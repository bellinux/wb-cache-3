40|$|It {{is known}} that early sensory {{deprivation}} modifies brain functional structure and connectivity. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the neuro-functional organization of reading in a patient with profound congenital unilateral deafness. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we compared cortical networks supporting the processing of written words in patient RA (completely deaf in the right ear since birth) and in a group of control volunteers. We found that congenital unilateral hearing deprivation modifies neural mechanisms of word reading. Indeed, while written word processing was left-lateralized in controls, we found a strong right lateralization of the fusiform and inferior occipital gyri activation in RA. This finding goes in the same direction of recent proposals that the ventral occipito-temporal activity in word reading seem to <b>lateralize</b> <b>to</b> the same hemisphere as the one involved in spoken language processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test, in single subjects, the hypothesis that the signs of voluntary movement- related neural activity would first appear in the prefrontal region, then move to both the medial frontal and posterior parietal regions, progress to the medial primary motor area, <b>lateralize</b> <b>to</b> the contralateral primary motor area and finally involve the cerebellum (where feedbackinitiated error signals are computed). Six subjects performed voluntary finger movements while DC coupled EEG was recorded from 64 scalp electrodes. Event-related potentials (ERPs) averaged on the movements were analysed both before and after independent component analysis (ICA) combined with dipole source analysis (DSA) of the independent components. Both a simple topographic analysis of undecomposed ERPs and the ICA/DSA analysis suggested that the original hypothesis was inadequate. The major departure from its predictions was that, while activity over many brain regions did appear at the expected times, it also appeared at unexpected times. Overall, the results suggest that the neuroscientific ‘standard model’, in which neural activity occurs sequentially in a series of discrete local areas each specialized for a particular function, may reflect the true situation less well than models in which large areas of brain shift simultaneously into and out of common activity states...|$|E
40|$|Amplitude modulations in {{the speech}} {{envelope}} are crucial elements for speech perception. These modulations comprise the processing rate at which syllabic (~ 3 - 7 Hz) and phonemic transitions occur in speech. Theories about speech perception hypothesize that each hemisphere in the auditory cortex is specialized in analyzing modulations at different timescales, and that phonemic-rate modulations of the speech envelope <b>lateralize</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere whereas right lateralization occurs for slow, syllabic-rate modulations. In the present study, neural processing of phonemic- and syllabic-rate modulations was investigated with auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs). ASSRs to speech-weighted noise stimuli, amplitude modulated at 4, 20 and 80 Hz were recorded in 30 normal-hearing adults. The 80 Hz ASSR is primarily generated by the brainstem, whereas 20 and 4 Hz ASSRs are mainly cortically evoked and relate to speech perception. Stimuli were presented diotically (same signal to both ears) and monaurally (one signal {{to the left or}} right ear). For 80 Hz, diotic ASSRs were larger than monaural responses. This binaural advantage decreased with decreasing modulation frequency. For 20 Hz, diotic ASSRs were equal to monaural responses while for 4 Hz diotic responses were smaller than monaural responses. Comparison of left and right ear stimulation demonstrated that with decreasing modulation rate a gradual change from ipsilateral to right lateralization occurred. Together these results (1) suggest that ASSR enhancement to binaural stimulation decreases in the ascending auditory system and (2) indicate that right lateralization is more prominent for low-frequency ASSRs. These findings may have important consequences for electrode placement in clinical settings, {{as well as for the}} understanding of low-frequency ASSR generation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe brain areas {{involved}} in visual word processing rapidly become <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left cerebral hemisphere.

An alternative hypothesis, however, might be that the early stages of visual word processing are <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere because of intrinsic hemispheric differences in processing low-level visual information as required for distinguishing fine-grained visual forms such as letters. If the alternative hypothesis was correct, we would expect posterior occipito-temporal processing stages still <b>to</b> be <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere for participants with right hemisphere dominance for the frontal lobe processes involved in language production. By analyzing event-related potentials of native readers of French with either left hemisphere or right hemisphere dominance for language production (determined using a verb generation task), we were able to show that the posterior occipito-temporal {{areas involved}} in visual word processing are <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the same hemisphere as language production.

40|$|To the Editor: We {{read with}} great {{interest}} the article by Hund-Georgiadis et al, 1 in which they presented a case report of a patient with crossed nonaphasia after left-hemispheric stroke. Functional MRI revealed “mirrored” brain organization not only for language but also for divided/selective attention, as assessed by the Stroop task. Both functions were <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the right hemisphere. The authors did not assess traditional right-hemispheric cognitive functions by means of functional MRI, such as visuospatial attention. 2 They mention in their case description, however, that “the patient complained of problems in the visuospatial domain. ” Neuropsychological testing revealed impaired processing of nonverbal material, whereas processing of verbal material was normal. Therefore, we suspect that visuospatial attention, which normally <b>lateralizes</b> <b>to</b> {{the right side of}} the brain, was <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere in this case, providing further support for the authors’ claim that their patient showed “completely reversed,” ie, “mirrored,” cognitive functions. The case by Hund-Georgiadis et al agrees with our findings from a cohort of healthy subjects who were assessed for hemispheric dominance of language and visuospatial attention by means of functional transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and functional magnetic resonance tomography. 3 We found that most subjects with atypical language lateralization indeed presented with a completely reversed brain organization, ie, visuospatial attention and language being lateralized into opposite hemispheres. Additionally, our study demonstrated that not only can completely reversed functional anatomy exist without obvious penalty to brain functions, but partially reversed functional anatomy can as well. Four of our 10 healthy subjects with right-hemispheric language dominance did not present with a “mirrored” brain organization. Rather, both language and visuospatial attention were <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the same hemisphere. Furthermore, cognitive functions can vary significantly in the extent <b>to</b> which they <b>lateralize.</b> Clinicians need <b>to</b> be aware of the possibility of combined linguistic and visuospatial impairments of variable degrees after left- or right-hemispheric damage...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Previous {{work has}} shown that {{individual}} differences in resting alpha asymmetry are associated with efficacy {{on a variety of}} cognitive tasks. Still unresolved is how ongoing alpha asymmetry relates to behavioral asymmetry, explored here using lateralized lexical decision. Methods: Alpha power immediately preceding lexical decision trials was measured to assess cognitive engagement during word recognition. This was compared with behavioral performance for the task, measured by accuracy and latency of the lexical decision response. Results: Greater relative left hemisphere alpha power (i. e. higher asymmetry) immediately before presentation of a word led to reduced likelihood for its successful identification. Greater alpha asymmetry was also associated with reduced performance for identifying stimuli <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the right visual field. Conclusions: Word recognition is facilitated by decreased asymmetry in cognitive engagement in the two cerebral hemispheres, particularly when the stimuli are <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere (right visual field). Significance: Results address the role of cognitive engagement in the two cerebral hemispheres, and its relationship with lexical access...|$|R

In Caucasian individuals, {{holistic}} {{processing and}} face recognition is <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the right hemisphere, whereas part-based processing and word recognition is <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere. Whether this hemispheric complementarity holds more generally is unclear. We compare the hemispheric basis of holistic processing of faces in Caucasian and Chinese observers (who, as readers of logographic script, {{may have different}} hemispheric organization). Participants made same/different judgements about the left/right halves of two sequentially presented composite faces (comprised of the left half of one face and the right half of another face) when the halves were aligned or were misaligned. There was a larger congruency effect for aligned than misaligned faces, reflecting significant holistic processing, and this was equivalent for face halves judged in {{the right and left}} visual fields and for Caucasian and Chinese observers. This same result was replicated in a second study with Caucasian observers, in which we presented the cue simultaneous with the study face, rather than simultaneous with the test face. These findings reflect equal participation of both hemispheres in holistic face perception and suggest that orthographic experience does not necessarily affect the hemispheric basis of holistic processing.

40|$|Previous {{findings}} indicate that the noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and cholinergic innervations of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulate memory consolidation. The current study investigated whether memory enhancement induced by post-training intra-BLA infusions of a β-adrenergic or muscarinic cholinergic agonist requires concurrent activation of dopamine (DA) receptors in the BLA. Rats with implanted BLA cannulae were trained on an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task and, 48 h later, tested for retention. Infusions of the β-adrenergic agonist clenbuterol into the right BLA, but not the left, enhanced retention, and concurrent infusions of the nonspecific DA receptor antagonist cis-Flupenthixol (Flu) blocked the enhancement. Post-training infusions of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine into the right BLA also enhanced retention, and concurrent infusions of Flu blocked this effect. Additional experiments investigated whether memory modulation was <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the right BLA. Post-training DA infusions into the right BLA, but not the left, enhanced retention. Post-training infusions of lidocaine or muscimol, which impair retention when infused bilaterally, had no effect when infused unilaterally into either the right or left BLA. These findings, together with earlier work, suggest that the dopaminergic system in the BLA is critically involved in memory modulation induced by noradrenergic and cholinergic influences.

Our purpose was to identify regional activation of the human cerebral cortex in response to pleasant (positive hedonic value) and unpleasant (negative hedonic value) odors. METHODS: Thirteen neurologically normal adults underwent functional MR imaging of frontal and anterior temporal brain regions with a gradient-echo echo-planar technique. Eleven candidate regions of interest (ROIs) were identified on {{the first half of}} the data set based on t-map comparisons of signal intensities during administration of clementine (pleasant odor), isovaleric acid (unpleasant odor), and clear air (control odor). These ROIs were applied to the second half of the data set, and the number of voxels activated with the odorants was compared with the number of voxels activated during clear air trials, using independent t-tests.

40|$|The left {{hemisphere}} specialization for speech perception might arise from asymmetries at more basic levels of auditory processing. In particular, {{it has been}} suggested that differences in "temporal" and "spectral" processing exist between the hemispheres. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to test this hypothesis further. Fourteen healthy volunteers listened to sequences of alternating pure tones that varied in the temporal and spectral domains. Increased temporal variation was associated with activation in Heschl's gyrus (HG) bilaterally, whereas increased spectral variation activated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) bilaterally and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). Responses to increased temporal variation were <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the {{left hemisphere}}; this left lateralization was greater in posteromedial HG, which is presumed to correspond to the primary auditory cortex. Responses to increased spectral variation were <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the right hemisphere specifically in the anterior STG and posterior STS.

40|$|Based on past {{theory and}} {{empirical}} {{results on the}} processing of lexical-level suprasegmental information, a Cascading Inhibition model for lexical stress parsing was proposed, in which lexical stress is situated at a different level from segmental information in a hierarchical structure and influences lexical identification via two mediating levels. These levels were proposed to direct lexical identification in a parallel and statistical manner. Because under this model, phonetic and lexical processing are both {{under the influence of}} lexical stress parsing, and because pre-attentive phonetic and lexical processing are both <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere, two hypotheses were proposed: Hypothesis A: Lexical stress parsing can modulate lexical selection without the presence of segmental information; Hypothesis B: Lexical stress parsing is <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the left hemisphere. To test these hypotheses, Noun-Verb homonym pairs (e. g. INsult vs inSULT) were used as targets in experimental listening conditions. Sentences that strongly predicted the Noun member (e. g. INsult) of the pair were spliced to end with the Verb member (e. g. inSULT) to create lexical stress anomalies. In the critical conditions, when targets were low-pass filtered to remove segmental information, listeners had to rely on the Lexical Stress Pattern for lexical identification of the target. For control conditions, the prosody changes associated with a shift in sex of the speaker (Gender Shift) were investigated in an auditory oddball paradigm. It was predicted that processing nonlinguistic prosody such as Gender Shift, in contrast to lexical stress, would be <b>lateralized</b> <b>to</b> the right hemisphere. Online EEG was recorded from right-handed young normal monolingual English speakers. For experimental conditions, the filtered Verb Lexical Stress Pattern induced larger N 400 than filtered Noun Lexical Stress Pattern, and this component was left-lateralized, supporting both hypotheses. Global Field Power and source estimation demonstrated that the neural networks for parsing Lexical Stress Pattern were similar to those for processing segmental information. In control conditions, the P 300 induced by Gender Shift was right lateralized. Overall, many features of the CI model were supported, but a direct influence from the prosody level to the lexical identification level is proposed to incorporate results from the current study. ...|$|R

Neuroimaging results and semiologic seizure characteristics {{of patients with}} midline spikes are not adequately described. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the neuroimaging findings and detailed seizure semiologies in patients with midline spikes. Methods: We reviewed the EEG database of the University of Michigan Medical Center and identified 35 patients with midline spikes. Information about seizure types and neuroimaging results was obtained from a review of medical records. The seizures were classified according to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) criteria and semiologic classification. Results: Twenty-nine (83 %) patients had a history of seizures. Complex partial seizures and simple partial seizures were the most common seizure types, experienced by 66 % of patients. The age at seizure onset was within the first 10 years in 90 % of patients.
