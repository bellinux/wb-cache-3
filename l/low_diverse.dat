Our studies on Malach spoken document collection and HARD collection have demonstrated that CombMNZ, the most widely used data fusion method, does not have such ability. We, therefore, developed two versions of signal boosting mechanisms on top of CombMNZ, which result in two new fusion methods called WCombMNZ and WCombMWW.

In this study, we present quantitative palaeoecological data, which are analysed {{in the context}} of their depositional environments. This integrated approach helps to discriminate between effects of the end-Permian mass extinction event and local environmental factors on alpha diversity and ecological structure of the Virgin Fauna. Shallow subtidal environments yield the highest species richness and lowest dominance values as recorded in two benthic associations, the Eumorphotis sp. A Association and the Protogusarella smithi Association, both of which contain 20 benthic species (bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, echinoderms, and porifers). Tidal inlet deposits yield a <b>low</b> <b>diverse</b> fauna (Piarorhynchella triassica Association) with a very high dominance of filter feeders adapted to high energy conditions. Another comparably <b>low</b> <b>diverse</b> fauna is recorded by the Bakevellia exporrecta Association, which is recorded in deposits of the offshore transition zone, most likely reflecting unconsolidated substrates. A single sample containing five bivalve species (Bakevellia costata Assemblage) is recorded from a marginal-marine setting. The Virgin fauna yields a bulk diversity of 30 benthic species (22 genera) of body fossils and 14 ichnogenera and, thus, represents the most diverse marine bottom fauna known so far from the Early Triassic. Our results suggest that oceanographic conditions during the early Spathian enabled ecosystems to rediversify without major abiotic limitations. However, taxonomical differentiation between habitats was still low, indicating a time lag between increasing within-habitat diversity (alpha diversity) and the onset of taxonomical differentiation between habitats (beta diversity). We suggest that taxonomical habitat differentiation after mass extinction events starts only when within-habitat competition exceeds a certain threshold, which was not yet reached in the Spathian of the investigated area. This interpretation is an alternative to previous suggestions that the prevalence of generalistic taxa in the aftermath of mass extinction events reflects protracted environmental stress. The onset of increasing beta diversity is a potential criterion for distinguishing two major recovery phases, the first ending with habitat saturation and the second ending with the completion of ecosystem differentiation...|$|E

Using those data, we were able to structure the individuals from our sample in three populations for O. barthii, related to geography, and two populations in O. glaberrima; these two last populations cannot be linked however to any currently phenotyped trait.

We found that presumably coolwater faunas from the Permian Gerster Limestone and the Park City Formation had low alpha- and betadiversities, comparable to those of <b>low</b> <b>diverse</b> faunas of the Early Triassic. In contrast, tropical Permian faunas had much higher alpha-diversities and a variable pattern of beta-diversity: Whereas faunas of spacelimited bioherms show a positive correlation between beta-diversity and gamma-diversity, beta-diversity in level-bottom faunas is elevated only when gamma-diversity is very high (> 250 species). This contrasting pattern probably reflects differential effects of interspecific competition on habitat partitioning. In lowcompetitive level-bottom faunas, species are able to coexist until competition forces species into their ecological optima, thereby increasing beta-diversity. This effect occurs at much lower gamma-diversities in more competitive reef-bound faunas, causing the observed positive correlation between beta- and gamma-diversity. We suggest that differences in the level of interspecific competition and hence diversity partitioning between Permian and Triassic benthic communities result from the higher average metabolic rates in the Mesozoic mollusc-dominated benthos in contrast to their Permian counterparts...|$|E

We hypothesized that water uptake from deeper soil depths increases in more diverse compared to <b>low</b> <b>diverse</b> plant species mixtures. We labeled soil water in 8 cm (with 18 O) and 28 cm depth (with ²H) three times during the 2011 growing season in 40 temperate grassland communities of varying species richness (2, 4, 8 and 16 species) and functional group number and composition (legumes, grasses, tall herbs, small herbs). Stable isotope analyses of xylem and soil water allowed identifying the preferential depth of water uptake. Higher enrichment in 18 O of xylem water than in ²H suggested that the main water uptake was in the upper soil layer. Furthermore, our results revealed no differences in root water uptake among communities with different species richness, different number of functional groups or with time. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of increased complementarity in water use in more diverse than in less diverse communities of temperate grassland species...|$|E

So far, none of the described taxa has been documented outside the Dinarides and the DLS, respectively.

The task was the identification of unusual uses for three common objects. The quantity criterion was the number of non-duplicate uses produced by each group.

The prediction that dyad groups would demonstrate the greatest creative performance was generally not supported. With respect to the number of ideas produced, dyad groups outperformed four-person groups. In the quality of creative performance there was no difference found between dyad and four person groups. For both quantity and quality measures, dyad and four-person groups were outperformed by individuals in nominal groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Invasions {{of natural}} {{communities}} by non-indigenous species are currently rated {{as one of}} the most important global-scale threats to biodiversity. Biodiversity itself is known to reduce invasions and increase stability. Disturbances by ecosystem engineers affect the distribution, establishment, and abundance of species but this has been ignored in studies on diversity-invasibility relationships. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined natural plant invasion into 46 plots varying in the number of plant species (1, 4, and 16) and plant functional groups (1, 2, 3, and 4) for three years beginning two years after the establishment of the Jena Experiment. We sampled subplots where earthworms were artificially added and others where earthworm abundance was reduced. We also performed a seed-dummy experiment to investigate the role of earthworms as secondary seed dispersers along a plant diversity gradient. Horizontal dispersal and burial of seed dummies were significantly reduced in subplots where earthworms were reduced in abundance. Seed dispersal by earthworms decreased with increasing plant species richness and presence of grasses but increased in presence of small herbs. These results suggest that dense vegetation inhibits the surface activity of earthworms. Further, there was a positive relationship between the number of earthworms and the number and diversity of invasive plants. Hence, earthworms decreased the stability of grassland communities against plant invasion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Invasibility decreased and stability increased with increasing plant diversity and, most remarkably, earthworms modulated the diversity-invasibility relationship. While the impacts of earthworms were unimportant in <b>low</b> <b>diverse</b> (low earthworm densities) and high diverse (high floral structural complexity) plant communities, earthworms decreased the stability of intermediate diverse plant communities against plant invasion. Overall, the results document that fundamental processes in plant communities like plant seed burial and invader establishment are modulated by soil fauna calling for closer cooperation between soil animal and plant ecologists...|$|E

This principle is exploited for in silico discovery of new drugs with the emergence of an activity prediction technology based on chemical structures. A variety of computational approaches for target or activity prediction were published over the past several years. For example, quantitative structure−activity relationship (QSAR) 2 − 5 was established on the hypothesis that compounds with similar physicochemical properties and/or structure share similar activities. The effectiveness of a QSAR analysis relies both on selecting the relevant descriptors for modeling the biological activity of interest and on the choice of a good quantitative model that maps the compound descriptors to chemical property or biological activity by means of statistical techniques. In similarity searching strategies, an unknown compound (the target) is compared to a set of compounds with known activities. The activity for which the compounds are the most similar to the target is assigned to it. Binary kernel discrimination (BKD), 6, 7 naı̈ ve Bayesian classifier (NBC), 8 − 1...|$|E

40|$|The Baltoscandia {{region was}} a wide {{platform}} covered by an epicontinetal sea on the Baltic Craton during Early to Middle Ordovician. In {{the same period}} the Baltica palaeoplate moved rapidly from high southern latitudes towards low southern latitudes. This northern directed movement crossed climate zones and the platform sedimentary succession changes from predominantly siliciclastic sedimentary rocks with minor carbonate in the late Cambrian to Early Ordovician to increasingly carbonate-rich rocks: first by cool, temperate shallow-water limestone (Orthoceras Limestone) and then by warmer temperate shallow-water carbonate and marl accumulation {{at the end of}} the Middle Ordovician (Darriwilian). True conodont faunal endemism within Baltica has not been observed. Instead Early and Middle Ordovician multielement conodonts from Baltoscandia record a series of faunal events comprising (1) conodont faunal phylogenetic developments, (2) migration events, (3) immigration events and (4) significant faunal turnovers. The late Cambrian and earliest Ordovician (early Tremadocian) record of the conodont faunas is incomplete for the Baltic Platform, because of pronounced global sea-level lowstand. The conodont phylogenic evolution starting from late Tremadocian (Early Ordovician) comprises the significant lineage of Paltodus, ‘Acodus’ (= Acodus deltatus sensu stricto), Trapezognathus and to Lenodus and from the top Floian the lineages of Baltoniodus and Microzoarkodina. Several migration events include genera in the Tremadocian and the significant Oepikodus evae acme in the Floian. The dispersal of the bi-membrate genus Eoplacognathus (sensu stricto) in the Darriwilian was a significant migration event from deeper-water setting at the margin of the craton and onto the platform. Visitors (i. e. Yangtzeplacognathus) immigrating from other palaeocontinents also reached the Baltica plate. These stayed only for a short period and disappeared equally fast as they appeared. However, the precise geographic source region for invaders and the palaeoceanographic conditions that facilitated dispersal into the Baltoscandia platform is still poorly understood. Biogeographic analysis indicates that in the Early Ordovician communication exclusively with Laurentia prevailed. This line of communication was disturbed at the beginning of the Middle Ordovician (Dapingian), where communication with Peri-Gondwana faunas also appeared on the Baltic platform. The Dariwillian invasions were multidirectional that involved taxa immigrating into the Baltoscandian region from both Laurentia and peri-Gondwana plates that approached continental margins of the Baltica palaeocontinent. The late Darriwilian–early Sandbian conodont faunas of Baltica show close similarities to faunas in the oceans, at margins of Laurentia, South China, and other adjacent tectonic plates and terranes, which indicate their semi-cosmopolitan distribution. The synchronicity of the geologic, climatic and oceanographic events supports the influence of geologic events on conodont evolution on Baltica.

40|$|The palaeo-landscape and {{environmental}} history {{during the last}} glacial-interglacial transition was studied in a broader regional context by comparing permafrost sequences from the northern and the southern coasts of the Dmitry Laptev Strait (East Siberian Sea) on Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island (73 ° 17 &# 8242;N, 141 ° 20 &# 8242;E) and on the Oyogos Yar coast (72 ° 36 'N, 143 ° 36 'E). Both coastal exposures show the same general stratigraphy pointing to similar landscape {{and environmental}} dynamics which were reconstructed using cryolithological, sedimentological and micro-palaeontological (i. e. pollen, freshwater ostracods) methods as well as stable isotope data from ice wedges. The late Glacial and Holocene permafrost records of both coastal sections are subdivided into three horizons that are of taberal (thawed and refrozen), lacustrine, and boggy origin. In both sections, the lowermost horizons consist of taberal deposits of the former late Pleistocene Ice Complex (dated between 46. 6 and 36. 6 14 C kyr BP) which are composed of sandy silt with peat lenses and thaw signs (whitish laminations). The ice content is generally low and the cryostructures are lens-like reticulated or layered, typical for refrozen sediments. The pollen data from the taberal horizons point to a Middle Weichselian interstadial vegetation. Ostracod shells are rare. The taberal horizon is discordantly covered by a lacustrine horizon of late Glacial age (dated between 14. 8 and 12. 5 14 C kyr BP). Its lowermost part is composed of cryoturbated peaty palaeosols in both sections. The overlying lacustrine facies is structured by alternating beds of clayish silts and plant detritus layers which contain numerous mollusc shells, ostracods, and wood fragments. The cryostructure is lens-like or lens-like layered and epigenetic roots of ice wedges are common within the lacustrine horizons. Pollen records are in good accordance with Allerød to Younger Dryas ages indicating a grass-sedge tundra dominated vegetation. The ostracod records point to stable aquatic conditions during the late Glacial where the high numbers and diverse assemblages were found. Thus, thermokarst development and lake formation started some time before the Holocene. The uppermost horizons accumulated under subaerial conditions in a boggy polygonal tundra environment from about 7. 5 to 4. 0 14 C kyr BP at the Bolshoy Lyakhovsky section and between about 10. 0 and 3. 3 14 C kyr BP at the Oyogos Yar section. However, the late Holocene deposits discordantly cover the underlying early Holocene sediments. Numerous peat inclusions or single peat layers were found in a sandy silt matrix with ice bands and a lens-like cryostructure between single bands which indicate syngenetic freezing of the sediments. Stable isotope signatures of ice wedges syngenetically formed in boggy deposits clearly differ from isotope composition of Weichselian ice wedges, pointing to warmer conditions during the Holocene. However, a notable variability and a clear warming trend occurred during the last millennium. An early Holocene shrubby tundra vegetation is reconstructed from the pollen spectra, whereas the late Holocene pollen spectra indicate a shift to modern wetland tundra vegetation. The early Holocene ostracod assemblages are sparse and <b>low</b> <b>diverse.</b> The multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental record of the last glacial- interglacial transition indicates a general pattern of regional landscape development according to climatic changes. Evidence of the three landscape development stages was obtained, including (1) thermokarst-induced formation of basins, (2) accumulation of lacustrine sequences, and (3) transformation of lake-dominated areas into polygonal tundra. The stages {{are considered to be}} of stratigraphical significance...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis deals with crinoids from the Middle Devonian (U. Eifelian to L. Givetian) of the Eifel Synclines (western Rhenish Massif, Germany) and secondary with U. Eifelian to U. Givetian crinoids {{of the eastern}} Rhenish Massif. The study focuses on new recovered material and on material deposit in historical collections. Since the classic monographs of the early 19 th century, crinoids are nearly unstudied in modern view. They are only periphery mentioned within the standard works �Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology� and �Fossil Crinoids�. The Eifel has to be characterised as the global hotspot of Middle Devonian crinoids. Because of the high diversity, selected groups {{of each of the}} four occurring Palaeozoic subclasses are studied {{in the course of this}} work: 1. The subfamily Cupressocrininae (subclass Cladida); 2. the family Hexacrinitidae (subclass Camerata); 3. the genus Stylocrinus (subclass Disparida); 4. the genus Ammonicrinus (subclass Flexibilia). Altogether, four families, eight genera and 66 species are described taxonomically. 10 new species are erected newly. Based on the excellent three-dimensional preservation of the partly autochthon conserved skeletons and their ecological-/facial response, the Eifel crinoids gave important information about the palaeodiversity, palaeobiology and palaeoecology: Regeneration processes in cupressocrinitids and hexacrinitids correspond with that features defined for recent echinoderms. Because of their important functions, the regeneration of injured arms is more perfect than those of affected cups. Hexacrinites contra balanced the general smallness of the regenerative arms by an increased pinnulated surface. Pre- and postmortem skeletal modifications are distinguishable based on the presence or absence of a stereomatic response. In cupressocrinitids, obviously genetically modified anomalies must be separated from external caused skeletal modifications. The function morphology of Ammonicrinus indicates that the nutriment flow of several species was obviously enabled by an active ligament pumping mechanism of the stem via slowly stiffening and relaxing of their mutable connective tissues under ionic balance. The arms of Stylocrinus shows internally inclined edges adjoining laterally with adjacent brachials in an interlocking network to stabilise the closed arm crown and may allow settling in hydrodynamic turbulent environments. The cups of Hexacrinites show sloping morphologies in turbulent environments. Hexacrinites and Ammonicrinus show phylogenetic trends that obviously evince a predator driven evolution (e. g. platyceratid gastropods). Biogenous caused skeletal modifications in hexacrinitid-cups can be attributed to platyceratid gastropods. Epizoan encrusting of bryozoans, microconchids, corals and poriferas mostly occurred postmortem, while the bryozoan genus Cyclopelta premortem encrusted the stems of cupressocrinitids. Stylocrinus-morphotypes are controlled by the ecological and facial framework. The stratigraphic distribution of several taxa, e. g. of Robustocrinites, was controlled by regional-geological events. This have bearing on the fluctuation of the palaeodiversity: Within the Rheno-Ardennic Massif it can be shown that the Middle Devonian crinoids of the Eifel Synclines are linked to carbonatic shelf environments and displaced the crinoid associations of the U. Pragian to L. Eifelian, e. g. of the Hünsrückschiefer, which are adapted to deeper water habitats and show more filigree skeletal morphologies. With the establishment of biostromal developments, this association dominates up to the L. Givetian with successive increasing of the diversity and individual numbers. Within the L. Givetian, this palaeodiversity collapse presumably because of successive increasing of the sea level (�Lower Givetian Crinoid Decline�), although, outside the Eifel, this association can be traced up to the U. Givetian of the Bergisches Land and the Lahn-Dill region. With beginning of the Frasnian, a crinoid association, which is dominated by camerates, sets in and can be recognised within the Rheno-Ardennic Massif up to the Frasnian/Famennian boundary. This Melocrinites-Megaradialocrinus association was abruptly replaced by an extremely <b>low</b> <b>diverse</b> amabilicrinitid-dominated fauna, which already has a �Carboniferous character�, and is the response of the Frasnian-Famennian Event (�Frasnian-Famennian Crinoid Decline�) ...|$|E
40|$|Videotext {{recognition}} is challenging due to <b>low</b> resolution, <b>diverse</b> fonts/styles, and cluttered background. Past methods enhanced recognition by using multiple frame averaging, image interpolation and lexicon correction, but recognition using multi-modality language models {{has not been}} explored. In this paper, we present a formal Bayesian framework for videotext recognition by combining multiple knowledge using mixture models, and describe a learning approach based on Expectation-Maximization (EM). In order to handle unseen words, a back-off smoothing approach derived from the Bayesian model is also presented. We exploited a prototype that fuses the model from closed caption and that from the British National Corpus. The model from closed caption {{is based on a}} unique time distance distribution model of videotext words and closed caption words. Our method achieves a significant performance gain, with word recognition rate of 76. 8 % and character recognition rate of 86. 7 %. The proposed methods also reduce false videotext detection significantly, with a false alarm rate of 8. 2 % without substantial loss of recall...|$|R
