5|$|The care of {{offspring}} among amphibians {{has been}} little studied but, in general, the larger the number of eggs in a batch, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> any degree of parental care takes place. Nevertheless, {{it is estimated that}} in up to 20% of amphibian species, one or both adults play some role in the care of the young. Those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young.|$|E
5|$|In Batesian mimicry, {{the mimic}} {{effectively}} copies the coloration of an aposematic animal, {{known as the}} model, to deceive predators into behaving {{as if it were}} distasteful. The success of this dishonest display depends on the level of toxicity of the model and the abundance of the model in the geographical area. The more toxic the model is, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the predator will avoid the mimic. The abundance of the model species is also important for the success of the mimic because of frequency dependent selection. When the model is abundant, mimics with imperfect model patterns or slightly different coloration from the model are still avoided by predators. This is because the predator has a strong incentive to avoid potentially lethal organisms, given the likelihood of encountering one. However, in areas where the model is scarce or locally extinct, mimics are driven to accurate aposematic coloration. This is because predators attack imperfect mimics more readily where there is little chance that they are the model species. Frequency dependent selection may also have driven Batesian mimics to become polymorphic in rare cases where a single genetic switch controls appearance, as in the swallowtail butterflies (the Papilionidae).|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, {{the rest of the}} pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E

50|$|Another {{problem with}} urine cooling <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would become thicker. The longer {{that it had}} to cool down the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{crystals}} in the it would bond together, causing it to thicken. This could lead to a false diagnosis, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> why doctors usually inspected the urine quickly.|$|R

25|$|The pond {{level is}} {{controlled}} by the height of the pipe in the dam. Since beavers depend on water for their survival, the more a beaver pond is lowered with a pipe, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the beavers will try to build a new dam to return the water to its previous high level. In addition, the more a beaver pond is lowered, the more valuable wetland acreage is lost. Therefore, it is important to lower a beaver pond only enough to resolve the threat to human health, safety, or property.|$|E
25|$|For {{a finite}} {{population}}, the population mean of a property {{is equal to}} the arithmetic mean of the given property while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height {{is equal to the}} sum of the heights of every individual divided {{by the total number of}} individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers dictates that the larger the size of the sample, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the sample mean will be close to the population mean.|$|E
25|$|The {{more time}} that has elapsed {{since the last}} civil war, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a {{conflict}} will recur. The study had two possible explanations for this: one opportunity-based and the other grievance-based. The elapsed time may represent the depreciation of whatever capital the rebellion was fought over and thus increase the opportunity cost of restarting the conflict. Alternatively, elapsed time may represent the gradual process of healing of old hatreds. The {{study found that the}} presence of a diaspora substantially reduced the positive effect of time, as the funding from diasporas offsets the depreciation of rebellion-specific capital.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inherent}} {{conflict in}} deciding {{the sizes of}} the plots. The larger the plot, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the settlers would make a success of it. But larger plots also served to delay the acquisition of plots for the remaining shareholders. The smaller the plot, the more shareholders could be settled. But smaller plots also meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> harder for the settlers to make a living.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{several studies}} have shown that asking a metacognitive {{question}} in different ways can produce different results. Koriat and Bjork (2005) showed <b>that</b> when people <b>were</b> asked to give their confidence ratings about how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they would remember an item, their subjective expected probability of recall was greater than when the experimenters reframed the question to enquire about how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they would forget the item. Presumably—while technically asking for the same information—the question about remembering evoked confirmatory evidence while the forgetting question provoked disconfirming evidence, producing different results. Finn (2015) showed that this difference in judgments had consequences. It played out in study choices, wherein people chose to study more in the latter than in the former case. Perhaps, if subjects in the present study had been asked how confident they <b>were</b> <b>that</b> their responses had been false rather than true, the results would have been different. People may have more knowledge about the truth of their answers, even prior to receiving feedback, than a single simple query about confidence taps.|$|R

25|$|In general, {{defining}} {{whether an}} individual is guilty of misconduct requires a detailed investigation by the individual's employing academic institution. Such investigations require detailed and rigorous processes and can be extremely costly. Furthermore, the more senior the individual under suspicion, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> conflicts of interest will compromise the investigation. In many countries (with the notable exception of the United States) acquisition of funds {{on the basis of}} fraudulent data is not a legal offence and there is consequently no regulator to oversee investigations into alleged research misconduct. Universities therefore have few incentives to investigate allegations in a robust manner, or act on the findings of such investigations if they vindicate the allegation.|$|E
25|$|As a result, widely varying principles, emphases, and {{definitions}} {{are used to}} determine local typologies among archaeologists working in the region. Attempts to identify and bridge the gaps made some headway at the Durham conference, though it was recognized that agreement on a single method of ceramic analysis or a single definition of a type may not be possible. The solution proposed by Dessel and Joffe is for all archaeologists {{in the field to}} provide more explicit descriptions of the objects that they study. The more information provided and shared between those in related sub-disciplines, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{they will be able to}} identify and understand the commonalities in the different typological systems.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a probability}} density function (PDF), or density of a continuous random variable, is a function, whose value {{at any given}} sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the random variable) {{can be interpreted as}} providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample. In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous random variable to take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the random variable, how much more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the random variable would equal one sample compared to the other sample.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{explored the}} contribution of framing effects on meta-memory judgments. In Experiment 1 participants studied word pairs. After each presentation they made an immediate judgment of learning (JOL) framed in terms of either remembering or forgetting. In the remember frame people made judgments about how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they would remember each pair on the upcoming test. In the forget frame people made judgments about how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they would forget each pair. Confidence differed {{as a result of}} the frame. Forget frame JOLs, equated to the remember frame JOL scale by a 1 -judgment conversion, were lower and demonstrated a smaller overconfidence bias than remember frame JOLs. When judgments were made at a delay rather than immediately, framing effects did not occur. In Experiment 2 people chose to restudy more items when choices were made within a forget frame. In Experiment 3 people studied Spanish-English vocabulary pairs ranging in difficulty. The framing effect replicated with judgments and choices. Moreover, forget frame participants included more easy and medium items to restudy. These results demonstrated the important consequences of framing effects on assessment and control of study...|$|R
25|$|The fuzzy logical {{theory of}} speech {{perception}} developed by Dominic Massaro proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember {{descriptions of the}} perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a fuzzy value corresponding to how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear {{is based on the}} relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the McGurk effect). Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.|$|E
25|$|Where the finder is an employee, {{most cases}} hold that the find should be {{awarded to the}} {{employer}} {{if it has a}} heightened legal obligation to take care of its customers' property, otherwise it should go to the employee. A find occurring in a bank is generally awarded to the bank as the owner is likely to have been a bank customer and the bank has a fiduciary duty to try to reunite lost property with their owners. For similar reasons, common carriers are preferred to passengers and hotels to guests (but only where finds occur in guest rooms, not common areas). The view has been taken that such a rule is suitable for recently misplaced objects as it provides the best chance for them to be reunited with their owners. However, it effectively delivers title of old artefacts to landowners, since the older an object is, the less <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the original depositor will return to claim it. The rule is therefore of little or no relevance to objects of archaeological value.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} evidence, {{according}} to Kahneman, is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of TomW., a fictional graduate student. One group of subjects had to rate Tom's similarity to a typical student {{in each of}} nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by probability, then they should resemble the base rates, i.e., the proportion of students {{in each of the}} nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom {{is more likely to be}} a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus {{we can say that}} the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E

The authors argue that, {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives. Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear.

The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science. The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians.

500|$|The most {{reliable}} {{test in the}} diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis {{is the level of}} creatine kinase (CK) in the blood. This enzyme is released by damaged muscle, and levels above 1000 U/L (5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)) indicate rhabdomyolysis. More than 5,000 U/L indicates severe disease but depending on the extent of the rhabdomyolysis, concentrations up to 100,000U/l are not unusual. CK concentrations rise steadily for 12hours after the original muscle injury, remain elevated for 1–3days and then fall gradually. Initial and peak CK levels have a linear relationship with the risk of acute kidney failure: the higher the CK, the more <b>likely</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> kidney damage will occur. There is no specific concentration of CK above which kidney impairment definitely occurs; concentrations below 20,000U/l are unlikely to be associated with a risk of kidney impairment, unless there are other contributing risk factors. Mild rises without kidney impairment are referred to as [...] "hyperCKemia". Myoglobin has a short half-life, and is therefore less useful as a diagnostic test in the later stages. Its detection in blood or urine is associated with a higher risk of kidney impairment. Despite this, use of urine myoglobin measurement is not supported by evidence as it lacks specificity and the research studying its utility is of poor quality.|$|E
