25|$|Two {{studies have}} been carried out to review the {{possibility}} of reviving train services. The first, in the 1990s, was to determine whether re-opening a portion of the line for passenger traffic from Bramley to Guildford would be economically viable. Although the study was inconclusive, Waverley Borough Council protected the line from further development in its <b>Local</b> <b>Plan.</b> In 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies applied for funding for a new line to Cranleigh.|$|E

To prevent future incursion, the path of the old railway line through Bourne End, Wooburn Green, Loudwater and the Wycombe Marsh area of Wycombe, is now listed in the <b>local</b> <b>plan,</b> as set aside as a footpath/cycle route or bus route.

Nevertheless, in 1998, Thanet District Council produced the Isle of Thanet <b>local</b> <b>plan,</b> which recognised the economic development potential of abandoned sections of the old military airfield, particularly on its north-western edge. After the plan was published, the Ministry of Defence announced its intention to sell RAF Manston, and following a ruling by Government instructing Government departments to generate money through the sale of surplus assets, the Ministry of Defence sold Manston.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore how}} Swedish <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authorities {{perceive}} standardized housing construction {{and attempt to}} use an ideal type typology of institutional logics to describe how <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authorities {{make use of the}} multiple institutional logics available to them. Increased standardization in Swedish housing construction has been suggested as a means to meet the growing need for housing with reasonable rent levels. However, housing contractors that use standardization and repetition of processes and components claim that the variation of requirements set by <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authorities prevents them from taking full advantage of their standardization. A recent empirical study of standardized housing contractors’ perceptions suggests that Local Requirement Setting, the requirement setting practices of <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authorities, are interpretational responses to a lack of familiarity with standardized housing construction. Yet, <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authorities’ perceptions of standardized housing construction have never previously been explored. Empirical material for this on-going study was collected through in-depth exploratory interviews with <b>local</b> <b>planning</b> officers from three municipalities situated in Swedish population growth regions. Findings suggest that <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authorities perceive potential benefits with standardization, but ultimately expect standardized housing concepts to adapt to local standards for processes and products. In projects with high ambitions for architectural quality standardized housing concepts need to be highly flexible. Conversely, highly standardized housing concepts benefit from project ambitions that favour reasonable rent levels. Therefore, Local Requirement Setting is indicative of a mismatch between the <b>Local</b> <b>Planning</b> Authority’s project ambitions and the standardized housing contractor’s degree of product standardization.

In February 1981 the Manchester Evening News reported that [...] "ten jacksharps , about two inches long" [...] had been spotted by a site manager working on the Mark Addy public house, which was then being built on the disused New Bailey Landing Stage, below New Bailey Street, {{on the border of}} Manchester and Salford. [...] Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. [...] In 1983 over 100canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could [...] "transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester". By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still [...] "a class 4 river– top of the pollution chart". [...] During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley <b>local</b> <b>plan</b> was launched, listing 187proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. [...] The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. [...] In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches {{on the side of the}} river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre [...] "mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford– the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000newjobs over the next 10years".

2500|$|In 1982, Southwark Council leased the Wood to London Wildlife Trust {{to manage}} as a nature reserve. In 1984 Southwark Council’s Mid/South Southwark <b>Local</b> <b>Plan</b> {{included}} proposals for blocks {{of up to}} 146 flats on the top part of the Wood. London Wildlife Trust's Southwark Wildlife Group ran a [...] "Save the Woods" [...] campaign backed by West Lewisham MP John Maples and other local MPs. Dulwich MP Gerald Bowden asked the Secretary of State for the Environment to intervene. A full-page Evening Standard article set the scene for a New Year public inquiry into the Plan. The January inquiry heard evidence from a dozen ecologists on the Wood's wildlife diversity, other witnesses describing the Wood’s educational and amenity value, visited the site and listened to views from several hundred {{members of the public}} at an evening meeting at Kingswood House. Southwark MP Simon Hughes spoke in favour of saving the wood in the House of Commons. Further, Dulwich College Estates applied for planning permission to build 36 flats on the site of Beechgrove House. In July, the <b>Local</b> <b>Plan</b> inspector reported that most of the Wood should be protected from development. The written report was published in the same week that Southwark Council’s planning committee rejected the Beechgrove application. In advance of a public inquiry into the Beechgrove plans held in November 1986, Gerald Bowden MP said: [...] "I’ve never had quite such a wide range of ordinary people writing to me on one subject. There is very broad opposition to the flats." [...] The inspector's decision against the plan was hailed as [...] "Wood reprieve a policy precedent." [...] "The need to preserve areas of existing natural woodland within the urban areas is of as much importance in preserving our heritage and improving the quality of the environment as that of preserving the countryside," [...] the inspector said.|$|E

[...] In Surrey, comparable buildings are the Chubb Tower and within 500m of border of Ewell, Surrey, the Tolworth Tower in Greater London.
