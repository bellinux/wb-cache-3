25|$|Motor oils have a {{slightly}} complicated relationship to machine tools. Straight-weight non-detergent motor oils are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils {{used to be the}} recommended spindle and way oils (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and <b>leadscrew</b> nuts (especially older or manual machine tools).|$|E

2500|$|Trapezoidal thread {{forms are}} screw thread {{profiles}} with trapezoidal outlines. They {{are the most}} common forms used for leadscrews (power screws). They offer high strength and ease of manufacture. They are typically found where large loads are required, as in a vise or the <b>leadscrew</b> of a lathe. Standardized variations include multiple-start threads, left-hand threads, and self-centering threads (which are less likely to bind under lateral forces).|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} trapezoidal thread form, {{and still}} probably {{the one most}} commonly encountered worldwide, is the Acme thread form ( [...] ). The Acme thread was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point threading or die than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires tool bit or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and it makes for smoother engagement of the half nuts on a lathe <b>leadscrew</b> than square does.|$|E

50|$|The {{buttress}} thread form, {{also known as}} the breech-lock thread form, refers to two different thread profiles. One is a type of <b>leadscrew</b> and the other is a type of hydraulic sealing thread form. The <b>leadscrew</b> type is often used in machinery and the sealing type is often used in oil fields.|$|E
2500|$|The {{square thread}} form {{is a common}} screw thread form, used in high load {{applications}} such as <b>leadscrews</b> and jackscrews. [...] It gets {{its name from the}} square cross-section of the thread. [...] It is the lowest friction and most efficient thread form, {{but it is difficult to}} fabricate.|$|R

50|$|Some lathes {{have only}} one <b>leadscrew</b> that serves all carriage-moving purposes. For screw cutting, a half nut is engaged {{to be driven by}} the leadscrew's thread; and for general power feed, a key engages with a keyway cut into the <b>leadscrew</b> to drive a pinion along a rack that is mounted along the lathe bed.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{area where}} {{backlash}} matters is in <b>leadscrews.</b> Again, {{as with the}} gear train example, the culprit is lost motion when reversing a mechanism {{that is supposed to}} transmit motion accurately. Instead of gear teeth, the context is screw threads. The linear sliding axes (machine slides) of machine tools are an example application.|$|R
50|$|Non-precision gear {{couplings}} use backlash {{to allow}} for slight angular misalignment. However, backlash is undesirable in precision positioning applications such as machine tool tables. It can be minimized by tighter design features such as ball screws instead of <b>leadscrews,</b> and by using preloaded bearings. A preloaded bearing uses a spring or other compressive force to maintain bearing surfaces in contact despite reversal of direction.|$|R
50|$|Gear {{teeth with}} slop (backlash) exhibit deadband. There is no {{drive from the}} input to the output shaft in either {{direction}} while the teeth are not meshed. <b>Leadscrews</b> generally also have backlash and hence a deadband, which {{must be taken into}} account when making position adjustments, especially with CNC systems. If mechanical backlash eliminators are not available, the control can compensate for backlash by adding the deadband value to the position vector whenever direction is reversed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ball screw}} {{is a more}} {{advanced}} type of <b>leadscrew</b> that uses a recirculating-ball nut to minimize friction and prolong {{the life of the}} screw threads. The thread profile of such screws is approximately semicircular (commonly a [...] "gothic arch" [...] profile) to properly mate with the bearing balls. The disadvantage to this type of screw {{is that it is not}} self-locking. Ball screws are prevalent in powered <b>leadscrew</b> actuators.|$|E
25|$|In general, certain thread-generating {{processes}} tend to fall along certain {{portions of}} the spectrum from toolroom-made parts to mass-produced parts, although there can be considerable overlap. For example, thread lapping following thread grinding would fall only on the extreme toolroom end of the spectrum, while thread rolling is a large and diverse area of practice that is used for everything from microlathe <b>leadscrews</b> (somewhat pricey and very precise) to the cheapest deck screws (very affordable and with precision to spare).|$|R
50|$|A {{ball screw}} is a {{mechanical}} linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little friction. A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for ball bearings which {{act as a}} precision screw. As well as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as the nut while the threaded shaft is the screw.In contrast to conventional <b>leadscrews,</b> ballscrews tend to be rather bulky, due {{to the need to}} have a mechanism to re-circulate the balls.|$|R
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and <b>leadscrews).</b> The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the labyrinth seal created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread seal tape or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope. Tapered thread joints typically do not include a gasket.|$|R

5000|$|Screw: <b>leadscrew,</b> screw jack, {{ball screw}} and roller screw {{actuators}} all {{operate on the}} principle of the simple machine known as the screw. By rotating the actuator's nut, the screw shaft moves in a line.|$|E

50|$|Early {{machine screws}} of metal, and early wood screws made of metal {{for use in}} wood, were made by hand, with files used to cut the threads. One method for making fairly {{accurate}} threads was to score a rod using an inclined knife with a wrap half way around the rod, the knife being precisely angled for the proper pitch. This {{was one of the}} methods Maudslay used to make his early <b>leadscrews.</b> This made the screw slow and expensive to make, and its quality highly dependent on the skill of the maker. A process for automating the manufacture of screws and improving the accuracy and consistency of the thread was needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} and dissemination throughout industry of NC, CNC, PLC, and other control technologies provided {{a new way}} to control the movement of the milling cutter: via feeding information from a program to actuators (servos, selsyns, <b>leadscrews,</b> machine slides, spindles, and so on) that would move the cutter as the information directed. Today most commercial machining is done via such programmable, computerized methods. Home machinists are likely to work via manual control, but computerized control has reached the home-shop level as well (it's just not yet as pervasive as its commercial counterparts). Thus pantograph milling machines are largely a thing of the past. They are still in commercial use, but at a greatly reduced and ever-dwindling level. They are no longer built new by machine tool builders, but a small market for used machines still exists. As for the magnification-and-reduction feature of a pantograph (with the scale determined by the adjustable arm lengths), it is achieved in CNC via mathematic calculations that the computer applies to the program information practically instantaneously. Scaling functions (as well as mirroring functions) are built into languages such as G-code.|$|R
50|$|Several {{innovations}} {{in the development}} of the jig borer were the work of the Moore Special Tool Company. In particular, the adoption of hardened and accurate leadscrews, formed by grinding, rather than a soft <b>leadscrew</b> with a compensating nut.|$|E
