40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a {{pathogenic}} Gram-negative bacterium {{that causes}} severe opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals; in particular, severity of infection with P. aeruginosa positively correlates with poor prognosis in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Establishment of chronic infection by this pathogen {{is associated with}} downregulation of flagellar expression and of other genes that regulate P. aeruginosa motility. The current paradigm is that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> flagellar expression enables immune evasion by the bacteria due to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> by phagocytic receptors that recognize flagellar components and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> immune activation through flagellin-mediated Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. In this work, we employ bacterial and mammalian genetic approaches to demonstrate that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> motility, not the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the flagellum per se, is the critical factor {{in the development of}} resistance to phagocytosis by P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that isogenic P. aeruginosa mutants deficient in flagellar function, but retaining an intact flagellum, are highly resistant to phagocytosis by both murine and human phagocytic cells at levels comparable to those of flagellum-deficient mutants. Furthermore, we show that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> MyD 88 signaling in murine phagocytes does not recapitulate the phagocytic deficit observed for either flagellum-deficient or motility-deficient P. aeruginosa mutants. Our data demonstrate that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> bacterial motility confers a dramatic resistance to phagocytosis that is independent of both flagellar expression and TLR signaling. These findings provide an explanation for the well-documented observation of nonmotility in clinical P. aeruginosa isolates and for how this phenotype confers upon the bacteria an advantage in the context of immune evasion...|$|R

Many students experience a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> {{and do not}} make a smooth transition into second year {{as a result of}} stress from academic pressure and personal development issues (Gump, 2007). Much effort is put into welcoming students to their first year of University but little has been previously done in Australia to assist the transition into second year (Hunter, Tobolowsky, Gardner, Evenbeck, Pattengale, Schaller & Schriner, 2010). Second year students are not necessary second year at University students but may include students articulating from MIBT or TAFE. These students need to form and build networks with students at the same level, not with “first year students”. We identified a “slump ” in the grades of second year students completing science courses at Deakin University with the greatest decline occurring between 1 st and 2 nd trimester. Since 2009 we have run a “Welcome to Second Year ” program during orientation week for students entering second year of their science course.

40|$|What is {{commonly}} known as the ‘sophomore slump’ or ‘second year blues’ can be attributed to several stress related factors: fears surrounding increased levels of independent learning and self-directed study, social group cohesion with peers, personal development issues with pressures to cope with new life challenges, such as housing and finance issues (Schreiner, 2010). Evidence suggests that due to the amalgamation of these factors, students often experience a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement,</b> struggle to manage a smooth transition into year two and, consequently, to get the best out of their intermediate level of undergraduate study (Grump, 2007). At the University of Huddersfield, we have found that fewer students access academic skills provision in their second year and that this pattern is mirrored in taught academic skills session delivery, with sessions being ‘front-loaded’ at foundation level. Our role as facilitators for the learning journey of a student requires that we engage with the progression levels of a degree programme holistically, but, are we successfully identifying and implementing relevant ‘progression points’ for each level?

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the manager as coach (MAC) role as an {{organisational}} development strategy, in particular, aspects of the relationship between manager and employee that make it successful. The purpose of the MAC in the business context is to help employees consider how they might work and behave differently with more effective behaviours that produce better outcomes, without a reliance on the formal authority the manager possesses. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative case study approach was adopted in which individuals shared their experiences as MAC and/or as an employee receiving coaching from a manager in an asynchronous online discussion forum. These discussions were then qualitatively analysed. Findings – The findings illustrate the complexity of the MAC role and why many managers fail in this role, leading to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and motivation <b>of</b> staff. Similarly, factors, which strengthen the relationship between the MAC and employee, such as trust, shared values, and benevolence lead to success in this organisational relationship. Practical implications – Managers need to understand how to operate as a MAC to elevate organisational performance. Similarly, organisational developers need to understand what is required in training programs to develop managers into coaches if they are to employ this strategy successfully. Originality/value – This practitioner oriented paper builds upon a case study, which explores the MAC role and integrates the findings with contemporary knowledge on performance management and coaching...|$|R

40|$|A <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> on {{the part}} of {{teachers}} can lead to decreased learning opportunities for students, high turnover costs for schools, and personal and professional issues for teachers. Transformative professional development (TPD) programs that focus on the person who teaches, rather than content or technique, have been shown anecdotally to offer a valuable source of support for teachers. As little empirical evidence exists, this quasi-experimental study attempts to fill that gap by estimating the effect that participation in Courage to Teach (CTT), a TPD program, has on subsequent engagement with teaching. The subjects of this study are samples of alumni from CTT and the National Writing Project (NWP), a professional development program used as a control group. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to measure engagement with teaching, and survey data were also collected on issues related to retention, perceived benefits of participation, and demographics. Propensity score matching techniques were then used to match the PK- 12 teachers from the two programs as closely as possible on a set of potentially confounding variables. On average, the CTT respondents reported higher levels of professional efficacy (indicating greater engagement), and higher levels of emotional exhaustion and cynicism (indicating lesser engagement) than the NWP respondents. The CTT respondents were also compared to the normative sample of the MBI and other contemporary studies, and consistently showed higher engagement on all three subscales.

40|$|Objective: Two studies tested multivariate {{models of}} {{relationships}} between subjective task engagement and vigilance. The second study included a stress factor (cold infection). Modeling tested relationships between latent factors for task engagement and vigilance, and the role <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> in mediating effects of cold infection. Background: Raja Parasuraman’s research on vigilance identified several key issues, including the roles of task factors, arousal processes, and individual differences, {{within the framework of}} resource theory. Task engagement is positively correlated with performance on various attentional tasks and may serve as a marker for resource availability. Method: In the first study, 229 participants performed simultaneous and successive vigilance tasks. In the second study, 204 participants performed a vigilance task and a variable-foreperiod simple reaction-time task on two separate days. On the second day, 96 participants performed while infected with a naturally occurring common cold. Task engagement was assessed in both studies. Results: In both studies, vigilance decrement in hit rate was observed, and task performance led to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> task <b>engagement.</b> Cold infection also depressed both vigilance and engagement. Fitting structural equation models indicated that simultaneous and successive tasks should be represented by separate latent factors (Study 1), and task engagement fully mediated the impact of cold infection on vigilance but not reaction time (Study 2). Conclusions: Modeling individual differences in task engagement elucidates the role of resources in vigilance and underscores the relevance of Parasuraman’s vision of the field...|$|R
40|$|Changes {{related to}} {{globalization}} {{have resulted in}} the growing separation of individuals in late modern societies from traditional bases of social solidarity such as parties, churches, and other mass organizations. One sign of this growing individualization is the organization of individual action in terms of meanings assigned to lifestyle elements resulting in the personalization of issues such as climate change, labour standards, and the quality of food supplies. Such developments bring individuals' own narratives to the fore in the mobilization process, often requiring organizations to be more flexible in their definitions of issues. This personalization of political action presents organizations with a set of fundamental challenges involving potential trade-offs between flexibility and effectiveness. This paper analyses how different protest networks used digital media to engage individuals in mobilizations targeting the 2009 G 20 London Summit during the global financial crisis. The authors examine how these different communication processes affected the political capacity of the respective organizations and networked coalitions. In particular, the authors explore whether the coalition offering looser affiliation options for individuals displays any notable <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> public <b>engagement,</b> policy focus (including mass media impact), or solidarity network coherence.

40|$|Intensified {{training}} {{regimes and}} increasing competitive pressure make some athletes leave sports with shattered hopes and dreams. A {{number of these}} athletes drop out of sports due to burnout, which is characterized by an enduring experience of emotional and physical exhaustion, reduced sense of accomplishment and devaluation of sport participation {{as a consequence of}} prolonged chronic stress. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and diminished motivation also characterize burnout. But burnout {{is more than just a}} simple stress reaction, as not all athletes who experience stress burn out. Study I investigates the prevalence of burnout among competitive athletes. The number of athletes showing high levels of burnout was found to be between 1 and 9 %. The number of athletes suffering from severe burnout was estimated at 1 - 2 %. Contrary to what has been speculated, burnout was not more common in individual sports than in team sports. Study II investigated the burnout process using a case-study approach. It was found that burnout can evolve with different levels of severity, time perspectives and characteristics. There appears to be a relationship between overtraining syndrome and burnout, and the study gave support to the notion that burnout is the most severe outcome on the training fatigue continuum. Early success might lead to high expectations and an inner pressure to train, which in the three cases made the athletes ignore signs of maladaptation. Performance-based self-esteem appears to be a “driving force” in the burnout process. In Study III the burnout experience was investigated using qualitative interviews. Lack of recovery, “too much sports” and high external demands were described as causes of burnout. A stressful situation with multiple demands from sport, school and social relationships leads to a total overload, which has both physiological and psychological consequences. Critical factors were a unidimensional identity, performance-based self-esteem, an inflexible organization and feelings of entrapment. These restraining factors made the athletes remain in sports despite negative outcomes. Thus the three studies indicate that burnout is a serious problem in competitive and elite sports, that restraining factors offer an explanation for why athletes remain in sport despite negative outcomes, and that striving for self-esteem is crucial in the development of burnout...|$|R
40|$|Distinguishing between {{depression}} and anxiety has {{been a matter of}} concern and controversy for some time. Studies in normal samples have suggested, however, that assessment of two broad mood factors—Negative Aflect (NA) and Positive Affect (PA) —may improve their differentiation. The present study extends these findings to a clinical sample. As part of an ongoing twin study, 90 inpa-tient probands and 60 cotwins were interviewed with the anxiety and depression sections of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, Helzer, Croughan, & Ratcliff, 1981). Respondents also completed trait NA and PA scales. Consistent with previous research, NA was broadly correlated with symptoms and diagnoses of both anxiety and depression, and acted as a general predictor of psychiatric disorder. In contrast, PA was consistently related (negatively) only to symptoms and diagnoses of depression, indicating that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> pleasurable <b>engagement</b> is a distinctive feature of depression. The results suggest that strengthening the PA component in depression measures may enhance their discriminative power.

All of {{the participants in this study}} were two or more years below grade-level according to their English Language Arts performance on their ih grade California Standards Tests, and 48 ofthese participants were further categorized as English Language Learners. Throughout the course of a two-week unit of study in American History, the 63 students were monitored through the use of pre and post tests, reflective journals, informal interviews, and class-work to determine the influences a multicultural curriculum would have on their behavior, academic performance, and attitudes. It was discovered that students were not only more engaged with the curriculum after the implementation of the multicultural unit, but they were more academically successful and well-behaved as well.

40|$|The term 'addiction' was {{traditionally}} used {{in relation}} to centrally active substances, such as cocaine, alcohol, or nicotine. Addiction is not a unitary construct but rather incorporates a number of features, such as repetitive engagement in behaviours that are rewarding (at least initially), <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> control (spiralling <b>engagement</b> over time), persistence despite untoward functional consequences, and physical dependence (evidenced by withdrawal symptoms when intake of the substance diminishes). It {{has been suggested that}} certain psychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive, repetitive behaviours share parallels with substance addiction and therefore represent 'behavioural addictions'. This perspective has influenced the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5), which now has a category 'Substance Related and Addictive Disorders', including gambling disorder. Could other disorders characterised by repetitive behaviours, besides gambling disorder, also be considered `addictions'?

50|$|The term Circular Connector {{applies to}} any {{electrical}} connector possessing multipin interconnects with cylindrical contact housings and circular contact interface geometries. Circular connectors are selected for ease <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> and disengagement, {{their ability to}} conveniently house different types of contacts, their wide range of allowable contact voltages and currents, their ease of environmental sealing and their rugged mechanical performance. In military, aerospace, and other high-reliability applications, the MIL-DTL-5015 and MIL-DTL-38999 {{are among the most}} commonly specified types. The primary disadvantage of the circular design is <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> panel space when used in arrays when compared to rectangular connectors.|$|R

As part of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the People's Republic of China's People's Volunteer Army made repeated attacks against the Republic of Korea 1st Infantry Division near Unsan beginning on 25 October, in an attempt to take advancing United Nations forces by surprise. In an accidental first encounter with the United States military during the Korean War, the Chinese 39th Corps attacked the unprepared US 8th Cavalry Regiment in Unsan on 1 November, resulting {{in one of the most}} devastating US <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the Korean War.|$|R

40|$|We applaud Rus and Cameron {{for their}} {{pioneering}} work describing predictors <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> in online patient communities. Their piece advances our understanding <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> in online patient communities and underscores {{the need for}} a science <b>of</b> <b>engagement</b> that informs the development of social media delivered interventions. Interdisciplinary teams of behavioral scientists, social media marketing experts, and data scientists are uniquely positioned to lead this science...|$|R
