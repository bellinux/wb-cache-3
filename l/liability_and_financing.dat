40|$|Leasing is an {{important}} additional financing technique used by many companies, enabling them to use property, plant and equipment without making large initial cash outlays. It also provides flexibility, allowing entities to address obsolescence risks. Under current accounting rules, when referring to the operating leasing in particular, {{there is a lack}} of comparability between the financial position and operating results of companies that buy assets and the financial position and operating results of those that lease similar assets. This has led critics to assert that the current accounting does not portray the economics of lease arrangements. In response to this criticism, the IASB and FASB have developed a new approach to lease accounting that would require a lessee to recognise assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> for the rights and obligations created by leases, this providing greater transparency and comparability for financial statements users. On the other hand, the proposals will affect almost every company and the impact of the proposed changes may be significant, as recognising additional assets <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>finance</b> expense will affect key performance ratios and, consequently, the ability to satisfy debt covenants. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two independent essays on banking, corporate capital structure, and the real economy, with evidence from China and the United States. The first essay examines how relationship bank health affects a firm’s debt choices. After identifying firms’ own relationship banks, we apply logistic regression on rated firms in the US between 1998 and 2013. We find that, when the leverage of a firm’s relationship bank decreases, the firm {{will be more likely}} to issue public bonds. The leverage of the whole banking sector has a similar impact, which is 1. 35 times that of a firm’s relationship bank’s leverage. As for contract design changes, average loan size slightly decreased, while average bond size significantly increased; the maturity of both loans and bonds significantly shortened; the cost of loans and bonds rocketed to a very high level during the crisis period. Overall, this essay provides evidence of the supply-side effect of corporate debt structure and shows that bank health and leverage have an effect on firms’ choices between bank loans and public bonds. This essay adds to the literature by putting forward a new credit supply-side effect, to understand how firms’ debt structure varies, a matter which has been much explored with regard to demand-side effect. Apart from that, we use a more general and direct measure to capture bank health and its lending behaviour through the effect of leverage. The second essay examines the cyclicality of equity <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>financing</b> of listed firms in China. First we find that simple correlation does not give us robust cyclicality results. We argue that this is largely due to small observations in calculating simple correlations. Next, we perform panel regressions controlling firm characteristics and year and firm fixed effects. We find that equity financing is pro-cyclical for all firm groups, while liabilities financing is pro-cyclical for only mid-large firm groups. To finance asset increment during economic recovery, small firms rely more on equity financing, while large firms rely more on liabilities financing. Lastly, we examine the cyclicality of corporate leverage using the same framework. We find that only some large firms’ leverages move counter-cyclically with the real economy. The similar cyclicality of equity <b>finance</b> <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>finance</b> cancels each other such that the cyclicality of corporate leverage is affected and differs across different firms. Overall, this essay shows that economic conditions affect equity <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>financing</b> of Chinese listed firms. Most firms have similar pro-cyclicality of equity <b>and</b> debt <b>financing.</b> Compared with firms in the US, firms in China rely more on equity markets but less on liabilities markets during economic upturn, especially for small firms. This essay adds to the literature by applying standard methodologies to listed firms in China, to make comparisons with US firms. More importantly, this essay shows that the discrepancy in the results of corporate leverage cyclicality in Chinese literature is understandable and is partly due to the similar cyclicality pattern of equity <b>and</b> <b>liabilities</b> <b>finance.</b> published_or_final_versionEconomics <b>and</b> FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The demand uncertainty makes some mergers {{that would be}} unprofitable in a certain environment profitable in this model. However, socially advantageous mergers may be still unprofitable for the colluding firms, so public intervention may be needed. One possibility consists in subsidizing such mergers. However, the combination of limited <b>liability</b> debt <b>financing</b> <b>and</b> an appropriate antitrust policy leads to higher social welfare than subsidies. The reason is that, given the limited liability effect, merging parties compete more aggressively, so the reduction in market quantity is mitigated.

40|$|Using {{data for}} {{a sample of}} listed Finnish firms for 1995 - 97 this paper {{examines}} the coincidence of reported cash flows with corresponding cash flows estimated from income statement and balance sheet data. The issue is important in light of prior empirical studies that have analysed the properties and usefulness of cash flow information derived from income statements and balance sheets. In addition, financial analyses of firms not disclosing cash flow statements are implicitly {{based on the assumption}} that income statements and balance sheets are useful in producing unbiased and efficient estimates of cash flows. The overall findings indicate that reported cash flows do not always articulate with income statements and balance sheets and that non-articulation can be observed in cash flows from operating, investing <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> activities. The differences between reported and estimated cash flows prove to be mostly random. The findings on cash flows from operating activities indicate that differences attributable to operating income and working capital are partially countervailing. The findings also suggest that the differences do not materially affect firms' relative rankings based on financial ratios. A detailed analysis of an individual company indicates that differences arising from the allocation of short-term <b>liabilities</b> to operating <b>and</b> <b>financing</b> activities can be important. Overall, the results call for the refinement of the standards and guidelines of cash flow reporting practices. ...|$|R
