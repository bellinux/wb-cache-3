5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 12.4, WASP-43 cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided eye. The star is located approximately 80 parsecs (260 <b>light</b> <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It {{spent much of}} its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away,</b> with a magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years away, with a magnitude of 3.87. It is approximately 63 times as luminous the Sun, with a surface temperature of 5279 K. Delta Apodis is a double star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible through binoculars. Delta1 is a red giant star of spectral type M4III located 760 ± 30 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away.</b> It is a semiregular variable that varies from magnitude +4.66 to +4.87, with pulsations of multiple periods of 68.0, 94.9 and 101.7 days.

5|$|Lying {{within the}} bounds of the {{constellation}} is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away,</b> {{making it one of the}} most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away,</b> it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E
50|$|Another {{question}} is what percentage of civilizations in the galaxy are close {{enough for us to}} detect, assuming that they send out signals. For example, existing Earth radio telescopes could only detect Earth radio transmissions from roughly a <b>light</b> <b>year</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
50|$|As of 2008, it was {{the largest}} known galaxy cluster at red shift z ≧ 1, {{weighing}} in at an estimated 1015 solar masses. However, galaxy cluster XMMXCS 2215-1738 is several billion <b>light</b> <b>years</b> farther <b>away.</b>|$|R

5|$|GJ 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 <b>light</b> <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> from the Earth, it cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided eye. The star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies {{at a distance of}} 14.7 parsecs (47.95 light years).|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40 {{hosts the}} sixth {{planetary}} {{system to be}} discovered in the orbit of a star with a mass of over 1.8 solar masses. It lies 2700 parsecs (8806.4 <b>light</b> <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> from Earth, making it more distant than any previously verified planet discovered by Kepler, and has an apparent magnitude of 14.58. Thus, it is invisible to the unaided eye.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40 lies 2700 parsecs (8,806.4 <b>light</b> <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> from Earth, {{further than}} any star (with a known distance) with an {{exoplanet}} previously discovered by Kepler.

50|$|Meanwhile Captain Janeway and {{her crew}} have entered a transwarp {{corridor}} and fire torpedoes at the unprotected manifolds while traveling {{back to the}} Alpha Quadrant, but are pursued by a Borg sphere that has managed to withstand the pathogen's effects and assimilate Admiral Janeway's adaptive armor upgrade. It is now following the Borg Queen's final orders to destroy Voyager so that the Admiral (and her sabotage) will never exist. Unable to fight back against the ship's exterior defenses, Janeway takes her ship inside the sphere, where, upon its arrival one <b>light</b> <b>year</b> <b>away</b> from Earth's solar system, she detonates a torpedo that destroys the sphere from the inside.|$|R
50|$|NGC 2158 is an {{open cluster}} in the {{constellation}} of Gemini. It is located southwest of open cluster Messier 35, and {{is believed to be}} about 2 billion years old. The two clusters are unrelated, as NGC 2158 is around 9,000 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> further <b>away</b> than M35.|$|R
50|$|HD 203842 is a F-type {{star in the}} {{constellation}} of Equuleus. Based on its parallax, it is located about 340 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (105 parsecs) <b>away.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the more}} {{prominent}} double stars include Gamma Coronae Australis—a pair of yellowish white stars 58 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> from Earth, which orbit each other every 122 years. Widening since 1990, the two stars {{can be seen as}} separate with a 100mm aperture telescope; they are separated by 1.3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees. They have a combined visual magnitude of 4.2; each component is an F8V dwarf star with a magnitude of 5.01. Epsilon Coronae Australis is an eclipsing binary belonging to a class of stars known as W Ursae Majoris variables. These star systems are known as contact binaries as the component stars are so close together they touch. Varying by a quarter of a magnitude around an average apparent magnitude of 4.83 every seven hours, the star system lies 98 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away.</b> Its spectral type is F4VFe-0.8+. At {{the southern end of the}} crown asterism are the stars Eta¹ and Eta² Coronae Australis, which form an optical double. Of magnitude 5.1 and 5.5, they are separable with the naked eye and are both white. Kappa Coronae Australis is an easily resolved optical double—the components are of apparent magnitudes 6.3 and 5.7 and are 1700 and 490 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> respectively. They appear at an angle of 359 degrees, separated by 21.6 arcseconds. Kappa² is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white, with a spectral type of B9V, while Kappa¹ is of spectral type A0III. Lying 202 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away,</b> Lambda Coronae Australis is a double splittable in small telescopes. The primary is a white star of spectral type A2Vn and magnitude of 5.1, while the companion star has a magnitude of 9.7.

5|$|WISE J003231.09-494651.4 and WISE J001505.87-461517.6 are two {{brown dwarfs}} {{discovered}} by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, and are 63 and 49 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> respectively. Initially hypothesised before they were belatedly discovered, brown dwarfs are objects more massive than planets, but which are of insufficient mass for hydrogen fusion characteristic of stars to occur. Many are being found by sky surveys.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.43, Beta Pavonis is the second-brightest {{star in the}} constellation. A white giant of spectral class A7III, it is an aging star that has used up the hydrogen fuel at its core and has expanded and cooled after moving off the main sequence. It lies 135 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> from the Solar System.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Bringloidi" [...] colony (after , the Irish {{word for}} [...] "dreams"), now {{led by an}} Irishman named Danilo O'Dell, are {{followers}} of an early 22nd century philosopher who advocated returning to a pre-industrial agrarian lifestyle, and when taken aboard the Enterprise, must quickly adapt to the 24th century technology. When {{the transfer of the}} colonists is complete, O'Dell informs Picard of another colony, also planted by the Mariposa. The Enterprise proceeds to the second colony—which has named itself [...] "Mariposa" [...] after their ship—half a <b>light</b> <b>year</b> <b>away.</b> The colony's Prime Minister, Walter Granger, is happy to see the Enterprise and welcomes them to visit, so Commander Riker beams down with Lieutenant Worf and Chief Medical Officer Doctor Pulaski.|$|R
5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812. A star-forming region of around , it contains Herbig–Haro objects (protostars) and some very young stars. About 430 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (130 parsecs) <b>away,</b> {{it is one of the}} closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865. The Coronet cluster, about 554 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (170 parsecs) <b>away</b> at the edge of the Gould Belt, is also used in studying star and protoplanetary disk formation.|$|R
50|$|Zeta Phoenicis (ζ Phe, ζ Phoenicis) is a B-type main {{sequence}} {{star in the}} constellation Phoenix. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye. Based upon parallax measurements made by the Hipparcos spacecraft, it is located some 300 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> (92 parsecs) <b>away.</b>|$|R

Its {{discovery}} was reported in June 2011, although it was suspected to be a planet as early as 2004. The planet is about three-fourths the mass of Jupiter, but is almost eighty percent larger than Jupiter is; this inflation has, as {{with the discovery of}} similar planets WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b, raised the question of what (other than temperature) causes these planets to become so large.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 {{is located}} 65.8 parsecs (214.6 <b>light</b> <b>years)</b> <b>away</b> from Earth. It has an {{apparent}} magnitude (V) of 8.22, making the star too dim {{to see from}} Earth with the naked eye. The star is slightly dimmer than planet Neptune as perceived with the naked eye, which has an apparent magnitude of 7.78 at its brightest. The star's actual brightness is measured with an absolute magnitude of 4.12, {{similar to that of}} the Sun.|$|E

5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not {{visible to the naked}} eye, and lies approximately 330 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet at least three times the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away,</b> could {{have no effect on}} Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away,</b> and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new {{window on the}} early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery {{of some of the}} most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E
50|$|Gliese 3685 {{is a star}} in the {{constellation}} of Leo. It is extremely faint; its apparent magnitude is 13.3, and can only be seen with a ten-inch (25 cm) telescope (see Limiting magnitude).

5|$|Although fainter {{than its}} {{northern}} counterpart, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis {{are the two}} brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System—a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away.</b> Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387L is a {{red dwarf}} in the Sagittarius {{constellation}} that is host to the planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb. The star {{is estimated to be}} nearly 20,000 <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> and approximately one fifth the mass of the Sun, although large confidence intervals exist, reflecting the uncertainties in both the mass and distance. The star drew the attention of astronomers when it became the lens of gravitational microlensing event MOA-2009-BLG-387L, in which it eclipsed a background star and created distorted caustics, an envelope of reflected or refracted light rays. Analysis of the caustic events and of follow-up observational data led to the planet's discovery, which was reported in February 2011.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion <b>light</b> <b>years</b> <b>away</b> even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E
