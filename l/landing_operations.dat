5|$|The Normandy {{landings}} (codenamed Operation Neptune) {{were the}} <b>landing</b> <b>operations</b> on Tuesday, 6 June 1944 (termed D-Day) of the Allied invasion of Normandy in Operation Overlord during World War II. The largest seaborne invasion in history, the operation began {{the liberation of}} German-occupied northwestern Europe from Nazi control, {{and contributed to the}} Allied victory on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's {{drooping}} nose, {{developed by}} Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b> Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} torpedo planes attacked Enterprise, South Dakota, and cruiser , but all {{of their}} torpedoes missed or failed, causing no damage. The engagement was over at 10:53; nine of the 16 torpedo aircraft were lost in this attack. After suppressing most of the onboard fires, at 11:15 Enterprise reopened her flight deck to begin landing returning aircraft from the morning U.S. strikes on the Japanese warship forces. However, only a few aircraft landed before {{the next wave of}} Japanese strike aircraft arrived and began their attacks on Enterprise, forcing a suspension of <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b> To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b> After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side of the flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E
5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese {{military}} would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied <b>landing</b> <b>operations</b> in the home islands began.|$|E

5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied <b>landing</b> <b>operations.</b> The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used {{in the formation of the}} four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E
5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if <b>landing</b> <b>operations</b> were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{reassembled}} on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel, {{where it}} conducted a mock {{attack on the}} harbor on 12 August. During its cruise in the North Sea, the fleet experimented with wireless telegraphy {{on a large scale}} and searchlights at night for communication and recognition signals. Immediately after returning to Kiel, the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers, which began on 29 August in the Baltic. The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September, where it took part in a major landing operation, after which the ships took the ground troops from the IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II. The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September. Three days later, the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, where it participated in further <b>landing</b> <b>operations</b> with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps. On 15 September, the maneuvers came to an end. The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise, this time to the eastern Baltic, from 22 November to 2 December.|$|E

5|$|On November 19, 2008, {{the police}} {{investigation}} was completed using 13,600 pages, which took 16 months {{of research to}} be produced, during which 336 people were heard. For federal prosecutors, {{the former director of}} ANAC Denise Abreu and then flight safety officer of the company, Marco Aurelio dos Santos de Miranda, should be convicted of attempt on air transport security in willful mode. In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the accident with the Airbus TAM, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on rainy days, received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, security in <b>landing</b> <b>operations</b> at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that takeoffs and landings were forbidden in Congonhas case the track was with a water depth greater than 3mm. After the accident with the plane of TAM in July 2007 it revealed that the study was not a standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for takeoffs and landings of all equipment.|$|E
