Ever-increasing pressure to develop environmentally benign nanoparticle synthesis has lead to {{a renewed interest in}} biotransformations as a route to growth of nanoscale structures. This lead to the development of biomimetic approaches for the growth of nanoparticles. Among various biosynthetic routes, the fungal mediated green chemistry approach towards the synthesis of nanoparticles has many advantages such as the ease with which the process can be scaled up, economic viability, possibility of easily covering up large surface areas by suitable growth of mycelia etc. Mukherjee and co-workers [1] demonstrated that exposure of the fungus, Verticillium sp. to aqueous silver nitrate solution resulted in formation of silver nanoparticles of about 25 nm diameter. Chen and co-workers also reported evidence of the production of silver nanoparticles via pretreatment of Phoma sp. with silver nitrate [2].

We assess relationships between longevity, reproductive onset, reproductive rate and age for 834 longitudinally monitored wild female African elephants in Amboseli, Kenya. The mean known age at first reproduction was 13. 8 years; only 5 % commenced reproduction by 10 years. Early reproducers (< 12. 5 years) had higher age-specific fertility rates than did females who commenced reproduction late (15 + years) with no differences in survival between these groups. Age-specific reproductive rates of females dying before 40 years were reduced by comparison to same-aged survivors, illustrating a mortality filter and reproductive advantages of a long life. Overall, 95 % of fertility was completed before 50, and 95 % of mortality experienced by age 65, with a mean life expectancy of 41 years for females who survived to the minimum age at first birth (9 years). Elephant females have a relatively long period (c. 16 years) of viability after 95 % completed fertility, although reproduction does not entirely cease until they are over 65. We {{found no evidence of}} increased investment among females aged over 40 in terms of delay to next birth or calf mortality.

40|$|In a {{study that}} {{included}} C- 4 tropical grasses, C- 3 temperate grasses and C- 3 pasture legumes, in vitro dry matter digestibility of extrusa, measured as in vitro dry matter loss (IVDML) during incubation, {{compared with that of}} the forage consumed, was greater for grass extrusa but not for legume extrusa. The increase in digestibility was not caused by mastication or by the freezing of extrusa samples during storage but by the action of saliva. Comparable increases in IVDML were achieved merely by mixing bovine saliva with ground forage samples. Differences were greater than could be explained by increases due to completely digestible salivary DM. There {{was no significant difference between}} animals in relation to the saliva effect on IVDML and, except for some minor differences, similar saliva effects on IVDML were measured using either the pepsin-cellulase or rumen fluid-pepsin in vitro techniques. For both C- 4 and C- 3 grasses the magnitude of the differences were inversely related to IVDML of the feed and there was little or no difference between extrusa and feed at high digestibilities (> 70 %) whereas differences of more than 10 percentage units were measured on low quality grass forages. The data did not suggest that the extrusa or saliva effect on digestibility was different for C- 3 grasses than for C- 4 grasses but data on C- 3 grasses were <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>few</b> <b>species</b> and to high digestibility samples. For legume forages there was no saliva effect when the pepsin-cellulase method was used but there was a small but significant positive effect using the rumen fluid-pepsin method. It was concluded that when samples of extrusa are analysed using in vitro techniques, predicted in vivo digestibility of the feed consumed will often be overestimated, especially for low quality grass diets.

Growth prediction curves, that {{can be derived from}} the same data, can also be very useful for a better planning, design and development of the urban forest. However, very little information is available on the growth behavior of urban trees, and <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>few</b> <b>species</b> and regional contexts. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the relationships between tree age and various parameters of tree size in order to develop models to predict the growth of the most important species of an urban forest in northeastern Italy. The logarithmic regression model, proposed by Peper et al. (2001 a,b) and applied by Stoffberg et al. (2008, 2009), and other equations were tested in order to obtain the best fit for each species and parameter. All the models provided a better fit for the larger species (Tilia x vulgaris Hayne, Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl., Acer platanoides L.) than for the smaller ones (Prunus cerasifera “pissardi” (Carriere) L. H. Bailey and Lagerstroemia indica L.). The equations for predicting tree sizes and leaf area are presented and applied to compare size and growth 15 and 25 years after planting. According to the models A. platanoides attained the largest average annual DBH growth with values ranging from an average of 1. 25 cm years− 1 between 0 and 15 years after planting and 1. 52 cm years− 1 between 15 and 25 years after planting. L. indica showed the smaller DBH growth, ranging from 0. 34 cm years− 1 in the first period to 0. 48 cm years− 1 in the second period. 25 years after planting. A. platanoides L. is the tallest species and reaches the largest crown diameter, whith the largest average annual growth, followed by F. angustifolia and Tilia x vulgaris that show similar growth patterns.

The assay can detect both plasmid and transposon genes and can also discriminate strains carrying antibiotic resistance single-nucleotide polymorphism mutations. Finally, the assay is similarly capable of discriminating between bacterial species through reporter-specific discrimination and allele-specific amplification. Anchored strand displacement amplification allows multiplex amplification and complex genotype discrimination on the same platform.

Yet, their routine application is <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>few</b> plant <b>species</b> often requiring substantial equipment and facilities. High chloroplast and chlorophyll content may further impede downstream applications of transformed cells from green plant tissue. Results Here, we describe a fast and simple technique for the high-yield isolation and efficient transformation (> 70 %) of mesophyll-derived protoplasts from red {{leaves of the}} perennial plant Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulccherrima). In this method no particular growth facilities or expensive equipments are needed. Poinsettia protoplasts display an astonishing robustness and can be employed {{in a variety of}} commonly-used downstream applications, such as subcellular localisation (multi-colour fluorescence) or promoter activity studies. Due to low abundance of chloroplasts or chromoplasts, problems encountered in other mesophyll-derived protoplast systems (particularly autofluorescence) are alleviated. Furthermore, the trans{{gene expression}} is detectable within 90 minutes of transformation and lasts for several days. Conclusions The simplicity of the isolation and transformation procedure renders Poinsettia protoplasts an attractive system for transient gene expression experiments, including multi-colour fluorescence, subcellular localisation and promoter activity studies.

40|$|Overfishing {{threatens to}} {{extinguish}} local fisheries for valuable tropical sea cucumbers by reducing population densities {{to the point}} where reproductive success trails behind natural mortality (known as depensation or the ‘Allee effect’). Once this happens, conventional management measures alone, such as closed seasons/areas, size limits and gear restrictions, will usually fail to repair the damage. A different suite of active management interventions must be considered to restore the spawning biomass of severely over-exploited populations. These include: (1) restocking no-take zones with hatchery-reared juveniles; (2) aggregating remnant wild individuals in no-take zones; and (3) development of small enterprises to rear wild-caught sea cucumbers in simple sea pens, or dedicated sublittoral areas, to the size above sexual maturity that optimises earnings.

These findings are {{one of the first to}} show cross-lineage stem cell-like induction, and to generate pluripotent-like cells for several of these species with in vivo chimeras. We suggest that the stem-cell state may be highly conserved across a wide phylogenetic range. DOI:[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Although {{aquaculture}} {{has been}} practised for many centuries, {{it was in}} the past on quite a modest scale and <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a <b>few</b> <b>species</b> e. g. carp. However, in recent decades, aquaculture has shown very rapid expansion. This is partly because catches of wild fish have expanded at a slower rate than demand and many new scientific and technological advances have been made in aquaculture. Furthermore, by the mid- 1990 s evidence available to scientists indicated that catches of wild fish had either reached, nearly reached or even exceeded their sustainable limits (Williams, 1997). Consequently, according to Meryl Williams (1997, p. 18), Director of ICLARM, now “aquaculture is the major, though not sole hope, for improving the world’s fish production”. Aquaculture, particularly marine aquaculture, has become a new economic frontier. Just as humankind in the past experienced the Agricultural Revolution it seems now to be starting on an Aquaculture Revolution. Naturally, this raises the question of how sustainable it will be. The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss the sustainability of aquaculture production. If expanded aquaculture production sets into motion forces that make it unsustainable, economic development based on it will be short lived. One should at least be aware how lack of economic sustainability of aquaculture production can arise, and be prepared to adopt policies to curb or prevent undesired trends in this.

40|$|Sponges are abundant, {{diverse and}} {{functionally}} important organisms of coral reef ecosys-tems. Sponge-associated microorganisms have been receiving greater attention {{because of their}} significant contribution to sponge biomass, biogeochemical cycles and biotechno-logical potentials. However, {{our understanding of the}} sponge microbiome is <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a <b>few</b> <b>species</b> of sponges from restricted geographical locations. Here, we report {{for the first time the}} bacterial diversity of two cohabiting sponges, viz. Cinachyra cavernosa and Haliclona pigmentifera, as well as that in the ambient water from the coral reef ecosystems of the Gulf of Mannar, located along the southeast coast of India. Two hundred and fifty two clones in the 16 S rRNA gene library of these sponges were grouped into eight distinct phyla, of which four belonged to the core group that are associated only with sponges. Phylogenetic analy-sis of the core bacteria showed close affinity to other sponge-associated bacteria from dif-ferent geographical locations. γ-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Deferribacter were the core groups in C. cavernosa while β and δ-Proteobacteria performed this role in H. pigmentifera. We observed greater OTU diversity for C. cavernosa (H ǀ 2. 07) compared to H. pigmentifera (H ǀ 1. 97). UniFrac analysis confirmed the difference in bacteri-al diversity of the two sponge species and also between the sponges and the reef water (p< 0. 001). The results of our study restate the existence of a host driven force in shaping the sponge microbiome...|$|R
5000|$|... ===Silurian=== The end-Ordovician {{extinction}} {{represented a}} large-scale extinction for diploporitans. The majority of diploporitan species went extinct {{during this period}} and they never returned to their high species numbers after this time. During the Silurian, there was a much larger presence of diploporitans in North American than during the Ordovician. These diploporitans, called the Holocystites Fauna, appeared in North America {{during the middle of}} the Silurian. These diploporitans, representing multiple genera, all share the same basic features: reduced food grooves, large plates to support feeding structures that branched off of the surface of the body, and specialized diplopore respiratory structures, called humatipores (diplopores that are connected by multiple canals below the surface of the plate). The Holocystites Fauna is mostly found in the midcontinental United States (e.g., Indiana, Wisconsin, Tennessee) and does not survive past the end of the Silurian. Other Silurian occurrences of diploporitans worldwide are rare and <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> only a <b>few</b> <b>species</b> (e.g., Eucystis). These occurrences are largely restricted to southern Europe.|$|R
40|$|Temperate phages, the {{bacterial}} viruses able {{to enter}} in a dormant prophage state in bacterial genomes, {{are present in the}} majority of bacterial strains for which the genome sequence is available. Although these prophages are generally considered to increase their hosts' fitness by bringing beneficial genes, studies demonstrating such effects in ecologically relevant environments are relatively <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>few</b> bacterial <b>species.</b> Here, we investigated the impact of prophage carriage in the gastrointestinal tract of monoxenic mice. Combined with mathematical modelling, these experimental results provided a quantitative estimation of key parameters governing phage-bacteria interactions within this model ecosystem. We used wild-type and mutant strains of the best known host/phage pair, Escherichia coli and phage λ. Unexpectedly, λ prophage caused a significant fitness cost for its carrier, due to an induction rate 50 -fold higher than in vitro, with 1 to 2 % of the prophage being induced. However, when prophage carriers were in competition with isogenic phage susceptible bacteria, the prophage indirectly benefited its carrier by killing competitors: infection of susceptible bacteria led to phage lytic development in about 80 % of cases. The remaining infected bacteria were lysogenized, resulting overall in the rapid lysogenization of the susceptible lineage. Moreover, our setup enabled to demonstrate that rare events of phage gene capture by homologous recombination occurred in the intestine of monoxenic mice. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first quantitative characterization of temperate phage-bacteria interactions in a simplified gut environment. The high prophage induction rate detected reveals DNA damage-mediated SOS response in monoxenic mouse intestine. We propose that the mammalian gut, the most densely populated bacterial ecosystem on earth, might foster bacterial evolution through high temperate phage activity...|$|R
