5|$|Writer Howard Weinstein {{had been}} a fan of space {{exploration}} following the flight of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard on Mercury-Redstone 3. He recalled that his first experience of Star Trek was in middle school, where he mixed elements of the show up with <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Space.</b> He began watching the show and was inspired to write for television after reading The Making of Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry and Stephen E. Whitfield. While in the 11th grade, he had a Star Trek short story published in the fanzine Probe, which was a yearly publication in East Meadow High School. Weinstein also wrote a script for , but the script was turned down as it was not submitted via an agent. It was returned with a list of suggested agents, and his father recognised Bill Cooper's name on the list from their school years together.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and <b>lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>space,</b> mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E
50|$|The {{third season}} had more {{straight}} adventure, with the Jupiter 2 now functional and hopping from planet to planet, but the episodes still {{tended to be}} whimsical and to emphasize humor, including fanciful space hippies, more pirates, off-beat inter-galactic zoos, ice princesses and <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Spaces</b> beauty pageant.|$|R

500|$|Carey Wilber {{was hired}} to write a script for an episode of Star Trek. His idea {{was based on an}} episode he wrote for the {{television}} series Captain Video and His Video Rangers (1949–1955). His work on that show featured Ancient-Greek-era humans transported in suspended animation through space, with the people of the future finding that they have mythological powers. For [...] "Space Seed", Wilber replaced these mythological powers with abilities that were enhanced due to genetic engineering. Wilber had briefly worked with Gene Roddenberry on the television series Harbormaster. His science fiction extended beyond Star Trek: he also wrote scripts for <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Space</b> and The Time Tunnel around the same time.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the setting, {{part of the original}} concept for the show was {{that there would be a}} lot of advanced technology similar to that seen in Star Trek, but it would be constantly malfunctioning.

In another twist, the two policemen who try to arrest Fry at the head museum use weapons which are visually similar to lightsabers used in the Star Wars film series; however, they are functionally more similar to nightsticks. The interaction between the characters was not overlooked. The relationship formed between Fry and Bender in this episode has been compared to the relationship between Will Robinson and the robot in <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Space.</b>|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The Day After Tomorrow remains mixed.

Although Byrne's scriptwriting {{has been described as}} [...] "lyrical", and {{it has been suggested that}} The Day After Tomorrow contains homages to the 1960s TV series <b>Lost</b> <b>in</b> <b>Space,</b> the plot has been criticised for a lack of suspense, which critics have generally attributed to the fact that the special is primarily a science education programme. Further criticism has been directed at the acting, with Martin Lev's performance attracting a particularly negative response. Author Douglas R.

Pretty powerful stuff for a kids' show." [...] Law, meanwhile, considers the faster-than-light shots to be the special's best effects, and compares the black hole sequence unfavourably to the closing act of Kubrick's 1968 film : [...] "Kubrick's Star-Gate it is not." ...|$|E
