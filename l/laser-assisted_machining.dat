Light {{amplification}} by {{stimulated emission}} of radiation (laser) is a coherent and monochromatic beam of electromagnetic radiation that can propagate {{in a straight}} line with negligible divergence and occur {{in a wide range of}} wave-length, energy/power and beam-modes/configurations. As a result, lasers find wide applications in the mundane to the most sophisticated devices, in commercial to purely scientific purposes, and in life-saving as well as life-threatening causes. In the present contribution, we provide an overview of the application of lasers for material processing.

These models are to assist in selecting machining parameters for <b>laser-assisted</b> <b>machining</b> of metal matrix composites. The two MMC’s studied in this research are an aluminum matrix reinforced by long alumina fibers {{and the other is}} an aluminum matrix reinforced by silicon carbide particles. ^ The multi-scale heirarchical model bridges the atomic, micro and macro scales. In this model, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to parameterize traction-separation laws for the aluminum-alumina and aluminum-silicon carbide interfaces in tensile and shear loadings at high temperatures. The interfaces are characterized by cohesive zone models (CZM), with the CZM traction-separation laws obtained from MD simulations. The parameterized CZM is then input into a finite element model to simulate the machining of fiber and particulate reinforced MMC. The multi-scale model is capable of predicting the cutting forces and post machined sub-surface damage. Average values of the predicted quantities are compared with experimental results, and the favorable agreement confirms the MD determined traction-separation laws and subsequently the validity of the multi-scale FEM. ^ <b>Laser-assisted</b> <b>machining</b> (LAM) of the two MMC’s is evaluated for its potential to improve the machinability while minimizing the sub-surface damage.

Surface topography greatly influences not only the mechanical and physical properties of contacting parts, but also the optical and coating properties of contacting components. The characteristics of surface topography in amplitude, spatial distribution and pattern of surface features dominate the functional applications in the field of wear, friction, lubrication, fatigue, sealing, joining, reflecting, painting, etc. Although surface roughness data from a stylus profilometer continues to be of basic importance, it does suffer from some limitations which cannot be overlooked. Some of the major limitations of using a stylus profilometer are finite tip radius, inability to record detailed information, bouncing of stylus tip and losing contact with surface, the stylus might create scratches as it passes over the surface, and long time when acquiring data. Alternatively, optical interferometry has, for a number of decades, been used to measure surface topography successfully. As a result there are many commercial interferometric instruments based on two or multi-beam interferometerss instruments available today.

However, shaping structural ceramics is both difficult and expensive, because of their brittleness and hardness. Because it heats the material prior to removal with a conventional cutting tool, thereby temporarily lowering the strength of the workpiece, <b>laser-assisted</b> <b>machining</b> (LAM) offers the ability to machine structural ceramics more rapidly and with greater flexibility than conventional methods. ^ This study focuses on understanding and evaluating <b>laser-assisted</b> <b>machining</b> (LAM) of partially-stabilized zirconia (PSZ) through the synergy of experiments and modeling of heat transfer in a semitransparent PSZ workpiece. A transient, three-dimensional heat transfer model is developed, and the optically thick assumption (diffusion) to internal radiative transfer is compared with a discrete-ordinates method solution for transfer in a semi-transparent medium. Since the difference in the predicted temperatures lies within the uncertainty limits of the predictions (+ 40 /− 55 °C at 400 °C to + 100 /− 120 °C at 1000 °C), the diffusion approximation is used. ^ The temperature predictions are validated with single-point temperature measurements made by a long-wavelength (11 – 14 μm) pyrometer with a total uncertainty from − 33 /+ 22 °C at 500 °C to − 59 /+ 49 °C at 1000 °C. The temperature predictions are in good agreement with values measured during machining. The validated model is used to show that laser power and feedrate have the greatest effect on the temperature distribution and LAM. ^ The machinability of PSZ under varying conditions is evaluated by examining tool wear, surface integrity, microstructure, and specific cutting energy. With increasing material removal temperature from 530 to 1210 °C, the benefit of LAM is demonstrated by a 2. 5 fold decrease in specific cutting energy and an increase {{in the life of a}} cubic boron nitride tool to 120 minutes. These machinability improvements are a result of some material removal occurring by plastic deformation, which nominally results in a finished surface without cracks and an average surface roughness of less than 1 μm.

In order for advanced ceramics to become more prevalent in industry, it is necessary to develop the adequate manufacturing equipment for processing at a much cheaper price and faster manufacturing time than conventional grinding does. <b>Laser-assisted</b> <b>machining</b> (LAM) of ceramics is one tool that can enable this growth while maintaining reasonable costs for making advanced ceramic parts in small quantities. Mostly CO 2 and YAG lasers have been used for processing but now with the development of diode lasers a new tool has been introduced. The diode laser offers more flexibility over others and cheaper equipment costs, smaller footprint and highest wall plug efficiencies. In LAM, the laser does not remove the material but helps the tool in removing the material with much greater ease, thus providing many advantages over conventional machining methods like grinding. In LAM of Si 3 N 4 it is required to melt the glassy phase present (at the grain boundaries) in the workpiece material around 1000 °C rather than evaporating the bulk of the material which happens above 1600 °C. The current thesis work obtains the temperatures achieved by a Si 3 N 4 rod (1 x 6 inch) during laser-assisted turning at different sets of parameters: rpm, laser spot size, laser power, laser preheat time, and bulk preheat temperature (temperature of preheating the whole workpiece externally without laser). The temperatures obtained are analyzed {{with the help of a}} previously carried out numerical modeling in LAM and a mathematical study is done relating these temperatures with the corresponding laser energies absorbed. In the process of the research conducted, the calibration of all the equipment/processes involved in the accurate estimations of temperatures, power outputs, and other parameters [...] which plays a major role in this study [...] has been done. The whole thesis work helps develop a complete understanding of various laser and machining parameters in LAM of ceramics, and makes some important conclusions that help in continuing the research for a fully developed LAM of ceramics system...|$|E
