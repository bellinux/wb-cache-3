5|$|There {{are five}} nature {{reserves}} in Kraków {{with a total}} area of 48.6 ha. Smaller green zones constitute parts of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland Jurassic <b>Landscape</b> Parks' Board, which deals with the protection areas of the Polish Jura. Under its jurisdiction are: the Bielany-Tyniec <b>Landscape</b> Park (Park Bielańsko-Tyniecki), Tenczynek <b>Landscape</b> Park (Park Tencziński) and Kraków Valleys <b>Landscape</b> Park (Park Krajobrazowy Dolinki Krakowskie), with their watersheds. All natural reserves of the Polish Jura Chain {{are part of the}} CORINE biotopes programme due to their unique flora, fauna, geomorphology and <b>landscape.</b> The western part of Kraków constitute the so-called Obszar Krakowski ecological network, including the ecological corridor of the Vistula river. The southern slopes of limestone hills provide conditions for the development of thermophilous vegetation, grasslands and scrubs.|$|E

5|$|Coffin's {{attempts}} to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable <b>landscape</b> architects in Chicago {{but she was not}} short of commissions despite this failure. Her success was recognized by her being elected a Fellow of the American Society of <b>Landscape</b> Architects in 1918, and by the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after East Coast <b>landscape</b> architects. Her work was widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership of publications such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading <b>landscape</b> photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures. Her marketing was highly successful and led to a steady stream of commissions.|$|E

50|$|Hard <b>landscaping</b> {{involves}} {{projects that}} cover {{the entirety of the}} yard and that are necessary before soft <b>landscaping</b> features come into play. Hard <b>landscaping</b> is very much altering the foundation of the yard, the “bricks and mortar”, and so only once this is completed can you begin to focus on the more beautiful features of the yard, hard-soft <b>landscaping</b> such as the floral arrangements, trees and shrubs and perfecting your color schemes. One key feature of hard <b>landscaping</b> is to do with the absorption of water - something that is of great importance given the climate. Hard <b>landscaping</b> ensures that worrying about water after heavy rain or snowfall isn’t an issue. The right water absorption and irrigation system installed through hard <b>landscaping,</b> coupled with hard materials that safely move water away from the property can ensure that soil movement is never a problem and that your yard stays a drier, enjoyable living space rather than a wet and muddy bog. There are soft <b>landscaping</b> options that can help to achieve this, but the bulk of this is definitely achieved through hard <b>landscaping.</b>|$|R

40|$|Fitness <b>landscapes</b> are {{generalized}} energy <b>landscapes</b> {{that play}} an important conceptual role in evolutionary biology. These <b>landscapes</b> provide a relation between the genetic configuration of an organism and that organism’s adaptive properties. In this work, global topographical features of these fitness <b>landscapes</b> are investigated using theoretical models. The resulting predictions are compared to empirical <b>landscapes.</b> It is shown that these <b>landscapes</b> allow, at least {{with respect to the}} properties considered, for a rough classification into two types. In the biologically relevant limit, these two types of <b>landscapes</b> show very different behavior. While empirical <b>landscapes</b> cannot be classified on purely theoretical grounds, some of the known <b>landscapes</b> are classified here on a case-by-case basis. The study of theoretical models leads to consider sequences of record events of independent but non-identically distributed random variables and correlations between these record events. While these considerations appear at first to be outside the main direction of this thesis, they lead to a record-base tool of data analysis that is applied to one of the data sets considered here...|$|R

25|$|<b>Landscape</b> ecology theory {{stresses}} {{the role of}} human impacts on <b>landscape</b> structures and functions. It also proposes ways for restoring degraded landscapes. <b>Landscape</b> ecology explicitly includes humans as entities that cause functional changes on the <b>landscape.</b> <b>Landscape</b> ecology theory includes the <b>landscape</b> stability principle, which {{emphasizes the importance of}} <b>landscape</b> structural heterogeneity in developing resistance to disturbances, recovery from disturbances, and promoting total system stability. This principle is a major contribution to general ecological theories which highlight the importance of relationships among the various components of the <b>landscape.</b> Integrity of <b>landscape</b> components helps maintain resistance to external threats, including development and land transformation by human activity. Analysis of land use change has included a strongly geographical approach which has led to the acceptance of the idea of multifunctional properties of landscapes. There are still calls for a more unified theory of <b>landscape</b> ecology due to differences in professional opinion among ecologists and its interdisciplinary approach (Bastian 2001).|$|E
25|$|A <b>landscape</b> with {{structure}} and pattern implies {{that it has}} spatial heterogeneity, or the uneven distribution of objects across the <b>landscape.</b> Heterogeneity {{is a key element}} of <b>landscape</b> ecology that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. <b>Landscape</b> heterogeneity is able to quantify with agent-based methods as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{perception}} of the <b>landscape</b> in historical ecology differs from other disciplines, such as <b>landscape</b> ecology. <b>Landscape</b> ecologists often attribute the depletion of biodiversity to human disturbance. Historical ecologists recognize {{that this is not}} always true. These changes are due to multiple factors that contribute to the ever-changing <b>landscape.</b> <b>Landscape</b> ecology still focuses on areas defined as ecosystems. In this, the ecosystem perpetually returns to a state of equilibrium. In contrast, historical ecologists view the <b>landscape</b> as perpetually changing. <b>Landscape</b> ecologists view noncyclical human events and natural disasters as external influences, while historical ecologists view disturbances {{as an integral part of}} the landscape's history. It is this integration of the concept of disturbance and history that allows for <b>landscape</b> to be viewed as palimpsests, representing successive layers of change, rather than as static entities.|$|E

In conclusion, the attributes of forest, hilly landform and architectural heritage have significant scenic value.
