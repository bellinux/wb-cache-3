Methods  Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups after adaptive swimming. Each group consisted of 12 rats, namely amino acids and vitamins capsule group (capsule group), control with bland water group (control group), and amino acid and fructose beverage group (granules group). Exhaustion was produced by non-load swimming. After 14 days of feeding with different beverages, the exhaustion time of swimming was recorded, and then all rats were killed to measure concentrations of muscle and hepatic glycogen, and contents of serum β-endorphin (β-EP), <b>lactic</b> <b>acid</b> (LA), lactate <b>dehydrogenase</b> (LDH), and creatine kinase (CK).
