25|$|One disc {{golf course}} is open year-round at the park. The course winds {{through the woods}} near Hopewell Lake and {{provides}} both short and <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> locations. Score cards and maps of the course {{are available at the}} park.|$|E
500|$|The front two {{and back}} two legs were each cast as one piece, yet where a [...] deep socket was {{hollowed}} {{into the front}} piece, a [...] <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> extends down from the back piece. The resultant pin and socket design would allow the boar to be mounted on another object, particularly a helmet.|$|E
2500|$|Both penannular and pseudo-penannular {{brooches}} {{feature a}} <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> attached by its {{head to a}} ring; the pin can move freely around the ring {{as far as the}} terminals, which are close together. [...] In the true penannular type, the ring is not closed; there is a gap between the terminals wide enough for the pin to pass through. In the pseudo-penannular type, the ring is closed, but there are still two separately defined terminals, which are joined by a further element. The penannular type is a simple and efficient way of fastening loosely woven cloth (where the pin will not leave a permanent hole), but the pseudo-penannular type is notably less efficient.|$|E
50|$|The New Richmond Swing Bridge {{has four}} main spans, plus eight short {{approach}} spans, totaling 422 ft in length. The four main spans include an 89 ft <b>long</b> <b>pinned</b> Warren pony truss swing span, two 70 ft <b>long</b> <b>pinned</b> Warren pony truss spans on either side, and an additional 51 ft long rivetted Warren pony truss span (repaired in 1899). On the south side, two 24 ft long approach spans slope upward to meet the bridge, which sits on a concrete abutment. On the north side, six short-span steel stringer structures, each 12 ft to 16 ft long, approach the bridge, again on concrete abutments.|$|R

60|$|I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my {{surprise}} {{to notice that}} my wife, instead of doing the same, drew from her pocket a little case, from which she selected a <b>long</b> <b>pin,</b> and by the help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth.|$|E

60|$|I {{slid back}} {{the barn door}} and then led the horse outside. Closing the door, and making as little noise as {{possible}} in doing it, I got into the sleigh, finding {{plenty of room to}} stand up in front of my companions. Now I wrapped the horse-blanket about the lower part of my body, and as I had no belt with which to secure it, Miss Burroughs kindly offered to fasten it round my waist by means of a <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> which she took from her hat. It is impossible to describe the exhilaration that pervaded me as she performed this kindly office. After thanking her warmly, I took the reins and we started.|$|E
50|$|Between about 1840 and 1916, {{clothing}} buttons {{were used}} in American political campaigns, and still exist in collections today. Initially, these buttons were predominantly made of brass (though horn and rubber buttons with stamped or moulded designs also exist) and had loop shanks. Around 1860 the badge or pin-back style of construction, which replaced the shanks with <b>long</b> <b>pins,</b> probably for use on lapels and ties, began to appear.|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{usability}} of {{a randomized}} numeric keypad was examined and {{compared to the}} usability of a conventional numeric keypad. The comparison used completion time measurements and the error rate of short (4 -digit) and <b>long</b> (8 -digit) <b>PINs</b> to contrast efficiency and accuracy of the keypads. The {{results showed that the}} average completion time with a randomized keypad is longer than with a conventional keypad. Additionally, the number of errors with a randomized keypad was significantly higher than with a conventional keypad, particularly when using <b>long</b> <b>PINs.</b> Accordingly, a randomized numeric keypad is more applicable to tasks with short (4 -digit) PINs...|$|R
60|$|The {{little room}} had been {{transformed}} for present emergencies. The desk had been pushed aside, and a small iron bedstead fitted up for the night nurse. A woman's paraphernalia was scattered about on the massive early Victorian furniture: a comb and brush, a cap and apron neatly folded, a couple of <b>long</b> <b>pins,</b> littered the table which used to look so severe with its heavy inkstand and firm blotting-pad. The piano had been relegated into a corner, and the portrait of Luke which always hung over the mantlepiece had been removed.|$|R
6000|$|At length, none {{hindering}} them, {{they reached}} the yard where the escort and the horses waited. Here, standing under an archway, were Castell and Peter. Castell greeted Margaret in English and kissed her through her veil, while Peter, who had not seen her close since months before he rode away to Dedham, stared at her with all his eyes, and began to draw near to her, designing to find out, as {{he was sure he}} could do if once he touched her, whether indeed this were Margaret, or only Betty after all. Guessing what was in his mind, and that he might reveal everything, Inez, who held a <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> in her hand with which she was fastening her veil that had come loose, pretended to knock against him, and ran the point deep into his arm, muttering, [...] "Fool!" [...] as she did so. He sprang back with an oath, the guard smiled, and she began to pray his pardon.|$|E
6000|$|But though Goldsmith might permit this raillery on {{the part}} of his friends, he was quick to resent any personalities of the kind from strangers. As he was one day walking the Strand in grand array with bag-wig and sword, he excited the merriment of two coxcombs, one of whom called to the other to [...] "look at that fly with a <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> stuck through it." [...] Stung to the quick, Goldsmith's first retort was to caution the passers-by to be on their guard against [...] "that brace of {{disguised}} pickpockets"--his next was to step {{into the middle of the}} street, where there was room for action, half draw his sword, and beckon the joker, who was armed in like manner, to follow him. This was literally a war of wit which the other had not anticipated. He had no inclination to push the joke to such an extreme, but abandoning the ground, sneaked off with his brother wag amid the hootings of the spectators.|$|E
60|$|Michael {{forgot about}} the bears, who were quickly {{at work on the}} other side of the circle from that to which he was taken. Some men, rolling out stout bright-painted barrels which {{elephants}} could not crush by sitting on, attracted his attention for a moment. Next, in a pause on the part of the man who led him, he regarded with huge interest a piebald Shetland pony. It lay on the ground. A man sat on it. And ever and anon it lifted its head from the sawdust and kissed the man. This was all Michael saw, yet he sensed something wrong about it. He knew not why, had no evidence why, but he felt cruelty and power and unfairness. What he did not see was the <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> in the man's hand. Each time he thrust this in the pony's shoulder, the pony, stung by the pain and reflex action, lifted its head, and the man was deftly ready to meet the pony's mouth with his own mouth. To an audience the impression would be that in such fashion the pony was expressing its affection for the master.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff faced Smackdown General Manager Theodore Long (with Palmer Canon). Two referees from each show officiated the match. Theodore Long, began by {{avoiding}} Eric's attacks. As Canon climbed on the apron, and distracted the referees, Bischoff used his obi to choke Long. Bischoff continued choking Long and applied the sleeper hold. Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe. The Boogeyman's music played with Bischoff sending the referees {{up the ramp}} to stop him. The Boogeyman delivered a pumphandle slam to Bischoff and <b>Long</b> <b>pinned</b> Bischoff to win the match.|$|R
5000|$|The DC power {{supplies}} to a hot-swap component are usually pre-charged by dedicated <b>long</b> <b>pins</b> that make contact before the main power pins. These pre-charge pins {{are protected by}} a circuit that limits the inrush current to an acceptable value that cannot damage the pins nor disturb the supply voltage to adjacent slots. The pre-charge circuit might be a simple series resistor, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) resistor, or a current-limiter circuit. Further protection can be provided by a [...] "soft-start" [...] circuit that provides a managed ramp-up of the internal DC supply voltages within the component.|$|R

60|$|But {{you get my}} idea; you {{see what}} a {{stunning}} dramatic surprise I would wind up with at the palace. It was all feasible, if I could only get hold of a slender piece of iron which I could shape into a lock-pick. I could then undo the lumbering padlocks with which our chains were fastened, whenever I might choose. But I never had any luck; no such thing ever happened to fall in my way. However, my chance came at last. A gentleman who had come twice before to dicker for me, without result, or indeed any approach to a result, came again. I was far from expecting ever to belong to him, for the price asked for me from the time I was first enslaved was exorbitant, and always provoked either anger or derision, yet my master stuck stubbornly to it--twenty-two dollars. He wouldn't bate a cent. The king was greatly admired, because of his grand physique, but his kingly style was against him, and he wasn't salable; nobody wanted {{that kind of a}} slave. I considered myself safe from parting from him because of my extravagant price. No, I was not expecting to ever belong to this gentleman whom I have spoken of, but he had something which I expected would belong to me eventually, if he would but visit us often enough. It was a steel thing with a <b>long</b> <b>pin</b> to it, with which his long cloth outside garment was fastened together in front. There were three of them. He had disappointed me twice, because he did not come quite close enough to me to make my project entirely safe; but this time I succeeded; I captured the lower clasp of the three, and when he missed it he thought he had lost it on the way.|$|E
6000|$|Upstairs, {{while she}} left him to put on {{something}} to go out in, {{the thought of his}} waiting below for her, in possession of the empty house, brought with it, sharply if briefly, one of her abrupt arrests of consistency, the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her, often, for the minute, before her glass-- the vivid look, in other words, of the particular difference his marriage had made. The particular difference seemed at such instants the loss, more than anything else, of their old freedom, their never having had to think, where they were together concerned, of any one, of anything but each other. It hadn't been HER marriage that did it; that had never, for three seconds, suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically, must reckon with another presence--no, not even with her husband's. She groaned to herself, while the vain imagination lasted, [...] "WHY did he marry? ah, why DID he?" [...] and then it came up to her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which, till Charlotte came so much more closely into their life, Amerigo hadn't interfered. What she had gone on owing him for this mounted up again, to her eyes, like a column of figures---or call it even, if one would, a house of cards; it was her father's wonderful act that had tipped the house down and made the sum wrong. With all of which, immediately after her question, her [...] "Why did he, why did he?" [...] rushed back, inevitably, the confounding, the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his reason. [...] "He did it for ME, he did it for me," [...] she moaned, [...] "he did it, exactly, that our freedom--meaning, beloved man, simply and solely mine--should be greater instead of less; he did it, divinely, to liberate me so far as possible from caring what became of him." [...] She found time upstairs, even in her haste, as she had repeatedly found time before, to let the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her with their customary effect of making her blink: the question in especial of whether she might find her solution in acting, herself, in the spirit of what he had done, in forcing her [...] "care" [...] really to grow as much less as he had tried to make it. Thus she felt the whole weight of their case drop afresh upon her shoulders, was confronted, unmistakably, with the prime source of her haunted state. It all came from her not having been able not to mind--not to mind what became of him; not having been able, without anxiety, to let him go his way and take his risk and lead his life. She had made anxiety her stupid little idol; and absolutely now, while she stuck a <b>long</b> <b>pin,</b> a trifle fallaciously, into her hat--she had, with an approach to irritation, told her maid, a new woman, whom she had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal, that she didn't want her--she tried to focus the possibility of some understanding between them in consequence of which he should cut loose.|$|E

50|$|During this period, superstition found {{expression}} {{in the formation of}} wax images of hated persons, into which <b>long</b> <b>pins</b> were thrust, in the confident expectation that thereby deadly injury would be induced to the person represented. This practice was considered more effective when some portion of the victim's hair or nails were added to the wax figure, thus strengthening the connection with its actual subject. This belief and practice continued until the seventeenth century, though the superstition survived into the nineteenth century. In the Scottish Highlands, a clay model of an enemy was found in a stream in 1885, having been placed there in the belief that, as the clay was washed away, so would the health of the hated one decline.|$|R
5000|$|The Bridgeport Bridge is a {{historic}} structure located near Denmark, Iowa, United States. This span was a replacement bridge for structure whose middle stone pier was deteriorating. The weaknesses in the old bridge were noted in 1887 and 1893. Both Des Moines and Lee counties financed the $5,110 construction of this bridge, which spans the Skunk River between the two counties. [...] The 240 ft Pennsylvania truss bridge was built in 1904 by the Clinton Bridge and Iron Works of Clinton, Iowa. It carried local traffic for nearly 90 years before it was closed. It has {{the distinction of being}} the <b>longest</b> <b>pinned</b> truss remaining in Iowa. [...] The Bridgeport Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.|$|R

30|$|Because we {{are gaining}} {{experience}} with this new concept, the half-pins are kept long as a safeguard {{to be able to}} mount the circular fixator back on the fixation to the bone in unforeseen circumstances. Since the Orthofix unilateral fixator seems to be very capable of maintaining the correction after lengthening, we have started to cut off the half-pins in the outpatient clinic {{in the second half of}} the consolidation phase, when the risk of loss of deformity correction is reduced to a minimum. The next development in this concept might be a clamp on which the rings of the circular fixator and the monolateral body with multidirectional hinges can be simultaneously fitted (on the same clamp instead of using two clamps). This clamp would make the use of <b>long</b> <b>pins</b> redundant.|$|R
