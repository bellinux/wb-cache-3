40|$|Europe (and in {{particular}} the European Union) is a regional economic area and thus an embedded feature of globalisation.

Since its introduction in 2002, the euro has become the world's second most important reserve currency. With the WTO's Doha Round still stuck, the EU runs a large network of bilateral free trade agreements ("spaghetti bowl"), and is pursuing several strategies to ward off the dangers of globalisation: For one, its constant enlargement makes for an ever <b>larger</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> which implicitly raises borders against third countries. This immunisation effect is further strengthened by the enlargement of the euro area. Secondly, the EU's competition and anti-dumping policy efficiently ensures fair competition within the EU's <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> The losers in the globalisation process are helped by the globalisation fund set up by the EU...|$|R

50|$|Alberta {{has a small}} <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> and it is {{relatively}} distant from major world markets, despite good transportation links {{to the rest of}} Canada and to the United States to the south. Alberta is located in the northwestern quadrant of North America, in a region of low population density called the Interior Plains. Alberta is landlocked, and separated by a series of mountain ranges from the nearest outlets to the Pacific Ocean, and by the Canadian Shield from ports on the Lakehead or Hudson Bay. From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers. The largest population clusters of North America (the Boston - Washington, San Francisco - San Diego, Chicago - Pittsburgh, and Quebec City - Windsor Corridors) are all thousands of kilometers away from Alberta. Partly for this reason, Alberta has never developed a large presence in the industries that have traditionally started industrialization in other places (notably the original Industrial Revolution in Great Britain) but which require large labour forces, and <b>large</b> <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> or easy transportation to export markets, namely textiles, metallurgy, or transportation-related manufacturing (automotives, ships, or train cars).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyse Friedrich List's {{contribution}} to the modern theory of economic development. We argue that Friedrich List saw economic development as {{a combination of a}} sectorial division of labour (following Adam Smith, 1776) and a geographical division of labour across regions and countries. In this sense, the passage from a traditional economy to an industrial one consists of balanced growth at both the sectorial and geographical level, as we see in modern development economics (see Rosentein-Rodan, 1943; and Murphy et al., 1989). In addition, List highlights the role of transport costs in the industrialization process {{not only in terms of}} the costs incurred by firms, but also how industrialization affects these costs, since modern technology produces goods that are ?lighter? to transport than goods produced with traditional technology. In this sense, contrary to what is usually attributed to List, tariffs are not the central part of his argument for industrialization. He puts more emphasis on the creation of a <b>larger</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> via for instance a customs union and the complementarities between resources and sectors in a country.

50|$|England in the 16th {{century was}} already a {{centralized}} state, in which much of the feudal order of Medieval Europe had been swept away. This centralization was strengthened by a good system of roads and a disproportionately large capital city, London. The capital acted as a central market hub for the entire country, creating a <b>large</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> for goods, {{in contrast to the}} fragmented feudal holdings that prevailed {{in most parts of the}} Continent. The economic foundations of the agricultural system were also beginning to diverge substantially; the manorial system had broken down by this time, and land began to be concentrated in the hands of fewer landlords with increasingly large estates. Instead of a serf-based system of labour, workers were being employed as part of a broader and expanding money economy. The system put pressure on both the landlords and the tenants to increase agricultural productivity to create profit; the weakened coercive power of the aristocracy to extract peasant surpluses encouraged them to try out better methods, and the tenants also had an incentive to improve their methods, in order to succeed in an increasingly competitive labour market. Land rents had moved away from the previous stagnant system of custom and feudal obligation, and were becoming directly subject to economic market forces.|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} of overseas manufacturing production by U. S. firms {{seems to have}} been strongly influenced by common factors that operate in all industries: notably proximity to the United States and to other markets. Within industries, the choices made by parent firms among locations appear to show a tendency of "opposites attract," with low-wage and low-capital-intensity parents choosing high-wage, high-capital intensity countries and high-wage, high-capital-intensity parents making the opposite choice. Production for export {{seems to have been}} most strongly attracted by <b>large</b> <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> in host countries. Economies of scale in production presumably made large markets also economical as export bases. Another factor was high trade propensities of host countries, which we interpret as representing access to imported materials at low world prices or better transport, finance, and other trade facilities. Labor cost {{seems to have been a}} weak influence on location choices. U. S. firms tended to export from high-wage countries but the high productivity in such countries more than offset the high wages.

On the other hand, integration leads {{to the creation of}} a <b>larger</b> <b>internal</b> capital <b>market,</b> thereby making integrated firms less dependent on the provision of follow-up financing by outside investors. But in a world where financial contracting is incomplete, the threat not to provide follow-up financing may be the only means that investors have to make borrowers repay their debt. By making this threat less effective, integration may aggravate existing financing constraints caused by contractual incompleteness. ...|$|R

40|$|Bananas are {{tropical}} fruits grown world-wide {{playing a}} key role in market trade and especially used as main food source for low income populations. In Brazil, bananas are mainly consumed in natura, occupying the second <b>largest</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> Nevertheless, this crop presents low availability of productive commercial varieties with good agronomic characteristics. A strategy undertaken to solve this problem is the development of new cultivars through conventional genetic breeding methods. However, this strategy presents some obstacles such as female sterility and low number of seeds. In order to overcome these shortcomings, use of mutation induction aiming the selection of mutants with desirable agronomic characteristics seems to have great potential for developing new cultivars. The objective of the present work was to evaluate the genetic variability in putative banana Pacovan (AAB genome, subgroup Prata Type) mutants submitted to gamma ray irradiation, using a set of agronomical and molecular data (ISSR markers). The distance between the putative Pacovan mutants varied from 0. 26 to 0. 64 with cophenetic correlation coef?cient of 0. 7669. Four mutants were selected based on best agronomical characteristics and height. This data also shows that there is variability that can be explored after the irradiation of Pacovan banana mutants, which can be used in the genetic breeding program of banana aiming to develop short new varieties that also present good agronomic characteristics. This is the first attempt to use combined data in order to evaluate the genetic variability in putative banana mutants. 2011 Também disponível em:. PESTANANA, R. K. N. i. e., PESTANA, R. K. N...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical framework which demonstrates how {{the structures of}} corporate <b>internal</b> labor <b>markets</b> are formed within the broader labor and capital market context in the U.

Prior to the Asian economic crisis, Korean conglomerates had <b>large,</b> closed <b>internal</b> labor <b>markets.</b> However, {{in the aftermath of}} the crisis, they have pursued structural downsizing and moved to open their labor markets. The empirical evidence introduced in this paper affirms the argument that the first step toward creating a flexible labor market in Korea should begin with establishing an efficient corporate governance structure. This implies that a simple switch from the Japanese paradigm for human resource management to an Anglo-American model or vice-versa may not improve <b>internal</b> labor <b>market</b> performance unless the change is accompanied by a solution to the problems posed by the minority controlling structure of Korean companies.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to analyse the {{evolution}} of the foreign direct investments (FDI) attracted by Romania between 2007 and present, taking into consideration {{the fact that there were}} two main determinants during this period: Romania’s adhesion to European Union and the economic and financial crisis.

In order to achieve these objectives, we have collected, tabulated and interpreted the data included in various statistical reports and databases. The results show that the relatively low unit labour cost, fiscal facilities, geographical location, <b>large</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> and the adhesion to the EU made Romania become one of the most attractive countries from the Central and Eastern Europe for the foreign investors.

Focus groups identified a primary concern with the food safety and a secondary interest on {{the environmental impact of}} production practices. Two alternative national certification seals were proposed: 1) a "Blue Seal" certifying the Department of Public Health's approval for food safety; and 2) a "Green Seal" certifying Ministry of Agriculture's approval for environmentally sound production practices. Three other attributes were selected: "Appearance", "Size", and "Price". These attributes, together with the proposed labels, were presented in different combinations to a sample of 432 Costa Rican consumers at ten supermarkets located in the urban Central Valley. The results of the multinomial logit model demonstrate that the attributes "Appearance" and "Price" the have the strongest influence over the probability choosing alternative scenarios. Also, there was a significant preference for the "Blue Seal" and the "Blue Seal" and "Green Seal" combined. The socioeconomic variables turned out to be not significant in consumer choice.

The prevailing neo-liberal economic concept in the EC which primarily wants to demolish borders and bureaucratic obstacles in order to establish a <b>large</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> is leading to a progressive integration of Europe. The recent development of polarisation and specialisation of main cities and urban agglomerations has consequences to the future urban system in Europe.

Models of best practice are sought for the above mentioned developments. This led to an initiatve by the Federal Chamber of Labour as a local agent in 1994 : A new model of regional cooperation for the Vienna Region was introduced. It proposes a bottom up strategy of policy making by demanding participation concepts inviting all local and regional agents and experts, institutionalized as well as voluntarily organized groups.

40|$|What is ‘the’ EU <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> as economists see it? The present BEER paper {{attempts}} to survey and help readers understand various ‘economic’ {{approaches to the}} <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> idea. The paper starts with a conceptual discussion of what ‘the’ <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> is (in an economic perspective). Six different economic meanings of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> are presented, with the sixth one being the economic benchmark in an ideal setting. Subsequently, the question is asked what the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> (i. e. its proper functioning) is good for. Put differently, the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> in the EU Treaty is a means, but a means to what? Beyond the typical economic growth objectives of the Rome Treaty (still valid today, with some qualifications), other Treaty objectives have emerged. Economists typically think in means-end relationships and the instrumental role of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> for Treaty objectives is far from clear. The ‘new’ Commission <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> strategy of 2007 proposes a more goal-oriented <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> policy. Such a vision is more selective in picking intermediate objectives to which ‘the’ <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> should be instrumental, but it risks to ignore the major deficits in today’s internal market: services and labour! The means-end relationships get even more problematic once one begins to scrutinise all the socio-economic objectives of the current (Amsterdam/Nice) Treaty or still other intermediate objectives. The <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> (explicitly including the relevant common regulation) then becomes a ‘jack of all trades’ for the environment, {{a high level of}} social protection, innovation or ‘Social Europe’. These means/ends relationships often are ill-specified. The final section considers the future of the <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> by distinguishing three strategies: incremental strategies (including the new <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> strategy of November 2007); the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> as the core of the Economic Union serving the ‘proper functioning of the monetary union’; and deepening and widening of the <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> as justified by the functional subsidiarity test. Even though the latter two would seem to be preferable from an economic point of view, they currently lack political legitimacy and are therefore unlikely to be pursued in the near future...|$|R
