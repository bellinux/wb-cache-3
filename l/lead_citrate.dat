40|$|Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+-ATPase) is an {{integral}} protein usually located in the basolateral membrane [1, 2] that actively pumps Na+ out and K+ in to the cell, through ATP hydrolysis [3]. The activity of Na+,K+-ATPase {{is essential for the}} existence of water and solute transport by epithelial cells [4, 5]. Measurement of Na+,K+-ATPase activity is usually done by biochemical assays. Cytochemical methods [6] allow cellular enzyme localization and may offer an alternative approach for determination of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in disrupted cells. We have used a cytochemical method, based on measurements of inorganic phosphate generated during ATP hydrolysis by ATPases during the incubation period and precipitated by a <b>lead</b> ammonium <b>citrate</b> acetate complex (LACA) as lead phosphate [Pb 3 (PO 4) 2]. The colorless lead phosphate was converted into a brown precipitate of lead sulphide (PbS) by treatment with ammonium sulphide.

40|$|A highly {{accurate}} and reliable screening method for enantiomeric excess of amine derivatives {{in the presence}} of water is reported. The fluorescence-based screening system has been realized by self-assembly of chiral diol-type dyes (BINOL, VANOL and VAPOL), 2 -formylphenylboronic acid, and chiral amines forming iminoboronate esters. The structure and chirality of the amine analytes determine the stability of the diastereomeric iminoboronate esters, which in turn display differential fluorescence. The fluorescence signal reflects the enantiomeric purity of the chiral amines and was utilized in high-throughput arrays. The arrays were able to recognize enantiomeric excess of amines, amino esters, and amino alcohols. In addition to qualitative analysis, quantitative experiments were successfully performed. Studies of the role of additives such as water or citrate were carried out to gain insight into the stability of the iminoboronate esters. It is shown that the above additives destabilize less stable esters while the stable esters remain unchanged. Thus, the presence of water and <b>citrate</b> <b>leads</b> to increased difference between the diastereomeric iminoboronates and contributes to the enantiodiscrimination of the chiral amines...|$|R

40|$|Various {{conformational}} {{forms of}} the archetypal serpin human alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1 PI), including ordered polymers, active and inactive monomers, and heterogeneous aggregates, have been produced by refolding from mild denaturing conditions. These forms presumably originate by different folding pathways during renaturation, {{under the influence of}} the A and C sheets of the molecule. Because alpha 1 PI contains only two Trp residues, at positions 194 and 238, it is amenable to fluorescence quenching resolved spectra and red-edge excitation measurements of the Trp environment. Thus, it is possible to define the conformation of the various forms based on the observed fluorescent properties of each of the Trp residues measured under a range of conditions. We show that denaturation in GuHCl, or thermal denaturation in Tris, followed by renaturation, leads to the formation of polymers that contain solvent-exposed Trp 238, which we interpret as ordered head-to-tail polymers (A-sheet polymers). However, thermal denaturation in <b>citrate</b> <b>leads</b> to shorter polymers where some of the Trp 238 residues are not solvent accessible, which we interpret as polymers capped by head-to-head interactions via the C sheet. The latter treatment also generates monomers thought to represent a latent form, but in which the environment of Trp 238 is occluded by ionized groups. These data indicate that the folding pathway of alpha 1 PI, and presumably other serpins, is sensitive to solvent composition that affects the affinity of the reactive site loop for the A sheet or the C sheet...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the nature of}} the precursor and the amount used is investigated in the preparation of MoO 3 catalysts supported on a mesoporous silica by a wet impregnation method. Four precursors are compared: ammonium heptamolybdate, peroxopolymolybdate, a citrate complex of MO and an oxalate complex of Mo. The MoO 3 loading is adjusted between 0 and 2 theoretical monolayers of MoO 3. Characterization of the samples was performed by N- 2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with as main objective the evaluation of the dispersion of MoO 3 on the silica and of the morphology of MoO 3 crystallites eventually obtained. At low loadings, MoO 3 appears as amorphous material remaining at the outer surface of the silica. At high loadings, MoO 3 appears as molybdite crystals. The loading above which MoO 3 crystals are obtained depends on the precursor used. The morphology of MoO 3 crystals, when obtained, also depends on the precursor used. Isotropic crystals are obtained with Mo oxalate and peroxopolymolybdate while Mo <b>citrate</b> <b>leads</b> to crystals with largely developed basal faces. Ammonium heptamolybdate leads to crystals with an intermediate morphology.

40|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} of lead salts (1, 2) and saturated solutions of lead hydroxide (1) {{have been}} used as stains to enhance the electron-scattering properties of components of biological materials examined in the electron microscope. Saturated solutions of lead hydroxide (1), while staining more intensely than either lead acetate or monobasic lead acetate (l, 2), form insoluble lead carbonate upon exposure to air. The avoidance of such precipitates which contaminate surfaces of sections during staining has been the stimulus for the development of elaborate procedures for exclusion of air or carbon dioxide (3, 4). Several modifications of Watson's lead hydroxide stain (1) have recently appeared (5 - 7). All utilize relatively high pH (approximately 12) and one contains small amounts of tartrate (6), a relatively weak complexing agent (8), in addition to lead. These modified lead stains are less liable to contaminate the surface of the section with precipitated stain products. The stain reported here differs from previous alkaline lead stains in that the chelating agent, citrate, is in sufficient excess to sequester all lead present. <b>Lead</b> <b>citrate,</b> soluble in high concentrations in basic solutions, is a chelate compound with an apparent association constant (log Ka) between ligand and lead ion of 6. 5 (9).

The tri-carboxylic acid citrate, which is secreted into the apoplast by both bacterial pathogens and plant hosts has previously been shown to increase the virulence of the gram negative pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC 3000 (Pst DC 3000), by acting both as a chemoattractant and as an inducer of genes associated with the type III secretion system (T 3 SS) and phytotoxin production. The effect of citrate on the host is less clear, though microarray analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana has demonstrated that application of exogenous <b>citrate</b> <b>leads</b> to the differential expression of 1876 genes suggesting that it might act as a metabolic signal for transcriptional reprogramming. In this study, functional enrichment analysis revealed statistically significant enrichment for gene ontology terms associated with defence in both citrate up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets.

When too much acid builds up, the muscle 2 ̆ 7 s contraction process is disrupted, which limits an athlete from achieving optimal performance.
