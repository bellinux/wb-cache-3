5|$|First {{described}} by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763, the red-throated loon is a monotypic species, with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range. Pontoppidan initially placed the {{species in the}} now-defunct genus Colymbus, which contained grebes as well as loons. By 1788, German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera, and moved the red-throated loon (along with all other loon species) to its present genus. Its relationship to the four other loons is complex; although all {{belong to the same}} genus, it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology, behaviour, ecology and breeding biology, and may be the basal <b>lineage</b> <b>of</b> the genus. It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic, and then to have expanded into the Nearctic. Analysis of molecular data together with the fossil record suggests the <b>lineage</b> <b>of</b> the red-throated loon diverged from that giving rise to the other loon species around 21.4 million years ago in the Miocene. It is also most closely related to the fossil Pliocene species Gavia howardae.|$|E

5|$|Good {{evidence}} exists for {{the appearance of}} gastropods (e.g. Aldanella), cephalopods (e.g. Plectronoceras, ?Nectocaris) and bivalves (Pojetaia, Fordilla) towards {{the middle of the}} Cambrian period, c. , though arguably each of these may belong only to the stem <b>lineage</b> <b>of</b> their respective classes. However, the evolutionary history both of the emergence of molluscs from the ancestral group Lophotrochozoa, and of their diversification into the well-known living and fossil forms, is still vigorously debated.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct <b>lineage</b> <b>of</b> hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving <b>lineage</b> <b>of</b> theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E

2500|$|Part of the {{solution}} seems that the delicate rasborines are the core group, consisting <b>of</b> minor <b>lineages</b> that have not shifted far from their evolutionary niche, or have coevolved for millions of years.

50|$|Several <b>lineages</b> <b>of</b> modern birds existed, {{though many}} were <b>of</b> <b>lineages</b> that {{differed}} profoundly from their relatives of today {{and thus are}} not their ancestors, but became extinct in the Cenozoic. For example, Vegavis iaai indicates that at least four <b>lineages</b> <b>of</b> Anseriformes were distinct: Anhimidae, Anatidae, Anseranatidae and Presbyornithidae (and possibly Dromornithidae), {{and that there was}} at least one Galliformes lineage too, and apparently the Gastornithiformes were also distinct. It is also highly likely that there was at least one, and probably several, <b>lineages</b> <b>of</b> Charadriiformes, that penguins were about to split from their closest relatives or had already done so, and that if the Metaves are a valid group they would presumably have been distinct too. Also, paleognaths were of course long distinct from neognaths.|$|R
