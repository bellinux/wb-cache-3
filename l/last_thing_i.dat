The most well known example is My Bed, where she displayed her bed. Another instance is the removal of her beach hut from Whitstable to be displayed in a gallery. This work was titled The <b>Last</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Said To You Is Don't Leave Me Here (The Hut) (1999).|$|E

Asked on June 19, 2016, on Meet the Press about his support for Donald Trump, Ryan said [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to see happen is another Democrat in the White House."

[...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want any of you to think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E

Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to do was to}} defend those peckerwoods.

500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> think of every night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E

Saddington defended her writing with [...] "Obviously some people can't face reality".

James' vocals on Duke Ellington and Paul Francis Webster's [...] "I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)" [...] are [...] "barely audible" [...] as she sings [...] "... I... can't... live without him." [...] "I Got It Bad" [...] is {{followed}} by a cover of John Frederick Coots and Haven Gillespie's 1933 popular song [...] "You Go to My Head". Mike Finnigan performs the Hammond organ solo on [...] "A Sunday Kind of Love" [...] and throughout the album, filling the gap between blues and jazz music. Closing the album are Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin's [...] "If It's the <b>Last</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>I</b> Do", and Alice Cooper's [...] "Only Women Bleed".

The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about [...] "reppin' that Third", a reference to the Third Ward area located in Houston.|$|E
500|$|The pair {{wrote the}} song, while {{longtime}} producer Scott Hendricks handled the production. It portrays a midtempo, country pop crossover duet. Shelton believed that writing his own music had [...] "been a great channel {{for him to}} vent and celebrate his tumultuous year". Rolling Stone stated that Shelton and Stefani [...] " [...] gush about their relationship in the press too much, as they [...] to keep some semblance of privacy. Instead, they wrote a song about it." [...] Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly claimed that [...] "Go Ahead and Break My Heart" [...] served as the parent album's [...] "gossipy framing" [...] for [...] "offer a simultaneous spit-in-the-face and [...] to their exes". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed, finding Shelton [...] "embracing his {{new lease on life}} with renewed vigor and a new a love", who Erlewine later claimed was Stefani. The lyrics of the recording delve on Stefani's insecurities in a relationship that [...] "will likely have its shares of ups and downs": [...] "I'm so scared, I don't know what to do". Additionally, she explains in the lyrics how the two artists met: [...] "I never ever meant to get so into you / Thought I was using you just to get me through" [...] and [...] "You know I'm broken, I don't trust anymore / <b>Last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> needed was to fall in love".|$|E

500|$|Mitchell and Webb's {{next project}} came in 2003, with {{starring}} {{roles in the}} Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy Usbourne respectively. The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC; they had an old script {{that they wanted to}} revive and Mitchell and Webb helped out, with it eventually evolving into Peep Show. Despite low viewing figures (which almost got the show cancelled after series three) the show was received to wide critical acclaim. The British Sitcom Guide called it [...] "without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade." [...] Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, which I thought was the best sitcom since Father Ted". The BBC hailed Mitchell's performance in the series, citing that [...] "As Mark Corrigan, David reached out to all those middle-aged men in a twentysomething's body, who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all." [...] Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he [...] "agrees with many of [...] opinions." [...] Peep Show has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.|$|E
500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E
500|$|As the {{acoustic}} tour made Grohl realize [...] "we were making music worth listening to, rather than music made for pummelling the person next to you" [...] {{he decided to}} give more importance to the lyrics and [...] "have a connection with the crowd in front of us", considering that among the many compositions the band made on pre-production [...] "the ones that stand out {{are the ones that}} say something". So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> want to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

[...] The author says in her publisher's newsletter: [...] "The greatest recommendation I can give is that Richard, its first reader, thought it wonderful. He devoured chunks, demanding ‘Bringmore story!’ even when he was in hospital. One of the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> was ever able to tell him was that Rebels and Traitors was to be published by Random House, so I would be working with dear friends for his favourite book." ...|$|R
