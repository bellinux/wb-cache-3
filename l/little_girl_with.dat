25|$|In Chapter 25, Lamb meets a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> her {{broken leg}} {{in a cast}} who spends the day looking {{out of the window}} at the neighbours, whom she has given fanciful {{descriptive}} names. The inspiration for this plot device is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, a nod to a classic. In the same chapter, the little girl refers to a neighbour called Miss Bulstrode, though it seems unlikely that the character is the same Miss Bulstrode from Cat Among the Pigeons.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} five monologues collectively titled Tutta casa, letto e chiesa (All House, Bed and Church) also first {{appeared}} in 1977, and were performed by Rame. The first, Il risveglio (Waking Up), featured a working-class mother talking to her baby (a doll). Una donna tutta sola (A Woman Alone) was about a housewife locked indoors by her husband who {{had to deal with}} a crying baby while fighting off the advances of his crippled, wheelchair-bound, pornographic-film-obsessed brother, a man with a telescope, an obscene telephone caller and a former teacher who has fallen in love with her. La mamma fricchettona (Freak Mother) featured a mother taking shelter in a church confessional after leaving her family to pursue drugs and free love. The Same Old Story features a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> a doll who swears. The final monologue, Medea, based on an Italian version rather than the more famous Euripides version, had been performed in 35 countries by 1990.|$|E

A second-grader at the time, according to her mother, Peggy, she did her homework and took a nap before appearing at the scheduled match. In advertisements for the match, Balukas was billed as [...] "the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards." [...] She was described by a reporter present as [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> honey-blond hair...wearing a short yellow dress and green leotards...who resembles a young Shirley Temple."

500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, and I think I stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
500|$|Kapadia {{once said}} she had always had {{aspirations}} to become an actress {{when she was a}} child, calling herself [...] "film-crazy". She was introduced by Raj Kapoor in his 1973 teen romance Bobby. While the film was to be Kapoor's son Rishi Kapoor's first leading role, Kapadia was given the title role of Bobby Braganza, a middle-class Goan Christian girl. The story follows how Bobby falls in love with Raj (Rishi), the son of a wealthy businessman, and how the two face the disapproval of their parents. Bobby was a major mainstream and critical success, and Kapadia was lauded for her performance, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (tied with Jaya Bhaduri for Abhimaan). In later years Kapadia would credit Raj Kapoor for her development as an actress: [...] "the sum total of me today as an actress, whatever I am, is Raj Kapoor." [...] Several of her lines in the film became popular, particularly, [...] "Mujhse dosti karoge?" [...] ("Will you be my friend?"). In 2008, Rediff.com ranked her performance in the film as the fourth-best female debut of all-time in Hindi cinema: [...] "An elfin <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> big, lovely eyes, nobody quite portrayed innocence as memorably as Dimple in her first outing. She was candid, striking, and a true natural... here was a girl who would redefine glamour and grace, and make it look very, very easy indeed." [...] Following the success of the film, Kapadia's modern wardrobe and hairstyle in Bobby, consisting of [...] "knotted polka-dotted blouse and earphone hairstyle", made her a youth fashion icon of the times in India. Consequently polka-dotted dresses were often referred to as 'Bobby Print'. Bhawana Somaaya of The Hindu credits Kapadia as starting film memorabilia merchandising in India. Mukesh Khosla of The Tribune reported that Bobby established her as a [...] "cult figure" [...] as she led the fashion trends. Kapadia had married actor Rajesh Khanna in March 1973 at the age of 16 and eight months later her debut film released. She left the film industry to raise her children.|$|E

2500|$|Many leading Italian {{artists in}} other genre, also {{produced}} some still-life paintings. In particular, Caravaggio applied his influential form of naturalism to still life. His Basket of Fruit (c. 1595–1600) {{is one of}} the first examples of pure still life, precisely rendered and set at eye level. Though not overtly symbolic, this painting was owned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo and may have been appreciated for both religious and aesthetic reasons. Jan Bruegel painted his Large Milan Bouquet (1606) for the cardinal, as well, claiming that he painted it 'fatta tutti del natturel' (made all from nature) and he charged extra for the extra effort. These were among many still-life paintings in the cardinal’s collection, in addition to his large collection of curios. Among other Italian still life, Bernardo Strozzi’s The Cook is a [...] "kitchen scene" [...] in the Dutch manner, which is both a detailed portrait of a cook and the game birds she is preparing. In a similar manner, one of Rembrandt’s rare still-life paintings, <b>Little</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>with</b> Dead Peacocks combines a similar sympathetic female portrait with images of game birds.|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{described}} her childhood as [...] "very happy". She {{was surrounded by}} a series of strong and independent women from an early age. Her time was spent alternating between her home in Devon, her step-grandmother and aunt's house in Ealing, West London, and parts of Southern Europe, where her family would holiday during the winter. Agatha was raised in a household with various esoteric beliefs and, like her siblings, believed that her mother Clara was a psychic with the ability of second sight. Her mother insisted that she receive a home education, and so her parents were responsible for teaching her to read and write {{and to be able to}} perform basic arithmetic, a subject that she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her about music, and she learned to play both the piano and the mandolin. According to biographer Laura Thomson, Clara believed that Agatha should not learn to read till she was eight. However, due to her curiosity, Agatha taught herself to read much earlier. One of the first known photographs of Christie (now a part of the Christie family's heirlooms) depicts her as a <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> her first dog, whom she called George Washington.|$|E

2500|$|Mary Small (May 10, 1922 [...] February 27, 2007) was a {{prominent}} singing personality during the Golden Age of Radio and hosted her own broadcasts for 14 consecutive years across all major networks.

[...] In addition to being an established recording artist, [...] she was a published author [...] and performed on film, television [...] and Broadway [...] during her career. She was the first singer to be widely promoted as The <b>Little</b> <b>Girl</b> <b>With</b> The Big Voice, a moniker likely adopted by her first manager Ed Wolfe that was marketed in the Fleischer Brothers' Love Thy Neighbor, distributed by Paramount Pictures in 1934.

2500|$|On {{the review}} {{aggregator}} Metacritic, the film {{had an average}} score of 25 out of 100, based on 32 reviews from professional critics. At Rotten Tomatoes, 22% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 122 reviews. The film earned generally negative reviews from movie critics, although some praised Lopez's performance. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said Lopez [...] "holds the screen in a star performance that {{has less to do}} with acting than with embodying a forceful, streetwise woman who stands up for herself", while commenting that its preview had [...] "audience gasping" [...] and [...] "Enough does a better job than most movies of sustaining a mood of palpable physical menace, then confirming your worst fears". On the other hand, Alice King of Entertainment Weekly described the film's plot as [...] "arduously nonsensical" [...] and felt that Lopez lacked connection with her on-screen daughter Tessa Allen, commenting that: [...] "All this to protect a helium-voiced <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> <b>with</b> whom Lopez has so little chemistry, it's as if she's handling garbage rather than a small child." [...] A writer from Contactmusic.com was underwhelmed with the development of the film, noting that the film doesn't [...] "utilize Slim's old friend and romantic interest enough, nor does it develop Slim's real and adopted fathers" [...] while it [...] "uses the tiresome old [...] "kid" [...] cliché. Gracie is, as always, just old enough to understand the situation, but not quite old enough to make an actual impact in the story." [...] However, the writer did praise Lopez in the end sequence, [...] "By the final scenes, despite their obviousness, I was as engrossed in the movie as I could have been, actually rooting for J. Lo to kick some bad guy butt". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: [...] "Lopez has an image of being sexy and tough, but her appeal as an actress is that she's down to earth and that her emotions are accessible. There's nothing cold about her." [...] Additionally, LaSalle felt that [...] "It's the most tension-producing movie out there right now", stating that [...] "it has the biggest visceral kick, capable of inspiring blood lust in otherwise peaceful viewers.|$|E
