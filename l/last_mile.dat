5|$|Tracy first {{discovered}} his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He {{spent seven years}} in the theatre, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in The <b>Last</b> <b>Mile</b> {{caught the attention of}} Hollywood. After a successful film debut in Up the River, Tracy was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation. His five years with Fox were unremarkable, and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films, most of them starring Tracy as the leading man. None of them were hits although The Power and the Glory (1933) features one of his most acclaimed performances.|$|E

40|$|From our desk chairs {{it may be}} {{tempting to}} work up an idea, build a quick prototype, test it in a lab, and say, “Our work here is done; the rest is merely details. ” More {{scholarly}} knowledge awaits discovery, however, by researchers who shepherd an information systems (IS) solution through the <b>last</b> research <b>mile,</b> that is, through successful transition to the workplace. Going the <b>last</b> research <b>mile</b> means using scientific knowledge and methods to address important unsolved classes of problems for real people with real stakes in the outcomes. The <b>last</b> research <b>mile</b> proceeds in three stages: proof-of-concept research to demonstrate the functional feasibility of a solution; proof-of-value research to investigate whether a solution can create value {{across a variety of}} conditions; and proof-of-use research to address complex issues of operational feasibility. The <b>last</b> research <b>mile</b> ends only when practitioners routinely use a solution in the field. We argue that going the <b>last</b> research <b>mile</b> negates the assumption that one must trade off rigor and relevance, showing it to be it a false dilemma. Systems researchers who take their solutions through the <b>last</b> research <b>mile</b> may ultimately have the greatest impact on science and society. We demonstrate the <b>last</b> research <b>mile</b> with cases from our own work and the work of others spanning more than forty years...|$|R

25|$|The {{ceremony}} {{began with}} a race between the track-layers and crews from the eastern and western ends of construction. The <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> had been left unfinished and each crew was timed to see who could complete their last half mile the fastest. The eastern crew won {{by a margin of}} only a few minutes and then the western crew placed the last rail.|$|E

This was due in part to the influences of his flying instructor, Sammy Mason, Mason's son Pete, and Barbara herself. McQueen attended his local church, Ventura Missionary Church, and was visited by evangelist Billy Graham shortly before his death.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{after his}} {{impressive}} appearance as the seething and desperate character Killer Mears in the Los Angeles stage production of The <b>Last</b> <b>Mile,</b> Gable {{was offered a}} contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. His first role in a sound picture was as the unshaven villain in a low-budget William Boyd Western called The Painted Desert (1931).

25|$|In December 2012, Hiriko and Deutsche Bahn {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} start a carsharing pilot program in Germany in 2013 to integrate the Hiriko Fold into Deutsche Bahn's railway service to allow their customers {{the possibility of using}} a vehicle parked at the station with which to complete the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> of the journey to their final destinations. The electric car sharing system is called eFlinkster, and Deutsche Bahn operates several of such car sharing fleets. The agreement also included an initial phase in 2013 in which the Hiriko folding was to be tested and adapted for public use in Berlin, and an official and broader roll out was planned for 2014.|$|E

Alternating albums of new and repackaged material would follow, until all the early Prestige material was now available in the new format.|$|R
25|$|Prefontaine set the American {{record in}} the 5000 meters at the 1972 Olympic Trials in Eugene on July 9. An underdog at the 1972 Olympics in Munich in September, Prefontaine {{took the lead in}} the 5,000 m final during the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> and ended the slow pace of the first two miles, {{negative}} splitting the race. In second place {{at the start of the}} bell lap, he fell back to third with 200 meters to go. Lasse Virén took the lead in the final turn over silver medalist Mohammed Gammoudi. Prefontaine ran out of gas with 30 meters to go as Britain's hard-charging Ian Stewart caught him from behind and moved into third place within ten meters of the finish, depriving Prefontaine of an Olympic bronze medal.|$|E
25|$|Heavy caliber rifled cannon {{which the}} Federals needed to reduce Pulaski had arrived nearby in February, {{at which time}} Gillmore decided to locate the {{batteries}} at the northwestern tip of Tybee Island nearest the fort. By March, Gillmore was offloading siege materiel onto Tybee Island. Roads had to be laid down, gun emplacements excavated, magazines and bomb-proofs constructed. As the work progressed southwesterly nearing the Fort, in the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> the Union troops came under fire from the Fort’s Confederate gunners. A ranging shot said to be aimed by Colonel Olmstead himself cut a Union soldier in two. The following bombardment from elevated fort guns effected mortar barrages that forced all construction to proceed on Tybee Island by night. Each morning the uncompleted elements of siege construction were camouflaged against the fort's spotters.|$|E
25|$|The BlackBerry PIN (Personal Identification Number) is an eight-character {{hexadecimal}} {{identification number}} {{assigned to each}} BlackBerry device. PINs cannot be changed manually on the device (though BlackBerry technicians are able to reset or update a PIN server-side), and are locked to each specific BlackBerry. BlackBerry devices can message each other using the PIN directly or by using the BlackBerry Messenger application. BlackBerry PINs are tracked by BlackBerry Enterprise Servers and the BlackBerry Internet Service and are used to direct messages to a BlackBerry device. Emails and any other messages, such as those from the BlackBerry Push Service, are typically directed to a BlackBerry device's PIN. The message can then be routed by a RIM Network Operations Center, and sent to a carrier, which will deliver the message the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> to the device. In September 2012 RIM announced that the BlackBerry PIN would be replaced by users' BlackBerry ID starting in 2013 with {{the launch of the}} BlackBerry 10 platform.|$|E
2500|$|The DL-109s {{eventually}} ran their <b>last</b> <b>miles</b> in {{the late}} 1950s in local commuter service around Boston. [...] One special unit was retained through the 1960s in Boston as a power plant; PP-716 was converted to produce power for a test third rail in Boston. Eventually PP-716 became the last DL-109 {{on the face of}} the Earth and fell to the scrappers torch under the Penn Central at Dover Street Yard, in June 1969.|$|R

50|$|The {{waterway}} {{carries the}} 100-year flood run-off. It {{centers on the}} new grass-lined Antelope Creek waterway. To create the channel, the Corps of Engineers designed and managed a 'big dig'--miles in length. Water flows North into the larger Salt Creek. Aside from providing the channeling complex for the <b>last</b> <b>miles</b> of the creek, the waterway connects on the South directly with Antelope Creek as it flows from Holmes Lake to the Southeast.|$|R
25|$|Waugh {{had walked}} in amidst loud ovation, and his arrival was widely anticipated. However, he {{immediately}} got into trouble, when, Martyn punched a ball through covers, {{and then ran}} two for it. Waugh then backed up for a third run, but Martyn pleaded to him emphatically enough to ignore the run. However, by the time Waugh did heed the call, {{it was too late}} for him to turn around. Martyn then sacrificed his wicket for his captain's. He was run out by Harbhajan Singh's throw from the deep, which Parthiv Patel took and whipped off the bails. However, the strangeness of the dismissal was accentuated by the fact that the ball was a no-ball. Waugh could not redeem himself as he got out shortly to a short ball by Zaheer Khan, and while trying to negotiate a ball from Zaheer, overbalanced and trod on his stumps. This dismissal gave him the dubious distinction of being the only man to be dismissed in every way possible in cricket, barring obstructing the field and timed out. Referring to his failure and the unfortunate mix-up between him and Damien Martyn, Greg Chappell mentioned in an interview that Waugh's <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> was going to be uphill from then. Waugh's dismissal brought the score down to 275/5.|$|E
25|$|New {{management}} came to {{both the}} lime plant and the railroad in 1976. The plant was bought by Domtar, while the Bellefonte Central was sold to Kyle Railways. Prospects still appeared reasonable for the railroad, as the plant at Chemical (bought by Domtar in 1976) had an extensive customer base. Most of the lime produced there went to steel mills in Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. Ground lime was also shipped to glass manufacturers, and to chemical and paper companies. However, the Pennsylvania steel industry soon began to falter {{under the pressure of}} foreign competition and its own inefficiencies. As the steel industry fell, the lime market also collapsed, and Domtar shut down the plant at Chemical on July 1, 1982. The Bellefonte Central shut down the same day. The Chemical plant was sold in April 1983 to Confer Trucking, a local firm, which operated it at reduced capacity and had no need for rail service. Accordingly, the Bellefonte Central filed for abandonment in 1984. The 4.1miles (6.6km) from Chemical to Coleville were removed in spring 1985. However, the <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> of track from Bellefonte to Coleville was bought by the SEDA-COG Joint Rail Authority, in order {{to make use of the}} enginehouse at Coleville. This track is now part of the Nittany and Bald Eagle Railroad, and the old Bellefonte Central enginehouse is now used for their locomotives. About a mile of the right-of-way on the grounds of The Arboretum at Penn State has been converted to a rail trail, which was opened on May 22, 2006.|$|E
500|$|In January 1930, Tracy was {{approached}} {{about a new}} play called The <b>Last</b> <b>Mile.</b> Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row, producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy, and later recounted: [...] "beneath the surface, {{here was a man}} of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part." [...] The <b>Last</b> <b>Mile</b> opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls. The Commonweal described him as [...] "one of our best and most versatile young actors". The play was a hit with critics, and ran for 289 performances.|$|E
