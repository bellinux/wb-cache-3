5|$|Sega {{producer}} Mac Senour {{was responsible}} for the Menacer project and designed the six-game pack. He originally proposed non-shooting minigames based on existing Sega licenses <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> Montana, David Robinson, and ToeJam & Earl, but most of the prototypes were abandoned due to high cost in favor of more shooting-type games. Sega did not plan another first-party release for the Menacer apart from the included multicart. Compatible games were published through 1995.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Thirteen Colonies of the {{original}} United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of {{the original}} material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the Shakers emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as {{the music of the}} Amish, the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.|$|E

(The large majority of Irish MPs did not vote, having transferred their allegiance elsewhere).|$|E
25|$|The IRA is not {{the only}} secret, death-dealing agent in our midst. Secret agents of the state have a veneer of respectability on its dark deeds which disguises its work of corruption. They work {{secretly}} in dark places unseen, seeking little victims <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> whom they can crush and manipulate for their own purposes. Their actions too corrupt the cause they purport to serve.|$|E
25|$|The R.A. 9211 also restricts {{advertising}} on public vehicles like taxis, bus {{and even the}} PNR, MRT and the LRT (buses, MRT and the LRT are most common with wrap advertising) and also banned cartoon characters in tobacco advertising that might affect children (<b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> Camel, which was popular in the U.S. and in European countries before it was banned; it is still unclear if this cartoon character went into advertising in the Philippines before the R.A. 9211 was passed). The law also prevents celebrities from endorsing tobacco products in advertising; prior to the R.A. 9211, actors Richard Gomez and the late Rudy Fernandez had promoted a cigarette brand.|$|E

25|$|However, {{following}} an injury during a training {{mission in the}} Cursed Earth, Rico began to become more aggressive, underhanded, and determined to prove himself better than Joe. After graduation, Rico began engaging in criminal activities, including extortion, assault and racketeering. Joe suspected {{that this was the}} result of exposure to radiation when Rico was injured on a training mission in the Cursed Earth. Rico himself had considered this in his early years but discounted it. In his opinion, Justice Department was itself a corrupt, absurd agency and this meant it didn't matter if he lined his own pockets. He considered it a farce that the 'good' judges <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> were using just as much brutality as he did.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
500|$|While Joe busies {{himself with}} his Ph.D. dissertation, he {{encourages}} Rennie to teach Jake horseback riding. [...] During their rides, Rennie and Jake talk at length about the Morgans' unusual relationship. [...] After returning from one such outing, Jake encourages a resistant Rennie to spy on her husband. [...] She is convinced that [...] "real people" [...] <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> are not [...] "any different when they are alone"; such people have [...] "o mask. What you see of them is authentic." [...] What Rennie sees of Joe while spying disorients her and her vision of him—he masturbates, picks his nose, makes faces, and sputters gibberish syllables to himself.|$|E

50|$|Reciprocity is {{not only}} a strong {{determining}} factor of human behavior; it is a powerful method for gaining one's compliance with a request. The rule of reciprocity has the power to trigger feelings of indebtedness even when faced with an uninvited favor and irrespective of liking the person who executed the favor. In 1971, Dennis Regan tested the strength of these two aspects of reciprocity in a study where participants believed they were in an art appreciation experiment with a partner, Joe, who was really Regan's assistant. During the experiment, Joe would disappear and bring back a soft drink for the participant. After this phase of the experiment was over, Joe would ask the participant to buy raffle tickets from him. The more the participants <b>liked</b> <b>Joe,</b> the more likely they were to buy raffle tickets from him. However, when Joe had given them a soda and thus indebted them to reciprocate, it made no difference whether the participants <b>liked</b> <b>Joe</b> or not, the rule of reciprocity overpowered liking. Thus, individuals who we might not even like have the power to greatly increase our chances of doing them a favor simply by providing us with a small gift or favor prior to their request. Furthermore, we are obliged to receive these gifts and favors which reduces our ability to choose to whom we wish to be indebted.|$|R

We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great.

You know, there's no mind-boggling lyrics or twists in the story - they just come directly from the heart. And to me 'Just The Way You Are' is one of those songs. There's nothing mind-blowing about it. I'm just telling a woman she looks beautiful the way she IS - and, let's be honest, what woman doesn't wanna hear those lyrics?!" ...|$|E

Additionally, Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Givens contributed as the layout artist for the storyboards. The show's official theme song was written by Hoyt Curtin, who also served as the series' music composer. Other than the main cast, frequent Hanna-Barbera voice actors Janet Waldo, Joan Gerber, Lennie Weinrib, Hal Smith and Vic Perrin played several minor characters for the show. A group of five writers wrote for Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch!, including Joel Kane, Heywood Kling, Howard Morgenstern, Joe Ruby, and Ken Spears. Despite Stephenson ultimately {{playing the role of}} Mr. Peevly, Barbera had intended for Joe Flynn to play the part since the character was based on Flynn's Captain Binghampton from McHale's Navy; however, when Flynn came into audition for the part, Barbera was unimpressed and cast Stephenson for the part instead. Barbera claimed [...] "that Joe Flynn didn't sound enough <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> Flynn." ...|$|E

500|$|The Detroit Pistons are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Auburn Hills, Michigan. They {{play in the}} Central Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team, owned by Tom Gores, plays its home games at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The franchise was founded in 1941 by Fred Zollner as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, playing in the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1948, the team was renamed to the Fort Wayne Pistons and joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which merged with the NBL to become the NBA a year later. After spending nine seasons in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Zollner moved the team to Detroit, Michigan in 1957 {{to be able to}} compete financially with other big city teams. In the 1980s, general manager Jack McCloskey was instrumental in the Pistons' future championship runs by drafting Isiah Thomas, acquiring key players <b>like</b> <b>Joe</b> Dumars and Dennis Rodman and hiring head coach Chuck Daly. The 1980s team, known today as [...] "the Bad Boys" [...] due to the physical playing style, eventually won two championships in the 1989 and 1990 NBA Finals under Daly. The Pistons won their third title in the 2004 NBA Finals under the tenure of Larry Brown.|$|E

The restaurant becomes a huge success among handicapped customers, but Peter is disappointed that {{what was supposed to be}} a cool restaurant has become a [...] "cafeteria at the veterans hospital," [...] and did not want to take the profits for granted. Angered, Peter bans them from entering with a [...] "no shirt, no shoes, no legs, no service" [...] policy. Joe is perplexed why Peter would turn away loyal paying customers, much less a good friend <b>like</b> <b>Joe,</b> but Peter stubbornly refuses to allow handicapped customers. In response, the handicapped unite into a giant robot known as [...] "CrippleTron", which begins attacking the restaurant while Peter, Chris and Stewie are on the roof. Stewie eventually takes matters into his own hands and defeats CrippleTron, which falls on Peter, breaking one of his legs. After being taken to the hospital, Peter needs to use a wheelchair for two weeks while his broken leg heals. Peter apologizes to Joe, who accepts his apology on the basis that he is glad to see Peter understand the difficulties of being disabled and that he does not want to continue holding a grudge against Peter. The two make amends, and things go back to the way they were and Peter closes down the restaurant.|$|E
