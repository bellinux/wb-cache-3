50|$|Depending on the shopper {{response}} to an out-of-stock, manufacturer and retailer incur various losses. Both manufacturer and retailer face a direct loss of the potential sale when a consumer faces an out-of-stock because the shopper purchases the item at another store or does not purchase it at all. Additionally, when a substitution is made, the retailer also loses an additional portion of the potential sale because the shopper tends to switch to smaller and/or cheaper substitutes. In addition to the direct losses, both the retailer and the manufacturer incur additional indirect losses due to decreased customer satisfaction that results in less overall reliance on the particular retailers and brands. When an out-of-stock <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> at another store, this provides the consumer an opportunity to try a different store. Consumer behavior theory argues that trial precedes adoption, and, thus, an out-of-stock {{sets the stage for}} possible permanent store switching. When an out-of-stock <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> of a competing brand, the consumer trial can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> possible permanent brand switching as well. Research findings show that a typical retailer loses about 4 percent of sales due to having items out-of-stock. A loss of sales of 4 percent translates into an earnings per share loss of about $0.012 (1.2 cents) for the average firm in the grocery retailing sector, where the average earnings per share, already is about $0.25 (25 cents) per year.|$|R

This paper draws a link between symbolic and emotional communication by suggesting that fashion changes our internal feelings and that many of these emotions are expressed to others through symbols such as the clothes we wear. A conceptual framework is presented explaining the effects of clothing on an individual consumer. This framework classifies the fashion effect into internally and externally communicated meanings.

As more features are added to the products, the question is that: Is the more the better? It does not always be. The purpose of this research is to locate the consumer preference on multifunctional cosmetics.

In terms of brand value, consumers prefer cosmetics with more existing features or those have new feature. In terms of confidence level, consumers prefer cosmetics with fewer existing feature with detailed information on the new feature. The research help marketers better understand the preference of consumers on cosmetics and provide the insights for product management and development. When deciding how many features the product should have, people should understand the trade-off between brand value and confidence level, which is identified in the research. When considering whether to launch new feature to the existing products, people should understand that new feature contributes to the brand value but does not directly <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> intention.

40|$|Marketers are {{continuously}} {{searching for}} new ways to communicate better with their public and to understand consumers’ purchasing behavior. They tried to define and explain the consumer’s purchase process by using different models and applying various strategies for improving brand communication. One of the paths followed was the use of hierarchy of effects models. This paper describes the consumer’s purchase process by interpreting the AIDA Model in the context of online advergames. The stages of the process are explained based on the interaction established between a consumer and a brand during a game session when the player is exposed to advertising messages embedded in the advergame content. The general setup for the model interpretation is given by the online environment and the specific virtual interactivity of the Internet. Previous studies concerning advergames showed that this new communication tool can increase brand awareness, creates positive feelings toward brand and a general positive attitude which can <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> intention and actual sales. This paper can help advertisers to better understand how advergames work and presents, for each stage of the AIDA model, a series of elements which could be used for driving consumers through the communication funnel and to reach the final stage of the acquisition process...|$|E

Thus, the impact of mobile marketing is not yet fully exploited and in need of investigation to fully understand its potential.

Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore differences in advertising response between mobile marketing through applications and electronic mails. Research question: What differences can be identified in the consumer buying process when exposed to an offer trough the mobile marketing channel compared to the e-mail marketing channel? Method: We have implemented a qualitative and deductive study where we expose one sample for an offer coming from the mobile marketing channel and one sample exposed to an offer coming from the e-mail marketing channel. The thesis is of a comparative character and the selection is a non-probability sampling.

Its immeasurable amount of user-generated content serves as a platform for opinion leaders to take the stage and influence purchase decisions, and recommendations from peers and evidence of positive online experience all serve to help consumers make purchasing decisions. Gunawan and Huarng's 2015 study concluded that social influence is essential in framing attitudes towards brands, which in turn <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> <b>purchase</b> intention. Influencers form norms which their peers are found to follow, and targeting extroverted personalities increases chances of purchase even further. This is because the stronger personalities tend to be more engaged on consumer platforms and thus spread word of mouth information more efficiently. Many brands have begun to realise the importance of brand ambassadors and influencers, and it is being shown more clearly that herd behaviour can be used to drive sales and profits exponentially in favour of any brand through examination of these instances.|$|R

This on-going research considers the affections generated by con-sumers towards the chocolate brand which is endorsed by a celebrity. The Dual Mediation Hypoth-esis Model (DMH) is used to ascertain the ad effectiveness of the product/ brand, in this research advertisement featuring the celebrity. The affections generated by the ad leads to generation of af-fection towards the brand leading to purchase a product/ brand. The chocolate brand selected for the research has high market share and manufactures chocolate based products catering to all classes of consumers. The research primarily focuses on the significance of affections generated by the adver-tisement for the product. The purchase decision for such products is usually based on consumer impulses and attitudes towards the product/ brand. A convenience sample of 116 individuals was considered for the research and the survey was done using questionnaire method.
