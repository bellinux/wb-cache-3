500|$|Fashion {{designer}} Donatella Versace {{and friend}} of Carey's told Vogue that [...] "Meteorite" [...] is [...] "upbeat" [...] and [...] "has the power to <b>lift</b> <b>your</b> mood". Jim Farber of New York Daily News complimented the track, writing that the disco beat and the Warhol quote was reminiscent of Studio 54. John Sargent for Pitchfork Media was less impressed with the song, simply commenting that the song [...] "is a gloopy scoop of Cher schmaltz". AXS writer John Shetler was critical of [...] "Meteorite" [...] and included it on his four worst songs list from the album, writing Meteorite' gets bonus points for opening with an Andy Warhol quote, but that’s not enough to save the non-descript dance track with a grating, repetitive chorus and unimaginative lyrics about shooting stars and burning up the night sky." ...|$|E
500|$|Ho Ho Ho {{received}} primarily positive {{reviews from}} music critics following its release. Darren Scott of Gay Times praised the album {{as one of}} his favorite Christmas albums of all time; during an interview with the publication, RuPaul and Visage stated that it had become a [...] "classic Christmas traditional album" [...] alongside releases by Johnny Mathis and Barbra Streisand. The record was described as a [...] "collection of reinterpretations guaranteed to <b>lift</b> <b>your</b> spirits" [...] by Vibe's Shawnee Smith, who commended it for its up-tempo instrumentals and ability to reverse [...] "holiday depression". Ken Veeder of The Advocate praised RuPaul's interpretations of the Christmas classic in [...] "the gay way", positively responding to the changes made to the songs' titles; Veeder highlighted [...] "I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus" [...] as his favorite track from the album. Even though Billboard's Melinda Newman referenced the album as a novelty record, she praised it for its humor. A writer from OutTV praised Ho Ho Ho as a [...] "collection of cheeky and cheerful tunes", and E! News Joal Ryan noted that the album {{was one of the most}} boundary-pushing Christmas releases of the year. Idolator's Robbie Daw described it as a [...] "yuletide classic".|$|E

500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / <b>Lift</b> <b>your</b> hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you {{never got a chance}} to see how good I've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key as the rest of the song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / <b>Lift</b> <b>your</b> hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will <b>lift</b> <b>your</b> cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though a prisoner, Táhirih {{still had}} {{relative}} {{freedom in the}} sense that she still taught her religion to people in the mayor's house. She openly denounced polygamy, the veil and other restraints put upon women. Her words soon made her an influential character and women flocked to see Táhirih, including one princess of the Qajar family who converted. [...] The clergy and members of the court, however, feared that she had grown too influential, and they organized seven conferences with Táhirih to convince her to recant her faith in the Báb. Instead, Táhirih presented religious [...] "proofs" [...] for the Báb's cause and—at the last of these conferences—exclaimed [...] "when will you <b>lift</b> <b>your</b> eyes toward the Sun of Truth?". Her actions horrified the delegation and were regarded as unbecoming of a woman, no less one from her social background.|$|E
2500|$|After Joseph was born, Jacob {{decided to}} return home to his parents. Laban the Aramean was {{reluctant}} to release him, as God had blessed his flock on account of Jacob. Laban asked what he could pay Jacob. Jacob suggested that all the spotted, speckled, and brown goats and sheep of Laban's flock, at any given moment, would be his wages. Jacob placed rods of poplar, hazel, and chestnut, all of which he peeled [...] "white streaks upon them", within the flocks' watering holes or troughs in a performance of sympathetic magic, associating the stripes of the rods {{with the growth of}} stripes on the livestock. Despite this practicing of magic, later on Jacob says to his wives that it was God who made the livestock give birth to the convenient offspring, in order to turn the tide against the deceptive Laban. As time passed, Laban's sons noticed that Jacob was taking the better part of their flocks, and so Laban's friendly attitude towards Jacob began to change. The angel of the Lord, in a dream back during the breeding season, told Jacob [...] "Now <b>lift</b> <b>your</b> eyes and see [...] all the he goats mounting the animals are ringed, speckled, and striped, [...] for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you", that he is the God whom Jacob met at Bethel, and that Jacob should leave {{and go back to the}} land where he was born, which he and his wives and children did without informing Laban. Before they left, Rachel stole the teraphim, considered to be household idols, from Laban's house.|$|E
