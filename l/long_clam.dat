50|$|Dacryomya, or {{the pointed}} nutclam is an extinct genus of small-sized (approximately 1 cm <b>long)</b> {{saltwater}} <b>clams,</b> marine bivalve molluscs in the nutclam family Nuculanidae. The {{size and shape}} of the shells of species in this genus are reminiscent of broad apple pips.|$|R
50|$|<b>Long</b> Island <b>clam</b> chowder is {{a variant}} {{that is part}} New England-style and part Manhattan-style, making it a creamy tomato clam chowder. The name is a {{geographical}} pun, noting that the location of Long Island, just like the recipe, is about halfway between Manhattan and New England. This variant is popular in many small restaurants across Suffolk County, New York.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} palaeontology of the <b>Long</b> Point and <b>Clam</b> Bank Formations exposed between Misty Cove and Salmon Cove on the west coast of the Port au Port Peninsula of Western Newfoundland. [...] The red-beds which outcrop along the coast north of Lourdes Cove have {{previously}} been thought {{to be part of the}} red sandstones and conglomerates of the Clam Bank Formation. A detailed study of the rocks in thin section and of the palaeontology of these beds and those immediately below them, showed that these beds are conformable with, and of similar age to, the Long Point Formation. They have, therefore, been named the Lourdes Member of the Long Point Formation. [...] The fauna of the upper part of the Misty Cove Member and the Lourdes Member of the Long Point Formation, and the fauna of the total exposed Clam Bank Formation is described. The age of the upper part of the Long Point Formation deduced from the fauna, is thought to be at the boundary between the Middle and Upper Ordovician, and that of the Clam Bank Formation to be Pridolian in age...|$|R
40|$|The geoduck clam fishery, worth {{approximately}} CDN $ 40 (approx. US$ 35) {{million in}} annual landed value, is British Columbia’s most valuable invertebrate fishery. This fishery has been comanaged by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and the Underwater Harvesters Association (UHA) since 1989. Earlier input control measures such as effort regulation, seasonal closures, and licenses failed to work effectively {{for more than ten}} years, resulting in excess fishing capacity, over harvesting, poor economic returns, and unsafe fishing practices. Output control measures such as the individual vessel quota system (IVQ) have, to some extent, proven successful in improving revenues, controlling excess fishing capacity, gaining compliance with regulations, and involving fishers in the joint decision making processes. However, there are public concerns about a common property resource at risk of being dominated by a few UHA license holders. Additionally, there are concerns about the job losses resulting from IVQ implementation, as well as distribution and equity issues. This paper traces and examines the policy context for fisheries management in the British Columbia (BC) geoduck fishery, discusses the major concerns surrounding the exploitation of <b>long</b> lived ‘Methuselah’s <b>clams</b> an...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern on the {{potential}} impacts of the harmful algal bloom (HAB) on the human society. The HAB incidents increase substantially in recent decades {{in many parts of the}} world, including southern China. The effects of HAB on the physiological responses of bivalves, which can accumulate high levels of toxins in their soft tissues, attract many attentions due to the potential loss in shellfishes industry. Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins are one of the dominant phycotoxins affecting the southern China area; death and illness of human had been recorded. In this study, the physiological responses of bivalves in southern China to harmful algal bloom were studied. Toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense ATHK is the local PSP causative organism affecting the area. Experiments were carried out to determine whether toxic A. tamarense could impose any harmful effects on the physiology of bivalves after short term and <b>long</b> term exposure. <b>Clam</b> Ruditapes philippinarum, mussel Perna viridis and scallop Chlamys nobilis were chosen as the model bivalves as different toxin burdens had been found in these bivalves in the field measurements. Results on feeding rate and absorption efficiency indicated that toxic A. tamarense had no effect on the local bivalves within the short term exposure period. However, after long term exposure on toxic dinoflagellates, the clam R. philippinarum reduced their growth rate and scope for growth, due to the reduced clearance rate and absorption efficiency, and the increase in respiration rate. Significant mortality was also recorded for both mussel P. viridis and clam R. philippinarum. It is concluded that the PSP producing dinoflagellates in this area had potential harmful impacts on the physiology of the bivalves, leading to potential losses to mariculture industry in southern China...|$|R
