50|$|Not yet {{approved}} in the USA but available in Europe {{and several other}} countries are the nickel-titanium stents Memokath Stents. Memokath™ Prostate stents place themselves between temporary and permanent stents since they can remain in place {{for several years and}} still easily be exchanged. The Memokath™ Prostate stent is used for long-term treatment of patients with prostatic obstruction and enlargement. The treatment requires only <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> <b>gel</b> which makes it suitable for day case treatment. The stent is easy and simple to insert and the procedure takes approximately 20 minutes. Patients can normally empty their bladder immediately after stent placement. If necessary, the stent can easily be exchanged as it is not prone to encrustation or tissue in-growth. The reason for this feature is that nickel-titanium becomes super-soft when cooled with cold water.|$|E
40|$|Context. The initial {{periodontal}} examination {{which includes}} full-mouth periodontal probing {{is one of}} the discomforting procedures for a patient. Aim. To evaluate the efficacy of two <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> <b>gels</b> in the reduction of pain during periodontal probing using Florida probe in CGP patients in comparison with manual probing. Materials and Methods. Ninety systemically healthy patients with moderate to severe CGP patients were recruited. In each patient, the quadrants were randomly assigned to manual probing with UNC- 15 probe, probing with Florida probe, and Florida probing with lidocaine 10 % gel and with benzocaine 20 % gel. In the quadrants undergoing probing with <b>anesthetic</b> <b>gels,</b> the sites were isolated and the gel was injected using syringe and a blunt-end cannula. Pain was measured using 10 [*]mm horizontal VAS. Statistical Analysis. The analysis was carried out using SPSS version 18. The comparison of mean VAS scores was done using repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni test. Results. Mean VAS for manual probing was significantly more than Florida probing. Further, the mean VAS score for Florida probing was higher than the two gels. Conclusion. It is suggested that the gels might be useful in reducing pain experienced during full-mouth periodontal probing in patients with CGP...|$|R

40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> block sodium {{channels}} in a state-dependent fashion, binding with higher affinity to open and/or inactivated states. Gating current measurements show that <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> immobilize {{a fraction of}} the gating charge, suggesting that the movement of voltage sensors is modified when a <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> binds to the pore of the sodium channel. Here, using voltage clamp fluorescence measurements, we provide a quantitative description of the effect of <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> on the steady-state behavior of the voltage-sensing segments of a sodium channel. Lidocaine and QX- 314 shifted the midpoints of the fluorescence – voltage (F-V) curves of S 4 domain III in the hyperpolarizing direction by 57 and 65 mV, respectively. A single mutation in the S 6 of domain IV (F 1579 A), a site critical for <b>local</b> <b>anesthetic</b> block, abolished the effect of QX- 314 on the voltage sensor of domain III. Both <b>local</b> <b>anesthetics</b> modestly shifted the F-V relationships of S 4 domain IV toward hyperpolarized potentials. In contrast, the F-V curve of the S 4 domain I was shifted by 11 mV in the depolarizing direction upon QX- 314 binding.
