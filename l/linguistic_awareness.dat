40|$|In the didactics of the Slovenian {{language}} {{as the first}} language the term language awareness is related primarily to the identity function of standard {{language as}} the most important element of the national and cultural awareness, while the conception of language awareness, based on the functional linguistics, has been put forward only in the last decade. Therefore, the main issue is how to understand language and <b>linguistic</b> cultural <b>awareness</b> in a society which is traditionally considered “culturally monolithic”, and how they should be dealt with in the first language teaching. In attempt to find the answer, first main features of both the language and <b>linguistic</b> cultural <b>awareness</b> are presented: their levels, components and emphasized language functions. It is evident that a person’s linguistic activity and his/her linguistic identification are inseparable. Because of this, the development of language and cultural awareness in the context of two models of first language teaching is discussed later on. In the model aimed at the development of functional communicative competence they are developed optionally and unrelated to each other. Only the model which aims at critical communicative competence allows developing them closely related {{to each other and to}} critical thinking...|$|R

40|$|Theories {{relating}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> {{to reading}} suggest that {{different types of}} awareness are required for different reading skills. In this paper we investigated the relation between children's awareness of different levels of language ambiguity in riddles and their comprehension and accuracy skills. In Experiment 1, 29 8 - 11 year-olds heard riddles requiring relatively high levels of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness.</b> Riddle recall {{was significantly related to}} reading comprehension skill after reading accuracy and age were partialled out. In Experiment 2, 39 7 - 10 year-olds chose punchlines for riddles requiring high or low levels of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness.</b> Comprehension skill was related to correct punchline choice for high-awareness but not low-awareness riddles. Accuracy skill was related only to appreciation of low-awareness riddles. Given the link between appreciation of high-awareness riddles and comprehension, in Experiment 3, we investigated whether training in understanding such ambiguity would improve children's reading comprehension. Thirty-six 7 - 8 year-olds were assigned to either a riddle-training or a control group. Trained children showed significantly greater improvements in comprehension skill than controls. These findings reinforce the claim that the appreciation of high-level linguistic ambiguity is related to the development of good comprehension skills...|$|E
30|$|Consider {{next the}} older children, {{typically}} 8 {{years old and}} above. The elementary arithmetic skills are already an objective of the past (even in case they are not actually attained); their mastery cannot constitute an achievement worth demonstrating to the experimenter. But what is currently emerging is metacognition in the linguistic domain (Gombert 1992) and the logical domain (Moshman 1990; in particular, logical necessity: Cormier and Dagenais 1983; Miller et al. 2000). Significantly, it is from about 8  years onwards that children start to understand riddles based on semantic ambiguity (Bernstein 1986; Kilcher 1991; Shultz 1974; Shultz and Horibe 1974; Sutton-Smith 1976) and {{about the same age}} that they start to offer a majority of metalinguistic explanations in response to requests to explain the use of linguistic items (Karmiloff-Smith 1986). The contemporaneous character of the emergence of metacognition (logical and <b>linguistic,</b> including <b>awareness</b> of semantic ambiguity) on one hand, and success on the class inclusion question on the other hand is no coincidence: The former is a condition for the latter.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{formation}} of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> of the Czechs after 1989. Rapid changes in the linguistic and paralinguistic reality of the past 25 years are associated with the Velvet Revolution and the division of Czechoslovakia. The most important changes in the <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> of the Czechs after 1989 are the gradual increase in the social acceptance of the colloquial language and lack of objection against the progression of brutalization of the language of public debate. This can be interpreted as the disappearance of the need to aestheticise the language and also as an aversion to, in its broadest sense, the Czech language culture. The most important change, however, seems to be a lack of awareness that the society is bilingual and that Czech-Slovak communication within the society is possible...|$|E

40|$|The {{similarities}} and differences between written and spoken forms of language have been a focus of interest of many scholars. There is agreement that instead of being a dichotomy or one single continuum, the differences between spoken and written forms can be measured along several dimensions. The coming into existence of computermediated communication (CMC) has made the line of distinction even less obvious. It is technically a writing (key-pressing) behaviour but may be used to carry out spontaneous communication. This study is intended to investigate the special linguistic features of CMC versus non-CMC texts. The study adopts a corpus linguistic approach to analyse a host of 67 linguistic features in synchronous and asynchronous CMC genres and finds interesting differences in the use of these features when used in different temporalities of CMC contexts. A comparison of these features in CMC genres with those in non-CMC texts also reveals some special characteristics of language developed through the use of CMC. The study suggests that, within the general development of CMC, there are emerging genres reflecting particular contexts. As CMC may soon become a major means of communication, and corpus linguistics is an innovative <b>linguistic</b> approach, <b>awareness</b> of CMC is likely to be of increasing importance for language learning. Some pedagogical suggestions are proposed from the experience and findings that have been gained...|$|R
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study of nine children examined two issues concerning infantile amnesia: the time at which memories for events experienced {{before the age of}} 3 - 4 years disappear from consciousness and whether this timing of memory loss is related to the development of specific aspects of episodic and autobiographical memory. This study followed children from infancy to early childhood and examined the central role of three verbal-cognitive milestones related to autobiographical memory: the age at which children begin to report autobiographical memories using the past tense (Milestone 1); the age at which they begin to verbally acknowledge past events (Milestone 2); and the age at which they begin to spontaneously use memory-related verbs (Milestone 3). As expected, memories of events that occurred before 3 - 4 years of age were affected by infantile amnesia. Achievement of these milestones followed almost the same developmental progression: Milestone 1 (1 year; 10 months (1; 10) to 3 years; 4 months (3; 4)) was followed by Milestones 2 (3; 1 to 4; 0) and 3 (3; 5 to 4; 4). Milestone 2 was typically related to the onset of infantile amnesia, whereas Milestone 1 occurred during the period for which the children became amnesic as they aged. These data suggest that <b>linguistic</b> meta-cognitive <b>awareness</b> of personal memory is the key feature in infantile amnesia...|$|R

40|$|In a {{longitudinal}} study, {{we looked at}} the link between children's understanding of a morphemically-based orthographic rule and their awareness of morphemic distinctions. The orthographic rule in question was the use of the apostrophe to denote possession in English. Early on in the study, we gave the children phonological, semantic/syntactic and morpho-syntactic awareness tasks, and later we gave them a spelling task in which they had to write words which were either genitives (e. g., 'boy's') or nominative or accusative plurals (e. g., 'boys'). Eight- to 10 -year-old children found this task difficult, but their performance improved to some extent with age. The morpho-syntactic, but not the phonological or semantic/syntactic, awareness tasks predicted how well the children placed apostrophes in genitive words and omitted them from plural words. We conclude that different forms of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> affect different aspects of reading and spelling. Learning about spelling patterns based on morphemes is heavily influenced by children's morpho-syntactic awareness but not, apparently, by other forms of <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness.</b> © 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} how professional development conditions, events, and activities {{relate to the}} process of teachers becoming linguistically aware. Through an analysis of 18 transcribed individual and group interviews, I show how changes in beliefs about language, as well as the application of these changes to teachers' pedagogies take place among a sample of 14 teachers. I analyze these findings as an outcome of these teachers' professional development and in relation to models of effective professional development derived from the fields of Multicultural Education, Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), Intercultural Communication, and Sociolinguistics. I also propose a new model, the Process of <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Awareness</b> and Application Model (PLAA Model, Strickling, 2012), that more accurately evaluates how changes take place as the teachers in this study become more linguistically aware. Changes in beliefs about language involve a cycle of five phases: confronting new linguistic information, questioning linguistic information and previously held beliefs, integrating new linguistic information within contexts of social engagement, evaluating the relational, emotional, and cognitive aspects of the experience, and modifying beliefs about language within the specific context of the experience. The PLAA Model also shows how a nuanced secondary cycle can occur where the process of questioning, integrating, and evaluating inform each other in a repeating cycle of increasing <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> before the final phase of modifying beliefs takes place. The cycle results in experiential linguistic knowledge and becomes the paradigm for new questioning. Within the secondary cycle, the teachers in this study show that they either gain a more linguistically aware knowledge from their integrating experience or within some contexts, reinscribe an aspect of their previously held standard language beliefs and gain a <b>linguistic</b> <b>awareness</b> during the same experience.

Krashen (1981) claims that focus on meaning is the key factor for successful second language acquisition. In FonM approach, learners learn a second language best when they experience it {{as a means of}} communication and that incidental and implicit learning is sufficient for language acquisition.
