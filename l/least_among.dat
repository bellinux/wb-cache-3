5|$|On Java and Sumatra, the Dutch found {{military}} {{success in}} cities and major towns, but {{they were unable to}} subdue the villages and countryside. On the outer islands (including Bali), Republican sentiment was not as strong, at <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the elite. They were consequently occupied by the Dutch with comparative ease, and autonomous states were set up by the Dutch. The largest, the State of East Indonesia (NIT), encompassed most of eastern Indonesia, and was established in December 1946, with its administrative capital in Makassar.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund's son Sigismund II Augustus (Zygmunt II August), a monarch of a {{much more}} {{tolerant}} attitude, guaranteed {{the freedom of the}} Lutheran religion practice in all of Royal Prussia by 1559. Besides Lutheranism, which, within the Polish Crown, ultimately found substantial following mainly in the cities of Royal Prussia and western Greater Poland, the teachings of the persecuted Anabaptists and Unitarians, and in Greater Poland the Czech Brothers, were met, at <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the szlachta, with a more sporadic response.|$|E

5|$|Hodgson {{made his}} Sabres debut {{two days after}} the trade, {{registering}} four shots on goal and 16 minutes of ice time in a 2–0 win against the Anaheim Ducks. After going pointless in his first ten games with Buffalo, Hodgson recorded two assists in a 7–3 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 19. Two nights later, he scored his first two goals as a Sabre in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. Leaving Vancouver gave Hodgson a larger on-ice role, earning nearly five minutes more ice time per game as a Sabre. Completing his first NHL season with the Sabres, he finished with 41 points (19 goals and 22 assists) over 83 games. He ranked fifth in League rookie scoring and first in power play goals (7), despite earning less ice time than his first-year peers (his 13 minutes and 49 seconds per game averaged the <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the top 14 rookie scorers). As a team, the Sabres then failed to qualify for the 2012 playoffs, finishing ninth in the Eastern Conference. Hodgson was assigned to the AHL's Rochester Americans immediately before the 2012–13 NHL lock-out took effect.|$|E

25|$|While the {{validity}} of the existence of paranormal phenomena is controversial and debated passionately by both proponents of the paranormal and by skeptics, surveys are useful in determining the beliefs of people in regards to paranormal phenomena.

While the Third Republic returned {{once again to}} the principles of equality espoused by the Revolution (at <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the political Radical party), in practice the upper echelons of French society maintained their notion of social distinction well into the 20th century (as attested to, for example, by the presence of nobility and noble class distinctions in the works of Marcel Proust).|$|E

25|$|With {{his initial}} huge haul of confiscated opium, and his newly won control of opium traffic into Laos, General Ouane {{improved}} his refineries. At {{the time of}} the 1967 Opium War, they were turning out morphine base; some of that was further refined into crude but smokeable Number 3 Globe heroin. Within two years of the war, highly refined injectable Number 4 Globe heroin was being produced. Ouane's product now spread beyond its prior Asian market, to be smuggled into and sold in the United States and Europe. Not <b>least</b> <b>among</b> his markets was disaffected American troops in Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Martinho de Araújo was {{the sole}} {{competitor}} for East Timor in weightlifting, competing in the bantamweight class. De Araújo was the first East Timorese at the Olympics, he represented East Timor in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney in the same weight class. In the 2002 Asian Games, his highest successfully lifted weight in snatch was 67.5kg, out of 65 and 67.5kg, and in clean and jerk his best was 90kg, he also tried two failed attempts for 95 and 100kg. De Araújo finished in 13th place in the final standings {{with a total of}} 157.5kg, <b>least</b> <b>among</b> all the ranked weightlifters.|$|E
25|$|Given that {{a factor}} {{is used in}} the {{production}} of a range of first-order goods, its value is determined by the good that is worth the <b>least</b> <b>among</b> all the goods in the range. This value is determined at the margin, the marginal utility of the last unit of the least valuable good produced by the factor. In connection with his opportunity cost, the value so derived represents an opportunity cost across all industries, and the values of the factors of production and goods are determined in the whole system. Thus, supply and demand do not develop into the determinants of value; the determinant of value is the marginal utility.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 {{the press}} widely {{reported}} suggestions by Alec Knight and Joanna Mountain of Stanford University {{that the original}} human language may have had clicks. The purported evidence for this is genetic: speakers of Juǀ'hoan and Hadza have the most divergent known mitochondrial DNA of any human populations, suggesting {{that they were the}} first, or at <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the first, surviving peoples to have split off the family tree. In other words, the three primary genetic divisions of humanity are the Hadza, the Juǀʼhoan and relatives, and everyone else. Because two of the three groups speak languages with clicks, perhaps their common ancestral language, which by implication is the ancestral language for all humankind, had clicks as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 after Casement's {{conviction}} for treason, the British government circulated alleged photographs {{of pages of}} the diary to individuals who were urging commutation of Casement's death sentence. At a time of strong conservatism, not <b>least</b> <b>among</b> Irish Catholics, publicising the Black Diaries and his alleged homosexuality undermined support for Casement. The {{question of whether the}} diaries are genuine or forgeries has been much debated. The diaries were declassified for limited inspection (by persons approved by the Home Office) in August 1959. The original diaries may be seen at the British National Archives in Kew. Historians and biographers of Casement's life have taken opposing views. Roger McHugh (in 1976) and Angus Mitchell (in 2000 and later) have argued that the diaries were forged. In 2012, Mitchell published several articles in the Field Day Review of Notre Dame University.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at <b>least</b> <b>among</b> the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E
