50|$|In electronics, an LED circuit or <b>LED</b> <b>driver</b> is an {{electrical}} circuit used to power a light-emitting diode (LED). The circuit must provide sufficient current {{to light the}} LED at the required brightness, but must limit the current to prevent damaging the LED. The voltage drop across an LED is approximately constant {{over a wide range}} of operating current; therefore, a small increase in applied voltage greatly increases the current. Very simple circuits are used for low-power indicator LEDs. More complex, current source circuits are required when driving high-power LEDs for illumination to achieve correct current regulation.|$|E

40|$|Lighting consumes {{approximately}} 20 - 25 % of {{the energy}} produced worldwide. LED based lighting is rapidly becoming the preferred choice over incandescent and fluorescent based lighting. LEDs have advantages such as high efficacy, long operating lifetime and excellent lumen maintenance. Therefore, to gain benefits from LEDs for lighting purposes, they must be driven with efficient drivers which maintain high LED efficacy and long LED lifetime. A review of existing LED drivers is done, and their advantages and drawbacks are identified. Existing fault-tolerant drivers are also reviewed. Several dimming methods and their effects on the LED efficacy and lifetime are investigated. As a result, a converter with coupled inductors, suitable as an <b>LED</b> <b>driver</b> which has high efficiency and can maintain high LED efficacy, incorporated with a high efficiency dimming method, is chosen. For the proposed <b>LED</b> <b>driver,</b> a comprehensive analysis {{on the effects of}} coupling type and coupling coefficient on converter performance is done. This is carried out to establish the best coupled inductor structure and coupling coefficient, for the proposed <b>LED</b> <b>driver.</b> The coupled inductor obtained is used to achieve high LED efficacy and also used to eliminate the need for an output filtering capacitor. This results in a highly compact, high efficiency and low cost <b>LED</b> <b>driver.</b> A lossless method of LED string current sensing is proposed, so that driver efficiency is not negatively impacted. The <b>LED</b> <b>driver</b> and a digital control system are designed, with the fault-tolerant feature incorporated. The <b>LED</b> <b>driver</b> and the control system are simulated and practically implemented. The results obtained show excellent <b>LED</b> <b>driver</b> performance.

40|$|The {{significant}} improvements recently achieved in LED technology {{in terms of}} lifetime, luminous efficacy, power rating, and color property render LED {{one of the most}} promising candidates to replace conventional light sources in various residential and industrial applications. The rapid advancement in the device characteristics has simultaneously stimulated interests in developing efficient <b>LED</b> <b>drivers</b> with optimized control circuitries. The two conventional techniques currently employed in most <b>LED</b> <b>drivers,</b> namely the amplitude-mode and pulsewidth modulation (PWM) mode driving techniques, suffer from the disadvantage that high luminous efficacy in the amplitude mode has to be traded for control flexibility in the PWM mode and vice versa. In this paper, a method is proposed to improve the luminous efficacy of conventional PWM-mode driving technique while retaining their control flexibility by introducing a dc-offset component into the PWM current. Two LEDs were used in the experimental verifications. Improvements of 17. 6 % and 18. 1 % on average were measured by maintaining a dc offset of 100 and 200 mA, respectively, in the LED current. Further improvement can be achieved by increasing the dc-offset current. The main tradeoff is the reduction of the dynamic range over which the average LED current can be controlled. For a given set of performance criteria, the proposed method offers designers of <b>LED</b> <b>drivers</b> the flexibility of balancing between luminous efficacy and dynamic range for control. © 2006 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
