In these formats, the four samples immediately following the EAV packets (but not the SAV packets) contain a cyclic redundancy check field, and a <b>line</b> <b>count</b> indicator.

50|$|The term PAL {{was often}} used informally and {{somewhat}} imprecisely {{to refer to}} the 625-line/50 Hz (576i) television system in general, to differentiate from the 525-line/60 Hz (480i) system generally used with NTSC. Accordingly, DVDs were labelled as PAL or NTSC (referring to the <b>line</b> <b>count</b> and frame rate) even though technically the discs do not carry either PAL or NTSC composite signal.
