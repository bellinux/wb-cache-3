5|$|Wanita dan Satria was {{released}} in 1941, reaching Bandung by August and Surabaya by September. The film was open to all ages. A novelisation was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta-based Kolff-Buning.

5|$|Young {{children}} were attended by a pedagogus, or less frequently a female pedagoga, usually a Greek slave or former slave. The pedagogue kept the child safe, taught self-discipline and public behaviour, attended class and helped with tutoring. The emperor Julian recalled his pedagogue Mardonius, a eunuch slave who reared {{him from the}} age of 7 to 15, with affection and gratitude. Usually, however, pedagogues received <b>little</b> <b>respect.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had <b>little</b> <b>respect,</b> Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E

A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E

But he is disappointed— from the very first day of their marriage, she comes home inebriated, and despite his repeated requests, has <b>little</b> <b>respect</b> for tradition and family values. Eventually, Gopal's father dies of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's drunken behaviour on Gopal's birthday. Gopal tries to control Chitra, but she is always irritated by his acts. At one point, she tries to leave him. Gopal begs her to change her decision, but Chitra still leaves. The next day, he hears that Chitra had died on a railway track, and this hurts him a lot. Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love.|$|E
5|$|The {{specifically}} military grievances {{that led}} to the mutiny of the 5th Light Infantry centred on the personality of the commanding officer at the time, Lieutenant-Colonel E. V. Martin. He had been promoted from major in the regiment, bur the previous colonel had reported that he was unpopular with his fellow officers and that he inspired <b>little</b> <b>respect</b> among the men. His appointment led to disunity amongst the British officers, which was reflected by division among the Indian officers over the promotion to commissioned rank of a colour-havildar. The issues, which might, under ordinary circumstances, have been of limited impact, were aggregated by the disruptive external influences of the Ghadar Party propaganda noted above and the entry of Turkey into the war.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, the sacred, or sacrum in Latin, {{encompasses}} {{all that}} exists beyond the everyday, natural {{world that we}} experience with our senses. As such, the sacred or numinous can inspire feelings of awe, because it is regarded as ultimately unknowable and beyond limited human abilities to perceive and comprehend. Durkheim pointed out however that there are degrees of sacredness, so that an amulet for example may be sacred yet <b>little</b> <b>respected.</b>|$|R
25|$|But as Stewart tracks three post-plague generations, he vividly {{demonstrates}} that advanced civilisation depends on numbers. Reduce {{the race to}} the size of a small town and how many residents will remember how to make plastic? The last Americans plunder canned goods (with <b>little</b> <b>respect</b> for sell-by dates), and literacy atrophies; electrical and water systems break down. At length, the community reverts to its hunter-gatherer forebears.|$|E
25|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{turned the}} matter {{over to the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs, with {{instructions}} that the white settlers would suffer no harm.

For the rest, Hurree could so stage-manage the journey through the hills that Hilas, Bunar, and four hundred miles of hill-roads should tell the tale for a generation. Men who cannot control their own coolies are <b>little</b> <b>respected</b> in the Hills, and the hillman has a very keen sense of humour.|$|R
25|$|Although the Indianapolis Colts, behind {{second year}} quarterback Peyton Manning, had posted some gaudy numbers {{en route to}} a {{sterling}} 13–3 regular season record, the upstart Tennessee Titans paid them <b>little</b> <b>respect.</b> Running back Eddie George rushed for a team playoff-record 162 yards, including a 68-yard touchdown, to help lead the Titans to victory. Manning endured a rough playoff debut as he completed only 19 of 42 passes.|$|E

25|$|The {{indoctrination}} of Japanese {{military personnel}} to have <b>little</b> <b>respect</b> for {{the act of}} surrendering led to conduct which Allied soldiers found deceptive. During the Pacific War, there were incidents where Japanese soldiers feigned surrender in order to lure Allied troops into ambushes. In addition, wounded Japanese soldiers sometimes tried to use hand grenades to kill Allied troops attempting to assist them. Japanese attitudes towards surrender {{also contributed to the}} harsh treatment which was inflicted on the Allied personnel they captured.|$|E

An infuriated Sir Alan ordered her back to the house for her rudeness, and told her that she would lead the next task, strongly implying that she would be fired if she lost.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{political}} class of Chad are drawn from Dazagra. During the civil conflict in Chad (1966–1993), the derde came to occupy a more important position. In 1965 the Chadian government assumed direct authority over the Tibesti Mountains, sending a military garrison and administrators to Bardaï, the capital of Tibesti Subprefecture. Within a year, abuses of authority had roused considerable opposition among the Toubou. The derde, Oueddei Kichidemi, recognized but <b>little</b> <b>respected</b> up to that time, protested the excesses, went into exile in Libya, and, {{with the support of}} Toubou students at the Islamic University of Bayda, became a symbol of opposition to the Chadian government.
