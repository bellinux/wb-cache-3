40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects on}} drinking and driving of lowered allowable blood alcohol concentration (<b>BAC)</b> <b>limits</b> for drivers younger than 21 years in 30 US states between 1984 and 1998. METHODS: Outcome measures were based on self-reports from a cross-sectional sample of more than 5000 high school seniors in 30 states surveyed before and after <b>BAC</b> <b>limits</b> were implemented in their states. RESULTS: Frequency of driving after any drinking and driving after 5 or more drinks declined 19 % and 23 %, respectively. Lower <b>BAC</b> <b>limits</b> did not affect overall amount of drinking or total number of miles driven.

5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|R

By 2004 all 50 states had passed 0.08 percent laws for drivers, making it the new national standard.|$|R

40|$|The review {{aimed to}} assess how {{effective}} the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) laws are at reducing road traffic injuries and deaths. It also assessed {{the potential impact of}} lowering the <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> from 0. 081 to 0. 05. The review examined: • drink-driving patterns and the associated risk of being injured or killed in a road traffic accident • how <b>BAC</b> <b>limits</b> and related legislative measures have changed drink-drinking behaviour and helped reduce alcohol-related road traffic injuries and deaths • models estimating the potential impact of lowering the <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> from 0. 08 to 0. 05 in England and Wales • lessons from other countries on using BAC laws as part of overall alcohol control and road safety policies. A conceptual framework was used to show how, in theory, a law <b>limiting</b> drivers’ <b>BAC</b> levels could lead to changes in how much drivers drink and the number of alcohol-related road traffic injuries and deaths. The review of evidence tested these theoretical links and the robustness of the underlying assumptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of ethanol}} transport {{from the blood}} to the skin surface are incompletely understood. We present a mathematical model to predict the transient exchange of ethanol across the skin while it is being absorbed from the gut and eliminated from the body. The model simulates {{the behavior of a}} commercial device that is used to estimate the blood alcohol concentration (BAC). During the elimination phase, the stratum corneum of the skin has a higher ethanol concentration than the blood. We studied the effect of varying the <b>maximum</b> <b>BAC</b> and the absorption rate from the gut on the relationship between BAC and equivalent concentration in the gas phase above the skin.

These effects increased as the <b>maximum</b> <b>BAC</b> increased. Our model’s predictions are consistent with experimental data from the literature.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, several {{countries}} enacted {{the reduction of the}} legal blood alcohol concentration (<b>BAC)</b> <b>limit,</b> often alongside the administrative license revocation or suspension, to battle drinking-and-driving behavior. Several researchers investigated the effectiveness of these policies by applying different analysis procedures, while assuming population homogeneity in responding to these laws.

Poisson regression models, adapted to account for possible observation dependence over time and state specific effects, are estimated to measure the reduction of the number of alcohol-related accidents and fatalities for single-vehicle accidents in 22 U.

Model estimates demonstrate that, for alcohol-related single-vehicle crashes, (i) BAC laws are more effective in terms of reduction of number of casualties rather than number of accidents, (ii) women and elderly population exhibit higher law compliance with respect to men and to young adult and adult population, respectively, and (iii) the presence of passengers in the vehicle enhances the sense of responsibility of the driver...|$|R
40|$|In Victoria, Australia, 21 – 26 -year-old {{drivers are}} {{over-represented}} in alcohol-related fatal crashes. At this age drivers generally transfer from intermediate to full licensure, correspondingly experiencing {{an increase in}} legal <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> from zero to. 05. This study used telephone surveys to compare drinking-driving profiles of 21 – 26 -year-old fully-licensed, 18 – 20 -year-old intermediate and 31 – 40 -year-old experienced drivers (N≅ 700) to identify potential crash-risk factors. High driving and drinking exposure was a likely contributor to the over-involvement of male 21 – 26 -year-olds, but not females. A tendency by 21 – 26 -year-olds to rely on other drivers was both successful and unsuccessful in avoiding drink-driving. When driving themselves, there was a tendency to count or space drinks - less successful than abstaining from alcohol. The need to return home, convenience and lack of transport options were common reasons for drink-driving. Fear of crashes/injuries, licence loss and detection/arrest were common motivators to avoid drink-driving. Findings suggest the increase in <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> is a difficult transition for some drivers and may contribute to their crash involvement...|$|R

40|$|Although {{moderate}} drinking {{does not}} necessarily increase a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to {{the level at which}} driving is legally prohibited in the United States, any drinking can impair driving tasks. In addition to laws establishing lower legal <b>BAC</b> <b>limits</b> for drivers, legislative approaches for reducing alcohol-impaired driving include imposing sanctions for drinking and driving and restricting alcohol’s availability. KEY WORDS: moderate AOD use; drinking and driving; AOD impairment; BAC; DWI laws; sanction; AOD availability; minimum drinking age; traffic accident; AODR (alcohol and other drug related) mortality; literature review Adriver {{does not necessarily}} have to be intoxicated to be impaired by alcohol. Even moderate drinking, defined as drinking no more than two drinks per day for men and no more than one drink per day for women (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism [NIAAA] 1995), may impair driving performance. This level of drinking generally results in a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0. 03 percent {{for both men and women}} (if the drinks are consumed in 1 hour on an empty stomach) (see figure 1). A person’s risk of involvement in a fatal crash nearly doubles with each 0. 02 percent increase in BAC (Zador 1991). In 1997, 18 percent of fatally injured drivers who tested positive for alcohol had BACs between 0. 01 and 0. 09 percent (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] 1998 a), a range that falls below the legal <b>BAC</b> <b>limit</b> for drivers in most States.
