40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{bullying}} at the primary level of the elementary schools {{from the point of view}} of the experienced teachers that have encountered this kind of situations in their practice. The thesis consists of a theoretical and empirical part. The theoretical part brings latest news from the foreign and <b>local</b> <b>bibliography.</b> It describes causes, forms, participants of bullying, and there is a comparison of different kinds of solutions. Last but not least it proposes a wide range of preventive methods. The practical part is based on case studies of the interventions of bullying in the primary school which are realized through semi-structured interviews with five teachers from different countries with different backgrounds who dealt with bullying in their practise. The results present different techniques which involved people in the intervention use to efectively solve the cases and on the other hand what slows the proces of healing down and how to overcome these obstacles. Which steps were done in the classroom and which methods of prevention teachers use. This paper includes a discussion about the difference of dealing with bullying in Czech and foreign schools.

Digital Bibliographies have been used as basis of many studies focused on the knowledge extraction in databases. Here we present a new methodology for mining knowledge in this field. Our approach aims to apply the potential of social network analysis techniques to accomplish this task, using a network representation of bibliography data. Besides we use some data mining techniques applied on social network representations in order to enrich this new point of view and to evolve our methodology towards a comprehensive <b>local</b> and global <b>bibliography</b> analysis workflow seen as a Knowledge Discovery process.

Already as the former Ravne na Koroškem Study Library, the Dr. Franc Sušnik Central Carinthian Library has incessantly maintained its local studies collection function with planned and systematic supplementation of the book material, serial publications, special collections and exhibition activity. Today the library is the central regional library in Koroška and, as specified by the law, performs various tasks for the wider region, receives obligatory copies, purchases library material for Slovenes abroad and completes the <b>local</b> <b>bibliography</b> for Koroška abroad. Many special collections, which the library can be proud of, {{are the result of}} a many year’s hard work. Formation of special collections accordingly to the kind and typology of material demands of a professional librarian also to be fully acquainted with certain elements of archival storage and museum activity. There have been great changes taking place in the field of local collection activity, {{as a consequence of the}} use of new technologies, while at the same time this work is hindered by financial troubles and deficiency of the tools needed for the input of the local collection materials into shared cataloguing. The library tends towards a unified and cooperative processing of the local studies collection materials, a good referral work and uniformed mediation of material and information. The aim is certainly to provide users with a fast, easily accessible and cheap local studies collection information...|$|E
40|$|Marina of Horta, main city of Faial Island, Azores, {{presents}} a surprisingly typographical view, {{due to its}} diversity and its geographical position, isolated {{in the midst of}} the North Atlantic Ocean. Due to a tradition of unknown origin, each sailor docking at the harbour paints their name and date of passage. Exposed to open air, the markings disappear under the action of natural elements and time. Nevertheless, the harbour area remains colourful; like the image of a ‘palimpsest’, the paintings are renewed with the constant flux of sailors docking at Horta. Although attributed to a superstition (“those who don’t paint will have bad luck on their trip”), the reason for this graphic phenomenon is related to leaving behind a mark of your own in a place lived through the experience of travel. As fascinating as they are, the paintings were never investigated from a graphic perspective. Therefore, this essay aims to study in which way the sailors write their passage through the harbour of Horta. It pretends to be fulfilled through a revision of literature that shows the connection between passage and writing, as well as contextualization and an analysis of the Marina’s lettering. A field trip was appointed to develop this last issue, namely by interviewing locals and sailors, research of <b>local</b> <b>bibliography,</b> and by creating a registry of one thousand photographs of the paintings based on an exploratory methodology. The practical part of this Master’s Final Essay, consists of creating a book that presents the photographic material collected throughout the research. Therefore, this editorial project aspires to prolong the passage movement mentioned since the beginning of this investigation, by means of a printed object that will circulate the variety of letters painted on the concrete of Horta’s Marina to other horizon...|$|E
40|$|Once the radial {{axis of the}} Spanish Railways was in place, major {{zones of}} the country still {{remained}} isolated. During {{the final years of}} the 19 th century and {{the early years of the}} 20 th, steps were taken to reduce this deficiency. Various plans were drawn up and these contemplated generous aid to facilitate the construction and to compensate for possible exploitation shortfalls. As a result of these conditions a considerable number of proposals were offered, some aimed at bringing prosperity to the less favoured areas while others were orchestrated by wily adventurers in quest of subsidies. However, neither one nor the other succeeded in providing Spain with a subsidiary railway network due to the difficulty of raising sufficient capital to set up the lines. Up to the present time, we know little of the history of the secondary Spanish Railway network and we still lack research on its financing and political relations. The case of Richard Preece Williams is paradigmatic and hence the interest in undertaking its study. To this end, we consult, as our primary source, the relevant documentation in the Railway History Archive. Furthermore, we check the railway journal Gaceta de los Caminos de Hierro, the most significant journalistic source of the period. Finally, we use the <b>local</b> <b>bibliography</b> on the Richard Preece Williams railways. Establecidos los ejes radiales de ferrocarriles, grandes zonas de nuestro país permanecían aisladas. Con objeto de paliar esta carencia, entre los últimos años del XIX y los primeros del XX se promulgaron varios planes de ferrocarriles secundarios que contemplaban generosas ayudas para facilitar su construcción y compensar su posible explotación deficitaria. A raíz de esta llamada, llegaron un buen número de proyectos. Unos para intentar dar prosperidad a las comarcas más desfavorecidas y otros manejados por tortuosos aventureros en busca de las subvenciones. Aunque, ni unos, ni otros consiguieron dotar a España de una red complementaria de ferrocarriles por la dificultad de encontrar el capital necesario para establecer las líneas. Hasta el presente, poco conocemos de la historia de los ferrocarriles secundarios españoles y, todavía, echamos en falta investigaciones sobre su financiación y sus relaciones políticas. El caso de Richard Preece Williams es paradigmático. De ahí, el interés de su estudio. Para tal cometido, consultamos como fuente primaria los fondos del Archivo Histórico Ferroviario. Además, revisamos la Gaceta de los Caminos de Hierro, la más significativa fuente hemerográfica de la época, y, por último, utilizamos la bibliografía local referida a los ferrocarriles de Richard Preece Williams...|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{the book}} {{collection}} {{is estimated to}} contain over 30,000 volumes, among them over 20 printed before 1800. The strongest areas of the collection are history, literature, language, religion, folklore, <b>local</b> lore, <b>bibliography,</b> music and art. All standard reference works are available. A collection of expatriate publications, both books and periodicals, is fairly comprehensive. New publications from Belarus are being purchased regularly, {{as well as all}} important Belarus-related works appearing abroad in any language. Most of books are in Belarusian language, a fair number in Russian and Polish, fewer in German, French and other languages. The library receives over 40 current periodicals from Belarus and abroad. The serials collection has over 200 titles; some of them are rare pre-1939 publications. The cartographic collection consists of over 100 maps from the sixteenth century onwards. The collection of Belarusian music records on LPs is comprehensive; more recent records on cassettes and CDs are collected episodically, with the emphasis on folk, rock and classical music. The archive is extensive; it is the least studied area of the library collection. It contains Church documents of the 18 and 19th centuries, materials dating from the period of the Belarusian Democratic Republic (1918), archives of Belarusian organisations and personalities in exile.|$|R

25|$|In Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) China, the Yuejue Shu (越絕書) {{written in}} 52 AD is {{considered}} by modern sinologists and historians to be the prototype of the gazetteer (Chinese: difangzhi), as it contained essays {{on a wide variety}} of subjects including changes in territorial division, the founding of cities, local products, and customs. However, the first gazetteer proper is considered to be the Chronicles of Huayang by Chang Qu 常璩. There are over 8,000 gazetteers of pre-modern China that have survived. Gazetteers became more common in the Song dynasty (960–1279), yet the bulk of surviving gazetteers were written during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and Qing dynasty (1644–1912). Modern scholar Liu Weiyi notes that just under 400 gazetteers were compiled in the era between the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 and the Tang dynasty (618–907). Gazetteers from this era focused on boundaries and territory, place names, mountains and rivers, ancient sites, local products, local myths and legends, customs, botany, topography, and locations of palaces, streets, temples, etc. By the Tang dynasty the gazetteer became much more geographically specific, with a broad amount of content arranged topically; for example, there would be individual sections devoted to local astronomy, schools, dikes, canals, post stations, altars, local deities, temples, tombs, etc. By the Song dynasty it became more common for gazetteers to provide biographies of local celebrities, accounts of elite <b>local</b> families, <b>bibliographies,</b> and literary anthologies of poems and essays dedicated to famous local spots. Song gazetteers also made lists and descriptions of city walls, gate names, wards and markets, districts, population size, and residences of former prefects.|$|R

40|$|Oil is a {{major source}} of income for Nigeria and it is the {{mainstay}} of the country’s economy. Nigeria’s intensive oil sector accounts for nearly 40 % of its gross domestic product, but declined steadily to an average of 14. 71 % of the country’s total export between 2006 and 20111; and contributed about 80 % of budgetary revenues that all tiers of government heavily depend on. 2 Oil spills and gas flaring are some {{of the effects of the}} unregulated exploratory activities of the oil multinational companies that have contributed immensely to the physical and mental illness of the local inhabitants of the Niger Delta region and violated most of their rights as guaranteed under international and regional human rights instruments and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) 1999. In view of the growing threats to human health and the environment (posed by human activities), the international community has agreed to a number of treaties to respond to the health and human rights challenges posed by environmental degradation. Although Nigeria is a party to most of these instruments, 3 it has done little or nothing to regulate the conduct of the oil companies that negatively impact on the health of the Niger Delta people. While the impact of oil extraction affects both men and women, the article focuses on its implications for women’s reproductive well-being. This is because women are a disadvantaged and marginalised group and have continued to experience discriminatory practices in many parts of the country, including the Niger Delta area. The article discusses the health challenges associated with oil exploitation in the Niger Delta, paying attention to the position of women. It then proffers suggestions on measures and steps that could be taken by the Nigerian government and other stakeholders in ensuring the adequate protection of the health rights of <b>local</b> inhabitants.
