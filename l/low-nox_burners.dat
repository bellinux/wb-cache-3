50|$|On January 17, 2013, the EPA {{proposed}} a BART ruling to further reduce NOx emissions:The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing a source-specific federal implementation plan (FIP) requiring the Navajo Generating Station (NGS), {{located on the}} Navajo Nation, to reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO X) under the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) provision of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) {{in order to reduce}} visibility impairment resulting from NGS at 11 National Parks and Wilderness Areas. NGS, which was built over 35 years ago, is the largest coal-fired power plant in the West in terms of generating capacity. It is central to the economies of the Navajo Nation and Hopi Tribe and supplies power to the states of Arizona, Nevada, and California. Electricity produced by NGS is also used to power the Central Arizona Project, which supplies surface water to three counties and numerous Indian tribes in Arizona. NGS is projected to continue operating at least until 2044. EPA is proposing to require NGS to achieve a nearly 80 percent reduction of its current overall NO X emission rate. Our analysis indicates that installation of controls to achieve this reduction would result in significant visibility improvement that is well-balanced with the cost of those controls. For a number of reasons, including the importance of NGS to numerous Indian tribes located in Arizona and the federal government's reliance on NGS to meet the requirements of water settlements with several tribes, EPA is proposing an alternative to BART that would provide flexibility to NGS in the schedule for the installation of new control equipment. We also describe other compliance schedules for consideration and comment. We recognize that there may be other approaches that could result in equivalent or better visibility benefits over time and that there may be changes in energy demand, supply or other developments over the next several decades that may change electricity generation on the Navajo Nation. EPA encourages a robust public discussion of our proposed BART determination and alternative, the additional alternatives described herein, and other possible approaches. EPA is prepared to issue a supplemental proposal if approaches other than the proposed BART determination or {{proposed a}}lternative articulated in this notice are identified as satisfying the requirements of the Clean Air Act and meeting the needs of the stakeholders. EPA is committed to continuing to engage with stakeholders to develop a final FIP that maintains benefits to tribes and the regional economy while improving visibility in many of our nation's most treasured National Parks and Wilderness Areas. The ruling would require the plant to reduce NOx emissions to no more than 0.055 lb/ MMBtu by 2023, necessitating the installation of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) equipment. The SCRs would need to reduce NOx by about 15,000 tons per year. Along with the existing <b>Low-NOx</b> <b>burners,</b> the total reduction would be about 29,000 tons per year below 2008 levels.|$|E

Although this technology involves a number of advantages, it is appropriate to mention some of its disadvantages such as refractory damage, inconsistent heating, increased pollutant emission or flame disturbance and/or flashback.

Among the conclusions are that a boiler's efficiency falls with rising cetane index, whereas the level of emitted particulate falls with rising cetane index but rises with sulphur content. Similar increases are observed for the emitted SO 2, which exhibits an almost linear behaviour relative to sulphur content. The NO(x) values fall with rising cetane index; the important observation {{here is that the}} accepted international limit NO(x) value of 120 mg m- 3 at 3 % O 2 could not be attained even with the 'best' fuel used; this highlights the importance of using <b>low-NO(x)</b> <b>burners...</b>|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the {{coal-fired}} power industry began a more accelerated move toward using <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> (LNB) technologies to reduce NOx emissions. Most LNBs incorporate less oxygen with the coal initially, creating a cooler and somewhat substoichiometric initial combustion zone, with additional oxygen added further on in the combustion process to complete char combustion. Another method used to achieve lower NOx emissions is to fire the coal substoichiometrically and add additional air through overfire air ports. Both of these methods create certain impacts on fireside performance that are different from conventional high-excess-air firing arrangements. Some of the impacts that have been noticed by the utility industry are higher levels of unburned carbon in the fly ash and bottom ash, increased boiler tube corrosion, higher particulate loadings on control devices, and changes in slagging in the main furnace. Work on the fundamental mechanisms of entrained ash and ash deposit formation during low-NOx combustion has been sparse. This project by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) focuses on the issues of entrained ash formation and slagging for low-NOx combustion systems in general. Time-resolved combustion tests under conventional and low-NOx conditions have been conducted to note particle-size formation and slagging deposition. The results from this work are yielding an increased understanding of the mechanisms of ash formation during low-NOx combustion along with methods for enhancing heat transfer and fly ash collectability. Specific objectives of this research project include (1) determining whether initial char and ash generated under low-NOx conditions have greater tendencies for slagging than conventionally generated ash and (2) determining the differences, if any, between particle size and composition for entrained ash generated under low-NOx and conventional combustion conditions...|$|R

Development of the <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> technology has been a focus in B&W's combustion program. The DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner (see Figure 1. 1) is B&W's newest low-NO{sub x} burner capable of achieving very low NO{sub x}. The burner is designed to reduce NO{sub x} by diverting air away from {{the core of the}} flame, which reduces local stoichiometry during coal devolatilization and, thereby, reduces initial NO{sub x} formation. Figure 1. 2 shows the historical NO{sub x} emission levels from different B&W burners. Figure 1. 2 shows that based on three large-scale commercial installations of the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burners in combination with OFA ports, using Western subbituminous coal, the NO{sub x} emissions ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 18 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. It appears that with continuing research and development the Ozone Transport Rule (OTR) emission level of 0. 15 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu is within the reach of combustion modification techniques for boilers using western U.

Although NO{sub x} emissions from the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner are nearing OTR emission level with subbituminous coals, the utility boiler owners that use bituminous coals can still benefit from the addition of an SNCR and/or SCR system in order to comply with the stringent NO{sub x} emission levels facing them...|$|R

40|$|INTERNATIONAL Regulatory agencies, consultants, and {{utilities}} have made assumptions regarding the NOx reduction capabilities of selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) on large, coal-fired boilers (> 500 MW).

40|$|Owing {{to recent}} strict legislation, {{environmental}} impact of combustion processes is nowadays {{one of the most}} important problems involving both scientific community and burner manufacturers. In the case of natural gas combustion, nitric oxides (NOx) reduction is the most critical aim to achieve, often requesting for industrial applications heavy and highcost plant revamping (for instance, adoption of <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> or burned gases de-NOx treatment). Moreover, although NOx formation mechanisms are today quite understood, many unsolved questions are connected to the interaction between fluid dynamic and chemistry inside the burner device and this makes the CFD codes not yet fully predictive.

40|$|Scope of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the oxide scale formation on metallic high-temperature alloys resulting during reaction with the atmosphere of the combustion of industrial gas oil (IGO). The Ni-Cr-based alloys 601 (2. 4851), 602 (2. 4633), 603, 693 and 617 (2. 4663) were tested at elevated temperatures between 900 °C and 1050 °C in a burner rig equipped with a <b>low-NOx</b> recirculation <b>burner</b> by application as material of the burner flame tube. Further on, the oxide scale on a woven wire cloth made of a Ni-Cr-based alloy was analysed. The wire cloth was used as the hot surface of a radiant burner at temperatures of approximately 685 °C for an operation time of 844 h. All alloys investigated in the <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> rig showed following oxide scale structure: a chromium oxide scale at the alloy surface and aluminium or silicon oxide (on alloy 603) beneath. Particles with a composition {{similar to that of the}} bulk alloy were found enclosed in the chromium oxide scale. Frequently these particles were located near the oxide-gas boundary indicating an impending local degradation of the chromium oxide scale. Aluminium oxide grew predominantly along grain boundaries in the depth of the bulk. During the test period of up to 3000 h no aluminium oxide scale was found. For longer investigation times accelerated internal oxidation of aluminium was observed. In contrast to aluminium, silicon formed an albeit noncontinuous scale of silicon oxide directly below the chromium oxide layer. The diffusion of chromium towards the surface was inhibited by the silicon scale, which resulted in a slower kinetic of the chromium oxide growth and consequently a thinner chromium oxide scale. However, as the silicon oxide scale was not protective. Mo-oxides formed in the bulk – Mo being an alloying element of alloy 603 – followed by breakaway oxidation. In case of the aluminium alloyed material the formation of nitrides in the bulk indicated the breakdown of the oxide scale. Failure of the alloys was related to massive inward nitrogen diffusion and the formation of aluminium nitrides in the bulk. Therefore it is assumed that in nitrogen rich atmospheres a high aluminium content is unfavourable due to the strong affinity of aluminium to nitrogen. In general it was observed, that at lower temperatures, as a result of a slower growth kinetic, the nitride formation began later. Short term tests of 50 hours of alloy 602, alloy 603 and alloy 693 showed, that a thicker and more uniform oxide layer formed when the burner was operated with standard quality IGO (1700 mg/kg S), compared with the oxide scale formed in the case of operation with fuel with reduced sulphur content (20 mg/kg S). Ventilation with air after burner shut down had no significant effect on chromium oxide scale thickness. The time dependence of the observed growth of the chromium oxide scale was fitted with a power law. A deviation from the parabolic law has been found indicating an oxide loss due to spallation. Reasonable estimation of life time was achieved by logarithmic plots of the time dependence of the chromium depletion measured by line scans on cross sections of the samples. The metallographic investigation of the hot surface of the radiant burner showed a thin continuous chromium oxide layer. No indication of damage of the scale, a small depth of internal oxidation and the absence of a significant chromium depletion zone were found. Hence, a long life time of the woven wire cloth can be expected...|$|R

To prevent the unburned combustibles emission, the diffusion burner used in the tube-nested combustor needs a high performance of the fuel-air mixing. Multi-port burner consists of a fuel-port and surrounding multi-air-ports, which induce a strong re-circulation flow. Thus the fuel-air mixing is enhanced so that the thermal NOx and CO emissions are significantly reduced. The NOx emission of the DME from the co-axial diffusion burner was over 130 ppm at 0 % O_ 2.

40|$|The {{increasing}} role of coal as {{a source}} of energy in the 21 st century will demand environmental and cost-effective strategies for the use of coal combustion by-products (CCBPs), mainly fly ash containing unburned carbon. However, the carbonaceous residue in fly ash, unburned carbon (UC), is a potential precursor for the production of adsorbent carbons, since it has gone through a devolatilization process while in the combustor, and therefore, only requires to be activated. Accordingly, this research program focuses on the development of activated carbons from the unburned carbon present in fly ash. During the present reporting period (June 30, 1999 [...] June 29, 2000), Task 1 ''Procurement and characterization of CCBPs'' was initiated and samples from various combustion systems were collected. The suite assembled thus far includes samples from pulverized utility boilers with <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> and Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system, and also from an utility cyclone unit. The characterization studies showed that the sample from the cyclone unit contained the highest carbon content (LOI of {approx} 80 %), since this unit has been retrofitted with a technology to separate the unburned carbon from the fly ash. In contrast, the sample from the unit retrofitted with a Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system showed the lowest carbon content with LOI values around 2 - 4 %. The samples from the utility boilers with <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> were collected from the hot-side hoppers and present carbon contents {approx} 50 %. The BET (N{sub 2 } 77 K) surface areas of the samples investigated were between 30 - 40 m{sup 2 }/g and the pore volume is mainly due to mesopores. In addition, during this reporting period, also Task 2 ''Development of activated carbons'' and Task 3 ''Characterization of activated carbons'' were initiated. The investigations showed that after steam activation at 850 C, the unburned carbon samples generated activated carbons with microporous structure and surface areas up to 443 m{sup 2 }/g. The samples activated with steam present generally higher surface areas than those using CO{sub 2 } or KOH pretreatment, probably due to the faster reaction rate of steam. The activation process could tailor the inherent mesoporosity of these materials into the desired porosity for a specific application, since the mesophore volume accounted for {approx} 66 % of the total pore volume for the parent samples, while after steam activation the micropore volume accounted for over 60 % of the total...|$|E

The {{short-term}} goal of {{the research}} is to develop advanced in-furnace technologies for coal-fired power plants capable of controlling NOx emissions {{to a level of}} 0. 15 pounds per million Btu heat input (lb/MMBtu) by 2007 and 0. 10 lb/MMBtu by 2010, while achieving a levelized cost savings of at least 25 % compared to state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control technology. The program’s long-term goal is to further develop a combination of advanced in-furnace and SCR control technologies to achieve a NOx emission rate of 0. 01 lb/MMBtu by 2020. The advanced NOx research program takes a holistic approach to pollutant control by not only addressing NOx emissions control technologies, but also important balance-of-plant issues associated with those technologies such as unburned carbon, ammonia slip, and sulfuric acid emissions. This paper provides an update on the status of DOE/NETL’s advanced in-furnace NOx control R&D efforts. Commercially-available <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> (LNB) and SCR NOx control technologies are enabling industry compliance with today’s regulatory requirements. However, the NOx control technologies under development by DOE/NETL will provide more costeffective options for coal-fired power plants to comply with the ever more stringen...|$|E
40|$|Fossil fuel combustion, such as coal combustion, {{currently}} {{meets the}} majority of the global energy demand; however, the process also produces a significant proportion of the worldwide CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Further improvement in the efficiency and control of the combustion process is needed, as well as the implementation of novel technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Oxy-fuel combustion is a very promising CCS technology, where the air in the combustion process is replaced with a mixture of recycled flue gas and oxygen producing a high CO 2 outflow that can effectively be processed or stored. The adjustment of the combustion environment within the boiler resulting from the high CO 2 concentration will modify the flame characteristics. It is therefore important to evaluate properly the changes of the flame that occur with different flue gas recycle schemes. A coal flame is often characterised by its physical parameters, such as the flame size, shape, brightness and temperature, and it can be considered as a stable flame by the presence of ignition and the propagation of the flame. The oscillatory behaviour of a flame can be quantified by the flicker frequency obtained after the instantaneous variations of the flame parameters, and is used as a reference for flame stability. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used to model coal combustion. This work compares the estimated flicker frequency taken from CFD calculations against measurements undertaken at the experimental facilities of the UKCCSRC Pilot-scale Advanced Capture Technology (PACT) located in South Yorkshire, UK. The 250 kW combustion test facility consists of a down-fired, refractory lined cylindrical furnace, which is 4 m in height with a 0. 9 m internal diameter. The furnace is fitted with a scaled version of a commercially available Doosan Babcock <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner.</b> The flame physical parameters are approximated from performing a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using the CFD code ANSYS FLUENT v 15. The flicker frequency obtained from the CFD approach is compared against the experimentally measured value from a 2 D flame imaging system. A series of oxy-fuel cases are then examined in the same fashion in order to assess their flame stability and the boiler operational limit. The flicker frequency trend obtained from the computations and measurements helps to determine the dynamic response of the flame for different combustion environments, and the results will be applicable in determining the optimal recycle ratio applied in future oxy-fuel systems...|$|R
40|$|The team of TIAX LLC, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company, and Callidus Technologies, LLC {{conducted}} a six-year program {{to develop an}} ultra-low emission process heater burner and an advanced high efficiency heater design. This project addresses the critical need of process heater operators for reliable, economical emission reduction technologies to comply with stringent emission regulations, and for heater design alternatives that reduce process heater energy requirements without significant cost increase. The key project targets were NOx emissions of 10 ppm (@ 3 % O 2), and a heater thermal efficiency of 95 percent. The ultra low NOx burner was developed {{through a series of}} pilot-scale and field tests combined with computational fluid dynamic modeling to arrive at simultaneous low emissions and suitable flame shape and stability. Pilot scale tests were run at TIAX, at the 2 MMBtu/hr scale, and at Callidus at 8 MMBtu/hr. The full scale burner was installed on a 14 burner atmospheric pipestill furnace at an ExxonMobil refinery. A variety of burner configurations, gas tips and flame stabilizers were tested to determine the lowest emissions with acceptable flame shape and stability. The resulting NOx emissions were 22 ppm on average. Starting in 2001, Callidus commercialized the original ultra low NOx burner and made subsequent design improvements in a series of commercial burners evolving from the original concept and/or development. Emissions in the field with the ultra <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> over a broad spectrum of heater applications have varied from 5 ppm to 30 ppm depending on heater geometry, heater service, fuel and firing capacity. To date, 1550 of the original burners, and 2500 of subsequent generation burners have been sold by Callidus. The advanced heater design was developed by parametric evaluations of a variety of furnace and combustion air preheater configurations and technologies for enhancing convective and radiative heat transfer. The design evolution relied heavily on computational fluid dynamic predictions of design alternatives. The final design features modular separate radiant cells, each with one and two-side fired vertical tubes. The convection section configuration is vertical tube banks enclosed in the radiant channels. Commercial modular plate air preheaters are used. The predicted performance for the integrated advanced heater and Callidus burner is 95 percent efficiency with 9 ppm NOx emissions firing natural gas, and 12 ppm firing refinery gas. The total erected cost is less than a conventional heater with combustion air preheat...|$|R
40|$|The Stirling {{engine is}} a {{promising}} prime mover for micro-scale combined heat and power. For Stirling engines with heat supply by combustion, the external heating system {{is one of}} the most important parts. It has major infulence on the overall performance. The central component of the external heating system is the burner. This thesis describes the theoretical and experimental studies in the developement of a gas fired burner for the external heating system that have been carried out. The focus was on low emissions and high system efficency. As a first step, a system analysis of the external heating system is presented based on fundamental considerations about the thermodynamics and practical aspects of the Stirling engine. The results of the analysis show that the expected NOx emissions are strongly determined by the system design. Without making any restrictions to the burner desing, a span of the NOx emissions with a ratio of 1 : 800 was found. Modern design methodology is then introduced in order to analyze a large number of different <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> concepts that were found in literature. The concepts are evaluated and classified with help of the methodology in order to find possible new low-NOx concepts by favourable combinations of generic principles. Based on this, the concept of the porous inert media (PIM) burner is chosen for further development as a burner for the Stirling engine. The selection is confirmed by an experimental benchmark study in which the PIM burner showes low NOx emissions and the lowest pressure drop compared to three other low- NOx burner concepts. The optimization of the design of the PIM burner is described. A fovourable combination of materials was found, which enables stable operation with a turn-down ration of 1 : 15 and a span of the excess-air ratio from 1. 28 to 2. 0 when methane is used as the fuel. Temperature and CO measurements inside the combustion region were made which enable conclusion about the stabilization of the combustion process. Finally, the behaviour of the PIM burner with different fuel gases like methane, propane, methane-hydrogen mixtures and syngas is presented based on experimental results. Stability and emissions of CO and NOx under different operating conditions are discussed. The possible pathways of formation of NOx are analysed. Strong correlation of the NOx emissions with the temperature at the burner outlet is found. Based on this, a way of predicting the NOx emissions by simple empirical correlations that are valid for all fuels gases that have been used is presented. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
