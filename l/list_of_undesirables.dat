The photo strips told in action sequence the story of young women arriving from the provinces to the Berlin metropolis to seek their fortunes and represent a technical step between static pictures and motion picture films. In 1933, even though the Nazi Party began shutting down Jewish owned businesses and published her name on a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>undesirables,</b> Yva decided to expand her business. In part, the ambiguity of the Nazi policies, her assimilation into the non-Jewish community, and her employment of ten assistants who were not Jewish, led Yva to {{a false sense of}} safety. She did not experience anti-Semitism from her advertising and fashion clients, and first moved to a larger studio on Bleibtreustraße before relocating again the following year to Schlüterstraße, shortly after her marriage. In 1934, she married Alfred Simon, who gave up his own career to manage the business aspects of Yva's firm.|$|E

40|$|Contrary to Granovetter’s {{hypothesis}} that salient job information derives from "weak ties " (acquaintances), {{this study of}} 299 social and physical scientists at one Canadian and one U. S. university reveals that "strong ties " (intimates) were approximately seven times more prevalent than "weak ties. " Furthermore, with only one exception (U. S. graduates who obtained Canadian academic positions), the reliance on "weak ties " for job information declined from 1920 to 1978. Although a greater amount of job information can be obtained through weak ties, the problem is to locate only the few openings for which one would be seriously considered and would consider accepting. Long <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> <b>undesirable</b> unobtainable positions are of little interest.

It {{should be based on}} integrated financing and delivery systems [...] partnerships that link doctors, hospitals and insurers [...] with per capita prepayment, with providers at risk for cost of care and cost of poor quality, publicly accountable for quality and per capita costs. The ideal {{market structure}} must be managed by active intelligent collective purchasing agents, called sponsors, that contract with health care systems and set the rules of competition. Sponsors structure and manage the enrollment process; they create price-elastic demand; they manage risk selection; and they create and administer equitable rules of coverage. Microeconomic theory tells us what sponsors should do to get the market incentives right. There is no comparable political theory to tell us how their boards of directors should be constituted.

40|$|M. A. (Afrikaans) When the {{collection}} of short texts, Sleep vir jou In stoel nader, was first published, reactions were varied. Many literary critics heralded the texts as new, exciting and of great literary value. However, {{a few members of}} the public objected to the texts' risque content and it was subsequently banned. Fortunately, the text's literary value prevailed and Sleep vir jou 'n stoel nader was removed from the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>undesirable</b> publications. Andre Ie Roux's work is unique in that he based the fiction on his day to day experiences as a journalist. Because the book is controversial, it is necessary to outline the theoretical aspects, such as reception history, in the introductory chapter. The role of the critics in the reception of the texts is specifically studied as their reviews appeared mainly in newspapers and magazines. Most of the critics mentioned the fact that {{the collection}} of short texts had been banned and questioned the role of censorship in literature. These reviews (which are mentioned in the first chapter) have several shortcomings which are discussed in the third chapter. Several critics mentioned aspects of the different literary trends that are evident in the texts, such as Postmodernism, Realism and New journalism. Aspects of these literary trends are discussed in depth in the second chapter. The interplay between reality (the Huisgenoot-texts) and fiction (the short stories and poems) are carefully considered. The two related texts are compared and analysed, for example, determining which facts are present in the articles but are not utilised in the texts. This establishes {{the manner in which the}} author used and transformed these facts to create fiction [...] ...|$|R

To arrive at these requirements a rough estimate of the required analyses, their scope and their frequency has been compiled. This is expected to serve as a basis for the Laboratories Division to outline their space and equipment requirements as soon as possible and to assemble the required personnel for operation later. Crucial elements encountered in the process are classed as light impurities or as metallurgical impurities. The light elements are undesirable due to the {alpha}, n reaction with plutonium. The metallurgical impurities are undesirable since they change the physical properties of plutonium. The light elements undesirable in the finished product and the approximate tolerances (in ppM of plutonium) acceptable for each are listed assuming all other elements listed are absent.

40|$|The {{ornamental}} aquaculture comprises both outdoor and {{indoor keeping}} of aquatic {{animals and plants}} for ornamental purpose {{which is a very}} popular hobby with many followers worldwide. It is also commercially profitable for specialized producers and vendors. Associated environmental risks include particularly introduction of non-native species, biological invasions and intensive field capture of exploited and marketed species. Since subsequent regulation, mitigation and eradication of naturalised alien species is very difficult and ineffective in many cases, the most important above all is to prevent new introductions. This trend is accented with a short delay in European legislature. The European Union (EU) currently initiates formation <b>of</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> the most invasive alien species. Although invasive potential of certain ornamental species such as red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is well known, the vast majority of traded species has never been tested and analysed from this point of view. Publications attached to this thesis are focused on monitoring and survey of market with ornamental animals, such as fishes and crayfishes, with special emphasis on <b>list</b> <b>of</b> advertised species, size classes, prices, origin and availability on market. With use of predictive models the probability of naturalisation and potential invasiveness of mentioned ornamental species were estimated. These information are supported by analysis of hobbyist behaviour. Results in present thesis highlight known environmental risks associated with ornamental aquaculture and also show detailed information about overlooked risks from the Czech Republic's as well as from EU perspective. Therefore this thesis should to help formation <b>of</b> aforementioned <b>list</b> <b>of</b> the <b>undesirable</b> species...|$|R

40|$|Grading is an integral, {{inevitable}} part of educational-upbringing {{process and}} presents an especially sensitive segment of teaching practice. With regard to that, {{the aim of}} our research was directed towards determining and analysing what pupils think {{about the process of}} grading and teachers in the context of grading. This research comprised 200 primary school pupils and 200 grammar school pupils. The questions were grouped into three thematic wholes (pupil's perception of teacher's actions in the process of grading; identification of pupil's preferred ways of grading and their reactions to grades and desirable and <b>undesirable</b> characteristics <b>of</b> teachers in the context of grading from pupil's perspective). On the basis of our findings, it can be concluded that pupils think: that teachers apply lower criteria when grading bad pupils, that they use grades as a disciplinary measure and that they are guided by pupil's grades in other subjects when grading. The grade is a strong motivator of a more active engagement of pupils in teaching process, where pupils especially appreciate regular checking and objective grading in teachers and object to excessively strict and unequal criterion of grading. The paper also provides the <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> desirable and <b>undesirable</b> characteristics <b>of</b> teachers in the context of grading, perceived on the part of pupils...|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920s, Wedderkop {{was a member of the}} advisory committee of the artists' association Das Junge Rheinland. In the series Junge Kunst published by Verlag Klinkhardt and Biermann Leipzig, he published the volumes on Paul Klee (1920) and Marie Laurencin (1921). From 1921 he was an employee of the Der Querschnitt. As editor, Wedderkop succeeded in making Der Querschnitt into the leading German Zeitgeist magazine of the 1920s: open to the artistic avant-garde, such as Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall or Fernand Léger, as well as the heroes of boxing, ironically elitist and artistic photos of male and female nude models. In Ernest Hemingway's posthumous memoirs [...] "A Moveable Feast", Wedderkop is mentioned as a purchaser of his works and described as awfully nice. The fact that Wedderkop was replaced by a chief editor in 1929 by the Ullstein Verlag, and that he was removed from his editor's post in May 1931, is said to have had something to do with Wedderkop's publicist enthusiasm for Benito Mussolini, according to Wilmont Haacke. Wedderkop visited Mussolini on May 5 and October 10, 1930, and on May 28, 1935. He spent most of the time of Nazi Germany in Italy.
