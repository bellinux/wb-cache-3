2500|$|In chemistry, the suffix -yne is used {{to denote}} the {{presence}} of a triple bond. In organic chemistry, the suffix often follows IUPAC nomenclature. However, inorganic compounds featuring unsaturation in the form of triple bonds may be denoted by substitutive nomenclature with the same methods used with alkynes (i.e. the name of the corresponding saturated compound is modified by replacing the [...] "-ane" [...] ending with [...] "-yne"). [...] "-diyne" [...] is used when there are two triple bonds, and so on. The position of unsaturation is indicated by a numerical <b>locant</b> immediately preceding the [...] "-yne" [...] suffix, or 'locants' in the case of multiple triple bonds. Locants are chosen so that the numbers are low as possible. [...] "-yne" [...] is also used as an infix to name substituent groups that are triply bound to the parent compound.|$|E
50|$|The <b>locant</b> is {{the number}} of the carbon atom to which the oxygen atom is bonded. If the oxygen is bonded to the middle carbon, the <b>locant</b> is 3. If the oxygen is bonded to an atom on either side (adjacent to an end carbon), the <b>locant</b> is 2 or 4; given the choice here, where the carbons are exactly equivalent, the lower number is always chosen. So the <b>locant</b> is either 2 or 3 in this molecule.|$|E
50|$|In organic chemistry, a <b>locant</b> is {{a figure}} to {{indicate}} {{the position of a}} functional group within a molecule.|$|E
5000|$|... syn and anti {{are always}} written small and italic, <b>locants</b> (if used) {{are placed in}} front of the word and {{separated}} by hyphens.|$|R
50|$|Whatever {{method is}} used, all polymer names have the prefix poly, {{followed}} by enclosing marks around {{the rest of}} the name. The marks are used in the order: {)}. <b>Locants</b> indicate the position of structural features, e.g., poly(4-chlorostyrene). If the name is one word and has no <b>locants,</b> then the enclosing marks are not essential, but they should be used when there might be confusion, e.g., poly(chlorostyrene) is a polymer whereas polychlorostyrene might be a small, multi-substituted molecule. End-groups are described with α- and ω-, e.g., α-chloro-ω-hydroxy-polystyrene.|$|R
50|$|Typographically, (R) and (S) {{are placed}} in {{uppercase}} and italic; the frequently preceding <b>locants,</b> the enclosing round brackets and the commas, on the other hand, as normal.|$|R
5000|$|... a In {{accordance}} with IUPAC organic nomenclature, square brackets indicate {{the nature of}} the <b>locant</b> sites in fused ring systems.|$|E
5000|$|Has the lowest-numbered locants for {{multiple}} bonds (The <b>locant</b> of a multiple bond {{is the number}} of the adjacent carbon with a lower number).|$|E
5000|$|Has the lowest-numbered <b>locant</b> (or locants) for the suffix {{functional}} group. Locants are {{the numbers}} on the carbons to which the substituent is directly attached.|$|E
50|$|CAS {{maintains}} a registry of substances. In the CAS system, the CRU {{is called a}} structural repeating unit (SRU). There are minor differences in the placements of <b>locants,</b> e.g., poly(pyridine-3,5-diylthiophene-2,5-diyl) is poly(3,5-pyridinediyl-2,5-thiophenediyl) in the CAS registry, but otherwise polymers are named using similar methods to those of IUPAC.|$|R
40|$|There are {{situations}} in chemical nomenclature where duplication of <b>locants</b> creates difficulties (a) in describing modifications to chemical structures, (b) in describing stereochemistry, (c) in identifying isotopically-labeled atoms, and (d) in uniquely identifying atoms for crystallography, Nodal nomenclature {{is shown to}} avoid these problems and to simplify such descriptions...|$|R
5000|$|Numbering of {{the various}} substituents and bonds with their <b>locants.</b> If {{there is more than}} one of the same type of substituent/double bond, a prefix is added showing how many there are ( [...] di - 2 tri - 3 tetra - 4 then as for the number of carbons below with a added) ...|$|R
5000|$|That an {{associated}} <b>locant</b> number represents {{the location of}} a covalent bond in an organic compound, the position of which is variant between isomeric forms ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>locant</b> is {{incorporated}} into {{the name of the}} molecule to remove ambiguity. Thus the molecule is named either pentan-2-one or pentan-3-one, depending on the position of the oxygen atom.|$|E
5000|$|Ethenylidene (without the -1- <b>locant)</b> or vinylidene, is used, systematically, {{to refer}} to the {{substituent}} group (...) [...] It is used, non-systematically, {{to refer to}} substituent group ethene-1,1-diyl (...) [...] Care should be taken to avoid confusing the names of the groups for the context-specific names for methylidenecarbene given above.|$|E
50|$|A {{descriptor}} is {{in chemical}} nomenclature a prefix placed before the systematic substance name, which describes the configuration or the stereochemistry of the molecule. Some listed descriptors are only of historical interest {{and should not}} be used in publications anymore as they do not correspond with the modern recommendations of the IUPAC. Stereodescriptors are often used in combination with <b>locants</b> to clearly identify a chemical structure unambiguously.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example is}} [...] The {{preferred}} CRU is an acyclic subunit of 4 carbon atoms with 4 free valences, one at each atom, as shown. [...] It is {{oriented so that}} the lower left atom has the lowest number. The free-valence <b>locants</b> are written before the suffix, and they are cited clockwise from the lower left position as: lower-left, upper-left:upper-right, lower-right. This example is thus named poly(butane-1,4:3,2-tetrayl). For more complex structures, the order of seniority again follows Figure 1.|$|R
50|$|For the {{attribution}} of (E) or (Z) {{is based on}} the relative position of the two substituents of highest priority are {{on each side of the}} double bond, while the priority {{is based on the}} CIP nomenclature. The (E)/(Z) nomenclature can be applied to any double bond systems (including heteroatoms), but not to substituted ring systems. The descriptors (E) and (Z) are always capitalized, set italic and surrounded by round brackets which are set as normal just like additional <b>locants</b> or commas.|$|R
5000|$|If one {{molecule}} contains several stereocenters, a <b>locant</b> must {{be placed}} before the descriptor (for example, in (1R, 2S)-2-amino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol, the systematic designation of norephedrine). If all stereocenters are configured the same, the naming of the locants can be omitted {{in favor of an}} [...] "all-R" [...] or [...] "(all-S)" [...] spelling.|$|E
50|$|In {{the above}} example, the oxy {{subunits}} in the CRUs are heteroatom chains. From Figure 1, oxy subunits are senior to the acyclic carbon chain subunits, {{the largest of}} which are bromo-substituted -CH2-CH2- subunits. 1-Bromoethane-1,2-diyl is chosen in preference to 2- bromoethane-1,2-diyl as the former has a lower <b>locant</b> for the bromo-substituent. The preferred CRU is therefore oxy(1-bromoethane-1,2-diyl) and the polymer is thus named polyoxy(1-bromoethane-1,2-diyl). Please note the enclosing marks around the subunit carrying the substituent.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} name isobutane {{was still}} {{retained in the}} 1993 IUPAC recommendations, but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations. Since the longest continuous chain in isobutane contains only three carbon atoms, the preferred IUPAC name is 2-methylpropane but the <b>locant</b> (2-) is typically omitted in general nomenclature as redundant; C2 is the only position on a propane chain where a methyl substituent can be located without altering the main chain and forming the constitutional isomer n-butane.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA succinct linear {{notation}} system to encode {{the structure of}} a graph is exemplified. The notation requires a prior canonical numbering of the graph nodes based on the lengths of a longest path and path branches, and uses <b>locants</b> to designate branch positions and cyclicity. An algorithm and computer program to obtain the longest paths and a spanning tree containing a longest path is described. An index which measures the similarity of a pair of graphs is defined based on a comparison of their linear codes...|$|R
50|$|A Hantzsch-Widman {{name will}} always contain a prefix, which {{indicates}} the type of heteroatom present in the ring, and a stem, which indicates both {{the total number of}} atoms and {{the presence or absence of}} double bonds. The name may include more than one prefix, if more than one type of heteroatom is present; a multiplicative prefix if there are several heteroatoms of the same type; and <b>locants</b> to indicate the relative positions of the different atoms. Hantzsch-Widman names may be combined with other aspects of organic nomenclature, to indicate substitution or fused-ring systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{abbreviation}} o- (short for ortho, from Greek orthós for upright, straight), m- (meta, Greek (roughly) for between) and p- (para, from Greek pará for adjoining, to the side) {{describe the}} three possible positional isomers of two substituents on a benzene ring. These are usually two independent single substituents, but {{in case of}} fused ring systems, ortho-fusing is also mentioned unless the substitution pattern is regarded in the name like in 2.2paracyclophane. In the current systematic nomenclature, o-, m- and p- are often replaced by using <b>locants</b> (1,2-dimethylbenzene instead of o-xylene).|$|R
5000|$|... exo (from Greek = outside) or endo (from Greek endon = inside) {{denotes the}} {{relative}} configuration of bridged bicyclic compounds. The {{position of a}} substituent in the main ring relative to the shortest bridge is decisive for the assignment of exo or endo (according to IUPAC: the bridge with the highest <b>locant</b> digits in the bridged ring system). The substituent to be classified is attributed with the exo descriptor when facing the bridge. It is endo configured when facing away from the bridge. If two different substituents are located on the same C atom, the exo/endo assignment {{is based on the}} substituent with higher priority according to the CIP rules.|$|E
5000|$|The suffix follows IUPAC nomenclature, and {{is mainly}} used in organic chemistry. However, {{inorganic}} compounds featuring unsaturation {{in the form}} of triple bonds may be denoted by substitutive nomenclature with the same methods used with alkynes, i.e., the name of thecorresponding saturated hydride is modified by replacing the [...] "-ane" [...] ending with [...] "-yne". [...] "-diyne" [...] is used when there are two triple bonds, and so on. The position of unsaturation is indicated by a numerical <b>locant</b> immediately preceding the [...] "-yne" [...] suffix, or 'locants' in the case of multiple triple bonds. Locants are chosen to be as low as possible. [...] "-yne" [...] is also used as an infix to name substituent groups that are triply bound to the parent compound.|$|E

5000|$|In {{place of}} the monomer name used in source-based {{nomenclature}}, structure-based nomenclature uses that of the preferred constitutional repeating unit (CRU). [...] It can be determined as follows: (i) a large enough part of the polymer chain is drawn to show the structural repetition, e.g.,(ii) the smallest repeating portion is a CRU, so all such possibilities are identified. In this case:(iii) {{the next step is}} to identify the subunits that make up each of these structures, i.e., the largest divalent groups that can be named using IUPAC nomenclature of organic compounds such as the examples that are listed in Table 3; (iv) using the shortest path from the most senior subunit to the next senior, the correct order of the subunits is determined using Figure 1; (v) the preferred CRU is chosen as that with the lowest possible <b>locant(s)</b> for substituents.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Blue Book, this {{chemical}} can be systematically {{named as}} 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbenzene. The <b>locants</b> are superfluous, however, {{as the name}} hexamethylbenzene uniquely identifies a single substance and thus is the formal IUPAC name for the compound. It is an aromatic compound, with six π electrons (satisfying Hückel's rule with n = 1) delocalised over a cyclic planar system; {{each of the six}} ring carbon atoms is sp2 hybridised and displays trigonal planar geometry, while each methyl carbon is tetrahedral with sp3 hybridisation, consistent with the empirical description of its structure. [...] When recrystallised from ethanol, solid hexamethylbenzene occurs as colourless to white crystalline orthorhombic prisms or needles with a melting point of 165-166 °C, a boiling point of 268 °C, and a density of 1.0630 g cm−3. Orthorhombic orange-yellow crystals of a 1:1 mixture of picryl chloride and hexamethylbenzene have been reported to possess alternating stacks of each component, probably due to &pi;-stacking of the aromatic systems. It is insoluble in water, but soluble in organic solvents including benzene and ethanol.|$|R
5000|$|... "Nor" [...] is an {{abbreviation}} of normal. Originally, {{the term}} was used to denote the completely demethylated form of the parent compound.Later, the meaning was restricted to the removal of one group. Nor is written {{directly in front of}} the stem name, without a hyphen between, unless there is another prefix after nor (for example α-). If multiple groups are eliminated the prefix dinor, trinor, tetranor, etcetera is used. The prefix is preceded by the position number (<b>locant)</b> of the carbon atoms that disappear. For example 2,3-dinor. The original numbering of the parent compound is retained. According to IUPAC nomenclature, this prefix is not written with italic letters and unlike nor, when it is a di or higher nor, at the end of the numbers separated by commas, a hyphen is used. As for example 2,3-dinor-6-keto Prostaglandin F1α is produced by beta oxidation of the parent compound 6-keto Prostaglandin F1α. Here, though actually carbon 1 & 2 are lost by oxidation. The new Carbon 1 has now become a CCOH similar to the parent compound, looking as if just carbon 2 & 3 have been removed from the parent compound. [...] "Dinor" [...] does not have to be reduction in adjacent carbons e.g. 5-Acetyl-4,18-dinor-retinoic acid, where 4 referred to a ring carbon and 18 referred to a methyl group on the 5th carbon on the ring.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} location {{service is}} a prerequisite to any robust, effective and precise location information aided Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) routing protocol. <b>Locant,</b> {{presented in this paper}} is a nature inspired location service which derives inspiration from the insect colony framework, and it is designed to work with a host of location information aided MANET routing protocols. Using an extensive set of simulation experiments, we have compared the performance of <b>Locant</b> with RLS, SLS and DLS, and found that it has comparable or better performance compared to the above three location services on most metrics and has the least overhead in terms of number of bytes transmitted per location query answered...|$|E
40|$|A {{relaxation}} of previous recommendations on the numbering of the atoms of myo-inositol is suggested, so that substituents {{are not necessarily}} numbered so that the smallest possible <b>locant</b> is used. This allows an alternative designation to be used, when authors wish, to bring out structural relationships...|$|E
40|$|Differently {{substituted}} 2 -amino- 8 -oxodecanoic acids (Aodas), {{present in}} naturally occurring inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC), have been prepd. using a convergent approach.  The configuration in <b>locant</b> 2 of Aodas {{was derived from}} enantiomerically pure allylglycine or glutamic acid, whereas the stereochem. of the substituent in <b>locant</b> 9 was derived from either (R) - or (S) -lactic acid or its glyceraldehyde deriv.  Starting from allylglycine, (2 S, 9 S) - and (2 S, 9 R) -Aodas, protected at the nitrogen as Boc or Fmoc, were obtained in four steps in about 30 % overall yield.  (2 S, 9 R) -Aoda was used to prep. a cyclic peptide I, a simplified analog of a natural cyclic tetrapeptide inhibitor of histone deacetylase, by solid-phase peptide synthesis.  I showed an IC 50 = 10 mM when tested against class III HDACs...|$|E
