50|$|Many studio {{engineers}} with {{a background}} in conventional stereo music mixing find that simple panning of a source to the centre-front (CF) channel makes it fail {{to blend in with}} the stereo mix. However, if the CF channel is left silent, consumers may believe there is a fault with the disc or with their equipment. A way around this problem is offered by Trifield. The processor typically takes a 2-channel <b>L-R</b> <b>signal</b> and renders it for L-C-R, and no signals are sent to the CF except for those generated by the Trifield processor. Not only does CF content now blend with the mix: in addition, the resulting soundstage is more stable and listener-position independent, while the listener can confirm that something is actually emerging from their centre-front loudspeaker.|$|E
5000|$|The Belar {{system was}} used in limited number of stations, such as WJR. The Belar system, {{originally}} designed by RCA in the 1950s, was a simple FM/AM modulation system, with an attenuated <b>L-R</b> <b>signal</b> frequency modulating the carrier (with a 400 µs pre-emphasis) in the extent of +/- 320 Hz around the center frequency, and the L+R doing the normal [...] "high level" [...] AM modulation (usually referred to as plate modulation in transmitters using a tube in the final stage, where the audio {{is applied to the}} plate voltage of the tube; in solid state transmitters, various different techniques are available that are more efficient at lower power levels). The Belar system (by the company of the same name) was dropped due to issues with its design though it was much easier to implement than the other systems. It and the Kahn system did not suffer from platform motion (which was a killer for AM stereo at night; platform motion is where the stereo balance would shift {{from one side to the}} other and then back to center) but the use of low level frequency modulation did not permit a high separation of L and R channels.|$|E
40|$|Retinoic acid (RA) {{signalling}} {{ensures that}} vertebrate mesoderm segmentation is bilaterally synchronized, and corrects transient interferences from asymmetric left–right (<b>L–R)</b> <b>signals</b> involved in organ lateralization. Snail genes participate in both these processes and, {{although they are}} expressed symmetrically in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), Snail 1 transcripts are asymmetrically distributed in the L–R lateral mesoderm. We show that the alteration of the symmetric Snail expression in the PSM induces asynchronous somite formation. Furthermore, {{in the absence of}} RA signalling, normal asymmetric Snail 1 expression in the lateral mesoderm is extended to the PSM, desynchronizing somitogenesis. Thus, Snail 1 is the first cue corrected by RA in the PSM to ensure synchronized bilateral segmentation...|$|R
50|$|The {{combined}} stylus motion can {{be represented}} {{in terms of the}} vector sum and difference of the two stereo channels. Vertical stylus motion then carries the <b>L-R</b> difference <b>signal</b> and horizontal stylus motion carries the L+R summed signal, the latter representing the monophonic component of the signal in exactly the same manner as a purely monophonic record.|$|R
40|$|The {{embryonic}} cellular {{events that}} set the asymmetry of the genetic control circuit controlling left-right (L-R) axis determination in mammals are poorly understood. New insight into this problem was obtained by analyzing mouse mutants lacking the KIF 3 A motor subunit of the kinesin-II motor complex. Embryos lacking KIF 3 A die at 10 days postcoitum, exhibit randomized establishment of L-R asymmetry, and display numerous structural abnormalities. The earliest detectable abnormality in KIF 3 A mutant embryos is found at day 7. 5, where scanning electron microscopy reveals loss of cilia ordinarily present on cells of the wild-type embryonic node, which is thought {{to play an important}} role in setting the initial L-R asymmetry. This cellular phenotype is observed before the earliest reported time of asymmetric expression of markers of the <b>L-R</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway. These observations demonstrate that the kinesin-based transport pathway needed for flagellar and ciliary morphogenesis is conserved from Chlamydomonas to mammals and support the view that embryonic cilia play a role in the earliest cellular determinative events establishing L-R asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVertebrate {{internal}} organs display invariant left–right (<b>L–R)</b> asymmetry. A <b>signalling</b> cascade that sets up L–R asymmetry {{has recently been}} identified (reviewed in [1]). On {{the right side of}} Hensen’s node, activin represses Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression and induces expression of the genes for the activin receptor (ActRIIa) and fibroblast growth factor- 8 (FGF 8) [2, 3]. On the left side, Shh induces nodal expression in lateral plate mesoderm (LPM); nodal in turn upregulates left-sided expression of the bicoid-like homeobox gene Pitx 2 [4 – 6]. Here, we found that the homeobox gene NKX 3. 2 is asymmetrically expressed in the anterior left LPM and in head mesoderm in the chick embryo. Misexpression of the normally left-sided signals Nodal, Lefty 2 and Shh on the right side, or ectopic application of retinoic acid (RA), resulted in upregulation of NKX 3. 2 contralateral to its normal expression in left LPM. Ectopic application of FGF 8 on the left side blocked NKX 3. 2 expression, whereas the FGF receptor- 1 (FGFR- 1) antagonist SU 5402, implanted on the right side, resulted in bilateral NKX 3. 2 expression in the LPM, suggesting that FGF 8 is an important negative determinant of asymmetric NKX 3. 2 expression. NKX 3. 2 expression was also found to be asymmetric in the mouse LPM but, unlike in the chick, it was expressed in the right LPM. In the inversion of embryonic turning (inv) mouse mutant, which has aberrant L–R development, NKX 3. 2 was expressed predominantly on the left side. Thus, NKX 3. 2 transcripts accumulate on opposite sides of mouse and chick embryos although, in both the mouse and chick, NKX 3. 2 expression is controlled by the <b>L–R</b> <b>signalling</b> pathways...|$|R
5000|$|While {{both systems}} used {{multiplexing}} to transmit the <b>L-R</b> stereo <b>signal,</b> the Crosby system used a frequency-modulated 50 kHz subcarrier, whereas the competing Zenith/GE system used an amplitude-modulated 38 kHz subcarrier. As FM is {{less susceptible to}} interference and noise than AM, the Crosby system had better frequency response and less noise of the two systems especially under weak signal conditions. However, the Crosby system was incompatible with existing subsidiary communications authorization (SCA) services which used subcarrier frequencies including 41 and 67 kHz. These SCA services were used by many FM stations since the mid-1950s for subscription-based [...] "storecasting" [...] to raise revenue and for other non-broadcast purposes. They consequently lobbied the FCC to adopt the Zenith/GE system. FCC tests in 1960 confirmed that the Zenith/GE stereo system was compatible with 67 kHz SCA operation, although not 41 kHz.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{4-channel}} decoder {{could simply}} send the sum signal (L+R) {{to the center}} speaker, and the difference <b>signal</b> (<b>L-R)</b> to the surrounds. But such a decoder would provide poor separation between adjacent speaker channels, thus anything intended for the center speaker would also reproduce from left and right speakers only 3dB below the level in the center speaker. Similarly anything intended for the left speaker would be reproduced from both the center and surround speakers, again only 3dB below the level in the left speaker. There is, however complete separation between left and right, and between center and surround channels.|$|R
40|$|The node and the {{anterior}} visceral endoderm (AVE) are important organizing centers that pattern the mouse embryo by establishing {{the anterior}}–posterior (A–P), dorsal–ventral (D–V), and left–right (<b>L–R)</b> axes. Activin/nodal <b>signaling</b> through the Smad 2 pathway has {{been implicated in}} AVE formation and in morphogenesis of the primitive streak, the anterior end of which {{gives rise to the}} node. The forkhead DNA-binding protein, FoxH 1 (or Fast), functions as a Smad DNA-binding partner to regulate transcription in response to activin signaling. Here, we show that deletion of FoxH 1 in mice results in failure to pattern the anterior primitive streak (APS) and form node, prechordal mesoderm, notochord, and definitive endoderm. In contrast, formation of the AVE can occur in the absence of FoxH 1. The FoxH 1 mutant phenotype is remarkably similar to that of mice deficient in the forkhead protein Foxa 2 (HNF 3 β), and we show that Foxa 2 expression is dependent on FoxH 1 function. These results show that FoxH 1 functions in an activin/nodal–Smad signaling pathway that acts upstream of Foxa 2 and is required specifically for patterning the APS and node in the mouse...|$|R
