25|$|Mutation of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} are {{passed on to}} the next generation of not merely cells, but their offspring, can cause increased likelihoods for cancers to be inherited. Members within these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from another. Because mutations in tumor suppressors act in a recessive manner (note, however, there are exceptions), the loss of the normal copy creates the cancer phenotype. For instance, individuals that are heterozygous for p53 mutations are often victims of <b>Li-Fraumeni</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and that are heterozygous for Rb mutations develop retinoblastoma. In similar fashion, mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene are linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer, with thousands of polyps in the colon while young, whereas mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Mutations of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} occur in germline cells are passed along to offspring, and increase the likelihood for cancer diagnoses in subsequent generations. Members of these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The tumor types are typical {{for each type of}} tumor suppressor gene mutation, with some mutations causing particular cancers, and other mutations causing others. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that an affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from the other. For instance, individuals who inherit one mutant p53 allele (and are therefore heterozygous for mutated p53) can develop melanomas and pancreatic cancer, known as <b>Li-Fraumeni</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Other inherited tumor suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations, linked to retinoblastoma, and APC gene mutations, linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer. Adenopolyposis colon cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in colon while young, leading to colon cancer at a relatively early age. Finally, inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Predictive and presymptomatic testing: Predictive and presymptomatic {{types of}} testing {{are used to}} detect gene {{mutations}} associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful {{to people who have}} a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's chances of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Hereditary breast cancer along with ovarian cancer syndrome are caused by gene alterations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Major cancer types related to mutations in these genes are female breast cancer, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancer. <b>Li-Fraumeni</b> <b>syndrome</b> is caused by a gene alteration on the gene TP53. Cancer types associated with a mutation on this gene include breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma (bone cancer), leukemia and brain tumors. In the Cowden syndrome there is a mutation on the PTEN gene, causing potential breast, thyroid or endometrial cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a person’s risk of developing a specific disorder, help with making decisions about medical care and provide a better prognosis.|$|E

30|$|We {{sought to}} {{identify}} potential regulatory SNPs by a “forward” genetic strategy that first assesses all DNA binding sites of p 53 in a genome wide manner, mines polymorphisms within the binding sites, interrogates the functional {{impact of these}} SNPs on the primary property of p 53 occupancy and transcriptional regulation, and lastly investigates their association with disease susceptibility. As {{a result of the}} initial attempt, we found that the homozygous state of the minor allele (TT) of one such binding site variant, rs 1860746, showed significantly lower p 53 occupancy after cellular induction with a genotoxic agent. Given the known function of p 53 as an important tumor suppressor gene, and the placement of the binding site variant within another cancer related gene PRKAG 2 (encoding AMPKγ) (Inoki et al. 2003; Shaw et al. 2004; Jones et al. 2005; Laderoute et al. 2006), we sought to determine the association of this SNP with cancer susceptibility in breast cancer. Our results show a modest effect of the homozygous TT state on breast cancer susceptibility which is significant only in ER negative breast cancers after examining over 5, 000 cases and controls. Such modest effects are intriguing but not definitive and therefore will require larger studies to validate, especially since the frequency of the effective homozygous state is low (< 5 %). This is similar to the results of SNP rs 3020314 which tags a region of ESR 1 intron 4 (the estrogen receptor gene) where after analysis in 55, 000 cases and controls showed an OR effect of 1.05 confined to women bearing ER positive tumors (Dunning et al. 2009). The greater association of the homozygous TT genotype of rs 1860746 with susceptibility for ER negative cancers is consistent with the molecular understanding of breast cancer biology since ER negative tumors have greater aneuploidy and are associated with aberrations of p 53 itself (Miller et al. 2005). Carriers of germ-line p 53 mutations in the families affected with <b>Li-Fraumeni</b> <b>syndromes</b> (LFS) are at risk for early-onset breast cancer (Olivier et al. 2003), and our findings further suggest that genetic disturbances in downstream transcriptional regulation by p 53 may also have an effect on breast cancer risk. We also {{want to point out that}} BRCA mutation carriers have been excluded from the familial patients from the KConFab and HEBC studies. In familial patients, BRCA mutations, especially BRCA 1 mutations, would be a strong confounding risk factor for ER negative breast cancer, if not excluded. Therefore, by excluding BRCA carriers, our association results are expected to be independent from the confounding effect of BRCA mutations. Further studies will be needed to investigate the risk effect of the polymorphism in BRCA mutation carriers.|$|R

In contrast, fibroblast strains from LF patients without TP 53 mutations showed normal G 1 arrest. We have now investigated {{the relationship between the}} extent of G 1 arrest and the level of structural chromosome damage (mainly dicentrics, rings and acentric fragments) in cells at their first mitosis after G 1 irradiation, in 9 LF strains with TP 53 mutations, 6 without TP 53 mutations and 7 normal strains. Average levels of damage in the mutant strains were 50 % higher than in normals, whereas in non-mutant LF strains they were 100 % higher. DNA double strand breaks (dsb) are known to act as a signal for p 53 -dependent G 1 arrest and to be the lesions from which chromosome aberrations arise. These results suggest that a minimal level of dsb is required before the signal for arrest is activated and that p 53 -defective cells have a higher signal threshold than p 53 -proficient cells. Dsb that do not cause G 1 blockage can progress to mitosis and appear as simple deletions or interact to form exchange aberrations. The elevated levels in the non-mutant strains may arise from defects in the extent or accuracy of dsb repair. In LF cells with or without TP 53 mutations, the reduced capacity to eliminate or repair chromosomal damage of the type induced by ionising radiation, may contribute to cancer predisposition in this syndrome. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{hereditary}} predisposition to cancer dates historically to interest piqued by physicians {{as well as}} family members wherein striking phenotypic features were shown to cluster in families, inclusive of the rather grotesque cutaneous findings in von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, which {{date back to the}} sixteenth century. The search for the role of primary genetic factors was heralded by studies at the infrahuman level, particularly on laboratory mouse strains with strong susceptibility to carcinogen-induced cancer, and conversely, with resistance to the same carcinogens. These studies, developed in the 19 th and 20 th centuries, continue today. This article traces the historical aspects of hereditary cancer dealing with identification and ultimate molecular genetic confirmation of commonly occurring cancers, particularly of the colon in the case of familial adenomatous polyposis and its attenuated form, both due to theAPC germline mutation; the Lynch syndrome due to mutations in mismatch repair genes, the most common of which were found to be MSH 2, MLH 1, and MSH 6 germline mutations; the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome with BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 germline mutations; the <b>Li-Fraumeni</b> (SBLA) <b>syndrome</b> due to the p 53 mutation; and the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma in association with pancreatic cancer due to the CDKN 2 A (p 16) germline mutation.

Patients and methods: A total of 30 adult patients from six families with germline TP 53 mutations were recruited. These patients did not have a diagnosis of cancer in the 24 months preceding the study. Anomalous concentrations from whole-body 18 F-FDG-PET/CT were assessed by two independent experts.

We find that residues 310 - 360 of the L 344 P mutant are monomeric, apparently unfolded and cannot interact with wild-type (WT) p 53. The full length L 344 P protein is unable to bind sequence specifically to DNA and is therefore an inactive, but not a dominant negative mutant. R 337 C, on the other hand, can form dimers and tetramers, can hetero-oligomerize with WTp 53 and can bind to a p 53 consensus element. However, the thermal stability of R 337 C is much lower than that of WTp 53 and at physiological temperatures more than half of this mutant is less than tetrameric. Thus, the R 337 C mutant retains some functional activity yet leads to a predisposition to cancer, suggesting that even partial inactivation of p 53 oligomerization is sufficient for accelerated tumour progression...|$|R

In Brazil, the prevalence of the TP 53 -p. R 337 H germline mutation is exceedingly high {{in the general population}} and in cancer-affected patients, probably as result of a founder effect. Several genotyping methods are used for the molecular diagnosis of LFS/LFL, however Sanger sequencing is still considered the gold standard. We compared performance, cost and turnaround time of Sanger sequencing, PCR-RFLP, TaqMan-PCR and HRM in the p. R 337 H genotyping. The performance was determined by analysis of 95 genomic DNA samples and results were 100 % concordant for all methods. Sequencing was the most expensive method followed by TaqMan-PCR, PCR-RFLP and HRM. The overall cost of HRM increased with the prevalence of positive samples, since confirmatory sequencing must be performed when a sample shows an abnormal melting profile, but remained lower than all other methods when the mutation prevalence was less than 2. 5 %. Sequencing had the highest throughput and the longest turnaround time, while TaqMan-PCR showed the lowest turnaround and hands-on times. All methodologies studied are suitable for the detection of p.

The entire cohort was screened for mutations in TP 53 using high-resolution melting analysis and Sanger sequencing, and multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification and targeted massively parallel sequencing for copy number changes. Pathogenic TP 53 mutations were detected in blood DNA of 20 / 559 sarcoma probands (3. 6 %); 17 were germline and 3 appeared to be somatically acquired.

Melanoma cells are highly radioresistant, yet they express wild-type p 53 protein, raising the possibility of defects in the pathways that activate p 53 in response to DNA damage. We have described a chk 2 /hcds 1 independent DNA damage signaling pathway that targets Ser- 376 within the COOH terminus of p 53 for dephosphorylation and leads to increased p 53 functional activity. We now report that in several human melanoma cell lines that express wild-type p 53, the phosphorylation state of Ser- 376 was not regulated by DNA damage. In these cell lines, neither the endogenous wild-type p 53 protein nor high levels of ectopic wild-type p 53 led to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
