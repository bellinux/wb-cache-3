40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to study the {{distribution}} of income in Ukraine and indentify the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> inequality, {{as well as its}} causes. Official statistics do not give a real picture of the economic inequality in Ukraine. It was found out that the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> labor is characterized by significant differentiation: the ratio of the minimum wage to the average wage was 0. 263 in 2015. The minimum <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> managers of state companies exceeded the minimum wage in 2016 by 250 times. The share of capital in the national income in 2014 - 2015 grew to 50 %, which indicates the distribution of income in favor of the capital owners and the deterioration of the position of employees. The excess of the return on capital (10 %) over the average rate of economic growth (4 %) will increase the inequality in the future. The reasons for the growing inequality in Ukraine is the orientation in international competition for capital on the model of “cheap labor”, unfair taxation of income from capital, corruption, shadow economy...|$|R

In the result of the study the article assesses impact on the effective feature “the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> perception of the system <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> labour as fair by employed workers” of such factor features as the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction of the worker with the size <b>of</b> <b>remuneration,</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> transparency of the system <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> labour, <b>level</b> <b>of</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> on complexity <b>of</b> works and duties, and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> on individual results of labour.

40|$|Orientation: In {{order to}} attract {{knowledge}} workers {{and maintain a}} competitive advantage,it is necessary for organisations to understand how knowledge workers are attracted todifferent types and <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> financial rewards. Research purpose: This research investigated a set of financial reward elements (remuneration, employee benefits and variable pay) to determine whether knowledgeworkers perceived them as attractive inducements when considering a job or position. Motivation for the study: In South Africa {{there is a shortage}} of talent, largely due to highrates of emigration of scarce skills (human capital). Financial rewards or inducementsare necessary to attract talent and it is essential to assess which of these rewards are mostsuccessful in this regard. Method: A 2 3 full-factorial experimental design (field experiment) was used. The threefinancial reward elements (remuneration, employee benefits and variable pay) weremanipulated in a fictitious job advertisement (each at two levels). Eight (2 × 2 × 2 = 8) differentversions of a job advertisement were used as a stimulus to determine the effect of financialreward elements on perceived job attractiveness. A questionnaire was used to measure howparticipants perceived the attractiveness of the job. A convenience sampling approach wasused. Different organisations throughout South Africa, as well as corporate members of the South African Reward Association, were asked to participate in the study. Respondents (n = 169) were randomly assigned to the various experimental conditions (i. e. one of the eightadvertisements). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics. A full-factorial analysis ofvariance was used to investigate if significant main effects could be found. Main findings: Participants considered high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration,</b> the inclusion ofbenefits and variable pay to be significant job attraction factors within a reward package. Remuneration was found to have the largest main effect on job attractiveness of the three. Gender, race and age did not have statistically significant main effects on job attractiveness. Practical/managerial implications: High <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration,</b> benefits and variable payshould be incorporated and emphasised in organisational talent attraction strategies as theyare attractive for knowledge workers. If organisations want to attract prospective talentthey need to offer high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> to make their offers appealing and attractive. Variable pay and benefits are, further, not sufficient to mitigate a low remuneration offer. Contribution: This study adds to the body of social science research as few studieshave empirically demonstrated a causal link between financial reward elements and jobattractiveness within a controlled laboratory environment. There is also limited empiricalresearch in South Africa that highlights the <b>level</b> and combinations <b>of</b> financial rewardelements that are attractive for talented knowledge employees. </p...|$|R

30|$|Program Description Public Sector Work {{programs}} are state-funded temporary employment {{opportunities in the}} public sector that usually involve production of socially valuable goods or services. The {{programs are}} mainly aimed at creating employment opportunities and giving youth some work experience. While they may comprise parallel participation in practical training courses, they are often intended to familiarize inexperienced, disadvantaged youth with a routine work environment. Participants usually receive a low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> during participation. While this may increase the willingness of youth to participate in the program, this may also have the unintended effect of reducing the search effort for “real” jobs. Also, as public work programs do not establish contact to “real” firms or employers, they do not offer a direct way into the labor market.|$|R
