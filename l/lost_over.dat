5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of {{corruption}} continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have <b>lost</b> <b>over</b> $400 billion to corruption since independence.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, {{the best}} batting {{strategy}} for Team 1 {{ahead of a}} coming interruption {{is not always the}} same, but varies with the facts of the match situation to date (runs scored, wickets <b>lost,</b> <b>overs</b> used, and whether there have been interruptions), and also with the opinions about what will happen with each strategy (how many further runs will be scored, further wickets will be <b>lost,</b> and further <b>overs</b> will be used? How likely are the coming interruptions, when will they happen, and how long will they last – will Team 1's innings be re-started?).|$|R

5|$|Stage 14 was the {{individual}} time trial, which was won by Vasil Kiryienka (Sky). Contador finished {{third on the}} stage, nearly three minutes ahead of Aru. Contador therefore moved back into the race lead. Contador passed Landa on the road, despite starting three minutes after him; Landa <b>lost</b> <b>over</b> four minutes and fell to seventh place overall. Movistar's Andrey Amador moved up into third. Stage 15 was {{the final stage of}} the second week and was the climb to Madonna di Campiglio. Landa won the stage after Astana rode hard on the final climb; he finished five seconds ahead of Contador and moved back up to fourth place. Contador finished a second ahead of Aru and extended his lead further due to bonus seconds for his third-place finish. Porte, who had <b>lost</b> <b>over</b> 30 minutes during the weekend following the crash in stage 13, withdrew from the race after the stage.|$|E

Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist <b>lost</b> <b>over</b> a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E

5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had <b>lost</b> <b>over</b> $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|For decades Salford's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and engineering. Since the Second World War however, Salford has experienced decades of growing unemployment as these sectors diminished and new sectors chose to locate in out of town locations with better transport links. Between 1965 and 1991 the city <b>lost</b> <b>over</b> 49,000jobs, or more than 32% of its employment base. Several factors contributed to this decline, not least changes in the national and international economies, {{the introduction of new}} technology and the concentration of investment in London and South East England. The biggest job losses were experienced in Salford's traditional industries and although the service sector expanded during this period, it was unable to compensate for the decline in manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Gannett Glacier, on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains.

Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier in the Wind River Range.

The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E
