50|$|The Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS) is a {{telephone}} company trouble ticketing system to coordinate repairs of local loops (telephone lines). When {{a problem is}} reported to the Centralized Repair Service Answering Bureau (CRSAB) by a subscriber dialing the designated number (often (1)+611), it is filed and relayed through the Cross Front End, which is a link from the CRSAB to the LMOS network. The trouble report is then sent to the Front End via the Datakit network, where a Basic Output Report is requested (usually by a lineman). The BOR provides line information including past trouble history and MLT (Mechanized <b>Loop</b> <b>Testing)</b> tests. As LMOS is responsible for trouble reports, analysis, and similar related functions, MLT does the actual testing of customer loops. MLT hardware {{is located in the}} Repair Service Bureau. Test trunks connect MLT hardware to the telephone exchanges or wire centers, which in turn connect with the subscriber loops.|$|E

Three strains of O-groups 8, 9, and 140 were positive only in the infant mouse assay and were designated ST mouse. Two strains of O-group 149 were positive in all tests except the infant mouse test and were designated LT. A total of 42 strains were negative in all four tests (Ent-), and 3 strains could not be categorized by the enterotoxigenicity criteria used.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in actuator technology {{have resulted in}} small, simple flow control devices capable of affecting the flow field over flight vehicles sufficiently to generate control forces. One of the devices which has been under investigation is the Micro-Trailing Edge Effector (MiTE), which consists of a small, 1 - 5 % chord, vertically sliding flap mounted at the trailing edge. The high bandwidth and good control authority with little required power makes the device an ideal candidate for active control of flutter in high aspect ratio wings. Unfortunately traditional control techniques do not address the non-linear nature of the device or the competing performance goals arising from large numbers of distributed devices. Novel approaches to control design, such as reinforcement learning, are therefore required. To demonstrate the aeroelastic control capability of the MiTEs and to explore reinforcement learning techniques, an experimental model has been designed, fabricated, and tested. This paper details the experimental model and the accompanying analytical model. Design, manufacturing and open <b>loop</b> <b>testing</b> of the experimental model and comparisons with the analytical predictions are presented. This paper also covers the controller design for flutter suppression using reinforcement learning policy search techniques. The results of closed <b>loop</b> <b>testing,</b> resulting in successful flutter suppression with the MiTEs, is presented...|$|E

50|$|The {{basic idea}} of loop {{unrolling}} {{is that the}} number of instructions executed in a loop can be reduced by reducing the number of <b>loop</b> <b>tests,</b> sometimes reducing {{the amount of time spent}} in the loop. For example, in the case of a loop with only a single instruction in the block code, the <b>loop</b> <b>test</b> will typically be performed for every iteration of the loop, that is every time the instruction is executed. If, instead, eight copies of the same instruction are placed in the <b>loop,</b> then the <b>test</b> will be performed only every eight iterations, and this may gain time by avoiding seven tests. However, this only handles a multiple of eight iterations, requiring something else to handle any remainder of iterations.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{synthesis}} of controllers for discrete event systems, as introduced by Ramadge and Wonham, amounts to computing winning strategies in parity games. We {{show that in}} this framework {{it is possible to}} extend the specifications of the supervised systems as well as the constraints on the controllers by expressing them in the modal μ-calculus. In order to express unobservability constraints, we propose an extension of the modal μ-calculus in which one can specify whether an edge of a graph is a loop. This extended μ-calculus still has the interesting properties of the classical one. In particular it is equivalent to automata with <b>loop</b> <b>testing.</b> The problems such as emptiness testing and elimination of alternation are solvable for such automata. The method proposed in this paper to solve a control problem consists in transforming this problem into a problem of satisfiability of a μ-calculus formula so that the set of models of this formula is exactly the set of controllers that solve the problem. This transformation relies on a simple construction of the quotient of automata with <b>loop</b> <b>testing</b> by a deterministic transition system. This is enough to deal with centralized control problems. The solution of decentralized control problems uses a more involved construction of the quotient of two automata. This work extends the framework of Ramadge and Wonham in two directions. We consider infinite behaviours and arbitrary regular specifications, while the standard framework deals only with specifications on the set of finite paths of processes. We also allow dynamic changes of the sets of observable and controllable events...|$|E
30|$|The {{emission}} {{stability of}} a field emission electron source {{is one of the}} key factors that affect its potential application in vacuum electronic devices. The J-E curves can only show transitory field emission phenomenon in a short time and cannot reflect the field emission behavior sufficiently. Figure  5 d showed the looping testing of the CNTs. The anode voltage was increased or decreased by 30  V/step. Seen from <b>loop</b> <b>testing</b> with increased and decreased voltage between 1.5 and 3.5  V μm− 1 for 25 loops, there is no obvious deterioration of the maximum current density. Before the looping testing with maximum current of about 20  mA/cm 2, the current density of 10  mA/cm 2 was also tested with no deterioration. Figure  5 e displayed the typical J-E curves for different loops of the <b>loop</b> <b>testing.</b> The current density was relatively stable both in the increased and decreased voltage processes. During the increased or decreased voltage process of the field emission testing, desorption and adsorption of the gas molecules will change the work function of CNT and probably lead to a phenomenon of hysteresis [9, 44]. The hysteresis was unnoticeable in this work indicated that desorption and adsorption may reach an equilibrium state. Furthermore, the long-term test of the sample exhibited good stability for 50  h (Fig.  5 f). When ionization vacuum gauge was opened, the emission current increased abruptly during the stability test as shown in the arrow pointed position of Fig.  5 f. The conditions in vacuum chamber and the surface state of CNT emitters may change in testing process which resulted in the rising of emission current. All these achievements underlined the potential of CNT emitters in applications.|$|E
