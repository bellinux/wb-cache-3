5000|$|When {{a complex}} {{question}} contains controversial presuppositions (often with loaded language - having an unspoken and often emotive implication), {{it is known}} as a <b>loaded</b> <b>question.</b> For example, a classic <b>loaded</b> <b>question,</b> containing incriminating assumptions that the questioned persons seem to admit to if they answer the questions instead of challenging them, is [...] "Have you stopped beating your wife?" [...] If the person questioned answers, [...] "Yes", then that implies that he has previously beaten his wife. A <b>loaded</b> <b>question</b> may be asked to trick the respondent into admitting something that the questioner believes to be true, and which may in fact be true. So the previous question is [...] "loaded", whether or not the respondent has actually beaten his wife - and if the respondent answers anything other than [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no" [...] in an attempt to deny having beaten his wife, the questioner can accuse him of [...] "trying to dodge the question". The very same question may be loaded in one context, but not in the other. For example, the previous question would not be loaded were it asked during a trial in which the defendant has already admitted having beaten his wife.|$|E
5000|$|... illegitimately complex {{question}}: On {{the other}} hand, [...] "Who is the King of France?" [...] would commit the complex question fallacy because while it assumes {{there is a}} place called France (true), it also assumes France currently has a king (false). But since answering this question does not seem to incriminate or otherwise embarrass the speaker, it is complex but not really a <b>loaded</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pre-suppositional or <b>loaded</b> <b>questions,</b> such as [...] "Have {{you stopped}} beating your wife?" [...] {{may be used}} as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more {{information}} than he was willing to affirm.|$|R

50|$|In general, the {{vocabulary}} of a question should be very simple and direct, and preferably under twenty words. Each question should be edited for readability and should avoid leading or <b>loaded</b> <b>questions.</b> If multiple questions {{are being used to}} measure one construct, some of the questions should be worded in the opposite direction to evade response bias.|$|R
5000|$|... "Mu" [...] {{may be used}} {{similarly}} to [...] "" [...] or [...] "not applicable," [...] a term often used to indicate the question cannot be answered because {{the conditions of the}} question do not match the reality.

[...] When the interviewee tried to express his or her disapproval of Bush, Colbert usually stated that the only choice was between [...] "Great or Greatest," [...] and nearly always stated, [...] "I'm gonna put you down for 'Great'."

50|$|Questions and {{prepared}} responses (for multiple-choice) should be neutral as to intended outcome. A biased question or questionnaire encourages respondents to answer one way rather than another. Even questions without bias may leave respondents with expectations. The order or grouping of questions is also relevant; early questions may bias later <b>questions.</b> <b>Loaded</b> <b>questions</b> evoke emotional responses and may skew results.|$|R
30|$|While {{developing}} the items, following were given emphasis: ensuring readability of each item; preventing usage of double barrelled items, ambiguous pronoun references and positive and negatively worded items (De Vellis 2003).

[...] Stern replied with two answers: [...] "Number one, no; and a statement, shame on you for asking." [...] He then proceeded to ask Rome the <b>loaded</b> <b>question</b> example of [...] "Have you stopped beating your wife yet?"

[...] She later wrote of this response:I must have been crazy; I should have answered the question by reframing it and pointing out the inherent flaws in the premise behind it.... As soon as I had spoken, I wished for the power to freeze time and take back those words. My reply had been a terrible mistake, hasty, clumsy, and wrong.... I had fallen into a trap and said something that I simply did not mean. That is no one's fault but my own.|$|E

50|$|When under hypnosis, an {{individual}} {{will attempt to}} fill in gaps in their memory with any information, including fantasies. The information used to fill gaps can come from the hypnotist and the individual under hypnosis. For example, the hypnotist may either knowingly or unknowingly use <b>loaded</b> <b>questions</b> that influence the already ambiguous memories of abductees {{in such a way}} the patient creates an alien abduction narrative for them. Skeptics Robert Sheaffer and Phillip J. Klass say individual abduction researchers appear to exert influence on the characteristics of narratives retrieved during hypnotic recall. This influence tends to influence recovered abduction narratives in ways that reinforces the preconceived biases of the individual researcher.|$|R
5000|$|Question dodging is the {{intentional}} avoidance of answering a question. This may {{occur when the}} person questioned either does not know the answer and wants to avoid embarrassment, or when the person is being interrogated or questioned in debate, and wants to avoid giving a direct response. [...] Overt question dodging can sometimes be employed humorously, in order to sidestep giving a public answer in a political discussion: when a reporter asked Mayor Richard J. Daley why Hubert Humphrey had lost the state of Illinois in the 1968 presidential election, Daley replied [...] "He lost it because he didn't get enough votes." [...] Often the aim of dodging a question {{is to make it}} seem as though the question was fulfilled, leaving the person who asked the question feeling satisfied with the answer, unaware that the question was not properly answered. A false accusation of question dodging can sometimes be made as a disingenuous tactic in debate, in the informal fallacy of the <b>loaded</b> <b>question.</b> A common way out of this argument is not to answer the question (e.g. with a simple 'yes' or 'no'), but to challenge the assumption behind the question. This can lead the person questioned to be accused of [...] "dodging the question".|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} explores affective stance in {{conversational}} storytelling by investigating {{the ways in}} which unknowing story recipients display affective stances toward a teller’s story through questions that deploy multimodal resources. The data are based on videotaped natural face-to-face conversations between native Japanese speakers. While unknowing story recipients ask questions of the storyteller only to elicit factual information (“neutral questions”), they also ask questions layered with affect (“affect-loaded questions”). Building on studies on affect and stance, assessment, questions, and alignment and affiliation in storytelling, I demonstrate how unknow-ing story recipients ask affect-loaded questions to elicit and display affective stances toward story contents by exploiting linguistic and non-linguistic resources. First, I explicate how unknowing story recipients employ not only linguistic devices (e. g., emotion words, wh-questions, and deictic expressions such as sonna “like that”), but also prosody, facial expressions, body movements, and pre-/concurrent-laughter in order to <b>load</b> <b>questions</b> with affective stance that display, for example, disgust, humor, sarcasm, criticism, or surprise. Secondly, I show how unknowing story recipients use rhetorical questions to express their affect (rather than to elicit information from the story...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{some evidence}} of shellfish gathering from what are arguably among the earliest shell middens in human history. What makes this evidence interesting for scientists involved in explaining human evolutionary events {{is the fact that}} it may register a key moment in the emergence of our species. I describe the sites, list some of the archaeological remains, and speculate on the relationship between the evidence for systematic shellfish gathering and the appearance of hominid fossils that almost all palaeoanthropologists would call 'modern'. I have this word in inverted commas because I believe all our definitions of 'modern behaviour', and perhaps even 'modern humans', are self-serving and in need of substantial unpacking. Cynically, modern behaviour is defined as likely to be reflected in the kinds of archaeological remains (worked bone, some or other complex subsistence activity, marked ochre, burial) that we have in hand. It may be better to ask a less <b>loaded</b> <b>question</b> such as what is the history of one of these component behaviours, such as inter-tidal marine food acquisition. The gathering of sessile molluscs is, at first sight, hardly complex, but its nutritional advantages and correlates in the archaeological record might be of considerable significance...|$|E
40|$|We {{have entered}} the Anthropocene (Gibson et al. 2015), an era of human-caused global {{systemic}} dysfunction where the same species that caused this dysfunction also has the responsibility to turn the tide and respond. How to live lightly, equitably, meaningfully and empathically (i. e. towards {{the past and the}} future, towards different cultures, the non-human and more-than-human world) on Earth is the key question of our time. Young people in particular might feel overwhelmed by such a heavy existential question as they have a full life ahead of them and may have serious doubts about having children of their own some day {{in the face of the}} declining state of our planet. How can schools help young people to engage meaningfully in such a <b>loaded</b> <b>question?</b> Or, morally speaking, how can they choose not to help them with this question or, worse, make them powerless witnesses and accomplices to this planetary demise by ignoring this question altogether and sticking to " education-as-usual " ? This edited volume brings together authors who are looking for principles, foundations and processes that enable educators, in a broad sense, to connect young people with the key questions of our time.

We show how semi-smoothness, a recently introduced generalization of smoothness, is necessary to find tight or near-tight bounds on the price of total anarchy, and thus on the quality of correlated and Nash equilibria, for several natural job-assignment games with interacting jobs. For most cases, our bounds on the price of total anarchy are either exactly 2 or approach 2. We also prove new convergence results implied by semi-smoothness for our games. Finally we consider coalitional deviations, and prove results about the existence and quality of Strong equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to improve the {{curriculum}} in the teaching of informal logic and critical thinking by throwing new light on a problem that is quite important in philosophy generally, and in the fields of statistics, political science and law, as well-the problem of how to evaluate <b>loaded</b> <b>questions.</b> The problem of dealing with fallacious or otherwise tricky questions has, since ancient times, been a subject of some interest to philosophers, and it is a complex problem, with many different factors that need to be taken into account. The subject is also of current interest in relation to recent concerns about the widespread abuse of statistics in polls that deceptively look precise because they are scientific surveys. But the results are skewed one way or another by effects of the wording of the question (effects not measured by the announced estimates of the probability of error). The problem here is that the connotations of the words used in the question can produce a large variance in the statistical outcome of a survey. In this paper, the factor studied is that of how to judge whether and how a question is "loaded, " in a way tha...|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} how people engage in a biased search for information, but also that this phenomenon may be limited by a preference for genuine diagnostic tests. In an initial experiment, participants rated another person on the introversion-extroversion personality dimension {{on the basis of}} an interview. They chose the interview questions from a given list. When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert, the participants chose questions that presumed introversion, such as, [...] "What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties?" [...] When the interviewee was described as extroverted, almost all the questions presumed extroversion, such as, [...] "What would you do to liven up a dull party?" [...] These <b>loaded</b> <b>questions</b> gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them. A later version of the experiment gave the participants less presumptive questions to choose from, such as, [...] "Do you shy away from social interactions?" [...] Participants preferred to ask these more diagnostic questions, showing only a weak bias towards positive tests. This pattern, of a main preference for diagnostic tests and a weaker preference for positive tests, has been replicated in other studies.|$|R
