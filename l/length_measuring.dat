500|$|Interferometers {{are widely}} used in science and {{industry}} for the measurement of small displacements, refractive index changes and surface irregularities. [...] In an interferometer, light from a single source is split into two beams that travel different optical paths, then combined again to produce interference. [...] The resulting interference fringes give information about the difference in optical path length. [...] In analytical science, interferometers are used to measure lengths and the shape of optical components with nanometer precision; they are the highest precision <b>length</b> <b>measuring</b> instruments existing. [...] In Fourier transform spectroscopy {{they are used to}} analyze light containing features of absorption or emission associated with a substance or mixture. [...] An astronomical interferometer consists of two or more separate telescopes that combine their signals, offering a resolution equivalent to that of a telescope of diameter equal to the largest separation between its individual elements.|$|E

2500|$|Alexandria {{consisted}} originally {{of little}} more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a [...] mole and called the Heptastadion ("seven stadia"—a stadium was a Greek unit of <b>length</b> <b>measuring</b> approximately [...] ). The end of this abutted on the land {{at the head of the}} present Grand Square, where the [...] "Moon Gate" [...] rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern [...] "Ras al-Tin" [...] quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.|$|E

6000|$|She {{could not}} have said this two days later--for instance, on Tuesday, when she at last {{received}} a letter from Morris Townsend. It was an epistle of considerable <b>length,</b> <b>measuring</b> five large square pages, and written at Philadelphia. It was an explanatory document, and it explained a great many things, chief among which were the considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an urgent [...] "professional" [...] absence to try and banish from his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to scatter it with ruins. He ventured to expect but partial success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever his failure, he would never again interpose between her generous heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties. He closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might compel him to travel for some months, and with the hope that when they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly involved in their respective positions--even should this result not be reached for years--they should meet as friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims of a great social law. That her life should be peaceful and happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe himself her most obedient servant. The letter was beautifully written, and Catherine, who kept it for many years after this, was able, when her sense of the bitterness of its meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute, to admire its grace of expression. At present, {{for a long time after}} she received it, all she had to help her was the determination, daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the compassion of her father.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a special}} {{vocabulary}} {{used to describe the}} length of pearl necklaces. While most other necklaces are simply referred to by their physical measurement, pearl necklaces are named by how low they hang when worn around the neck. A collar, measuring 10 to 13 inches or 25 to 33 cm in length, sits directly against the throat and does not hang down the neck at all; collars are often made up of multiple strands of pearls. Pearl chokers, measuring 14 to 16 inches or 35 to 41 cm in length, nestle just {{at the base of the}} neck. A strand called a princess <b>length,</b> <b>measuring</b> 17 to 19 inches or 43 to 48 cm in length, comes down to or just below the collarbone. A matinee <b>length,</b> <b>measuring</b> 20 to 24 inches or 50 to 60 cm in length, falls just above the breasts. An opera <b>length,</b> <b>measuring</b> 28 to 35 inches or 70 to 90 cm in length, will be long enough to reach the breastbone or sternum of the wearer; and longer still, a pearl rope, measuring more than 45 inches or 115 cm in length, is any length that falls down farther than an opera.|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{relations}} to describe experimentally measured traction-separation laws are often expressed in dimensionless quantities. The traction and the separation are commonly normalized using the cohesive strength and a <b>length</b> <b>measure,</b> respectively. The ratio between the fracture {{energy and the}} cohesive strength is often used as a <b>length</b> <b>measure.</b> An alternative <b>length</b> <b>measure</b> is the ratio between the cohesive strength and the maximum slope of the traction-separation law. A relation between these two <b>length</b> <b>measures</b> are established. To illustrate the implications on cohesive laws, three existing cohesive laws are rewritten using the alternative normalization. As a result it is shown {{that the number of}} unknown material parameters can be reduced. One of the derived dimensionless cohesive law is validated against experimental uniaxial tension and compression load-deformation data of different sample sizes and different quasi-brittle materials, i. e. concrete and paperboard. A good fit of the cohesive law is shown to all the investigated data. These findings indicate that the derived normalized cohesive law is independent of material directions, moisture contents and sample size...|$|R
