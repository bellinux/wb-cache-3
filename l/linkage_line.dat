The {{first step is to}} make the MAKLINK graph which is used to describe the working space of mobile robot. The limited length value of free <b>linkage</b> <b>line</b> is conducted to substitute the constant weights in the adjacent matrix, which is well correlated {{with the fact that the}} number of paths is drastically less than that using the conventional Dijkstra method. Then the particle swarm optimization is adopted to investigate the global path from the several possible paths. Therefore, the proposed method facilitates reducing the computing time which enhances the efficiency of particle swarm optimization when performs the global path planning for mobile robot. Furthermore, simulation result is provided to verify the effectiveness and practicability...|$|E

Heterozygosity fell more than expected, though not significantly so, but this traditional measure {{of the degree of}} inbreeding did not make full use of the information from genetic markers. It proved more informative to estimate directly the probability distribution of a measure of inbreeding, sigma 2, the variance in the number of descendants left per gene. In all bottlenecked lines, sigma 2 was significantly larger than in control lines (300 founders). We demonstrate that this excess inbreeding was brought about both by an increase in the variance of reproductive success of individuals, but also by another process. We argue that in bottlenecked <b>lines</b> <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium generated by the small number of haplotypes passing through the bottleneck resulted in hitchhiking of particular marker alleles with those haplotypes favored by selection. In control <b>lines,</b> <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium was minimal. Our result, indicating more inbreeding than expected from demographic parameters, contrasts with the findings of previous (Drosophila) experiments in which the decline in observed heterozygosity was slower than expected and attributed to associative overdominance. The different outcomes may both be explained as a consequence of linkage disequilibrium under different regimes of inbreeding. The likelihood-based method to estimate inbreeding should be of wide applicability. It was, for example, able to resolve small differences in sigma 2 among replicate lines within bottleneck-size treatments, which could be related to the observed variation in reproductive viability...|$|R

For inhomogeneous systems, with or without boundaries, our technique then allows one to discuss the local magnetic helicity density evolution, in a gauge independent fashion, which was not possible earlier. This evolution equation is governed by local sources (owing to the mean field) and by the divergence of a magnetic helicity flux density. The role of magnetic helicity fluxes in alleviating catastrophic quenching of mean field dynamos is discussed...|$|R

To isolate this from its accompanying lines we use its isotopic shift of ∼ 1 cm− 1 when 56 Fe in natural-abundance deoxymyoglobin is substituted by 54 Fe. This enables us to isolate the true line shape. We have measured this line shape in sperm whale myoglobin dissolved in a 66 % vol/vol glycerol/water solution for nine temperatures from 10 K to 300 K. The ν(Fe-His) band shows a complex temperature-dependent profile, with a shoulder on its high-frequency wing, which becomes more prominent with increasing temperature. Detailed analysis reveals that the band is composed of five distinct lines attributable to taxonomic conformational substates of the ν(Fe-His) linkage. These are in thermodynamic equilibrium above the glass transition temperature Tf but freeze in into the thermodynamic distribution at Tf for lower temperatures. Alternative models that try to explain the ν(Fe-His) band shape by either an anharmonic coupling of the ν(Fe-His) to a low-frequency heme doming mode or by conformational substates related to a Gaussian distribution of iron out-of-plane displacements are at variance with the distinct features observed experimentally...|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{conditions in}} the planet forming regions of protoplanetary discs remain difficult to observe directly. Gas accreting from the disc on to the star provides a way to measure the elemental abundances because even refractory species are in an atomic gaseous form. Here we compare the abundance ratios derived from UV lines probing T Tauri accretion streams to simple models of disc evolution. Although the interpretation of line ratios in terms of abundances is highly uncertain, discs with large cavities in mm images tend to have lower Si emission. Since this can naturally {{be explained by the}} suppressed accretion of dust, this suggests that abundance variations are at least partially responsible for the variations seen in the line ratios. Our models of disc evolution due to grain growth, radial drift and the flux of volatile species carried as ices on grain surfaces, give rise to a partial sorting of the atomic species based on the volatility of their dominant molecular carriers. This arises because volatiles are left behind at their snow lines while the grains continue to drift. We show that this reproduces the main features seen in the accretion line ratio data, such as C/N ratios that are a few times solar and the correlation between the Si to volatile ratio with mm-flux. We highlight the fact that developing a more robust <b>linkage</b> between <b>line</b> ratios and abundance ratios and acquiring data for larger samples has the potential to cast considerable light on the chemical history of protoplanetary discs.

These hybrids have been readily accepted {{to the extent that}} more than 80 % of the sorghum growing area was planted to hybrids with some level of midge resistance by 1995. Since selection for resistance to sorghum midge is one of the primary objectives of Australian sorghum breeding programs, the relationship between resistance and genetic diversity was investigated. Genetic diversity and heterozygosity were assessed using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis among 26 grain sorghum hybrids grown commercially in Australia. The genetic distances between each sorghum hybrid and a standard highly resistant hybrid were found to be strongly negatively correlated to hybrid midge resistance ratings (r = - 0. 77, p < 0. 001). In addition, the average heterozygosity of each hybrid was correlated with their midge resistance ratings (r = - 0. 54, p < 0. 01). The results indicate that the move to midge resistant hybrids has been associated with a narrowing of the genetic diversity and average heterozygosity of commercial sorghum hybrids. Repeated use of particular elite parent <b>lines,</b> <b>linkage</b> drag and genetic drift are likely to have contributed to this decline.

40|$|Abstract: For decades, {{the field}} of SHRM has {{conducted}} {{a lot of research}} into the relationship between the presence of HR systems and organizational performance. This process is also referred to as the HR value chain with the presence of HR systems as the start and organization performance {{as the end of the}} chain. More insight into intermediate linkages is needed to increase managers understanding how to increase organizational performance through HR systems. Previous studies have shown that employee HR attribution is one of these intermediate linkages. Following this, science has need for more insight into the antecedents of employee attribution. This cross-sectional and multi-level study responds to this need by examining the contribution of line manager HR attribution to employee HR attribution. It is also verified if the quality of communication (Communication) and the quality of the relationship between the line manager and employee (LMX) reinforce this connection. This has resulted in the following research question: What is the influence of line manager HR attributions on employee HR attributions and to what extent is this linkage moderated by communication and LMX? Following previous research this study distinguishes between positive and negative HR attributions. Data for this study were collected from 40 line managers and 239 employee of a non-profit and profit organization, both based in the Netherlands. Respondents completed an online questionnaire. Measured is at the individual level: data from the line managers is disaggregated to employee level. The results of the stepwise regression analysis with additional mediation analysis show that LMX and communication don’t act as moderators, but that the link between positive line manager HR attributions and positive employee HR attributions is mediated by LMX and that the link between negative line manager HR attributions and negative employee HR attributions is mediated by communication. Important conclusions that can be drawn from the data are the following: line manager HR attributions have no direct influence on employee HR attributions (1) and LMX and Communications prove to be major mediators in the <b>linkage</b> between <b>line</b> manager and employee HR attribution in the HR value chain (2).

40|$|A {{linkage disequilibrium}} between sexually {{selected}} and life history traits {{can be explained}} by three mutually non-exclusive mechanisms. Genes coding for two traits may be located close on the same chromosome, genes responsible for variation in one of the trait may pleiotropically alter the other, and non-random pairing with respect to two traits may generate a non-physical linkage disequilibrium between their genes. Knowledge of which of these three mechanisms is responsible for a covariation between two traits is of interest to understand why differently ornamented individuals differ in several phenotypic aspects. In Switzerland, barn owls Tyto alba mate randomly with respect to a colour polymorphism generating a large range of variants between reddish-brown and white, males being lighter coloured than females. Several studies have shown that plumage coloration is not neutral with respect to some life history components. To test whether coloration is genetically associated with body size, partial cross-fostering experiments were performed by exchanging some hatchlings between nests. These experiments showed that darker biological fathers produce longer-tailed offspring. This sex-specific pattern is consistent with the hypothesis of non-physical <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium. In <b>line</b> with this hypothesis, darker coloured males were mated with longer-tailed females, whereas female coloration was not associated with tail length of their mate. The finding that dark nestlings had a longer tail than their pale siblings also supports the physical linkage and pleiotropy hypotheses.

In this study, two insertion/deletions (InDels) within a gene encoding c-tocopherol methyltransferase, Zea mays VTE 4 (ZmVTE 4), and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located, 85 kb upstream of ZmVTE 4 were identified to be significantly associated with a-tocopherol levels in maize kernels by conducting an association study with a panel of, 500 diverse inbred <b>lines.</b> <b>Linkage</b> analysis in three populations that segregated at either one of these three polymorphisms {{but not at the}} other two suggested that the three polymorphisms could affect a-tocopherol content independently.

One of the two InDels is located within the promoter region and associates with ZmVTE 4 transcript level.

For this purpose, the associations between 1022 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and immune traits were studied in 583 hens from nine different layer lines. Immune traits were natural antibodies for keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at 20, 40 and 65 weeks, acquired antibodies to the vaccinal virus of Newcastle disease at 20 weeks, and complement activity measured on sheep and bovine red blood cells at 20, 40 and 65 weeks. We adopted a novel approach based on across-line analysis and testing of the SNP-by-line interaction. Among <b>lines,</b> <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium is conserved at shorter distances than in individual lines; therefore, SNPs significantly associated with immune traits across lines are expected to be near the functional mutations.

Ultimately, 59 significant associations between SNPs and immune traits were detected. Our results confirmed some previously identified QTL and identified new QTL potentially involved in the immune function. We found evidence for a role of IL 17 A (chromosome 3) in natural and acquired antibody titres and in the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation.

40|$|Purpose: The cone-rod {{homeobox}} protein (CRX) is {{a member}} of the homeodomain-containing protein family expressed in the retinal photoreceptors and pinealocytes; it is involved in the regulation of the coordinate expression of multiple photoreceptor specific genes during retinal development. Mutations in the CRX gene are causally associated with retinal degeneration phenotypes in man. To clone the full length cDNA, characterize the genomic organization of canine CRX, map the gene in a radiation hybrid (RH) panel, and evaluate it as a candidate for canine inherited retinal degenerations. Methods: cDNA representational difference analysis (RDA) was done using normal and cone degeneration (cd) affected retinas. Exonic primers designed from consensus sequences of mammalian CRX cDNA were used to amplify and sequence dog genomic DNA. Canine specific primers were used for RH mapping of CRX on the RH 3000 cell <b>line.</b> <b>Linkage,</b> sequencing and/or mapping the disease locus was used to evaluate CRX as a disease associated candidate gene. Results: The gene comprises three exons and two introns and codes for a transcript with a 900 bp open reading frame (ORF). In agreement with human map data, RH mapping placed canine CRX on the proximal end of CFA 1, in a region of synteny with HSA 19 q 13 -q 13. 3. Based on RH mapping, meiotic linkage or sequencing data, we excluded CRX as the cause of canine early onset photoreceptor degenerations affecting Alaskan malamutes (cd), collies (rod-cone dysplasia 2, rcd 2), American Staffordshire terriers, and Tibetan terriers. Conclusions: Canine CRX has a high level of nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity with ortholgous sequences reported for other species. The gene is excluded from causal association with 4 early onset photoreceptor diseases affecting cones (cd) or rods and cones (rcd 2, PRA in American Staffordshire terriers, and Tibetan terriers) ...|$|R

Feather condition score {{is a measure of}} feather damage, which {{has been shown to be}} closely related to feather pecking behaviour in hens housed in groups. A population of 662 hens was genotyped for 1536 SNPs of which 1022 could be used for the association study. The analysis was conducted across 9 different lines of White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red origin. Across <b>lines</b> <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium is conserved at shorter distances than within lines; therefore, SNPs significantly associated with feather condition score across lines are expected to be closer to the functional mutations. The SNPs that had a significant across-line effect but did not show significant SNP-by-line interaction were identified, to test that the association was consistent across lines. Both the direct effect of the individual’s genotype on its plumage condition, and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual’s plumage condition were analysed. The direct genetic effect can be considered as the susceptibility to be pecked at, whereas the associative genetic effect can be interpreted as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Finally, 11 significant associations between SNPs and behavioural traits were detected in the direct model, and 81 in the associative model. A role of the gene for the serotonin receptor 2 C (HTR 2 C) on chromosome 4 was found. This supports existing evidence of a prominent involvement of the serotonergic system in the modulation of this behavioural disorder in laying hens.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increased}} use of human biological material for cell-based research and clinical interventions poses risks to the privacy of patients and donors, including the possibility of re-identification of individuals from anonymized cell lines and associated genetic data. These risks will increase as technologies and databases used for re-identification become affordable and more sophisticated. Policies that require ongoing <b>linkage</b> of cell <b>lines</b> to donors’ clinical information for research and regulatory purposes, and existing practices that limit research participants’ ability to control what is done with their genetic data, amplify the privacy concerns. Discussion To date, the privacy issues associated with cell-based research and interventions have not received much attention in the academic and policymaking contexts. This paper, arising out of a multi-disciplinary workshop, aims to rectify this by outlining the issues, proposing novel governance strategies and policy recommendations, and identifying areas where further evidence is required to make sound policy decisions. The authors of this paper take the position that existing rules and norms can be reasonably extended to address privacy risks in this context without compromising emerging developments in the research environment, and that exceptions from such rules should be justified using a case-by-case approach. In developing new policies, the broader framework of regulations governing cell-based research and related areas {{must be taken into}} account, as well as the views of impacted groups, including scientists, research participants and the general public. Summary This paper outlines deliberations at a policy development workshop focusing on privacy challenges associated with cell-based research and interventions. The paper provides an overview of these challenges, followed by a discussion of key themes and recommendations that emerged from discussions at the workshop. The paper concludes that privacy risks associated with cell-based research and interventions should be addressed through evidence-based policy reforms that account for both well-established legal and ethical norms and current knowledge about actual or anticipated harms. The authors also call for research studies that identify and address gaps in understanding of privacy risks...|$|R
40|$|While {{the genetic}} {{consequences}} of inbreeding and small population size are of fundamental importance {{in many areas}} of biology, empirical research on these phenomena has proceeded {{in the absence of a}} well-developed statistical methodology. The usual approach is to compare observed means and variances with the expectations of Wright's neutral, additive genetic model for quantitative characters. If the observations deviate from the expectations more than can be accounted for by sampling variance of the parameter estimates, the null hypothesis is routinely rejected in favor of alternatives invoking evolutionary forces such as selection or nonadditive gene action. This is a biased procedure because it treats sequential samples from the same populations as independent, and because it ignores the fact that the expectations of the neutral additive genetic model will rarely be realized when only a finite number of lines are studied. Even when genes are perfectly additive and neutral, the variation among the properties of founder populations, the random development of <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium within <b>lines,</b> and the variance in inbreeding between lines reduce the likelihood that Wright's expectations will be realized in any particular set of lines. Under most experimental designs, these sources of variation are much too large to be ignored. Formulas are presented for the variance-covariance structure of the realized within- and between-line variance under the neutral additive genetic model. These results are then used to develop statistical tests for detecting the operation of selection and/or inbreeding depression in small populations. A number of recommendations are made for the optimal design of experiments on drift and inbreeding, and a method is suggested for the correction of data for general environmental effects. In general, it appears that we can best understand the response of populations to inbreeding and finite population size by studying a very large number (> 100) of self-fertilizing or full-sib mated lines in parallel with one or more stable control populations...|$|R
40|$|Interest on rotor wake {{analysis}} {{has always been}} a point of focus of rotorcraft analysis and design, its importance is undeniable and has been kept in current status within the research community as improvement of knowledge and tools have allowed the exploration of such phenomenon and its influence on engineering applications. While several approaches are available to consider the important effect of wake on rotorcraft performance, the need to explore in detail and emulate the nature of this complex fluid structure has increased to meet demanding operational requirements. High loading on blades, maneuver loads, unsteady structural dynamics, vibration management, major structural components fatigue, close to ground operations and on-board ship operations, all have shown their own demanding nature related with rotor wake, a reality that traditional models and methods may not meet completely when faced with convergent design philosophies and analysis based on early life cycle assessment to boost development. The goal of this work to provide an initial insight into the potential of a rotorcraft aerodynamic wake model in state space form and its impact on rotor performance and the capability of current analytical and numerical models to consider such potential into a basic flight mechanics environment. First a brief overview of the physical phenomena is included to highlight the origin of this study and the relevance of the physics fundamentals. Then, with the presence of the wake already established, a review of diverse literature is shown containing the different approaches to rotor wake modeling. The free wake model in state space is introduced and its definition is presented as well as problem setting solution approach trough the Method of <b>Lines,</b> <b>linkage</b> to blade motion is also presented. A dissection of the different model components is presented and individual validation for every component is included. The integrated model is tested for an isolated rotor in different circumstances and compared against the behavior of experiments in order to check for suitability of the model into potential more complex flight mechanics evaluations and analysis via simulation. Conclusions in this regard are finally presented. Flight Performance and PropulsionAerodynamics, Wind Energy, Flight Performance and PropulsionAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
