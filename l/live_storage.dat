25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} Egypt {{depends on a}} complex set of infrastructure along {{the entire length of the}} river. The key element of this infrastructure is the Aswan High Dam that forms Lake Nasser. The High Dam protects Egypt from floods, stores water for year-round irrigation and produces hydro power. With a <b>live</b> <b>storage</b> capacity of 90 billion cubic the dam stores more than one and a half the average annual flow of the Nile River, thus providing a high level of regulation in the river basin compared to other regulated rivers in the world.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{the amount}} of river flow will {{correlate}} with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows will reduce the amount of <b>live</b> <b>storage</b> in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water {{that can be used for}} hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change. One study from the Colorado River in the United States suggest that modest climate changes, such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree Celsius resulting in a 10% decline in precipitation, might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. Brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity, as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years back data), the tribunal estimated the average water yield in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The <b>live</b> <b>storage</b> capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the average yield. The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved salt load generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in industrial, agriculture and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its aquatic ecosystem conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{tests at}} Hughes {{have shown that}} Ni/H 2 cells cycled in 26 percent KOH have much longer lives than those cycled in other concentrations. As {{part of an ongoing}} program to try to {{correlate}} the impedances of nickel electrodes with their life and performance, impedances were measured of a number of electrodes from these tests that had been cycled in concentrations from 21 to 36 percent KOH. These had ranged from about 1000 to 40, 000 cycles. After cycling ten times to reduce possible changes due to storage, impedances were measured at five voltages corresponding to low states of charge. The results were analyzed using a standard circuit model including Warburg impedance term. Lower kinetic resistances and Warburg slopes were found for several electrodes which had been cycled in 26 percent KOH even though they had been cycled for a much longer time than the others.

40|$|Spontaneous heating {{property}} of coal {{is a matter}} of prime concern in mining industry. Spontaneous combustion of coal has caused many mine fires leading to huge loss of coal and also loss of many human <b>lives.</b> <b>Storage</b> and transportation of coal requires knowledge about the spontaneous heating liability of coal, as it starts degrading on coming in contact with air. Numerous studies and research work has been done to understand the mechanism of spontaneous heating and its relation with coal’s intrinsic properties. The present study presents the correlation of spontaneous heating susceptibility of coals belonging to different coalfields of India with their intrinsic properties. The coal samples were collected from different Indian coalfields. Twelve coal samples were collected from Mahanadi Coalfield Ltd. (MCL), Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL), Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL) and North Eastern Coal Fields Ltd. (NECL). The Intrinsic properties were determined by carrying out – proximate analysis, Aliphaticity from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gross calorific value (GCV) using Bomb calorimetry. The susceptibility indices were found using Crossing point temperature (CPT) and Wet oxidation potential difference (WOPD). The correlation of intrinsic properties and susceptibility indices is done using both Simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. The results for intrinsic properties and the susceptibility indices are presented in table 1. The simple linear regression analysis showed that the moisture, ash and aliphaticity as compared to other intrinsic properties are a better indicator of spontaneous heating as they have better correlation with CPT and WOPD. Therefore, aliphaticity is suggested as a good indicator of spontaneous heating susceptibility. On multiple linear regression analysis strong correlation was found between moisture, ash, aliphaticity and both the susceptibility indices...|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{refrigerators}} often {{operate at}} temperatures which {{are higher than}} ideal for chilled food storage, with several studies finding averages around 7 C. Reducing temperatures for example to 4 C could significantly extend <b>storage</b> <b>lives,</b> giving greater opportunity for use before disposal. However, the savings in costs and emissions associated with reduced waste must be balanced against those associated with increased energy consumption at lower temperatures. Based on published <b>storage</b> <b>lives</b> of foods which are currently refrigerated and UK waste statistics, reducing from 7 C to 4 C could save £ 162. 9 m of waste annually, with associated emissions of 270, 000 tonnes CO 2 e. Including certain foods which are not always refrigerated and removing others which do not benefit from refrigeration, the estimated savings increased to £ 283. 8 m and 578, 383 tonnes CO 2 e. Based on experimental assessment, the costs and emissions associated with increased fridge energy consumption were considerably lower at £ 80. 9 m and 367, 411 tonnes CO 2 e. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

Besides, users can just use so-called low-cost thin client or PDA to link to the cloud platform to complete the routines rather than PCs. Furthermore, thin client has its own simple device architecture, extremely low possibility of malfunction, shutdown by overheating, and attacked by viruses.
