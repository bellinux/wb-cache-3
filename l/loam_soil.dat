5|$|In addition, the Strip {{west of the}} Toledo area is a prime {{location}} for agriculture, because of its well-drained, fertile <b>loam</b> <b>soil.</b> The area had for many years produced large amounts of corn and wheat per acre.

25|$|Like {{all crops}} and plants, Christmas trees require a {{specific}} set of nutrients to thrive. There are 16elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, chlorine, manganese, molybdenum, iron, and zinc are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used. Other important soil considerations include pH and drainage. Certain types of soil are preferable, {{depending on the type of}} tree. Pine trees are usually better adapted to a sandy or sandy <b>loam</b> <b>soil,</b> while white spruce trees and fir trees, such as the Douglas-fir, prefer fine-texture loams and clay loam soils. Some trees grow well in all types of soil, but in any case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas tree farm to have a chance of thriving.|$|E
40|$|Field {{infiltrometer}} {{techniques are}} becoming very popular for soil hydraulic characterization because the experiments are relatively easy, rapid and inexpensive. <b>Loam</b> <b>soils</b> generally exhibit a good balance between {{large and small}} pores, thus movement and retention of water is almost optimal.

5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy <b>loam</b> <b>soils,</b> and clay <b>loam</b> <b>soils</b> in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay <b>loam</b> <b>soils</b> are found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|R

The Geological Survey of India has identified Thiruvananthapuram as a moderately earthquake-prone urban centre and categorised the city in the Seismic III Zone. Thiruvananthapuram lies on the shores of Karamana and Killi rivers. Vellayani, Thiruvallam and Aakulam backwaters lies in the city. The Soil type in the middle part of the city is dark brown loamy laterite soil high in phosphates. Laterisation {{is a result of the}} heavy rainfall and humid conditions.

2500|$|The Red Mountain AVA was {{established}} in 2001 and is the second smallest wine region in Washington next to Naches Heights. Of the region's , nearly [...] were planted as of 2008. The {{vast majority of the}} AVA is composed of gentle slope made up of sandy <b>loam</b> <b>soil</b> with high calcium content. The area has good air drainage with full southern exposure which allows the wine grapes to maintain increased acidity levels and attain optimal ripeness. In recent years Red Mountain has seen increased interest in the quality of its Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah and Sangiovese. The soils of Red Mountain are low in nutrients with high pH levels. This limits the vigor of the vine producing low yields, small canopy and grape berry sizes 50-60% smaller than the varietal norm. Despite having a reputation as Washington's most prestigious and highly sought after AVA, growth in the Red Mountain area was limited by lack of available water rights and needed to establish irrigation. In 2005, the Washington Department of Natural Resources released water rights for [...] of land suitable for vineyard development. The new developments are expected to increase the profile of the AVA.|$|E
