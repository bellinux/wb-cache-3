60|$|Dante and Milton {{were both}} deeply {{penetrated}} with the ancient {{religion of the}} civilized world; and its spirit exists in their poetry probably in the same proportion as its forms survived in the unreformed worship of modern Europe. The one preceded and the other followed the Reformation at almost equal intervals. Dante was the first religious reformer, and Luther surpassed him rather in the rudeness and acrimony, than in the boldness of his censures of papal usurpation. Dante was the first awakener of entranced Europe; he created a <b>language,</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> music and persuasion, out of a chaos of inharmonious barbarisms. He was the congregator of those great spirits {{who presided over the}} resurrection of learning; the Lucifer of that starry flock which in the thirteenth century shone forth from republican Italy, as from a heaven, into the darkness of the benighted world. His very words are instinct with spirit; each is as a spark, a burning atom of inextinguishable thought; and many yet lie covered in the ashes of their birth, and pregnant with a lightning which has yet found no conductor. All high poetry is infinite; it is as the first acorn, which contained all oaks potentially. Veil after veil may be undrawn, and the inmost naked beauty of the meaning never exposed. A great poem is a fountain for ever overflowing with the waters of wisdom and delight; and after one person and one age has exhausted all its divine effluence which their peculiar relations enable them to share, another and yet another succeeds, and new relations are ever developed, the source of an unforeseen and an unconceived delight.|$|E

When we see the life-blood of the state {{circulate}} so freely through the capillary vessels of the System, we scarcely need inquire if the heart performs its functions aright. But let us approach it; let us lay it bare, and watch the systole and diastole, as it now receives and now pours forth the vital stream through all the members. The port of London has always supplied the main evidence {{of the state of}} our commerce. I know, that, amidst all the difficulties and embarrassments of the year 1793, from causes unconnected with and prior to the war, the tonnage of ships in the Thames actually rose. But I shall not go through a detail of official papers on this point. There is evidence, which has appeared this very session before your House, infinitely more forcible and impressive to my apprehension than all the journals and ledgers of all the Inspectors-General from the days of Davenant. It is such as cannot carry with it any sort of fallacy. It comes, not from one set, but from many opposite sets of witnesses, who all agree in nothing else: witnesses of the gravest and most unexceptionable character, and who confirm what they say, in the surest manner, by their conduct. Two different bills have been brought in for improving the port of London. I have it from very good intelligence, that, when the project was first suggested from necessity, there were no less than eight different plans, supported by eight different bodies of subscribers. The cost of the least was estimated at two hundred thousand pounds, and of the most extensive at twelve hundred thousand. The two between which the contest now lies substantially agree (as all the others must have done) in the motives and reasons of the preamble; but I shall confine myself to that bill which is proposed {{on the part of the}} mayor, aldermen, and common council, because I regard them as the best authority, and their <b>language</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> is fuller and more precise. I certainly see them complain of the [...] "great delays, accidents, damages, losses, and extraordinary expenses, which are almost continually sustained, to the hindrance and discouragement of commerce, and the great injury of the public revenue." [...] But what are the causes to which they attribute their complaints? The first is, [...] "THAT, FROM THE VERY GREAT AND PROGRESSIVE INCREASE OF THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SHIPS AND OTHER VESSELS TRADING TO THE PORT OF LONDON, the river Thames, in and near the said port, is in general so much crowded with shipping, lighters, and other craft, that the navigation of a considerable part of the river is thereby rendered tedious and dangerous; and there is great want of room in the said port for the safe and convenient mooring of vessels, and constant access to them." [...] The second is of the same nature. It is the want of regulations and arrangements, never before found necessary, for expedition and facility. The third is of another kind, but to the same effect: That the legal quays are too confined, and there is not sufficient accommodation for the landing and shipping of cargoes. And the fourth and last is still different: they describe the avenues to the legal quays (which, little more than a century since, the great fire of London opened and dilated beyond the measure of our then circumstances) to be now [...] "incommodious, and much too narrow for the great concourse of carts and other carriages usually passing and repassing therein." [...] Thus our trade has grown too big for the ancient limits of Art and Nature. Our streets, our lanes, our shores, the river itself, which has so long been our pride, are impeded and obstructed and choked up by our riches. They are, like our shops, [...] "bursting with opulence." [...] To these misfortunes, to these distresses and grievances alone, we are told, it is to be imputed that still more of our capital has not been pushed into the channel of our commerce, to roll back in its reflux still more abundant capital, and fructify the national treasury in its course. Indeed, my dear Sir, when I have before my eyes this consentient testimony of the corporation of the city of London, the West India merchants, and all the other merchants who promoted the other plans, struggling and contending which of them shall be permitted to lay out their money in consonance with their testimony, I cannot turn aside to examine what one or two violent petitions, tumultuously voted by real or pretended liverymen of London, may have said of the utter destruction and annihilation of trade.|$|E

50|$|Méndez Guédez's {{work has}} been placed by many {{literary}} scholars — such as Chiara Bolognese (Autonomous University of Madrid), Fabiola Fernandez (Andrés Bello Catholic University), Vega Sánchez (University of Salamanca), or Maartje Vranken (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven) — in the orbit of the Spanish-American romantic and sentimental narrative. A line of writing that comes from authors like Manuel Puig or Alfredo Bryce Echenique, in which the humor, relationships with popular culture, and {{the emphasis on the}} emotional dramas of male characterized by their fragility, define the general discourse of its narrative. But, as the writer Ignacio Sanz argues, in Méndez Guédez one sees a sense of dual belonging, on one side to the Peninsular Spanish cultural register and, on the other, to the Hispanic American Weltanschauung, which is evident in the construction of his prose style, full of winks and lexical features that constitute a sort of mestizo <b>language</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gödel's {{conclusion}} in his incompleteness theorems {{was that you}} cannot prove consistency within any axiomatic system rich enough to include classical arithmetic. On the one hand, you must use only the formal language chosen to formalize this axiomatic system; on the other hand, {{it is impossible to}} prove the consistency of this <b>language</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> (Snapper, 1979). Hilbert was originally frustrated by Gödel's work because it shattered his life's goal to completely formalize everything in number theory (Reid and Weyl, 1970). However, Gödel did not feel that he contradicted everything about Hilbert's formalist point of view. After Gödel published his work, it became apparent that proof theory still had some use, {{the only difference is that}} it could not be used to prove the consistency of all of number theory as Hilbert had hoped (Reid and Weyl, 1970). Present-day formalists use proof theory to further our understanding in mathematics, but perhaps because of Gödel's work, they make no claims about semantic meaning in the work that they do with mathematics. Proofs are simply the manipulation of symbols in our formal language starting from certain rules that we call axioms.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanization}} {{of translation}} of texts from one language to another {{has been a}} great problem ever since linguists, computers and computer programs exist as such. People tried to develop programs to make translation easier, to make machines able to translate a text without human, manual help. However, these attempts have not succeeded fully. Nowadays, translation programs are able to produce a "raw" translation of a text, but afterwards there is great need for revision and editing, which necessarily involves the work of a professional translator. The nature of <b>languages</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> is an obstacle to the full mechanization of translation. You can think of some basic, simple examples, even if you have never dealt with machine translation or linguistics, but you know at least two languages. For example, there is no one-to-one correspondence between words of two different languages. There are even words or expressions <b>in</b> a <b>language</b> that have no exact equivalent <b>in</b> the other <b>language,</b> <b>in</b> extreme cases the notion itself does not exist <b>in</b> the other <b>language,</b> so there is no word for it.
