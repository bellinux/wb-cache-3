When Bond has presumably ordered a drink from room service to his hotel room, it is mixed by a waiter, who says [...] "one medium dry vodka martini mixed <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> sir, but not stirred." [...] (A slice of lime was {{in the bottom of}} the glass.) Later, Dr. No presents Bond with a drink - [...] "A medium dry martini, lemon peel. Shaken, not stirred." ...|$|E

Gang Starr has always been one of my favorite groups. I've always wanted to work with him. It was time. I connected with him and seen him in a couple of places. I told him that I wanted to work with him. It took a little time to get up with him but eventually, we got up. That was the last song I recorded for Like Water For Chocolate. We released 'Dooinit' first and then the single and video for 'The 6th Sense'. Then, we followed it up with 'The Light'.|$|E

5000|$|Commentators in {{a variety}} of media sources have {{characterized}} Dane Cook's humor as unfunny. Comedian Ron White has criticized Dane Cook for his lack of real material and for his inflated ego; saying [...] "He does not make me laugh, at all, in any way, shape or form." [...] When asked about his opinion of Cook on The Howard Stern Show, comedian Nick DiPaolo said [...] "he doesn't make me laugh, but that doesn't mean he's not funny." [...] On Boston radio station WBCN, Dane Cook was named by radio show Toucher and Rich to a tournament of the top 16 [...] "Worst Comedians" [...] and, based on listener voting, was voted the [...] "Worst Comedian" [...] of all. In the Michigan Daily, Elie Zwiebel and co-author Jesse Bean wrote that [...] "he's managed {{to become one of the}} most overrated comics ever" [...] and that his act is [...] "boringly stagnant". In an interview with Jason Tanamor of Zoiks! Online, Tanamor asked Cook why he was so despised. Cook stated that he'd had conversations with his therapist, attributing some of the negativity to his alpha demeanor. Add to that, Cook's highly successful career. [...] "Unfortunately, what you find is, you know in your graduating class with the guys you came up with, there's going to be some dudes in front of you that don’t want you catching up, and there's going to be some guys behind you that maybe they’ve never had an opportunity. That, coupled with, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> reaching the Billboard charts with ‘Retaliation’ and a lot of people going, ‘Who the fuck does he think he is?’ ...|$|E

5000|$|Lynne {{is leaving}} a hotel {{when she is}} bumped into by Virgil, who on purpose spills tea on her. She goes to the {{bathroom}} to clean up, where Carrie is waiting for her. She gives Lynne the device needed to download the Prince's phone data hidden in a makeup compact. Carrie tries to set Lynne at ease, lying to her that Lynne is under 24/7 protection. Carrie visits her sister Maggie (Amy Hargreaves). Maggie is a psychiatrist and has been pilfering samples of an anti-psychotic medication to give to Carrie. Maggie expresses concern that she is jeopardizing her own practice by doing so, but Carrie says she has no other option, as if she pursued any kind of treatment on her own, her secret would be out and she would surely lose her security clearance with the CIA. Maggie gives her a week's supply of pills. A flashback is shown of Brody's time as a prisoner. Brody emerges from his cell and seems surprised {{by the fact that he}} is able to walk freely about the compound. He encounters a room full of worshipers in the middle of Muslim prayer and stops to watch them. Back in the present day, Brody heads to his garage. He puts his newly purchased carpet down on the floor and kneels down on it; he begins to pray, reciting Al-Fatiha from the Quran. Later that day, Brody goes outside in full uniform to talk to all of the media camped out in front of his house. Carrie is watching the cameras and excitedly calls Saul and tells him [...] "It's happening, exactly <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said.</b> He's out there playing the hero card!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Chelsea was {{originally}} {{portrayed as a}} con artist and bad girl. Egan said that she [...] "knew some people hate her", and she finds Chelsea [...] "fun because she's a con artist". Catherine Bach was cast {{in the role of}} Anita Lawson, Chelsea's mother, to [...] "play a vital role in Egan's character storyline". Egan said that [...] "you see where Chelsea gets it from because her mom is a con artist, but way worse than Chelsea", and that [...] "Chelsea has more of a conscience than Anita". Jeffrey Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) was then revealed as Chelsea's father, after which Egan said [...] "it came out of nowhere", though [...] "it’s great to have so many people to be intertwined with, if you will." [...] On the topic of her character's personality, the actress said: [...] "The viewers met Chelsea as a schemester and pregnant with child. She did not have any friends. And now, {{you will be able to}} see her personality. We can see her finally in some hot clothes, maybe a skirt, and high heels. She is no longer the beached whale at the bar." [...] In an interview in 2013, Egan stated that she thought Chelsea had [...] "certainly evolved a lot", saying: [...] "Well she’s certainly evolved a lot; I mean she’s done a complete 180 as far as her intentions are. When I started, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> she was kind of a con artist, and manipulative, and doing things for money, and you know - completely, kind of not a very good person. But since then, she’s fallen in love, she’s gotten married - she’s gotten divorced! -and experienced life, its highs and lows and ups and downs and learned about family she didn’t know she had. She’s gotten closer to certain members of her family and gained friendships. I don’t think Chelsea was someone who had girlfriends before when she was on the road and cons don’t really have good relationships. So she’s just a better person; a better human being. She’s kind of lived life a little bit and definitely become more of a genuine, well-rounded person." ...|$|E
30|$|B: But {{we have to}} {{know this}} that some people only to give just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> in teamwork. Some people they give because they want to make you feel like he is cleverer than you, he is {{stronger}} than you, and he is more powerful than you. So he choose to give not because he wants to make this thing better, just want to show that he is more powerful than you. That’s a kind of abnormal kind of giving.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, that's so <b>like</b> <b>you.</b> I always <b>said</b> you'd {{no feeling}} of real romance. If I cared {{for a woman}} I'd give her the coat off my back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{it is to}} have {{a friend}} <b>like</b> <b>you,</b> Gertrude,' <b>said</b> Cadurcis, 'a friend who is neither a Goth, nor a Vandal, nor a Hun, nor a Calmuck, nor a Canadian savage; but a woman of fashion, style, ton, {{influence}} in the world! It is impossible that a greater piece of good fortune could have befallen me than having you for a friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps. But {{we thought}} you wanted us to be more serious than we were about {{addressing}} letters properly. This is the larger-sized morality, the real No. 11 sort, and <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> it, though <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> expected it of us." ...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{majority}} of participants reporting that heterosexual relationships had “understandings” and not agreements, and the problems linked to infidelity noted in the discussion of sexual agreements, {{the majority}} of both male and female participants reported being in favor of having explicit sexual agreements. As one female participant noted, “It does make it easier at the beginning and you might as well get your cards all out on the table because, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> you find out four, five, six, years later this is what his idea of cheating is and this is what my idea of cheating is and we’re not even on the same page…So like might as well {{get it out of the}} way” (female). However, there were some gender differences in how men and women spoke about the content of sexual agreements. Men focused on the sexual aspects of sexual agreements, while women expanded the discussions to a broader definition of relationship agreements, including, for example, finances: “you need money to survive, and I know what I’m not going to be doing this bill and you ain’t doing no bills, this bill in half, and it’s coming every month, yeah he’s going to pay that in full” (female).|$|E
40|$|The present work discusses, {{from the}} presuppositions of the New Rhetoric or Theory of the Argumentation, the {{argumentative}} movements {{realized in the}} journalistic interview. The Objective in this work is to reveal how the interview technics can be use as persuasion strategies, e achieve a theorical basis to sustain the thesis of the interaction as a space of subjectivities encounter. In the interviewer questions has been identified linguistic marcs used as arguments {{to try to persuade}} the interviewee and to control the deliberated senses and the talk`s flow. Those linguistic elements has been systematized, with the connection between data and theory, in rhetoric categories created during the research. The questions were systematized, them, according the purpose and effect production. Two macro-categories appears: 1) Sense control, 2) Talkâs flow control. From this extract emerge the analysis categories understood as interview and persuasion strategies. Through this macro-categories can be visualized witch argumentation instruments are used by the interviewer in the interview. In the first macro-category of sense control appears: 1) the use of the interrogative modalities: a) interrogation-thesis, b) direct style question; 2) use of notions: a) adjectives (evaluatives), b) nouns (nominations and classifications). Otherwise in the interviewâs control flow category are: 3) the use of the restrictive expressions of beginning, of recover and closure: to begin with, retaking the theme, changing the subject, to finish; 3. 1) the use of expressions that indicate restrictions: <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> but the point is. In this work were analyzed 10 selected interviews from the section âEntrevistas Explosivasâ, from the Caros Amigos Magazine. O presente trabalho examina, a partir dos pressupostos teÃricos da Nova RetÃrica ou Teoria da ArgumentaÃÃo, os movimentos argumentativos que se realizam na entrevista jornalÃstica. Objetivou-se revelar como as tÃcnicas de entrevista podem ser abordadas como estratÃgias de persuasÃo, e ganhar, desse modo, um suporte teÃrico para sustentar a tese da interaÃÃo como espaÃo de encontro de subjetividades. Foram identificadas nas perguntas do entrevistador marcas lingÃÃsticas usadas como argumentos para tentar persuadir o entrevistado, controlar os sentidos deliberados e o fluxo da conversa. Esses elementos lingÃÃsticos foram sistematizados, conforme os dados se entrelaÃavam com a teoria, em categorias retÃricas criadas ao longo da pesquisa. As perguntas foram sistematizadas, entÃo, conforme a finalidade e o efeito que produziam. Duas grandes macro-categorias surgiram: 1) controle de sentidos, 2) controle de fluxo da conversa. Desse recorte surgiram as categorias de anÃlise compreendidas como estratÃgias de entrevista e persuasÃo. A partir dessas macro-categorias visualizam-se quais sÃo os instrumentos utilizados na argumentaÃÃo do entrevistador frente ao entrevistado. Na primeira macro-categoria de controle de sentidos aparece: 1) uso de modalidades interrogativas: a) tese-interrogaÃÃo, b) pergunta no estilo direto; 2) uso de noÃÃes: a) adjetivos (avaliativos), b) substantivos (nominaÃÃes e classificaÃÃes). JÃ na categoria de controle de fluxo da entrevista estÃo: 3) uso de expressÃes restritoras de inÃcio, de retomada e de finalizaÃÃo: pra comeÃar, retomando a questÃo, mudando de assunto, pra encerrar; 3. 1) uso de expressÃes denotadoras de restriÃÃo: dentro do que vocÃ disse, mas a questÃo Ã.
