5|$|The {{reservations}} in Wisconsin {{were named}} the <b>Lac</b> Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, and <b>Lac</b> du Flambeau Indian Reservation. The La Pointe Band {{was given a}} reservation at Bad River around the Band's traditional wild ricing grounds on the south shore of Lake Superior, and some reserved land for fishing grounds at the eastern tip of Madeline Island. In Minnesota, the reservations for the Fond du <b>Lac</b> and the Grand Portage bands were established, with pending negotiations promised for the Bois Forte Band. In Michigan, reservations for the <b>Lac</b> Vieux Desert, Ontonagon and L'Anse bands were established.

5|$|In a 2016 plebiscite, the {{residents}} of six parishes (Baker Brook, Clair, <b>Lac</b> Baker, Madawaska, Saint-François, and Saint-Hilaire) and four villages (Baker Brook, Clair, Saint-François de Madawaska and Saint-Hilaire) within the New Brunswick Panhandle voted 493 to 299 in favour of incorporating a new rural community {{under the name of}} Haut-Madawaska. The plebiscite was the second in as many years. In 2015, a similar plebiscite was held that also included a fifth village, <b>Lac</b> Baker. The residents of all communities involved voted in favour of incorporation as a rural community with the exception of <b>Lac</b> Baker's residents, thereby defeating the proposal.|$|E

50|$|Third group {{forming the}} Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians were the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band of Mississippi Chippewa, a band {{associated}} with the powerful Mississippi Chippewa. Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band of Mississippi Chippewa lived primarily along Nokasippi River, Cedar River and Ripple River (all located north and northwest of Mille <b>Lacs</b> Lake), the portage ways connecting these three rivers to Mille <b>Lacs</b> Lake, and along the northwestern and northern shores of Mille <b>Lacs</b> Lake.|$|R
5000|$|When the White Earth Indian Reservation was established, {{like the}} rest of the Mississippi Chippewa, the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians were also {{encouraged}} to relocate. Many Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians became homeless so under , homesteading and cemetery lands were secured for the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians. After the signing of the [...] "An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota" [...] (51st-1st-Ex.Doc.247) and a removal bill in May 27, 1902, many Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians did remove themselves to the White Earth Inidan Reserveration, becoming the Removable Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band. Others remained on the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indian Reservation, becoming the Non-removable Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band. Within few years, many of the Removable Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band left White Earth and returned to Mille <b>Lacs,</b> splitting the group onto two separate Indian Reservations.|$|R

5|$|Linde's {{first taste}} of minor league action came in 1942, when he signed with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Wisconsin State League. His {{performances}} that season included a near-no-hitter that {{was lost in the}} ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du <b>Lac</b> Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du <b>Lac,</b> in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory.

5000|$|Mille <b>Lacs</b> County was {{organized}} on May 23, 1857, cleaving off the easternmost portion of Benton County, Minnesota.

40|$|The study set out {{to explore}} whether local area coordinators (<b>LACs)</b> and their {{managers}} view the health role of <b>LACs</b> as {{an essential component of}} their work and identify the health-related activities undertaken by <b>LACs</b> in Scotland. A mixed methods cross-sectional phenomenological study involving local authority service managers (n = 25) and <b>LACs</b> (n = 40) was adopted. Quantitative data from <b>LACs</b> were obtained using online and postal questionnaires. Qualitative data from local authority service managers and <b>LACs</b> were collected using one-to-one interviews and focus groups. Thematic analysis was undertaken of the qualitative data. The results indicate {{that there is a need}} to develop further the wider public health role of <b>LACs</b> to incorporate health-related activities focused on broader community-based outcomes such as empowerment and community integration.

50|$|The Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians (Ojibwe: Misi-zaaga'iganiwininiwag), {{also known}} as the Mille <b>Lacs</b> and Snake River Band of Chippewa, are a Band of Indians formed from the {{unification}} of the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band of Mississippi Chippewa (Ojibwe) with the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band of Mdewakanton Sioux (Dakota).

5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the <b>Lac</b> Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and <b>Lac</b> Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E

Sandy Lake Band members who dis-enrolled from the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band and re-enrolled elsewhere were automatically excluded from dis-enrolling from their new tribe to re-enroll with the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band.

The four historical bands in the Mille <b>Lacs</b> region (Mille <b>Lacs</b> Indians, Sandy Lake Band, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, and Snake and Kettle River Bands of St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota) were reorganized as the Mille <b>Lacs</b> Band of Ojibwe.|$|R

Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of <b>Lac</b> Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, <b>Lac</b> du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
