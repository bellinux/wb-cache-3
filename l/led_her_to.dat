5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience {{and she did}} so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive {{of herself as a}} more serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E
5|$|Maria's {{character}} and beliefs <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{become involved in}} the movements directed against intemperance and slavery. She {{was a member of the}} Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and persuaded her husband to become an abolitionist. James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments, but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement. His second volume of poems Miscellaneous Poems expressed these antislavery thoughts, and its 1,500 copies sold well.|$|E

5|$|Ucu {{was born}} in Sukabumi, West Java, on 19 August 1976 to a strict Muslim family. As a child, she studied in the Darunnajah Islamic {{boarding}} school in Jakarta for six years; removed from the outside world, she felt shocked when she learned {{that many of the}} women in her hometown worked as prostitutes. This discovery <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> become more critical of the world around her and made her interested in journalism. Ucu later attended the Jakarta Islamic State University.|$|E
5|$|After John Firth's death, Arthur {{moved with}} his family to London. According to Richardson they lived in the area around Liverpool Street in the east of the city, {{although}} Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in Bedford Park and then Kensington, both in the west of the city. From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at Studley Agricultural College in Warwickshire, a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913. She later claimed that at the college she was the victim of mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a mental breakdown that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.|$|E

She took further studies at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Banff, Alberta, before returning to the CFC as a director residency. She continued to be involved with the American company Women Make Movies, a distributor of feminist media, which she had become involved with while at NYU.|$|E

5|$|Asma is a {{professional}} Emirati puppeteer, storyteller and creative drama specialist. A graduate of the United Arab Emirates University, Asma earned her BA in English Literature, minoring in drama and theater. Through a Summer Master’s Degree Program in Applied Drama at the City University of New York, Asma distinguished herself as a creative drama specialist, {{with a focus on}} puppetry and early childhood education. This <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be chosen by the Zayed Higher Organization in 2012 to work with children with special needs. As a result of her training with the ‘Kids on the Block’ program, which uses special puppets crafted with different disabilities, Asma has opened up a new field of early childhood intervention; one that uses the dynamics of puppetry and creative drama to enhance education for the most impressionable audience in the UAE.|$|E
5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Roosevelt's {{international}} role as {{spokesperson for}} women <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stop publicly criticizing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), although she never supported it. In the early 1960s, she announced that, due to unionization, she believed the ERA {{was no longer}} a threat to women as it once may have been and told supporters that they could have the amendment if they wanted it. In 1961, President Kennedy's undersecretary of labor, Esther Peterson proposed a new Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. Kennedy appointed Roosevelt to chair the commission, with Peterson as director. This was Roosevelt's last public position. She died just before the commission issued its report. It concluded that female equality was best achieved by recognition of gender differences and needs, and not by an Equal Rights Amendment.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Chastain {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut as Juliet in {{a production of}} Romeo and Juliet staged by TheatreWorks, a company in the San Francisco Bay Area. The production <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> audition for the Juilliard School in New York City, where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by the actor Robin Williams. In her first year at the school, Chastain suffered from anxiety and was worried about being dropped from the program, spending {{most of her time}} reading and watching movies. She later remarked that her participation in a successful production of The Seagull during her second year helped build her confidence. She graduated from the school with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 2003.|$|E
5|$|McConnell {{was raised}} in Colorado and after {{studying}} chemistry she became a high school teacher. She later attended medical school at the University of Colorado Denver, graduating in 1925. She specialized {{in the fields of}} toxicology and forensic pathology, which <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> testify in many high-profile criminal cases throughout her career. In addition to working as Denver's city toxicologist, she held positions in multiple hospitals and administrative boards. After battling lifelong health problems, including rheumatic heart disease and a leg amputation, McConnell died in 1975. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Between 1908 and 1910 the WLL and the WIC co-operated in a {{nationwide}} investigation of married women's working conditions. Bondfield {{carried out the}} fieldwork in Yorkshire. The {{relationship between the two}} bodies was sometimes fractious, and when the report was due to be published, there were disagreements over how it should be handled. As a result of these and other clashes, Bondfield, MacDonald and the other League women resigned from the Council. In 1911 Bondfield assumed the role of the WLL's Organising Secretary, and spent much of the year travelling: she formed a WLL branch in Ogmore Vale, Glamorgan, reformed the Manchester branch, and found time to advise laundrywomen engaged in a dispute in South Wales. The sudden death of Mary MacDonald in September 1911 added considerably to Bondfield's workload; the strain, together with internal animosities within the WLL, <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> resign her position in January 1912. The League made strenuous efforts to retain her, and only in September did its committee reluctantly accept her departure. An attempt to re-engage her in 1913 was unsuccessful, and Marion Phillips was appointed to succeed her.|$|E

5|$|Breakaway is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, {{released}} on November 30, 2004, by RCA Records. The album is a follow-up to her successful debut album, Thankful (2003). Executive produced by Clive Davis, Breakaway sees Clarkson collaborating with various producers and songwriters for the first time, primarily Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, Ben Moody, and David Hodges; the latter two are former members of American rock band Evanescence. Despite the established commercial success of Thankful, music critics still continued to typecast Clarkson as an American Idol winner and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she was convinced by Davis to work with Dr. Luke and Martin in Stockholm, and with Moody and Hodges in Los Angeles, {{in pursuit of a}} pop rock direction. This also <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. Breakaway is predominately a pop rock album with elements of rock and soul music, marking a departure from the R sound of Thankful; its lyrics explore themes of heartbreak, love, and escapism.|$|E
5|$|David played squash {{when she}} was five years old, and {{received}} coaching {{at the age of}} eight. While training at the Bukit Dumbar Squash Centre, David was talent spotted by Ee Phoeh Hoon, who <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> represent her home state of Penang, along with her sisters. David's squash career began in 1992 when she won silver in the Under-14 category of the Penang State Junior Championship. Her first national level victory was also in 1992 at the Milo-Dunlop Sport National Junior Interstate Championship, where she won silver in the Under-16 category. In 1994, David was chosen to join the Penang state squash team for the Malaysian Games (SUKMA) tournament where she helped Penang win a gold medal in the team event, despite being ill at the time. In the same year, she won her first two international titles – the Hong Kong U-13 and the Scottish Junior Open Under-12.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{go along with the}} plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E

5|$|In her April 2008 budget, Stelmach's Finance Minister Iris Evans {{forecast}} a $1.6billion surplus for 2008–2009. By August, she had revised {{this prediction}} to $8.5billion. The {{major reason for}} this change {{is an increase in}} oil prices: while she had estimated in April that they would average $78 per barrel over the fiscal year, by August increases—including a high of $147 per barrel in July—have <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make a new estimate of a $119.25 per barrel average. By November, prices had fallen to $55 per barrel, and Evans estimated a $2billion surplus. By February 2009, the government of Alberta appeared poised to run a $1billion deficit. In April 2009, Evans released her budget for 2009–2010, in which she anticipated a $4.6billion deficit. This is the largest deficit in Alberta's history, and its first in sixteen years. The government's fiscal plan includes deficits until 2012–2013, when it again anticipates a surplus.|$|E
5|$|Lana is Sindi (Marisa Warrington) and Penny Watts' (Andrea McEwan) cousin. She {{was born}} in Australia, but her family moved to Canada when she was young. They {{returned}} to Australia a few years later, and Lana began attending Wattle Heights High School, where she was bullied over her sexuality. This <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> transfer to Erinsborough High. Lana finds employment at the Coffee Shop alongside Serena Bishop, whom she befriends. Lana is convinced {{that she had seen}} Serena before, and she realises that Serena had been in some photos taken by dodgy photographer Chris Cousens. Lana admits to Serena that she had also been taken in by Chris and that she was not over it. Lana did not get on with Serena's cousin, Sky, and one day they fight at school. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) places them in detention and urges them to work things out.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E
