5|$|By the 19th century, the Spanish Crown had <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of its {{possessions}} in the Americas. Two of its remaining possessions were Puerto Rico and Cuba, both {{of which}} were demanding more autonomy and had pro-independence movements. The Spanish Crown issued the Royal Decree of Graces (Real Cédula de Gracias) which was originated August 10, 1815, with the intention of attracting European settlers who were not of Spanish origin to the islands.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, the Klan's {{public support}} nearly {{vanished}} and their membership dropped to about 100,000 people, primarily {{concentrated in the}} South, having <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of their members in the Midwest and West. At that time, James A. Colescott, Evans' handpicked chief of staff, increasingly shouldered Evans' responsibilities. After the Great Depression further damaged the Klan's finances, the group's leadership sold their Atlanta headquarters in 1936. Around that time, Evans announced his intention to retire.|$|E

5|$|In the beginning, {{everything}} seemed to go well for the new Emperor, who even tried {{to set up a}} new dynasty by conferring the title of Augusta upon his wife Aelia Zenonis and creating his son Marcus, Caesar, and later Augustus; however, due to his mismanagement as emperor, Basiliscus quickly <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Some Vedar have {{gradually}} <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> {{aspects of their}} aboriginal identity and culture and no longer identify themselves as Vedar. During the 1980s and 1990s, most Vedar families were displaced from their native villages due {{to the effects of}} the Sri Lankan civil war and were placed in refugee camps along with other Tamil refugees.|$|E

5|$|The {{tendency}} to panic continued {{in nearly all}} the 24th Infantry operations west of Sangju. Men left their positions and straggled to the rear. They abandoned weapons on positions. On many occasions units <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of their equipment while on the move, even when not under fire, causing logistical shortages. In other cases the majority of a unit would desert its position {{at the first sign}} of North Korean fire.|$|E
5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was <b>lost.</b> <b>Most</b> commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E
5|$|As Tikal and its {{hinterland}} reached peak population, {{the area}} suffered deforestation, erosion and nutrient loss {{followed by a}} rapid decline in population levels. Tikal and its immediate surroundings seem to have <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of their population between 830 and 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly. There is not much evidence from Tikal {{that the city was}} directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic, although an influx of refugees from the Petexbatún region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources.|$|E

5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with their mates are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus had {{relied on}} the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his own sister Verina's support, {{executing}} the Magister Officiorum Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the imperial rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after the flight of Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose him, and not Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer was a natural candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution.|$|E
5|$|Composite bows {{can be used}} without {{difficulty}} by infantry. The infantry archers of classical Greece and the Roman Empire used composite bows. The military of the Han Dynasty (220 BCE–206 CE) utilized composite crossbows, often in infantry square formations, in their many engagements against the Xiongnu. Until 1571 archers with composite bows were a main component of {{the forces of the}} Ottoman Empire, but in the Battle of Lepanto in that year they <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of these troops and never replaced them.|$|E

5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund. Although initially influential, these two groups soon <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of their voters to the Christian Social Party and the Social Democratic Party. Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} 36 {{hours of the}} Battle of Sharon between 04:30 on 19 September and 17:00 on 20 September, the EEF {{infantry}} continued fighting and marching forward, forcing the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies in the Judean Hills to retreat. The Eighth Ottoman Army virtually ceased to exist, excepting its Asia Corps, which together with the Seventh Ottoman Army {{was still in the}} Judean Hills between Nablus and Beisan, having <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of their transport. The XXI Corps continued their advanced north–east to drive the enemy into and through the foothills towards Messudieh Junction, and then down the road to Jenin where they were captured by Australian light horse during the night of 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Germany, which <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of its fleet {{under the}} terms of the Versailles treaty, was allowed to keep eight pre-dreadnoughts (of which only six could be in active service at any one time) which were counted as {{armoured}} coast-defence ships; two of these were still in use at the beginning of World War II. One of these, , shelled the Polish Westerplatte peninsula during the opening of the German invasion of Poland. Schleswig-Holstein served for most of the war as a training ship; she was sunk while under refit in December 1944, and broken up in situ in January 1945. The other, , was mined and then scuttled in March 1945.|$|E

5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he <b>lost</b> <b>most</b> of {{his fortune}} by {{the outset of the}} Depression as {{overproduction}} depleted his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas Oil Field. Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and was labeled the richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 the Allies {{lost some}} 8,000,000 tons of shipping, {{and though they}} {{replaced}} 7,000,000 tons, U-boats still managed to sink 1,160 out of the 1,664 Allied ships <b>lost.</b> <b>Most</b> of these sinkings {{took place in the}} mid-Atlantic gap, well within range of long-range Sunderlands and Liberators, only the Command lacked these aircraft in quantity. Following the entry of the United States of America into the war, German U-boats had plenty of targets. Coastal Command found it difficult to maintain strength. Its units now operated from the United States, West Africa, the Mediterranean, Iceland, Russia, Gibraltar, North Africa and the Middle East. Squadrons were also sent to the Pacific Theatre of Operations.|$|E
