30|$|This paper {{addresses}} the individual incentives of a better-informed <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> {{as an additional}} source of filtering failure. We incorporate asymmetric information, individual concerns, such as liability risks or reputational issues, and <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> remuneration in a stylized model in which the interactions between the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> and the creditors of a company are analysed. Our key contribution is that the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> compensation schemes typically used in insolvency law will not imply optimal creditor satisfaction {{and the absence of}} filtering failure simultaneously. The main driver of this result is the information asymmetry between the involved parties in combination with the individual concerns of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator.</b> The <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> will always report the true viability of the bankrupt firm and will always propose the correct resolution of a bankruptcy under an appropriate compensation scheme. However, providing these incentives is not optimal from the creditor’s perspective.|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to uncompensated costs, reputational effects may imply non-monetary benefits. Reputation arises primarily in a {{reorganization of the}} insolvent firm because the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> can demonstrate his ability to develop a sustainable business model and to maintain the firm as a going concern. Restructuring a firm under time constraints is a highly complex task. The <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> has to develop a profound, firm-specific understanding {{in a very short}} time. Hence, he needs high cognitive skills and high managerial know-how. Therefore, the reorganization of an insolvent firm {{can be seen as a}} positive signal that helps the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> be assigned to profitable future insolvency procedures. For example, the German government implemented an insolvency law reform in 2011 intended to encourage the reorganization of insolvent firms. 2 This amendment also affects the value of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> reputation: Prior to the reform, the insolvency court assigned an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> to the insolvent firm. The court had to choose the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> from a list and, thus, had considerable leeway. Overall, this process was rather obscure. Under the new law, creditors can propose an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> (Sec. 56 a InsO).|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} example of non-monetary benefits for an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> is reputational issues. Regulation {{has had a}} strong impact {{on the value of}} reputation, as the following example shows. In 2011, the German government implemented an insolvency law reform intended to encourage the reorganization of insolvent firms. 5 Prior to the reform, the insolvency court assigned an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> to the insolvent firm. The court had to choose the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> from a list and thus had considerable leeway. Ultimately, this process was rather obscure. Under the new law, the creditor can decide which <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> to choose. 6 The reform will clearly change the value of reputation {{in the event of a}} continuation decision. Insolvency judges might have preferences for a reorganization of the insolvent firm because of negative public reactions to a liquidation. Thus, they select <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> with a strong record of reorganization. Creditors concentrate on the satisfaction of their claim and prefer an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> with a history of high insolvency dividends. Therefore, the non-monetary benefit of a reorganization might have declined due to the reform.|$|R
30|$|A second {{strand of}} the {{literature}} empirically examines the reasons for ex post inefficiency. For example, Djankov et al. (2008) use a case study presented to lawyers in 88 countries to measure the concrete extent of inefficiency. They find that bankruptcy procedures in all countries are highly inefficient. Therefore, {{the main reasons for}} inefficiency are high administrative costs and long time delays. The study contains several countries with an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> {{as an integral part of}} the bankruptcy procedure, but they do not separately analyse how the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> should be remunerated. Only one empirical study considers the influence of an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> compensation scheme on the bankruptcy outcome. Using Hungarian data, Franks and Loranth (2013) find an impact of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> remuneration on the satisfaction of creditors and argue that one reason for high bankruptcy costs might be the structure of the remuneration scheme for <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators.</b> Our paper can be understood as a theoretical basis for the inefficiencies mentioned in Franks and Loranth (2013).|$|R
40|$|The work {{examines}} {{the role of}} the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in solving bankruptcy. The main objective of debt relief is to help over-indebted non-entrepreneurs to break out of their impasse resulting from too high a debt which they are unable to repay. This partly differs from other ways of addressing bankruptcy while emphasizing the needs of the borrower. The <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> is in charge of satisfying the needs of creditors. The work addresses whether a different principle of debt relief affects {{the role of the}} <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{abstract}} Position on <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> under <b>insolvency</b> law This thesis {{describes the}} insolvency proceedings {{in view of}} the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator.</b> It deals not only with the position of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in already running insolvency proceedings but also the prerequisites that must be met in order to become an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> at all. It is processed with regard to the importance of the amendments to the act of the year 2013. Due to the financial crisis and growing indebtedness of population it is a very actual subject, which applies to almost all of us. The thesis is divided into six main chapters. The first is devoted to the person of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> with detailed terms and conditions for the emergence of the processed function relating in particular to integrity and tests and to the types of terminativ of their activities. The second chapter discusses the performance of the function with an emphasis to the appointment, amendment, withdrawal, exclusion and exemption from the function. The various types of <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> are discussed in chapter three. The largest chapter is the fourth one. This chapter discusses the General rights and obligationsc at first, which are common for all the types of resolving insolvency and it is followed by the second [...] ...|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we examine}} the equilibria of the game between the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> and the creditor. The {{equilibrium}} concept used is perfect Bayesian or sequential equilibrium, as the game {{is similar to a}} signalling game. In our model, the creditor will use the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> proposal as a signal and he will update his beliefs about θ. Using the updated beliefs, he will accept or reject the proposal. Under perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> reporting strategy and the creditor’s reaction to the report are best responses given Bayesian updating.|$|R
30|$|Motivated by the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> {{compensation}} {{observed in}} Germany {{and several other}} European countries, our setting was restricted to a linear contract based on the liquidation and continuing value so far. In the following, we look how the results change when the continuation value is the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> private information and, thus, not contractible. Therefore, the compensation is restricted to fixed payments conditional on liquidation (b_ 0) and continuation (b_ 1). Table 1 in Appendix A shows that fixed payments as <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> compensation are also common in several European insolvency codes.|$|R
30|$|The scheme {{presented}} above {{shows that}} optimal creditor satisfaction and no filtering failure {{can be achieved}} simultaneously if the creditor and the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> individually negotiate the compensation contract without any legislative constraints. However, a first best compensation scheme will generally not be implementable by regulation because <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> differ with respect to unverifiable uncompensated costs and benefits. Therefore, a presumably more promising way to improve insolvency proceedings {{with respect to the}} conflict of interest between creditors and <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> would be to control uncompensated costs and benefits. We discuss this point in Sect. 6.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> {{incentives}} contain elements {{other than}} monetary remuneration. These are the uncompensated costs or non-monetary {{benefits of the}} <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator.</b> Uncompensated costs arise from litigation or liability risks (for example, Sec 60 InsO and Brandes/Schoppmeyer, in: Kirchhof et al. (2014), to Sec. 60, Note 89 – 91). Legal liabilities and litigation costs are prevalent in reorganizations because the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> has to manage the bankrupt firm {{and to develop a}} sustainable business model in a continuation. During this task, creditors may believe that the administrator’s decisions are negligent or wrong. Additionally, he vouches for all debt issued during the insolvency. Thus, creditors may sue the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> for damage payments as a party with deep pockets and not only in situations in which a reorganization plan fails.|$|R
30|$|The <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> is of {{particular}} importance in the German Insolvency Code; therefore, we use the German insolvency procedure {{as the basis for}} our analysis. Nonetheless, our study is not limited to Germany, as <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> are common in many insolvency codes. 1 German insolvency proceedings begin after creditors or the management of the bankrupt firm declare insolvency. The reasons for such a declaration are illiquidity, impeding illiquidity or over-indebtedness (Sec. 16 et seq. Insolvenzordnung (InsO)). In a next step, an insolvency judge examines whether the remaining assets are sufficient to cover the insolvency costs (Sec. 26 InsO and Haarmeyer, in: Kirchhof et al. (2014), to Sec. 26, Note 11) and delegates the responsibility and management of the bankrupt firm to an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> (Sec. 27 (1) InsO). Thereafter, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> must continue operations, secure remaining assets and develop options {{for the future of the}} firm. During this time, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> privately obtains information about the viability and conditions of the firm and therefore learns whether a liquidation or continuation of the bankrupt firm is beneficial.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the issue of <b>{{insolvency}}</b> <b>administrator</b> and his role in insolvency proceedings. Firstly, it deals with the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> as a person and tries to offer various points of view on their status not only within the area of insolvency law. It also concerns the general and qualification requirements for the performance of the office of <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator.</b> Within the explication {{of the role of the}} <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in the <b>insolvency</b> proceedings, the ways of the administrator's appointment to the office and possibilities of termination of their activity in the office are described, but the main focus is their rights, duties and activities during the insolvency proceedings, both general activities the administrator executes irrespective the way of bankruptcy resolution and activities following the particular ways of bankruptcy resolution. The thesis also contains explication of rewarding of the administrator and compensation of expenses, as well as a chapter dealing with various forms of liability of <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator.</b> The conclusion offers also a few considerations de lege ferenda...|$|R
30|$|The {{essential}} {{result in}} the preceding two sections states that insolvency procedures coordinated by a better-informed <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> will never simultaneously achieve optimal creditor satisfaction and no filtering failure if the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> compensation is designed as typical in many insolvency codes. The driving force behind this result is {{a conflict of interest}} between the creditor and the better-informed <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> that originates from uncompensated costs and non-monetary benefits. As discussed in the model description above, these typically represent liability risks and non-monetary benefits, such as building a valuable reputation from reorganizing and continuing the insolvent firm.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} the master thesis {{is the role of}} <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in {{bankruptcy}} and dischargeofdebts. The thesis defines the role of an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in an entire process of aninsolvency proceeding, from administrator nomination {{to the end of the}} procedure. The first part of thesis describes the historical development of the legislation of insol-vency proceeding and its characteristic. The second part of the thesis is focused on the figure of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> and administrator and his nomination together with the conditions, how to get the authorization to exercise this function. The practical part of the thesis is focused on the comparison of the legislation ofinsol-vency proceeding before the amendment of the Act about insolvency from 1. 1. 2014 and the recent way of proceeding. In this comparison I am focusing on analysis of terri-torial action of individual <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators.</b> All the information I have found, I use in practice thanks to the company Alva s. r. o., which provided me all the documen-tation needed to find out, if all the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> work in the same way or not, and if they work as they should. In the conclusion of my thesis there is a summary of all the facts I have found out...|$|R
30|$|The {{compensation}} {{does not}} counterbalance the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> continuation bias, as the resulting threshold values θ ^* = u/u+r and θ ^* = 1 +u/ 2 (1 +r+u) are below 1 / 2. Moreover, θ ^* decreases in {{the discrepancy between}} u and r, and thus, inefficient continuation appears more frequently when the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> continuation benefits increase.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> on ex post efficiency and creditor satisfaction in bankruptcy procedures. We incorporate asymmetric information and incongruent objectives between a creditor and an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> into a sequential game. Our key result states that the remuneration schemes typically used in insolvency proceedings will not allow a compensation of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> that simultaneously avoids any filtering failure and provides optimal creditor satisfaction. Optimal creditor satisfaction will always imply false liquidation or continuation decisions due to uncompensated costs or non-monetary benefits. The theory in this paper adds to the literature a novel explanation for the emergence of filtering failure in insolvency proceedings.|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} stage, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> reports his favoured option to the {{creditor}}. The creditor then decides whether to follow or {{to reject the}} proposal. This decision critically depends on the creditor’s conditional expected payoffs for both alternatives, which we derive below. If the creditor accepts the proposal, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> will carry out his decision and the game ends.|$|R
30|$|Ayotte and Yun (2007) analyse {{the effect}} of the quality of judges or <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> on the ex post outcome of a {{bankruptcy}} procedure. They find that judicial expertise is necessary when creditors are biased, using the following argumentation: When creditors are biased towards liquidation, a more debtor-friendly bankruptcy law in which management is allowed to retain some control will be efficient. Therefore, this freedom in managers’ decisions necessarily requires judicial expertise to separate viable and unviable bankrupt firms. In contrast, if the judges’ ability to identify viable firms is low, a more creditor-friendly bankruptcy law will be optimal. Bernhardt and Nosal (2004) also analyse how judicial discretion influences the outcome of a bankruptcy. They show that some judicial error can enhance the ex post efficiency of a bankruptcy procedure due to better ex ante actions on the part of management. In contrast, we investigate the influence of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> remuneration on the ex post outcome and do not distinguish different qualities or discretion of an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator.</b> Moreover, in our model, an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> has divergent incentives from those of a judge. The <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> is not employed by the government, is personally liable for his decisions and needs a good reputation to be assigned to future insolvency procedures.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2009, Bruno M. Kübler, Thielert's <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> {{announced}} that the company was, [...] "in the black and working to capacity". On 6 April 2009 the company {{announced that}} <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> had [...] "transferred the company's operative new business to {{a company that is}} unaffected by the insolvency proceedings". The new company Centurion Engines is responsible for sales of Centurion diesel engines and spare parts, worldwide.|$|R
30|$|An <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> {{replaces the}} manager of an {{insolvent}} firm to devise and organize a liquidation or reorganization plan in the creditors’ interest. In {{the course of the}} process, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> presents the most favourable option from his perspective, and the creditors choose to accept or reject this plan. Conflicts of interest arise because the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator,</b> as the better-informed party, considers in his proposal liability risks and reputational issues that are beyond the creditors’ scope. We model this conflict as a Bayesian game and find that, under those compensation schemes typically used in real-world regulations, optimal creditor satisfaction and efficient decisions concerning the economic future of the insolvent firm will never be achieved simultaneously.|$|R
30|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this paper is}} structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the role and the remuneration of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in the German Insolvency Code. Section 3 presents the model, and Sect. 4 analyses the different equilibria of the game. Section 5 analyses the efficiency of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> compensation. Some implications for the regulation of insolvency procedures are discussed in Sect. 6, and the final section concludes the paper.|$|R
30|$|The <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> {{compensation}} can entail {{fixed and}} variable components, {{depending on the}} value of assets under continuation or liquidation.|$|R
30|$|Under a fixed {{compensation}} scheme, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> liquidation {{incentives are}} stronger and filtering failure occurs more often. Moreover, the creditor would prefer fixed over linear compensation, {{which is quite}} intuitive: Linear compensation induces high compensation in cases where non-monetary benefits to the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> are large. Overall, the linear scheme is based on more information than fixed compensation, but from the creditor’s perspective, {{it does not make}} use of it in an optimal way.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> and its function, which it {{performs}} in the insolvency proceedings. In my work I deal with the legal regulation of the insolvency trustee, its function in the chosen way of solving bankruptcy, and also assess the impacts of the changes made {{in recent years as}} well as the changes that this area is still waiting for. The aim of this diploma thesis is to analyze the institute of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> in terms of its role, significance and influence in insolvency proceedings. The objective is also to assess the change in the system of determining <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrators</b> by focusing on assessing whether the new method is actually more transparent and whether this change affects the transparency of the whole procedure...|$|R
30|$|Motivated by the {{discussion}} of the German insolvency code, we assume that the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator’s</b> payoff is proportional to the value realized in the insolvency procedure. 3 The shares can depend on liquidation and continuation and are denoted as β _ 0 (liquidation) and β _ 1 (continuation). To keep things simple, we abstract from any direct expenses of the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> for preparing and performing the plan if the plan is accepted by the creditors and implemented.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{the results}} in this section are {{comparable}} to the second best outcome of typical principal–agent problems. From this perspective, the interaction between a creditor and an <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> {{can be seen as}} a setting in which the principal hires an agent with different objectives and private information. The creditor finds it too expensive to select a compensation for the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> that induces first best actions. The tension vanishes only if conflicts of interest due to uncompensated costs and non-monetary benefits disappear.|$|R
30|$|At most {{three months}} after the {{beginning}} of the insolvency procedure, the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> reports on the potential future options for the bankrupt firm at the creditors’ meeting (Sec. 156 InsO). On the basis of this report, creditors decide to liquidate and shut down the firm or to continue the firm. Furthermore, they can enable the <b>insolvency</b> <b>administrator</b> to devise an insolvency plan (Sec. 157 InsO). The main purpose of such an insolvency plan is the development of a detailed proposal on how the bankrupt firm can be reorganized.|$|R
