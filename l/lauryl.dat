5|$|Sodium <b>lauryl</b> {{sulphate}} (SLS), a detergent {{present in}} some brands of toothpaste and other oral healthcare products, may produce oral ulceration in some individuals. It {{has been shown}} that aphthous stomatitis is more common in people using toothpastes containing SLS, and that some reduction in ulceration occurs when a SLS-free toothpaste is used. Some have argued that since SLS is almost ubiquitously used in oral hygiene products, there is unlikely to be a true predisposition for aphthous stomatitis caused by SLS.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|After using toothpaste, {{orange juice}} and other juices have an {{unpleasant}} taste. Sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, apples are known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste. Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate is still an unresolved issue and {{it is thought that}} the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.|$|E
25|$|Contact {{dermatitis}} is of two types: allergic (resulting from {{a delayed}} {{reaction to a}}n allergen, such as poison ivy, nickel, or Balsam of Peru), and irritant (resulting from direct reaction to a detergent, such as sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate, for example).|$|E
25|$|Sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate, {{in science}} {{referred}} to as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), is used in cleaning procedures, and is commonly used as a component for lysing cells during DNA extraction, and for denaturing proteins in preparation for electrophoresis in the SDS-PAGE technique.|$|E
25|$|Many, {{although}} not all, toothpastes contain sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate (SLS) or related surfactants (detergents). SLS {{is found in}} many other personal care products, as well, such as shampoo, and is mainly a foaming agent, which enables uniform distribution of toothpaste, improving its cleansing power.|$|E
25|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate, {{appearing}} as its synonym sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate (SLS), is {{considered as a}} {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) ingredient, for food use according to the guidelines published in 21 CFR 172.822. It is used as an emulsifying agent and whipping aid. SLS is reported to temporarily diminish perception of sweetness.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{detergent}} surfactants, sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate removes oils {{from the}} skin, {{and can cause}} skin and eye irritation. It {{has been shown to}} irritate the skin of the face, with prolonged and constant exposure (more than an hour) in young adults. SDS may worsen skin problems in individuals with chronic skin hypersensitivity, with some people being affected more than others.|$|E
25|$|Companies such as Tom's of Maine, among others, {{manufacture}} {{natural and}} herbal toothpastes and market them to consumers {{who wish to}} avoid the artificial ingredients commonly found in regular toothpastes. Many herbal toothpastes do not contain fluoride or sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate. The ingredients found in natural toothpastes vary widely but often include baking soda, aloe, eucalyptus oil, myrrh, plant extract (strawberry extract), and essential oils.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} aphthous {{stomatitis}} is unknown, {{but there may}} be a genetic predisposition in some people. Other possible causes include hematinic deficiency (folate, vitamin B, iron), stopping smoking, stress, menstruation, trauma, food allergies or hypersensitivity to sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulphate (found in many brands of toothpaste). Aphthous stomatitis has no clinically detectable signs or symptoms outside the mouth, but the recurrent ulceration can cause much discomfort to sufferers. Treatment is aimed at reducing the pain and swelling and speeding healing, and may involve systemic or topical steroids, analgesics (pain killers), antiseptics, anti-inflammatories or barrier pastes to protect the raw area(s).|$|E
25|$|The {{generally}} accepted methods of making CNT films {{involves the use}} of non-ionic surfactants, such as Triton X-100 and sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate, which improves their dispersibility in aqueous solution. These suspensions can then be membrane filtered under positive or negative pressure to yield uniform films. The van der Waals force's interaction between the nanotube surface and the surfactant can often be mechanically strong and quite stable and therefore there are no assurances that all the surfactant is removed from the CNT film after formation. Washing with methanol, an effective solvent in the removal of Triton X, was found to cause cracking and deformation of the film. It has also been found that Triton X can lead to cell lysis and in turn tissue inflammatory responses even at low concentrations.|$|E

When the manufacturer Johnson & Johnson discontinued the product in 2014, it caused a backlash of anger from long term customers, and the toothpaste began to sell for many times the original price on the auction website eBay.|$|E
500|$|... "Robbing the Cradle" [...] is the {{penultimate}} {{level of}} [...] (2004), {{a video game}} developed by Ion Storm. In addition to the stealth gameplay typical of the game, the level features a strong survival horror theme. [...] "Robbing the Cradle" [...] takes place inside the Shalebridge Cradle, a conscious, malevolent and abandoned orphanage and mental institution. It is patrolled by creatures called [...] "Puppets", the reanimated bodies of former inmates. Protagonist Garrett enters the building in hopes of solving a mystery related to a supernatural murderer, the Gray Lady. Once inside, he encounters {{the ghost of a}} deceased orphan, <b>Lauryl,</b> who was killed by the Gray Lady. She is trapped within the Cradle because it [...] "remembers" [...] her.|$|E
500|$|The Shalebridge Cradle {{is divided}} into two sections: the [...] "Inner Cradle" [...] and [...] "Outer Cradle". The player begins in the Outer Cradle, which is {{designed}} to terrify players, but which secretly contains no dangers or enemies. The Inner Cradle is roamed by Puppets. The building's backstory is unveiled in a nonlinear fashion, via clues scattered within the level. The player must free <b>Lauryl</b> by locating and disposing of artifacts that allow the Cradle to remember her. However, after completing this objective, Garrett discovers that the Cradle has remembered him. To escape, the player travels back in time within the Cradle's memory, while fleeing from silhouettes of the Cradle's staff. The player ends the level by leaping from the Cradle's highest window, which convinces the building that Garrett is dead.|$|E
2500|$|SDS is {{synthesized}} {{by treating}} <b>lauryl</b> alcohol with sulfur trioxide gas, oleum, or chlorosulfuric acid to produce hydrogen <b>lauryl</b> sulfate. The resulting product is then neutralized through {{the addition of}} sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. <b>Lauryl</b> alcohol {{can be used in}} pure form or may be derived from either coconut or palm kernel oil by hydrolysis (which liberates their fatty acids), followed by hydrogenation. [...] When produced from these sources, commercial samples of these [...] "SDS" [...] products are actually not pure SDS, rather a mixture of various sodium alkyl sulfates with SDS being the main component. [...] For instance, SDS is a component, along with other chain-length amphiphiles, when produced from coconut oil, and is known as sodium coco sulfate (SCS). SDS is available commercially in powder, pellet, and other forms (each differing in rates of dissolution), as well as in aqueous solutions of varying concentrations.|$|E

2500|$|SDS is not {{carcinogenic}} when consumed or applied directly, even to amounts and concentrations {{that exceed}} amounts used in standard commercial products. The earlier {{review of the}} Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) program Expert Panel in 1983 reported that SDS (there, abbreviated SLS, for sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate) in concentrations up to 2%, in a year-long oral dietary studies in dogs, gave no evidence of tumorigenicity or carcinogenicity, and that no excess chromosomal aberrations or clastogenic effects were observed in rats fed up to 1.13% sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate in their diets for 90 days, over those on a control diet. The 2005 review by the same group indicated that further available data lacked any available suggestion that SDS or the related ammonium salt of the same amphiphile could be carcinogenic, stating that [...] "Despite assertions to the contrary on the Internet, the carcinogenicity of these ingredients is only a rumor;" [...] both studies conclude that SDS appears [...] "to be safe in formulations designed for discontinuous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing {{from the surface of}} the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with skin, concentrations should not exceed 1%." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate, synonymously sodium <b>lauryl</b> sulfate (or laurilsulfate; SDS or SLS, respectively), is a {{synthetic}} organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)11SO4Na. [...] It is an anionic surfactant {{used in many}} cleaning and hygiene products. The sodium salt is of an organosulfate class of organics. It consists of a 12-carbon tail attached to a sulfate group, that is, it is the sodium salt of dodecyl hydrogen sulfate, the ester of dodecyl alcohol and sulfuric acid. Its hydrocarbon tail combined with a polar [...] "headgroup" [...] give the compound amphiphilic properties and so make it useful as a detergent. [...] Also derived {{as a component of}} mixtures produced from inexpensive coconut and palm oils, SDS is a common component of many domestic cleaning, personal hygiene and cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food products, as well as of industrial and commercial cleaning and product formulations.|$|E
