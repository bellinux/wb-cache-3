2500|$|In effect, {{this section}} of the Act {{establishes}} national underwriting standards for residential loans. It is not the intent of this section to establish rules or regulations that would require a loan to be made that would not be regarded as acceptable or prudential by the appropriate regulator of the financial institution. However, the <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> shall make a reasonable and good faith effort based on verified and documented information that [...] "at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan, according to the terms, and all applicable taxes, insurance (including mortgage guarantee insurance), and other assessments". Also included in these calculations should be any payments for a second mortgage or other subordinate loans. Income verification is mandated for residential mortgages. Certain loan provisions, including prepayment penalties on some loans, and mandatory arbitration on all residential loans, are prohibited.|$|E

50|$|Warehouse {{lines of}} credit play an {{important}} role in making mortgage loan market more accessible to property buyers since many mortgage bankers would not be able to attract sufficient amount of deposits that are necessary to fund mortgage loans by themselves. Therefore, warehouse funding allows the <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> to provide mortgages at more competitive rates. Unlike in other types of lending, <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> earn more profit from origination fees rather than interest rate spread since the closed mortgage loan is sold quickly to an investor.|$|R

25|$|However, {{the credit}} crisis of 2007–2008 has exposed a {{potential}} {{flaw in the}} securitization process – <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> retain no residual risk for the loans they make, but collect substantial fees on loan issuance and securitization, which doesn't encourage improvement of underwriting standards.|$|R
5000|$|Often {{disclosed}} in the adjustable rate rider of a Deed of Trust, the margin {{is determined by}} the lender and is used to calculate the interest rate. Often the <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> can increase the margin when structuring the product for the borrower. An increase to the margin will also increase the borrower's interest rate, but will improve the yield spread premium which the <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> may receive as compensation from the lender.|$|E

5000|$|... (Also see primary servicer)In {{some cases}} the {{borrower}} may deal with a primary servicer that {{may also be the}} <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> or mortgage banker who sourced the loan. The primary servicer maintains the direct borrower contact, and the master servicer may sub-contract certain loan administration duties to the primary or sub-servicer.|$|E
5000|$|Economist Paul Krugman {{notes the}} {{subprime}} boom [...] "was overwhelmingly driven" [...] by <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> {{who were not}} subject to the Community Reinvestment Act.One study, by a legal firm which counsels financial services entities on Community Reinvestment Act compliance, found that CRA-covered institutions were less likely to make subprime loans (only 20-25% of all subprime loans), and when they did the interest rates were lower. The banks were half as likely to resell the loans to other parties.|$|R
2500|$|Because of the {{long-term}} nature of mortgages, the secondary market is an essential factor in maintaining lender liquidity. The infusion of capital from investors provides mortgage lenders such as banks, thrifts, mortgage bankers and other <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> with a market for their loans. [...] In addition to providing liquidity and increasing overall efficiency, the secondary market can smooth out geographic credit disparities. [...] However, in some respects, particularly where subprime and other riskier mortgages are involved, the secondary mortgage market may exacerbate certain risks and volatility.|$|R
50|$|Mortgage loan originatorsUnder {{legislation}} passed in 2006 regulates mortgage <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> (MLOs), who are individuals employed by {{or who have}} an independent contractor relationship with licensed mortgage bankers or registered mortgage brokers and who assist customers by soliciting, negotiating, explaining or finalizing {{the terms of a}} mortgage loan. MLOs are subject to a criminal background check and must complete certain educational requirements. MLOs are assessed fees that cover the cost of administering the registration program. MLOs are covered by Article XII-E of the banking Law.|$|R
50|$|The term primary {{servicer}} {{refers to}} companies that monitor and manage loans. The primary servicer of a loan can be the <b>loan</b> <b>originator,</b> the mortgage banker or a third party and maintains {{direct contact with the}} borrower. If the loan falls into default or needs special attention, a special servicer would undertake this role.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the warehouse credit providing business is limiting fraud on warehouse lending. Main risks of fraud include dishonest and collusive mortgage loan originators, title companies, real estate agents and customers themselves, false information in the loan application (especially appraisals), forged signatures on the loan documents, and false documents of title. The 'Wet funding' type of warehouse credit is riskier in terms of possible fraud because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the <b>loan</b> <b>originator.</b> Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from sale of loans to investors.|$|E
50|$|Warehouse lending can be {{differentiated}} between 'wet funding' and 'dry funding'. The {{difference is}} related to when the <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> gets his funds {{with respect to the}} time at which the real estate transaction takes place. During 'wet funding' the mortgage loan provider gets the funds {{at the same time as}} the loan is closed, i.e. before the loan documentation is sent to the warehouse credit provider. 'Dry funding' takes place when the warehouse credit provider gets the loan documentation for review before sending the funds.|$|E
50|$|On June 4th, 2015, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a {{complaint}} in federal district court against RPM Mortgage and its CEO, Erwin Robert Hirt, for illegally paying bonuses and higher commissions to <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> to incentivize them to steer consumers into costlier mortgages, illegally profiting {{tens of millions of}} dollars from 2011 to 2013. They were fined $20 million including $18 million as redress to consumers with an additional $2 million as a civil penalty, half of which is to be paid by CEO Robert Hirt.|$|R
25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} asset-backed securities for <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> (with associated disadvantages for investors) {{is that they}} bring together a pool of financial assets that otherwise could not easily be traded in their existing form. By pooling together a large portfolio of these illiquid assets they can be converted into instruments that may be offered and sold freely in the capital markets. The tranching of these securities into instruments with theoretically different risk/return profiles facilitates marketing of the bonds to investors with different risk appetites and investing time horizons.|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{organizational}} structure of CMBS <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> may reflect {{differences in the}} incentives they face for underwriting risky loans. We treat an originator's type [...] that is, commercial bank, investment bank, insurance company, finance company, conduit lender, or foreign-owned entity [...] {{as a proxy for}} incentives related to warehousing risk, balance sheet lending, and regulatory constraints. After controlling for observable credit characteristics of over 30, 000 loans securitized into CMBS after 1999, we find considerable differences in <b>loan</b> performance across <b>originator</b> types. The results suggest that moral hazard [...] captured by lack of warehousing risk-negatively affected the quality of loans underwritten by conduit lenders. On the other hand, despite opportunities for adverse selection, balance sheet lenders [...] commercial banks, insurance companies and finance companies [...] actually underwrote higher quality loans. Mortgage-backed securities; Moral hazard...|$|R
50|$|The cycle {{starts with}} the {{mortgage}} banker taking a loan application from the property buyer. Then the <b>loan</b> <b>originator</b> secures an investor (often a large institutional bank) to whom the loan will be sold, whether directly or through a securitization. This decision is generally based on an institutional investor's published rates for various types of mortgage loans, while {{the selection of a}} warehouse lender for a particular loan may vary based on the types of loan products allowed by the warehouse provider or investors in the loan approved by the warehouse lender to be on the line of credit.|$|E
50|$|The Capital Markets segment {{primarily}} {{operates as}} a registered securities broker dealer, a residential mortgage loan manager and a commercial mortgage <b>loan</b> <b>originator.</b> CFC also operates broker dealers in Japan and the United Kingdom, an introducing broker dealer of futures contracts, an asset manager and a broker of mortgage servicing rights. With the exception of its commercial mortgage activities, the company transacts only with institutional customers, such as banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies, asset managers, mutual funds, pension plans, other broker dealers and governmental agencies. Customers of its commercial real estate finance business are the owners or sponsors of commercial properties, who can be individuals or institutions.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, when credits {{are applied}} to a {{purchase}} price the agreement becomes a financing contract and these contracts {{have been identified as}} predatory lending arrangements under the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this federal law any financing arrangement requires the purchaser of an owner occupied dwelling (one to four living units) is to qualify for any financing contract with a registered Mortgage <b>Loan</b> <b>Originator.</b> There are exemptions under this federal law for homeowners financing their primary residence, those in the business of real estate such as landlords are considered dealers. In all states, rent to own arrangements are no longer compliant with federal financing requirements.|$|E
40|$|<b>Loan</b> <b>originators</b> often {{securitize}} some {{loans in}} secondary loan markets {{and hold on}} to others. New issuances in such secondary markets collapse abruptly on occasion, typically when collateral values used to secure the underlying loans fall and these collapses are viewed by policymakers as inefficient. We develop a dynamic adverse selection model in which small reductions in collateral values can generate abrupt inefficient collapses in new issuances in the secondary loan market by affecting reputational incentives. We find {{that a variety of}} policies intended to remedy market inefficiencies do not help resolve the adverse selection problem...|$|R
5000|$|Taibbi dissects {{the housing}} bubble crisis {{as a complex}} scam {{involving}} players at many levels. Entry level assessments, income levels, and credit scores were falsified or neglected, allowing unqualified customers to acquire mortgages they could not carry. Taibbi maintains that ARMs and other [...] "financial inventions" [...] enlarged the pool of loans that could never be paid back, yet issuing agents and agencies were made rich by commissions. The real money, however, came in for the big banks that securitized these loans, that is to say, repackaged them as investment vehicles (and in the process took the <b>loan</b> <b>originators</b> off the hook).|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} {{events that led}} to the {{financial}} crisis of the late 2000s, and many differing views on which parties were primarily responsible. The main groups that have been identified for playing {{a major role in the}} crisis include: investment bankers, credit rating agencies, financial statement preparers, the Federal Reserve, investors, <b>loan</b> <b>originators,</b> auditors, and borrowers among others. For a detailed background on the causes of the crisis and the parties that contributed please reference:Causes of the 2007-2012 global financial crisis and “History of Fair Value Issues” The purpose of this article is to expand on the role that accountants specifically played within the late 2000s financial crisis.|$|R
