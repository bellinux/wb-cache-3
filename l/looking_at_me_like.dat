In between takes I had about 5 fans on me, one up {{the front of my}} dress, one up the back of my dress. I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
