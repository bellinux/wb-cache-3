40|$|Since the {{terrorist}} attacks in the USA in September 2001, several regulations have beenintroduced with a special emphasis on the security of containerised port operations. Global security measures specifically targeting container-port operations include theInternational Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code, the Container SecurityInitiative (CSI), and the 24 -hour Advance Vessel Manifest Rule (the 24 -hour rule). Nevertheless, no attempt has been made to-date to investigate the ex-post impacts ofsecurity on the operational efficiency of container ports and terminals. This PhDresearch seeks to adopt an approach that incorporates within an analytical frameworkthe association of security with operational efficiency, tools for modelling proceduralsecurity, and techniques for benchmarking container-port efficiency. A panel data set of 39 ports and 60 container terminals from 2000 until 2006 is used resulting into 420 container-terminal decision-making units (DMUs). In order to account equally for container terminal operational configurations and themulti-input/ multi-output nature of container port production, we apply both processmodelling and analytical benchmarking techniques. These are the Integrated ComputerAided Manufacturing Definition (IDEF 0) for operational and security modelling, andData Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for efficiency measurement and benchmarking. Based {{on the results of}} IDEF 0 modelling, we disaggregate container-port operations byterminal sites (quay, yard and gate) and spatial scope of security and apply alternativeDEA models to analyse (i) the operational impact of individual and aggregate securityregulations and (ii) the influence of operating and exogenous factors on port efficiency. We then estimate a Malmquist productivity index (MPI) to measure and decomposeproductivity changes following the introduction of new security measures. The results of the research confirm that both handling configurations and operatingprocedures have a direct effect on container terminal's productive efficiency. Theanalysis of the impact of security on operational efficiency shows that the latter variesgreatly by security regulation and terminal group but there is evidence of generalisedproductivity gains from the technological progress prompted by investments in the newsecurity technology. More importantly, the implementation of the new port securitymeasures revealed several inherent logistical inefficiencies especially in the wayterminal policies and work procedures are being designed, operated, and managed.
