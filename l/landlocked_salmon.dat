Between January and around 15 March 2012 at 421 occasions food was found containing more than 100 becquerels per kilogram cesium. All was found within 8 prefectures: Chiba, Fukushima Prefecture (285 finds), Gunma, Ibaraki (36 finds), Iwate, Miyagi, Tochigi (29 finds) and Yamagata.

Since 1875, the rainbow trout has been widely introduced into suitable lacustrine and riverine environments throughout the United States and around the world. Many of these introductions have established wild, self-sustaining populations.|$|E

40|$|The {{technique}} of high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection {{was used to}} identify, detect and measure monoamines within {{the central nervous system}} of the juvenile rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, the male <b>landlocked</b> Atlantic <b>salmon,</b> Salmo Salar and male and female winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus. The catecholamines norepinephrine, dopamine and the indoleamine serotonin were found in the brains of these three teleost species. All three monomines were heavily concentrated in the hypothalamus, with norepinephrine being the most concentrated monomine in this area followed by serotonin and dopamine. Norepinephrine concentrations ranged from a low 0. 33 ± 0. 07 (± S. E. M.) ng/mg in the rhombencephalon of the juvenile rainbow trout to 2. 64 ± 0. 24 ng/mg in the hypothalamus of the female winter flounder. Dopamine concentrations ranged from 0. 08 ± 0. 01 ng/mg in the optic tectum of the juvenile rainbow trout to 2. 41 ± 0. 14 ng/mg in the hypothalamus of the mature male Atlantic salmon. Serotonin concentrations ranged between 0. 24 ± 0. 01 ng/mg in extrahypothalamic tissues of the male <b>landlocked</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> to 1. 13 ± 0. 11 ng/mg in the hypothalamus of this same species. [...] A breakdown of the data obtained for the mature male <b>landlocked</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> and mature male and female winter flounder showed a correspondence of these monoamine concentrations with certain stages of the annual gonadal recrudescence cycle. Norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations declined during spermiation in the male <b>landlocked</b> Atlantic <b>salmon.</b> Norepinephrine concentrations increased in extrahypothalamic tissues of the male winter flounder during advanced spermatogenesis. A separate study was conducted on mature male winter flounder to determine if monoamine concentrations were altered by castration, but there were no significant changes in norepinephrine, dopamine or serotonin concentrations in the central nervous system of castrated males compared with sham-castrated and control males.

25|$|Before the {{creation}} of Lake Shannon, the area was used primarily for fur trapping, logging, and concrete making. The construction of Lower Baker Dam blocked salmon migration in the Baker River. An artificial fish passage system was begun in the 1950s and completed in 1959 after the construction of Upper Baker Dam, located upstream of Lake Shannon. The lake has abundant <b>landlocked</b> kokanee <b>salmon,</b> the by-product of salmon spawning in lake tributaries. Fishing, boating and water skiing are popular recreational activities on the lake.|$|R
25|$|The Salmon River derives {{its name}} from the <b>landlocked</b> Atlantic <b>salmon</b> which were of great {{importance}} to Native Americans and early settlers of the region. However, these native salmon were extirpated from the river by 1872 and from Lake Ontario by 1898. Since the late 1960s, the Salmon River has been stocked primarily with Chinook salmon, coho salmon, steelhead, and brown trout, in addition to a smaller proportion of Atlantic salmon. These fish return to the river for annual spawning runs after spending a majority of the year in Lake Ontario.|$|R
