40|$|The {{lower limit}} on the frit loading {{parameter}} when measurement uncertainty is introduced has impacted DWPF performance during immobilization of Tank 42 Sludge; therefore, any defensible relaxation or omission of this constraint should correspondingly increase DWPF waste loading and efficiency. Waste loading should be increased because the addition of frit is the current remedy for exceeding the <b>lower</b> frit <b>loading</b> constraint. For example, frit was added to DWPF SME Batches 94, 97 and 98 to remedy these batches for low frit loading. Attempts were also made to add frit {{in addition to the}} optimum computed to assure the <b>lower</b> frit <b>loading</b> constraint would be satisfied; however, approximately half of the SME Batches produced after Batch 98 have violated the <b>lower</b> frit <b>loading</b> constraint. If the DWPF batches {{did not have to be}} remediated and additional frit added because of the <b>lower</b> frit <b>loading</b> <b>limit,</b> then both, the performance of the DWPF process and the waste loading in the glass produced would be increased. Before determining whether or not the <b>lower</b> frit <b>loading</b> <b>limit</b> can be relaxed or omitted, the origin of this and the other constraints related to durability prediction must be examined. The <b>lower</b> <b>limit</b> <b>loading</b> constraint results from the need to make highly durable glass in DWPF. It is required that DWPF demonstrate that the glass produced would have durability that is at least two standard deviations greater than that of the Environmental Assessment (EA) glass. Glass durability cannot be measured in situ, it must be predicted from composition which can be measured. Fortunately, the leaching characteristics of homogeneous waste glasses is strongly related to the total molar free energy of the constituent species. Thus the waste acceptance specification has been translated into a requirement that the total molar free energy associated with the glass composition that would be produced from a DWPF melter feed batch be less than that of the EA glass accounting for both prediction uncertainty (including bias) and measurement uncertainty to a confidence level of 95 %. However, it was discovered during Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) testing that under certain conditions, DWPF glasses were prone to phase separation resulting in glasses that had noticeably unpredictable and, at times, unacceptable leaching behavior.

In the present article, {{on the basis of the}} nature of the iterative procedure for upper bound limit analysis, the statically admissible stress fields, which satisfies the equilibrium equation and boundary conditions, are constructed using some intermediate variables obtained by upper bound limit analysis procedure. Moreover, a mathematical programming formulation is set up for the static limit analysis of 3 -D structures under multi-loading systems and a direct iterative algorithm used to determine the <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> multiplier is proposed, which depends on the static theorem of plasticity.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of {{load carrying capacity}} under applied loads is an important goal in designing mechanical components and structures. Limit analysis is carried out to determine the load at which uncontained plastic flow occurs in the component under consideration. <b>Lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>loads</b> are vital from the structural integrity standpoint and are germane to fitness-for-service assessments. [...] The existing <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> determination methods using elastic modulus adjustment procedures (EMAP) such as the classical and mα-multiplier methods have a dependence on the maximum equivalent stress. These methods are therefore sensitive to localized plastic action, which occurs in components with thin or slender construction, or those containing notches and cracks. The lower bounds obtained using the present methods have an oscillatory behavior during successive elastic iterations. [...] The mβ-multiplier method developed in this thesis is obtained by considering a distribution of stress rather than a single maximum equivalent stress. As a result, good <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> estimates can be obtained especially for shape-sensitive structures and components with cracks and notches. [...] The applicability of the m fJ -multiplier method is extended such that the method can determine <b>limit</b> <b>loads</b> of pressure components exhibiting anisotropy. As a result, collapse load analysis can be performed for perforated heat exchanger tubesheet that is currently modeled as an equivalent solid plate with anisotropic properties. [...] Simplified procedures for fitness-for-service assessment, suitable for use by plant engineers, is also developed. A variational formulation in plasticity is used to develop these procedures. The concept of "integral mean of yield" is utilized to problems involving locally thinned areas and local hot spots {{in the context of}} industrial pressure vessels and piping.

40|$|From {{a design}} point of view, a robust {{simplified}} <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> solution {{is the one}} which is consistently lower bound, yet provides a better estimate compared to the classical <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load.</b> The robustness is determined by its proximity to the exact <b>limit</b> <b>load.</b> There are several <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> multipliers such as multiplier m"α (Seshadri and Indermohan, 2004), multiplier m"α (Simha and Adibi-Asl, 2012), two bar multiplier (Seshadri and Adibi-Asl, 2007), and multiplier (Seshadri and Hossain, 2009) which provides reasonable estimates of <b>limit</b> <b>loads.</b> However their nature of bounds has not been examined. In this thesis <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> bounds for these multipliers have been investigated. Finally, the nature of bounds of all the <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> multipliers in the literature are summarized, where bounds are either already established or will be addressed in this thesis. The lower bound estimate of the multiplier m"μ relies on the exact distribution of plastic flow parameter. It is found that for an approximate distribution of flow parameter, m"μ is either upper bound or its bounds are not obvious. Since the exact distribution of plastic flow parameter is only available from the limit state stress distribution, the multiplier m"μ could not be established as a lower bound based on the linear elastic analysis. Simha and Adibi-Asl (2012) proposed an inequality relation (m"< m"μ) for lower bound m". It is concluded that the inequality (m"< m"μ) could not guarantee a lower bound m", when m"μ is estimated from an approximate distribution of plastic flow parameter. In order to investigate <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> bounds of the two bar solution, reference two bar multiplier (which gives bounding <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> over the other two bar configurations) is first identified by performing general two bar analysis. Since a mechanical component or structure can be represented by a suitable multi bar model, a general multi bar analysis is then performed. It is found that the reference two bar multiplier bounds the <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> solution of multi bar models. A correction factor has also been introduced to the reference two bar solution in order to eliminate any possibility of overestimation of <b>limit</b> <b>loads</b> using reference two bar multiplier. Hence the proposed estimate of reference two bar solution provides <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load.</b> However <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> estimation using this multiplier at times could be conservative (although offers much better accuracy than classical lower bound) compared to the exact <b>limit</b> <b>load.</b> The mαᵀmultiplier which offers better accuracy than the two bar multiplier is also established as a lower bound by investigating exact solution trajectory, utilizing the constraint map construction. Also, {{it is found that}} the mαᵀ multiplier bounds the <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> solution of multi bar models, which confirms the lower bound nature of the mαᵀ multiplier. A guideline is proposed to obtain sufficiently accurate <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> based on a single linear elastic analysis. In terms of elastic modulus adjustment procedure (EMAP), classical <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> multiplier is susceptible to oscillations with iterations, when sharp modulus adjustments are performed thereby raising convergence issues. On the other hand, more gentle element modulus adjustments turn out to be computationally expensive. In this thesis, the mα-tangent multiplier is used in conjunction with the elastic modulus adjustment procedure for <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> determination. The <b>lower</b> boundedness of the mα-tangent multiplier for any iteration is ensured by incorporating reference volume and peak stress corrections. By the virtue of the faster convergence feature, the mαᵀ-multiplier permits gentler modulus adjustments, {{and at the same time}} estimates sufficiently accurate <b>lower</b> bound <b>limit</b> <b>load</b> within a relatively small number of elastic iterations. This minimizes the convergence difficulties usually encountered in EMAP. Simplified techniques on the basis of linear elastic finite element analysis (FEA) assumes elasticperfectly- plastic material model. However, due to strain hardening, a component or a structure can store supplementary strain energy and carry additional load. In this thesis, an iterative elastic modulus adjustment scheme is developed for strain hardening material model, utilizing the “strain energy density” theory. The proposed algorithm is then programmed into repeated linear elastic FEA and implemented to a number of practical components. Moreover, the procedure for elastic modulus adjustment to achieve limit state and elastic-plastic state are explained in parallel, to demonstrate their similarity and diversity...|$|R

40|$|The {{assessment}} of compatibility in frontal impacts has to address the importance of different vehicle structures. A critical component in the assessment is to identify, quantitatively, what constitutes good performing structures. In particular, the concepts of structural alignment and structural interaction need to be investigated. Structural alignment is incorporated in the FIMCAR candidate compatibility assessments to achieve geometric alignment of identifiable crashworthiness structures. Structural interaction is also a global {{assessment of}} how structures interact with a collision partner during the crash.

FIMCAR has developed a vehicle crash test program that investigates the performance of vehicle structures using three different test series.

40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine offers diesel-like {{efficiency}} {{with very}} low soot and NOx emissions. In a HCCI engine, a premixed charge of air, fuel and burned gas is compressed to achieve autoigntion. Combustion occurs throughout the chamber volume resulting in short overall burn duration. This short burn duration can cause excessively high pressure rise rates {{which lead to}} unacceptable engine noise and potentially reduced engine life. To combat this high pressure rise rate the engine must be operating with significant diluent, either excess air or burned exhaust gas. However this high level of dilution limits the specific output of the HCCI engine to levels far below spark ignition or diesel engines. The high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is a major challenge for the HCCI engine. This study utilized a single cylinder research to examine the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> and possible methods to extend it. The details of the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> were first explored {{across a range of}} intake temperatures, boost pressures, trapped residual fractions, equivalence ratios and external EGR ratios for a gasoline fueled HCCI engine. A significant finding was that the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> always occurs at the misfire limit and that for a given pressure rise rate constraint, the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> occurs at lowest possible intake pressure and trapped residual fraction needed to prevent misfire. A possible means to allow operation at higher boost pressures is to utilize cooled external EGR or to reduce the intake temperature. For a given burn fraction, increasing the EGR rate or reducing the intake temperature provided reduced MPRR. (cont.) However with these changes, the misfire limit also shifted such that the value of the maximum load does not materially change. Thus boosting coupled with EGR or intake temperature reduction {{can not be used to}} significantly extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> A correlation was developed for the burn duration. Multi-zone combustion simulations were used to confirm the form of this correlation.
