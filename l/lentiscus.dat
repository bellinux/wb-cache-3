2500|$|If one ignores, for the moment, the {{influence}} of the mountains, the typical Mediterranean peninsular forest is made up of evergreen trees: oak forests, cork oaks, wild olives, juniper, and so on. These are accompanied or replaced in the warmer regions and eroded by forests of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) and in areas of sandy ground and fixed sand dunes by juniper [...] and stone pine forests. Exceptions to the rule are the more arid region in the southeast, the lower regions of the provinces of Murcia and Almeria, where the only vegetation is the European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), and thorny thickets of blackthorn and at higher altitudes, Kermes oak groves and mastic (Pistacia <b>lentiscus).</b> The same can be said of the salty or endorheic zones, with great differences in temperature, such as the depression of the Ebro, Hoya de Baza and the chalky marls further inland.|$|E
60|$|The {{chemical}} qualities, odours, and {{tissues of}} plants are often modified by a change {{which seems to}} us slight. The Hemlock is said not to yield conicine in Scotland. The root of the Aconitum napellus becomes innocuous in frigid climates. The medicinal properties of the Digitalis are easily affected by culture. As the Pistacia <b>lentiscus</b> grows abundantly in the South of France, the climate must suit it, but it yields no mastic. The Laurus sassafras in Europe loses the odour proper to it in North America. (23/11. Engel 'Sur les Prop. Medicales des Plantes' 1860 pages 10, 25. On changes in the odours of plants see Dalibert's Experiments quoted by Beckman 'Inventions' volume 2 page 344; and Nees in Ferussac 'Bull. des Sc. Nat.' 1824 tome 1 page 60.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the diversity of}} mitochondrial DNA (CO 1) sequences in the New Zealand native aphids with a particular focus on the genus Schizaphis (syn. Euschizaphis). Previously, the genus was thought to consist of two species, each host-specific to endemic New Zealand plants (Aciphylla and Dracophyllum). These unnamed native taxa are reasonably common but have either a narrow distribution (Aciphylla-host) or low local abundances (Dracophyllum-host). There is also some uncertainty over the number of Schizaphis species present on the various host plants. Specimens from both host plants were collected from ten sites in the North (n= 3) and South (n= 8) Islands. A total of 29 new COI sequences were obtained. A further 189 sequences {{were obtained from the}} Barcode of Life Datasystems (n= 187) and GenBank (n= 2). Thirteen of the 15 known native aphids were analysed by Maximum Likelihood and their taxonomic classification confirmed, the majority belonging to the Aphidinae, but also representatives in other sub-families. Maximum Likelihood analyses and pairwise genetic distances confirmed taxonomic groupings of the Aphididae sub-family Aphidinae and within the Aphidinae the monophyly of the sub-tribe Rhopalosiphina which contains two genera: Rhopalosiphum spp. and Schizaphis spp. Two distinct, well supported clades within Schizaphis were clearly delineated according to the host plant. However, we also found two distinct clusters within the Aciphylla-host South Island individuals and four within the Dracophyllum-host individuals (North & South Islands), suggesting six potentially cryptic species. Based on these data, we suggest that the CO 1 gene region is effective for identifying aphids and could assist in the on-going discovery and protection of these taxa in New Zealand. New information regarding the diversity of New Zealand native Schizaphis aphids is using COI gene sequences to reveal additional diversity. International databases such as the Barcode of Life Datasystems and GenBank will be particularly helpful in examining global relationships within the New Zealand native aphid taxon. Root Aphids (Aploneura <b>lentisci)</b> are an introduced taxon, which live exclusively on the roots of Poaceae and can cause detrimental effects to New Zealand pastures, reducing the forage available for farmed livestock. In order to assess abundances of A. <b>lentisci</b> in soil samples, specific primers were first developed to target and amplify the mitochondrial gene region cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO 1) gene region. Three DNA extraction protocols, the PowerSoil® DNA Isolation Kit, Extract-N-Amp™Tissue PCR and a phenol chloroform DNA extraction protocol were then assessed and real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure the amount of amplicon produced, which was compared to a standard curve of known aphid numbers. The developed primers successfully amplified a 317 nucleotide fragment of the COI gene region and had limited cross reactivity with other aphid taxa tested. Of the three extraction methods, the Extract-N-Amp Tissue PCR Kit was the most effective. Adult root aphids were selected as representatives of infestations. DNA concentrations extracted using the Extract-N-Amp Kit were linear over the entire range of aphid numbers (R²= 0. 98). Further dilutions were carried out: 10 -fold, 100 -fold and 1000 -fold to test linearity and when combined produced a standard curve with a regression of 0. 93 over a cycle threshold range of 18 - 33 cycles. DNA extractions from mixtures of 60 aphids in soil produced amplifiable aphid DNA. We conclude that this method will successfully measure root aphid abundances from soil samples using mitochondrial CO 1 gene sequences and qPCR...|$|R
40|$|Plant micro-reserves (PMRs) {{represent}} a new tool for conservation, which {{were developed in}} the last decade in Spain. They are small land plots that shelter populations of endemic, rare and threatened taxa. The originality of PMRs is that they not only provide protection for plants of special interest but are also a tool for scientific studies and management actions, such as ecological restoration, reinforcement or creation of new populations. The first PMRs were declared in 1998 in Valencia (SE Spain), and today there are 259 in this region alone, as well as many others in different parts of Spain and other countries. The aim {{of the present study was}} to thoroughly analyse the floristic composition and to identify the plant communities present in an area that we considered of special interest and worth to be declared as a new PMR in Valencia. The site was selected for its special floristic interest, and for its status of preservation of the natural habitat, which is rather high in this area, near the coast, where most natural spaces have been severely modified by the anthropic effect. The floristic inventory consists of 199 vascular plants. Four taxa are endemics restricted to the Valencian territory (Biscutella gr. calduchii, Sideritis juryi, Teucrium edetanum and Urginea undulata subsp. caeculi), two are narrow nearly exclusively endemics (Helianthemum origanifolium subsp. glabratum and Thymus vulgaris subsp. aestivus) and seven are eastern Iberian endemics of wider distribution. The potential natural vegetation, corresponding to scrublands of the community Querco cocciferae-Pistacietum <b>lentisci,</b> is underrepresented due to the extension of perennial (ass. Heteropogono contortii-Stipetum tenacissimae and Teucrio pseudochamaepitys-Brachypodietum retusi) and therophytic pastures (Saxifrago tridactylitae-Hornungietum petraeae).

40|$|An area {{of rough}} {{pastureland}} has been sampled regularly for Lasius flavus and other soil animals for three years. The density of ants found in these nests agrees well with estimates of other workers using mature nests from undisturbed sites. The abundance of ants {{in the surface}} 10 cm of the nest was correlated with twenty biotic and abiotic measurements to see which factors most heavily influenced ant captures. It {{was found that the}} model: Ant = 17494 x larval brood dry biomass (g) activity + 10654 x adult reproductives dry biomass (g) + 0. 1 x base area of nest mound (sq. cm) + c could predict the trends in ant activity with high accuracy (0. 0001 < p < 0. 002). The relationship of subterranean aphids to ants was also investigated. Generally there were positive associations between Lasius flavus and regularly tended root aphids; but species which show obligatory host alternation e. g. Anoecia corni and aphids which are not ant tended e. g. Aploneura <b>lentisci</b> show marked negative associations with Lasius flavus. During periods of high larval biomass, the number of adult aphids was practically unchanged, although many first instar aphids vanished from the nest, presumably due to predation. Only when the alate ants emerged were aphid numbers drastically reduced. This was attributed to the feeding up of the new queens, which subsequently fast until the development of their first brood. Despite the fluctuation of aphid numbers, no deliberate form of regulation by ants could be shown. The distribution of aphids within the nest was studied and clump sizes for aphid species were calculated. These varied with sub-family, and showed that for most of the year different species intermingled within the nest, not forming separate mosaics. At high aphid density however, it was found that different aphid species became most abundant in certain parts of the nest; those most heavily sclerotized/waxy still possessing rudimentary siphuncles, furthest from the nest centre, and those without siphuncles and some with legs adapted for ant 'communication' near the centre of the nest. This is related to the degree of ant attendance towards each aphid. <p...|$|R

40|$|The {{description}} of vegetation typologies that characterise the plant landscape in Nurra - according to phytosociological and sinphytosociological interpretations - is presented. Plant associations found out are here presented from areas {{closer to the}} sea towards the inner ones, grouped according to environmental and structural characteristics. The following new associations are described. Crithmo maritimi-Limonietum nymphaei, Evaco pygmaeae-Bellietum bellidioidis, Senecioni leucanthemifolii-Nanantheetum perpusillae, Spergulario salinae-Hordeetum marini, Limonietum laeti-glomerati, Brassico insularis-Seselictum praecocis, Anthyllido vulnerariae-Kundmannietum siculae, Loto cytisoidis-Dactyletum hispanicae, Dactylo hispanicae-Camphorosmetum monspeliacae, Scillo obtusifoliae-Bellidetum sylvestris, Scillo autumnalis-Bellidetum sylvestris, Hypecoo procumbentis-Silenetum nummicae, Bupleuro fontanesii-Scorpiuretum muricati, Rosmarino officinalis-Thymelaeetum tartonrairae, Dorycnio pentaphylli-Cistetum eriocephali, Pyro amygdaliformis-Quercetum ilicis, Euphorbio characiae-Juniperetum turbinatae, Pistacio lentisci-Calicotometum villosae, Crataego monogynae-Pistacietum <b>lentisci.</b> Furthermore, phytosociological and syntaxonomical study of the subnitrophilous hemicryptophyte communities allowed their attribution to the Artemisietea vulgaris c 1 ass. Within this class the new Brachypodio ramosi-Dactyletalia hispanicae order is described, together with two new alliances, Reichardio maritimae-Dactylion hispanicae and Leontodo tuberosi-Bellidion sylvestris. The order includes the perennial, hemicryptophyte and geophyte, subnitrophilous vegetation of the secondary formations, finding their optimum in the sub-humid and humid mesomediterranean macroclimate, and can also penetrate into the thermomediterranean one for edaphic compensation. Moreover, this study suggests {{to include in the}} new Brachypodio ramosi-Dactyletalia hispanicae order, the Bromo-Oryzopsion and the Thero-Brachypodion ramosi alliances. The study of associations and their dynamic relationships also allowed to reconstruct the vegetation series which integration produces the main plant landscape units present in Nurra. The coastal Tyrrhenian, basophilous, calcicole, thermomediterranean and edaphon-xerophilous series of Juniperus turbinata (Chamaeropo humilis-Junipereto turbinatae sigmetum) was reconstructed on Mesozoic limestone. Different plant associations of comophytic and chasmophytic communities integrating the coastallimestone landscape are connected to this pattern by chain relationships. Between the landscape units of the Mesozoic limestone sector and the Paleozoic metamorphic one, the coastal Tyrrhenian, neutroacidophilous, of sandstone, thermomediterranean and edaphon-xerophilous series of Juniperus turbinata with Arbutus unedo (Chamaeropo humilis-Junipereto turbinatae arbutetosum unedonis sigmetum), representing an edaphic variant of the previous one, linked to the violet quartzose sandstone on which a more clayey soil is generated, was reconstructed. The geosigmetum of Mesozoic limestone is completed by the Tyrrhenian, neutroacidophilous, calcicole, thermomediterranean c 1 imatophilous series of Quercus ilex (Pistacio-Querceto i 1 icis sigmetum). It is present on the inner hills and, of its series-head, only a few examples of Quercus ilex grove remain, which assume a particular characterisation for the presence of Chamaerops humilis. The Sardinian coastal, neutroacidophilous, of Paleozoic schist, thermomediterranean, climatophilous and edaphon-xerophilous series of Juniperetus turbinata (Euphorbio characiae-Junipereto turbinatae sigmetum) was reconstructed in the metamorphic area. The prevalently chain contact with the subhalophile garigue and the microgeosigmeta of the therophytic and chamaephytic halophile communities occurs in the coastal girdle close to the c 1 iff. The landscape unit of the coastal metamorphic section is completed by the Tyrrhenian, neutroacidophilous, mesomediterranean, of schist, climatophilous series of Quercus ilex (Erico arboreae-Querceto ilicis sigmetum). In the alluvial plain of Nurra, on strong clayey substrata with a mixed calcicole-silicic matrix, always in thermomediterranean climate but under a marked edaphic compensation, the Sardinian, neutroacidophilous, of plain, edaphon-mesophilous series of Quercus ilex and Quercus suber (Pyro amygdaliformis-Querceto i 1 icis sigmetum) is found. The geosigmetum of the alluvial plain is completed by the edaphon-hydric series of the alluvial soils in the north-western Sardinia (Allio triquetri-Ulmeto minoris sigmetum).
