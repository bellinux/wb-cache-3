40|$|A {{conjugate}} {{record and}} playback system is described which enhances the resolution and sonic performance of digital audio recording based on linear pulse code modulation, while remaining compatible with standard <b>linear</b> <b>playback.</b> Using additional information encoded {{entirely in the}} program material, it addresses both the amplitude resolution and sampling rate limitations of the current commercial recording standards...|$|E
40|$|In a new {{approach}} to medical computer based education (CBE) students at several U. S. and Canadian health professions schools have been using an optical videodisc under computer control to study basic medical pathology. Each side of the videodisc has a single concept program which supports <b>linear</b> <b>playback</b> and can also serve as visual and audio databases for interactive presentation. The experimental programs were in use at twenty-two alpha test sites in 1983 - 84; thirty-five sites will be used in the 1984 - 85 academic year. Over five hundred students have evaluated the courseware, and preliminary data show that students learn the material by using the programs and that they rate various features of the programs at four-plus on a one-to-five scale. In their written comments, students have indicated that they believe such programs provide highly valuable learning tools. They say that they want more...|$|E
50|$|LD-ROMs {{owe their}} greater {{capacity}} to a design for constant <b>linear</b> velocity (CLV) <b>playback.</b> Like magnetic tape, the playback speed corresponds with picture quality and audio definition of analog audio-video streams. Since Pioneer intended LD-ROMs primarily for computer software, they chose CLV technology {{to increase the}} file storage capacity.|$|R
40|$|Crosstalk {{cancellation}} system {{plays an}} important role in binaural sound playback using loudspeakers and has attracted many researchers&# 039; interest. However, limited sweet spot is still a challenge especially when the head is laterally misaligned. In this report the optimization of a <b>linear</b> binaural <b>playback</b> system is proposed, in which the optimal source distribution strategy in a linear array configuration is combined with the technique of multiple control points. The proposed method aims to find a good trade-off between the crosstalk cancellation performance and the robustness against the head misalignment. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method...|$|R
50|$|More {{expensive}} decks offered stereo {{audio recording}} and <b>playback.</b> <b>Linear</b> stereo, as it was called, fit two independent channels in the same space as the original mono audiotrack. While this approach preserved acceptable backward compatibility with monoaural audio heads, the splitting of the audio track degraded the signal's SNR {{to the point that}} audible tape hiss was objectionable at normal listening volume. To counteract tape hiss, decks applied Dolby B noise reduction for recording and playback. Dolby B dynamically boosts the mid-frequency band of the audio program on the recorded medium, improving its signal strength relative to the tape's background noise floor, then attenuates the mid-band during playback. Dolby B is not a transparent process, and Dolby-encoded program material will exhibit an unnatural mid-range emphasis when played on non-Dolby capable VCRs.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper to {{identify}} deviations fidelity spatial contours of industrial robots, determine the error pattern detected, and define the ways to solve the problem. The paper presents the research results of fidelity spatial contours done by Fanuc M- 710 iC/ 50 industrial robot when moving along a predetermined path. The proposed method uses a QC 20 -W ballbar wireless system of Renishaw company, designed to diagnose the state of the measurement and <b>playback</b> <b>linear</b> and angular displacements of the CNC. The solutions to adapt the QC 20 -W ballbar system to the constructive peculiarities of industrial robots with five or more independently controlled axes are given. The stages of the preparation of diagnostic systems and software robot movements are described. According to study results of errors that arise while playing back the programmed motions of a fixed point of robot capture in three mutually perpendicular planes its practical accuracy has been defined when performing movements in a given region of the working area, thereby allowing us, eventually, to draw a conclusion on the possibility to use a robot in one technological process or another. The study has resulted in emerging the guidelines for the operation of industrial robots with five or more independently controlled axes. Using these guidelines enables us to increase the playback accuracy of the industrial robot to 0. 01 mm. </p...|$|R
