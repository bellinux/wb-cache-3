25|$|The chief {{benefit is}} that by {{avoiding}} drawing-off domestic hot water directly, the tank is not continually fed with cold water, which in 'hard' water areas reduces the deposit of <b>limescale</b> to whatever is dissolved in the original charge of water plus relatively trivial amounts added to replace losses due to seepage.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula CaCO3. It {{is a common}} substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is {{the main component of}} pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create <b>limescale.</b> It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|Citric acid is an {{excellent}} chelating agent, binding metals by making them soluble. It is used to remove and discourage the buildup of <b>limescale</b> from boilers and evaporators. It {{can be used to}} treat water, which makes it useful in improving the effectiveness of soaps and laundry detergents. By chelating the metals in hard water, it lets these cleaners produce foam and work better without need for water softening. Citric acid is the active ingredient in some bathroom and kitchen cleaning solutions. A solution with a six percent concentration of citric acid will remove hard water stains from glass without scrubbing. In industry, it is used to dissolve rust from steel. Citric acid can be used in shampoo to wash out wax and coloring from the hair.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Usually {{ultrasonic}} testing of complex aerospace components {{is carried out}} with squirter technique. However, water coupling delivers disadvantages like pressure variations, air-bubbles, <b>limescales,</b> algae and corrosion of the mechanics. Therefore a non-contact technique is preferable which avoids these disadvantages. The air-coupled ultrasonic technique large acoustical mismatch between air and solids can be reduced with special transducers in connection with special transmitter and receiver techniques. In spite of these optimisations the test frequencies have to be lower than 1 MHz. It has been already published that low ultrasonic frequencies are necessary for the inspection of CFRP sandwich components (even with water coupling). The air-coupled {{ultrasonic testing}} technique has been qualified for testing CFRP honeycomb sandwich structures. Because of the vertical alignment of the transducers {{on opposite sides of}} a complex component a ten axis robot scanning system is necessary. This paper presents first results and details of the automated aircoupled robot ultrasonic imaging system which is in operation by Eurocopter i...|$|R
25|$|Steam was {{collected}} inside a dome {{on top of}} the top chamber, and in the Reed boiler all but the dome and the ends of the three water chambers was enclosed in a double-layered casing with an air gap and asbestos lining that reduced the temperature of the outer layer. The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as <b>limescale,</b> would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E

2500|$|It is an aminopolycarboxylic {{acid and}} a colourless, {{water-soluble}} solid. Its conjugate base is ethylenediaminetetraacetate.

2500|$|The artists {{appear to}} have used feathers, in a {{relatively}} complex painting technique, compared {{to the art of}} the Upper Paleolithic, that produced relatively simple figures. Figures are often outlined, apparently after the main body was painted. Some figures are shallowly engraved rather than painted. The figures are relatively small, between about [...] high, and in one or two colours. The paint was generally very thin, using mineral earths (often reddish) or charcoal, and the paintings are preserved by a very thin transparent layer of <b>limescale</b> forming over them from water dripping down the wall.|$|E
2500|$|If {{clogging}} occurs, it {{is usually}} the result of an attempt to flush unsuitable items, or too much toilet paper. Flushing of large amounts of hair should also be avoided. However, clogging can occur spontaneously due to <b>limescale</b> fouling of the drain pipe, or by overloading the stool capacity of the toilet. Stool capacity varies among toilet designs and is based {{on the size of the}} drainage pipe, the capacity of the water tank, the velocity of a flush, and the method by which the water attempts to vacate the bowl of its contents. The size and consistency of the stool is also a contributing, but hard-to-predict factor.|$|E

50|$|Sulfamic acid {{is used as}} an acidic {{cleaning}} agent, sometimes pure or as {{a component}} of proprietary mixtures, typically for metals and ceramics. It is frequently used for removing rust and <b>limescale,</b> replacing the more volatile and irritating hydrochloric acid, which is however cheaper.
