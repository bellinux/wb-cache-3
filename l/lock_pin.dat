50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the <b>locking</b> <b>pins,</b> making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R
50|$|The Mendoza used a gas-operated Lewis LMG {{operation}} with improvements, an overhead box magazine and a quick-change barrel. It used a gas cylinder system that delivers a short impulse to the piston, and the bolt {{is similar to}} that of the Lewis Gun, rotating and driven by two cams engaged with the piston rod. The RM2 is the most recent model and adds a simplified method of stripping, by simply removing a <b>lock</b> <b>pin,</b> the stock and rear of the receiver can be folded down to allow the bolt and piston to be withdrawn backwards.|$|E

The dislodgement of the whole blade without any breakage is not possible unless the locking mechanism fails. It appears most probable that in this particular case, this was possible due to an assembly error wherein a <b>locking</b> <b>pin</b> of length 27. 0 mm was used against the specification of 32. 0 mm...|$|R
50|$|A {{pin tumbler}} lock is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} spring-loaded stacks called pin stacks. Each pin stack {{is composed of}} two pins that are stacked on top of each other: the key pin, which touches the key when it is inserted, and the driver pin, which is spring driven. When the different length key pins are aligned at their tops by the insertion of the correspondingly cut key at their bases, the tops of the key pins and, consequently, the bases of the driver pins, form a shear line, so that the cylinder can be turned, rotating the key pins away from the driver pins. When no key or the wrong key is in the <b>lock,</b> <b>pin</b> misalignment prevents the cylinder from turning.|$|E

50|$|The Cam Profile Switching (CPS) {{system uses}} a tri-lobe {{camshaft}} to switch between two different cam profiles. One cam profile provides low valve lift, {{while the other}} cam profile has a high valve lift. The low valve lift cam profile is used at low to mid engine speeds to maintain idling quality and reduce emissions, while the high lift cam profile is used when the engine is spinning at mid to high engine speeds improve peak horsepower and torque. Unlike the other similar variable valve timing systems such as the Honda VTEC, the Toyota VVT-i and the Mitsubishi MIVEC which use rocker arm <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing, the CPS system uses direct-acting tappets with <b>locking</b> <b>pins</b> to change the valve timing and lift profile.|$|R

50|$|Rekeying a lock is {{replacing}} the old <b>lock</b> <b>pins</b> with new <b>lock</b> <b>pins.</b> <b>Locks</b> are usually re keyed to build master-key systems, make {{a set of}} locks share a common key, or to eliminate compromised keys. Sometimes worn pins are replaced with new pins if the old pins become too short to reach the shear-line. The shear-line is the thin line shared by the plug and it's cylindrical housing. If a pin sits flush with the circumference of the plug it will allow lock rotation. Lock cylinders use different length pins in different combinations to create relatively unique key bitting. Most keys have 5 cuts from bow to tip. If a key has 5 cuts, the <b>lock</b> has 5 <b>pins.</b> Different brand <b>locks</b> each vary in many small ways, this is most true when servicing them. Many manufacturers offer product specific manuals. Information disclosed in manufacturer manuals is often otherwise difficult to find, as is locksmith material in general.|$|R
5000|$|Virtually {{all of the}} {{shutters}} in colonial times were hung with strap hinges - following the examples in Britain and on the continent. Strap hinges were strong and secure. The frames of windows were hewn from a single heavy piece of wood and offered plenty of [...] "meat" [...] into which a heavy pintle could be driven. The rails of the shutter were often six or eight inches high and provided {{plenty of room to}} position the strap hinge across the width of the shutter. The hinges were fastened to {{the shutters}} with rivets or nails driven through and clinched {{on the inside of the}} closed shutter. The nails and rivets were not only strong and secure, but they were also the cheapest fastener option. A relatively unskilled smith could produce them with only a hammer and small anvil and an open fire. Screws had to be forged, and then the threads hand-cut and the head had to be slotted - usually with a sharp chisel blow. Locks of the period followed the form of the strap hinges. The rolled barrel was replaced by a pin of about ½" [...] in diameter and twice the length of the thickness of the shutter mounted perpendicular to the face of the lock. The lock would be nailed or riveted on the lock rail of one shutter with the pin positioned about two inches beyond the edge of the shutter. The opposite shutter would be drilled through with a hole to accept the pin protruding from the lock. From the inside close the shutter with the hole, and then close the shutter with the lock. The <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> passes through the hole and you drop a simple nail-like key into the hole in the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> and the shutter is virtually impregnable from the exterior. Closed eighteenth century shutters are very handsome with their five matching strap elements. It's quite impressive to see an early city block with the windows shuttered and the doors locked - there's just no way to get in.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the main}} arbor of the going train, there are two pegs of metal mounted that turn with the main arbor once per hour. The first one is short (approximately 2 cm), and the second is longer (approximately 10 cm). They are at roughly a 90 degree angle. As the main arbor of the going train turns anti-clockwise, the first, short peg will push the fork up a little, which {{releases}} the flail and also moves the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> out of the count wheel. The flail turns clockwise until it hits the second, longer peg. This is the warning. A couple of minutes later, as the longer peg moves anti-clockwise, it completely releases the flail, which now turns clockwise whilst the clock strikes. As soon as a notch comes up on the count wheel, the fork dips again, and the left tine of the fork blocks the flail on its next turn.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> <b>pin.</b> The lock block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. The lock block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A lock tab on the lock block serves to align and register the respective holes on the lock block and switch handle. A <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect the lock block to the switch handle. Once the lock block and the switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by the lock tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is installed, an apertured-end portion of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> is in registration with another hole on the lock block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H. A. regulations can be installed, with one or more padlocks, on the lockout assembly to prevent removal of the <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> from the lockout assembly, thereby preventing removal of the lockout assembly from the circuit breaker...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays all {{different}} kind of actuators is used in a widespread range. Their job is to transmit force, bear load, produce linear force, adjust height etc. Hydraulic fluid pressure, pneumatic pressure and electrical current usually change in {{to some sort of}} motion in actuators. This report is related to electrical actuators and self-locking problem, which is really common in them. The thesis report has been performed at Reac AB in Åmål, Sweden, a major supplier of wheel chair actuators.   Electrical actuators have vast usage and they are versatile but in some cases they face with different working situation like dynamic forces. Recent generation of electrical actuators which used in wheelchairs (imagine moving wheelchair in bumpy road) have self-locking problem, which it means that they will lose their position after while under compression load. This fact will lead to de-calibration of the control system. Approximately 90 % of  AB production is related to the electrical wheelchairs. Challenging point here is dynamic force which can lead to de-calibration of potentiometer and failure of device.   Load capacity of certain actuator (RE 25) is 2000 N. In this project different method has been used to simulate and calculate different aspects. Design of new part, material selection and improvement of some parts are most important. During the period lots of static and dynamic tests, CAD design and FEM analysis have been executed.   Shock absorber, <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> and new material have been run parallel and more or less all those three had a positive effect.   Finally with design and selection of <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> solution included cogwheel and pin, we overcome to the problem with great results. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to reevaluate and improve the existing cable-to-post attachment hardware that is utilized in the non-proprietary cable barrier being developed at MwRSF. The study focused on redesigning the bolted, tabbed bracket (V 10) to eliminate the bolt, reduce the number of components per bracket, eliminate the need for tools during installation, and reduce the number of small parts. Three attachment concepts were selected for evaluation through dynamic testing: (1) the key plate attachment; (2) the wire <b>lock</b> <b>pin</b> attachment; and (3) the pinned back attachment. Each attachment prototype was subjected to two vertical and two lateral dynamic component tests to evaluate the release loads and fracture mechanisms of the brackets. Test results were compared to previous tests on the bolted tabbed bracket (V 10). None of the three bracket attachment designs were found to satisfy all of the design criteria for an alternative bracket. The lack of fixity in the connection between the brackets and the post led to a variable position of the tabs within the keyway which frequently caused unsatisfactory release loads. Therefore, none of the three alternative attachment brackets were recommended for use within the prototype non-proprietary cable barrier...|$|E
