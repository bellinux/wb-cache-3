40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{presenting}} the enzymatic activity of β-amylase used in different concentrations, in the bread dough. The rheological {{characteristics of the}} dough have been obtained by alveographic method. Together with α-amylase and <b>limited</b> <b>dextrinase,</b> β-amylases act on the degradetion of starch, the result being the production of carbohydrates. β-amylase acts on non-reducing end of the polysaccharide chain cleaving maltose residues. Maltose coming from the hydrolysis of starch is the main fermentable sugar which is fermented and therefore provides necessary gas volume in the final part of the technological process. An insuficient fermentation results in a smaller increase of bread. Addition of β-amylase modifies the rheological characteristics of dough. Dough extensibility increases and the resistance and specific mechanical work consumption also decreases proportionally with increasing doses of enzyme. Due {{to the fact that}} the enzyme is active in the finished product, the enzyme activity is likely to go too far. Furthermore maintain freshness, the core may become sticky. The initial dosage of the enzyme is very important to prevent this. The influence of amylase enzyme in the dough for bread can help evaluate and improve the insufficiently developed technology and the nutritive value of the products...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of malt {{fermentability}} (apparent attenuation limit — AAL) by {{measurement of}} the diastatic power enzymes (DPE), α-amylase, total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase,</b> total β-amylase, β-amylase thermostability, and the Kolbach index (KI or free amino nitrogen — FAN) is superior to the conventional use of diastatic power (DP) alone. The thermostability of β-amylase {{is known to be}} an important factor in determining fermentability, thus the thermostability of the other relatively thermolabile enzyme, <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase,</b> was investigated to determine if it was also useful in predicting fermentability. To facilitate this aim, methods were developed for a rapid and cost efficient assay of both β-amylase and <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> thermostability. Internationally important Australian and international malting varieties were compared for their total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> and β-amylase activity and thermostability. Interestingly, the level of <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> thermostability was observed to be inversely correlated with total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> activity. The prediction of malt fermentability was achieved by both forward step-wise multi-linear regression (MLR) and the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate model development methods. Both methods produced similar identifications of the parameters predicting wort fermentability at similar levels of predictive power. Both models were substantially better at predicting fermentability than the traditional use of DP on its own. The emphasis of this study was on the identification of predictive factors that can be consistently used in models to predict fermentability, because the model parameter estimates will subtly vary depending on mashing conditions, yeast strain/fermentation conditions and malt source. The application of these multivariate model development methods (PLS and MLR) enabled the identification of further potential fermentability predicting factors. The analyses divided the predictive parameters into those defined by DP enzymes and those associated with modification (KI, FAN, fine/coarse difference, wort β-glucan and friability). Surprisingly, <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> thermostability was not a substantial predictor of fermentability, presumably due to its negative correlation with total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> activity. The application of these insights in the malting and brewing industries is expected to result in substantial improvements in brewing consistency and enable more specific quality targets for barley breeder's progeny selection cut-off limits to be more precisely defined...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} of the levels of the diastatic power enzymes (DPEs) beta-amylase, <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase,</b> and alpha-amylase has previously been shown to predict barley malt fermentability. Using micromalted samples of barley from different genotypes and growing environments, it was demonstrated that both these factors were important in determining the level of DPEs in malt. In terms of genotypic effects, a trial of breeders’ lines and varieties showed substantial variation in the levels of total beta-amylase (means 455 – 914 U/g), total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> (means 268 – 603 U/kg), and alpha-amylase (means 154 – 316 U/g). The application of gibberellin (GA) during malting resulted in substantial increases in the levels of total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> and alpha-amylase {{and the extent of}} modification (KI). However, the level of total beta-amylase was relatively unchanged. It was also observed that the levels of total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> and alpha-amylase and extent of KI generally were highly correlated (r » 0. 6 – 0. 7), which was attributed to the sensitivity of each of these malt quality factors to GA.

Kernel heterogeneity can lead to brewhouse problems and a product with unpredictable nitrogen and fermentable sugar content. The variability between individual grains of important malting characteristics was measured in malt samples produced under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Various parameters (including germinative energy, germinative capacity, moisture content, β-glucanase activity, friability and homogeneity) were measured {{to ensure that the}} 5 d aerobic Optic malt, produced in Heriot-Watt university micromaltings, was viable and of commercial quality. The 5 d aerobic malt kernels produced at Simpsons Maltings in Berwick-Upon- Tweed were heavier than the micromalt. Commercially produced malt kernels had higher levels of fermentable sugars and soluble nitrogen than the micromalt despite lower α-amylase, β-amylase and ‘total’ <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> activity. Differences between the 5 d aerobic micromalt and the 5 d aerobic commercially produced malt are indicative of why micromalting cannot always be used as a model system for what is happening industrially and must be modelled on commercial practice.

Continuation of malting for up to 10 d only slightly increased the amount of both bound and free forms. Grain grown under conditions of ample moisture (wet grown) for 5 d produced a much higher amount of bound enzyme but a similarly low amount of free enzyme compared to malting conditions. After 10 d of growth there was a decrease in the amount of bound enzyme and a large increase in the amount of free enzyme, such that almost all of the enzyme was present in the free form. A more detailed study of <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> development in wet-grown grains revealed that a bound form was rapidly produced soon after germination. Five to 6 d after germination the amount of bound enzyme decreased rapidly and a very low amount was found in grains 9 d after germination.

For alpha-amylase activity, levels across cultivar and location ranged from 52 to 214 U/g, for beta-amylase activity they ranged from 201 to 1550 U/g; and, for <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> activity, they ranged from 56 to 636 U/kg.

40|$|Diastatic power (DP), {{a measure}} of the level of {{activity}} of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, is a term that refers to the combined activity levels of beta-amylase, alpha-amylase, <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase,</b> and alpha-glucosidase. The result of the action of these enzymes during brewing is to break down starch into component sugars that are readily fermented into alcohol by yeast. Although DP is a reasonable predictor of fermentability, it does not always accurately estimate the level of fermentable sugars generated during mashing or the subsequent fermentability of the resultant wort. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} allelic variation in beta-amylase thermostability has a significant impact on wort fermentability. The thermostability of the DP enzymes is critical in determining fermentable sugar yield during mashing, where the mash temperature profile is a balance between the temperature required for starch gelatinization to enable efficient hydrolysis and the rate of thermal inactivation of the DP enzymes.

A total of nine QTLs for eight traits were mapped to chromosomes 3 H, 4 H, 5 H, and 7 H.

40|$|Starch {{debranching}} enzymes, which specifically hydrolyse a- 1, 6 -glucosidic {{bonds in}} glucans containing both a- 1, 4 and a- 1, 6 linkages, are classified into two types: isoamylase (EC. 3. 2. 1. 68) and <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> (EC. 3. 2. 1. 41). The starch debranching enzymes are primarily involved in starch degradation during seed germination. Recently, however, starch debranching enzymes, particularly isoamylase, have {{been implicated in}} starch biosynthesis in many plant species. In this study, a 2, 590 -bp isoamylase cDNA, which encoded an 88 -kDa isoamylase pre-protein containing the N-terminal transit peptide of 5 kDa, was isolated from a developing wheat kernel cDNA library. The recombinant protein produced in E. coli by expression of the cDNA exhibited isoamylase-type debranching enzyme activity. Accumulation of the 2. 6 -kb isoamylase transcripts in various tissues of wheat indicated the involvement of isoamylase in both starch synthesis in storage and non-storage organs, and starch degradation during seed germination. In the early stages during wheat kernel development, {{the presence of a}} 1. 7 -kb transcript was observed. The 1. 7 -kb transcript encoded a 51 -kDa truncated isoamylase, whose starch debranching enzyme activity could not be detected in vitro. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cultivar CDC Teal) showed that isoamylase gene existed as a single copy in the wheat genome. Therefore, the production of various isoamylase transcripts and the involvement of isoamylase during two developmental stages of wheat plant may result from transcriptional modification of the existing gene and/or expression from a distantly related gene. Western blot analysis using rabbit antibodies raised against wheat isoamylase detected a single polypeptide of 83 -kDa from developing wheat kernels. Accumulation of isoamylase polypeptide increased as the kernels developed from five to 15 days post-anthesis (dpa), and then started to decrease in 20 -dpa kernels until it could not be detected in mature kernels. Similar to the presence of isoamylase, highest activity of <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> was observed in 15 -dpa wheat kernels. According to the amounts of polysaccharides present at different stages during wheat kernel development, the concentration of starch increased as kernels matured, while the amylose/amylopectin ratio remained constant until the kernels reached a fully matured stage. The relationships between the concentrations of polysaccharides and the presence of isoamylase polypeptide, and the activity of <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> in developing wheat grains have suggested that debranching activities of starch debranching enzymes are essential to maintain a constant ratio of amylose and amylopectin during wheat kernel development...|$|E

Alignment of the LD amino acid sequences of Galleon and Maud identified seven amino acid substitutions Lys/Arg- 102, Thr/Ala- 233, Ser/Gly- 235, Gly/Ala- 298, Cys/Arg- 415, Ala/Ser- 885 and Gly/Cys- 888. Genetic diversity of LD was investigated using single strand conformation polymorphism based on the amino acid substitutions. Only limited genetic variation was detected in the current malting barley varieties, although wide variation was observed in the wider barley germplasm.

40|$|Background Starch {{contributes}} to barley grain and malt quality {{which in turn}} {{contributes to}} beer quality and flavour; through fermentable sugar profiles, rates of fermentation and Mallard reactions. Both amylopectin and amylose are enzymatically degraded to release maltose, maltotriose and higher order sugars. Scope and approach Amylopectin is highly branched [α-(1  →  6) glycoside bond branch points] with numerous short branches while amylose is a long chained polymer with a few side branches. During grain development, the final level of branching is controlled by two enzymes namely; isoamylase and <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> (LD). Mutations in either of these genes can also result in changes to structure, content, and granule formation and size.

Transgenic lines transformed with the B 1 -hordein promoter with a signal peptide sequence produced a higher level of wheat thioredoxin h on average than those without a signal sequence. The overexpression of thioredoxin h in the endosperm of germinated grain effected up to a 4 -fold increase in the activity of the starch debranching enzyme, pullulanase (<b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase),</b> the enzyme that specifically cleaves α- 1, 6 linkages in starch. These results raise the question of how thioredoxin h enhances the activity of pullulanase because {{it was found that the}} inhibitor had become inactive before the enzyme showed appreciable activity...|$|E
40|$|In this study, commercially {{produced}} malts {{were used}} for small-scale simulated mashing trials to investigate the impact of differences in the level and thermostability of malt diastatic power (DP) enzymes on the resultant wort fermentability. A modified European Brewery Convention/American Society Brewing Chemists mashing protocol was used with mash-in temperatures ranging between 45 and 76 °C for full-malt and 30 % rice adjunct mashes. Malt extract yield varied little with mashing temperature for most varieties in this temperature range. However, the fermentability, maltose content, and free amino nitrogen of that extract was considerably affected by mashing temperature with 65 °C achieving the highest fermentability for all malt varieties. Multilinear regression analysis of full-malt and rice adjunct mashing trials at 65 °C using 43 commercial malts showed {{that the level of}} alpha-amylase and total <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> activity, Kolbach Index, and the total beta-amylase activity level and thermostability were the most important malt quality predictors of wort fermentability. These conclusions suggest that the conventional DP assessment could be replaced with the measurement of its component enzymes outlined above so that maltsters could better satisfy brewers malt quality expectations by blending and defining their malt quality in terms of these fermentability predicting factors. This information would be particularly useful to brewers who brew with multiple varieties and blends from different suppliers. The focus on individual enzyme characteristics by barley breeders is likely to provide selection targets that are more accurate and achievable...|$|E
40|$|Barley grain starch {{is formed}} by amylose and {{amylopectin}} in a 1 : 3 ratio, and is packed into granules of different dimensions. The distribution of granule dimension is bimodal, {{with a majority}} of small spherical B-granules and a smaller amount of large discoidal A-granules containing {{the majority of the}} starch. Starch granules are semi-crystalline structures with characteristic X-ray diffraction patterns. Distinct features of starch granules are controlled by different enzymes and are relevant for nutritional value or industrial applications. Here, the Targeting-Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) approach was applied on the barley TILLMore TILLING population to identify 29 new alleles in five genes related to starch metabolism known to be expressed in the endosperm during grain filling: BMY 1 (Beta-amylase 1), GBSSI (Granule Bound Starch Synthase I), LDA 1 (<b>Limit</b> <b>Dextrinase</b> 1), SSI (Starch Synthase I), SSIIa (Starch Synthase IIa). Reserve starch of nine M 3 mutant lines carrying missense or nonsense mutations was analysed for granule size, crystallinity and amylose/amylopectin content. Seven mutant lines presented starches with different features in respect to the wild-type: (i) a mutant line with a missense mutation in GBSSI showed a 4 -fold reduced amylose/amylopectin ratio; (ii) a missense mutations in SSI resulted in 2 -fold increase in A:B granule ratio; (iii) a nonsense mutation in SSIIa was associated with shrunken seeds with a 2 -fold increased amylose/amylopectin ratio and different type of crystal packing in the granule; (iv) the remaining four missense mutations suggested a role of LDA 1 in granule initiation, and of SSIIa in determining the size of A-granules. We demonstrat...|$|E
40|$|A key {{biochemical}} process in brewing is the hydrolysis of starch by diastatic power (DP) enzymes into fermentable sugars during the mashing stage of brewing. Efficient starch hydrolysis during mashing requires initially starch gelatinization at approximately 59 - 64 degrees C and then sufficient DP enzyme activity to achieve starch hydrolysis. This investigation compared {{the persistence of}} DP enzyme activity during modified Institute of Brewing (MIoB, 1 : 3 grist/water ratio + Ca 2 +) mash with the conventional Congress (1 : 4 grist/water ratio) small-scale mash, using malt from three current Australian barley varieties. Traditionally, with the thermostability of DP enzymes, it is understood that beta-amylase is relatively thermostable, whereas beta-amylase and <b>limit</b> <b>dextrinase</b> (LD) are relatively thermolabile at conventional mashing temperatures. In addition, it is also known that beta-amylase and in particular LD have bound and latent fractions that require release from binding proteins or inhibitors, respectively, before {{they are able to}} contribute to starch hydrolysis. One mechanism observed empirically was that heat applied during mashing at temperatures of approximately 55 - 60 degrees C appears to liberate bound beta-amylase and LD. The results in terms of DP enzyme release, thermostability, and activity were examined to understand the relative contributions of the three key DP enzymes to starch hydrolysis during different mashing conditions. Interestingly, we observed that both beta-amylase and LD retained significant levels of activity (approximately 40 % total activity), even after mashing for 60 min at 65 degrees C. These observations are of critical importance to brewers in meeting beer quality specifications when they manipulate mash temperatures to cope with variations in malt quality, developing new products, or producing beers requiring different wort qualities for production. The implications from these results of the choice of small-scale mash protocol for malt quality evaluation, the targeting of DP enzyme alleles for barley malt quality improvement, and the selection of malt for brewing are discussed...|$|E
