40|$|The {{interaction}} of vertical, horizontal and moment (VHM) loads {{acting on a}} shallow foundation is complex, and {{it is becoming increasingly}} popular to represent ultimate limit states under general VHM loading as failure envelopes in three-dimensional load space. General loading is of particular interest offshore, where harsh environmental conditions lead to large horizontal and moment foundation loads. Shallow foundations with peripheral skirts that penetrate into the seabed are used to resist large <b>lateral</b> and <b>overturning</b> forces. During undrained loading, tensile resistance can be mobilised {{on the underside of the}} base plate by suctions developed within the skirt compartment. This paper presents failure envelopes and kinematic mechanisms for undrained ultimate limit states of circular skirted foundations in uniform and heterogeneous deposits under general VHM loading based on finite element results. An approximating method is proposed that permits accurate prediction of ultimate limit states under a full range of general loading. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study aims at {{optimizing}} {{the dynamics}} of a fixed – tank three – axle vehicle, with respect to both its vertical and lateral performance. This is accomplished by developing a hybrid optimization algorithm, which combines the conventional Evolution Strategy with well – known deterministic methods, such as line – search and/or trust – region. By utilizing a Monte Carlo analysis, the stiffness and damping characteristics of vehicle's suspensions are optimized {{with respect to the}} pitch and roll angles of the sprung mass, taking under consideration the design limitations, the geometrical constraints of the vehicle, as well as the <b>lateral</b> acceleration at <b>overturn...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tractor {{stability}} predominantly determines operator’s safety. For {{a tractor}} parking on <b>lateral</b> slopes, <b>overturning</b> accidents have been frequently discussed using mathematical models. While the existing static models remarkably contribute tractor overturning mechanisms, {{few of them}} have considered the stability {{from the perspective of}} tractor sideslip. In our study, a relatively precise quasi–static model presented recently was adopted as the base model. We expanded it by introducing potential tractor sideslips. While the original model pointed out the lateral slope angle as the main factor influencing tractor overturns, we investigated tractor slipping stability under the influences of the slope angle and the coefficient of friction. The dimensional parameters of the example tractor for simulation were set the same as those in the original work. It was found that the allowable friction forces of both the front and rear tires primarily depended on the coefficient of friction rather than the slope angle. By comparing the surfaces of the allowable friction forces and the corresponding friction forces, tractor slipping thresholds for the front and rear tires were identified. Caution areas implying certain ground conditions that will definitely cause tractor sideslip were marked accordingly. The results shown in this study provide a relatively comprehensive way to understand tractor static stability when both tractor sideslip and overturn are concerned...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} the influence of the presence of a structure on the soil-foundation-structure interaction. Analysis is carried out using a global elastoplastic finite element modelling of the soil-foundation-structure system. It is based on comparing the response of a single foundation to that of both adjacent foundations and soil-foundation-structure system. Analyses show that the interaction between adjacent foundations does not affect their response to vertical load, while the presence of the structure could affect largely the response of the soil-foundation-structure to vertical loads, in particular for high values of the soil-structure relative stiffness. The presence of the structure induces additional loads to the foundation (<b>lateral</b> reaction and <b>overturning</b> moment), which result in a reduction of the vertical bearing capacity of the foundation. These analyses show the necessity to consider the soil-foundation-structure in foundations design...|$|R
40|$|Timber {{buildings}} have always showed great performances, even if past timber structural systems {{are no longer}} adequate to fulfil modern building standards. The key aspect of CLT buildings, as for timber constructions in general, are the connection systems. Nowadays, design of CLT wall connections {{is based on the}} hypothesis that hold-down connection is subjected only to tension, while angle bracket only to shear. Nevertheless, experimental highlighted that the two types of connection may be subjected to significant displacements in both directions, thus to coupled actions. The first part of this study presents results from an extensive experimental campaign conducted on traditional connections for CLT buildings using a specific setup that allowed to impose prescribed levels of displacements in secondary direction, varying {{at the same time the}} main direction displacement in a cyclic and monotonic manner. A total of fifteen specimens, for each connection type, are presented and critically discussed in terms of load-displacement curves, strength, stiffness, energy dissipation, strength degradation and ductility. The second part of the thesis focuses on an experimental and numerical investigation of a two storey 2 / 3 scaled CLT hybrid rocking wall. The applicability and the response of this relatively new low-damage solution has been studied for the first time applied on a CLT shear wall. The CLT wall included post-tensioned bars to provide self-centring capabilities and replaceable external steel dissipaters to accommodate energy dissipations. Furthermore, an experimental solution for the dissipater-wood panel link has been implemented. Results are presented in terms of achieved <b>lateral</b> force, <b>overturning</b> moment capacity, variation in the post-tension force, oscillation of the neutral axis depth and energy dissipation. Lastly, a numerical simulation accompanied experimental evidences, to examine the response of the rocking system for higher level of drifts, going beyond test limits...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{was established to}} investigate the lateral mass transfer {{as well as the}} mechanism of bed-inventory overturn inside a pant-leg circulating fluidized bed (CFB), which are of great importance to maintain safe and efficient operation of the CFB. Results show that the special flow structure in which the solid particle volume fraction along the central line of the pant-leg CFB is relative high enlarges the lateral mass transfer rate and make it more possible for bed inventory <b>overturn.</b> Although the <b>lateral</b> pressure difference generated from lateral mass transfer inhibits continuing lateral mass transfer, providing the pant-leg CFB with self-balancing ability to some extent, the primary flow rate change due to the outlet pressure change often disable the self-balancing ability by continually enhancing the flow rate difference. As the flow rate of the primary air fan is more sensitive to its outlet pressure, it is easier to lead to bed inventory overturn. While when the solid particle is easier to change its flow patter to follow the surrounding air flow,the self-balancing ability is more active.

40|$|With {{the growing}} wind {{industry}} in Canada, {{it has become}} important to optimize wind turbine foundation design. Wind turbine foundations are subjected to combinations of vertical, horizontal and moment loads due to vertical self-weight of the structure and soil surcharge. Additionally, there are significant <b>lateral</b> loads and <b>overturning</b> moments attributed to varying wind forces acting at considerable tower heights above the ground level. In this thesis, the undrained bearing capacity response of circular 2 ̆ 6 octagonal foundations subjected to combined loading is calculated using finite element analyses. Previous works have mostly focused on circular foundations. An octagonal foundation of the style typically used in the wind industry forms {{the focus of this}} research. Foundations are either surface based or embedded in homogeneous or heterogeneous soils. The results are expressed in terms of a coherent set of bearing capacity factors and failure envelopes in two dimensional planes (VH, VM and HM). This research also presents a parametric study on the effect of a surficial crust on the bearing capacity of a foundation. Finally, working and design loads for a typical wind turbine foundation are plotted in two dimensional failure planes to investigate if there is a potential `spare 2 ̆ 7 capacity. The finite element study indicates that an increase in soil strength heterogeneity and embedment leads to increases in the uniaxial limit capacities and size of the failure envelopes. For octagonal foundations, the average increase in uniaxial vertical, horizontal and moment capacities due to increases in the embedment is 15...|$|R
