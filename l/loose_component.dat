40|$|Nuclear crystalloids {{have been}} found in sieve {{elements}} of several Boraginaceae. Nuclei of dif-ferentiating sieve elements of Echium and other genera except Amsinckia contain one or more crystalloids composed of thin rods densely packed in parallel arrangement. After the nuclei disintegrate in the maturing sieve element the crystalloids are released into the cell lumen where they persist intact. Amsinckia the crystalloid consists of two components: a dense component, similar to the crystalloid in the other genera and a loosely arranged paracrystalline component. The proteinaceous nature of the nuclear crystalloids and their possible similarity to P-protein was inves-tigated by enzyme digestion techniques. Three proteolytic enzymes were employed in this study: protease, pepsin and trypsin. Successful digestion of the dense crystalloid in both Echium and Amsinckia was obtained with each enzyme tested. P-protein plugging the sieve plate pores was also digested. The <b>loose</b> <b>component</b> in Amsinckia and the aggregated and dispersed P-protein were not affected by the enzyme digestion procedures.

40|$|New {{research}} {{initiatives are}} being {{dedicated to the}} task of creating the procedures and technologies necessary to reduce active satellite installation times from the current scale of years. One of the largest time consuming steps is the set of flight qualification tests requiring structural verification through methods that currently give no information on sources of undesired structural changes; {{the most common cause of}} these changes is a <b>loose</b> <b>component</b> such as a bolt. To assist with reducing the time of this process, structural health monitoring is being considered as a means of locating sources of damage when detected or verifying the structure through self-diagnostic techniques during assembly intervals. It is envisioned that this option would potentially allow traditional tests to be omitted. Piezoelectric wafer active sensors are utilized in a simple 2 x 2 network on a realistic satellite panel incorporating 49 bolts where damage is simulated by minimally loosened bolts. Both Acousto-Elastic and Electro-Mechanical Impedance methods are investigated for their capability to detecting damage. Experimental results show that the techniques utilized allow for damage detection and localization and present the possibility of eliminating the need for a baseline. I...|$|E

40|$|Periprosthetic {{fractures}} after total knee arthroplasty {{may occur}} in {{any part of}} the femur, tibia and patella, and the most common pattern involves the supracondylar area of the distal femur. Supracondylar periprosthetic fractures frequently occur above a well-fixed prosthesis, and risk factors include anterior femoral cortical notching and use of the rotational constrained implant. Periprosthetic tibial fractures are frequently associated with <b>loose</b> <b>components</b> and malalignment or malposition of implants. Fractures of the patella are much less common and associated with rheumatoid arthritis, use of steroid, osteonecrosis and malalignment of implants. Most patients with periprosthetic fractures around the knee are the elderly with poor bone quality. There are many difficulties and increased risk of nonunion after treatment because reduction and internal fixation is interfered with by preexisting prosthesis and bone cement. Additionally, previous soft tissue injury is another disadvantageous condition for bone healing. Many authors reported good clinical outcomes after non-operative treatment of undisplaced or minimally displaced periprosthetic fractures; however, open reduction or revision arthroplasty was required in displaced fractures or fractures with unstable prosthesis. Periprosthetic fractures around the knee should be prevented by appropriate technique during total knee arthroplasty. Nevertheless, if a periprosthetic fracture occurs, an appropriate treatment method should be selected considering the stability of the prosthesis, displacement of fracture and bone quality...|$|R
40|$|Aseptic {{loosening}} {{of total}} joint replacements {{is associated with}} bone resorption. A heavy infiltrate of foreign body macrophages in response to biomaterial wear particles is commonly found in the fibrous membrane surrounding <b>loose</b> <b>components.</b> It has recently been shown that foreign body macrophages can differentiate into osteoclastic cells. To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of bone resorption {{have a role to}} play in controlling the osteolysis of aseptic loosening, we analyzed the effect of a bisphosphonate, disodium ethane- 1, 1 -diphosphonate (EHDP) on this process. Murine monocytes and foreign body macrophages (derived from granulomas formed by subcutaneous implantation of particles of prosthetic biomaterials) were co-cultured with UMR 106 osteoblast-like cells in the presence of 1, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 for 14 days on glass coverslips and bone slices. EHDP significantly inhibited bone resorption in these co-cultures. There was little or no expression of the osteoclast-associated enzyme, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) in EHDP-treated co-cultures. Addition of EHDP to monocyte-UMR 106 co-cultures after the appearance of TRAP-positive cells did not abolish bone resorption, indicating that EHDP, in addition to its known inhibitory effect on osteoclast function, suppresses differentiation of osteoclast precursors. EHDP inhibition of the osteolysis induced by particulate biomaterial-associated macrophages shows that pharmacological inhibition of bone resorption might be used to control the osteolysis of aseptic loosening...|$|R

The present study evaluates the safety and efficacy of clindamycin in combination with rifampin for the management of staphylococcal PJI. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients were included who received clindamycin-rifampin combination therapy to treat a periprosthetic hip or knee infection by Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci. Patients were treated according to a standardized treatment algorithm and followed for a median of 54 months. Of the 36 patients with periprosthetic staphylococcal infections, 31 had an infection of the hip, and five had an infection of the knee. Eighteen patients underwent debridement and retention of the implant (DAIR) for an early infection, the other 18 patients underwent revision of <b>loose</b> <b>components</b> in presumed aseptic loosening with unexpected positive cultures. RESULTS: In this study, we report a success rate of 86 %, with five recurrent/persistent PJI in 36 treated patients. Cure rate was 78 % (14 / 18) in the DAIR patients and 94 % (17 / 18) in the revision group. Five patients (14 %) discontinued clindamycin-rifampin due to side effects.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of loosening in {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) {{and the role of}} polyethylene (PE) wear debris in this process is unclear. Radiographic measurements showed that THA with 32 mm heads have about 3 times greater volumetric wear than those with 22 mm heads. If PE debris were the main cause of loosening, then there should be an obvious difference in revision rates between the prostheses with these two head sizes. However, the analysis of revision rates, due to aseptic loosening, showed no significant difference. These findings do not support the hypothesis that wear debris is the main cause of loosening. The intracapsular pressure and ultrasonographic synovitis in THA with <b>loose</b> <b>components</b> was studied. The pressure was high and with cyclic alterations dependent on hip joint movements. The synovitis in loose THA was more pronounced than in stable ones. There was a significant correlation between the intracapsular pressure with the hip in extension with inward rotation and synovitis. These results suggest that increased pressure and synovitis is important in loosening of THA. The correlation between synovitis, wear and radiographic loosening was studied. There was a significant correlation between volumetric wear and synovitis. Hips with cup loosening had significantly greater wear and synovitis than the others. In THA with loose cups the PE wear was higher than in those with loose stems. This indicates that PE debris is of certain importance in loosening of acetabular components, but of less significance in loosening of stems. The experimental study showed that bone cement, if left inside PE cups during curing, contaminates the articulating surface of the cups with cement debris. In clinical situations such contamination may predispose to increased wear...|$|R
