40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of geometry and surface growth {{based on the}} sequential replica method is used to compare morphogenesis at the shoot apex of Anagallis arvensis in the reproductive and vegetative phases of development. Formation of three types of lateral organs {{takes place at the}} Anagallis shoot apical meristem (SAM) : vegetative leaf primordia are formed during the vegetative phase and leaf-like bracts and flower primordia during the reproductive phase. Although the shapes of all the three types of primordia are very similar during their early developmental stages, areal growth rates and anisotropy of apex surface growth accompanying formation of leaf or bract primordia are profoundly different from those during formation of flower primordia. This provides an example of different modes of de novo formation of a given shape. Moreover, growth accompanying the formation of the boundary between the SAM and flower primordium is entirely different from growth at the adaxial <b>leaf</b> or bract <b>primordium</b> boundary. In the latter, areal growth rates at the future boundary are the lowest of all the apex surface, while in the former they are relatively very high. The direction of maximal growth rate is latitudinal (along the future boundary) in the case of <b>leaf</b> or bract <b>primordium</b> but meridional (across the boundary) in the case of flower. The replica method does not enable direct {{analysis of}} growth in the direction perpendicular to the apex surface (anticlinal direction). Nevertheless, the reconstructed surfaces of consecutive replicas taken from an individual apex allow general directions of SAM surface bulging accompanying primordium formation to be recognized. Precise alignment of consecutive reconstructions shows that the direction of initial bulging during the leaf or bract formation is nearly parallel to the shoot axis (upward bulging), while in the case of flower it is perpendicular to the axis (lateral bulging). In future, such 3 D reconstructions can be used to assess displacement velocity fields so that growth in the anticlinal direction can be assessed. In terms of self-perpetuation, the inflorescence SAM of Anagallis differs from the SAM in the vegetative phase in that the centrally located region of slow growth is less distinct in the inflorescence SAM. Moreover, the position of this slowly growing zone with respect to cells is not stable {{in the course of the}} meristem ontogeny...|$|R

From 1987 to 1990 four field experiments were conducted to monitor barley main-stem apical development and {{to determine the effects of}} chlormequat (CCC) and ethephon on the development, physiology and yield of spring barley. Our data provide a description of barley apical development and the general pattern of <b>leaf</b> and spikelet <b>primordium</b> production under field conditions. In general, PGR treatment reduced the apical dominance of dominant sinks allowing the survival and greater development of more subordinate sinks. Early application of either CCC or ethephon retarded development of the main-stem apex from shortly after application to the awn elongation stage and reduced the number of aborted spikelet primordia, thus increasing the potential number of grains per spike and sometimes grain yield. Ethephon applied at ZGS 39 reduced plant height and lodging. Early application (ZGS 30) of ethephon, alone or in combination with CCC increased the number of spikes m$ sp{- 2 },$ but not grain yield. The number of spike-bearing shoots per unit area or per plant was increased by early PGR treatment, primarily by enhancement of tiller number rather than tiller survival. Early application of CCC or ethephon to spring barley is not justified, and caution must be taken when using ethephon at the currently recommended rate and stage for lodging control. Post-anthesis application of ethephon can efficiently enhance grain fill and yield of spring barley...|$|R

Both number of cell layers in palisade tis-sue and individual leaf area were affected by the previous-year irradiance, whereas cell length of palisade tissue was larger in LH leaves than in LL leaves, suggesting determination by cur-rent-year irradiance. Lamina chlorophyll/nitrogen ratio was higher in HL and LL leaves than in LH leaves, suggesting de-termination by current-year irradiance. Diurnal minimum val-ues of leaf water potential measured under sunlit conditions were lower in H and LH leaves than in HL and LL leaves. Ef-fective osmotic adjustment was found in H and LH leaves, sug-gesting that leaf water relations were affected by current-year irradiance. Net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance measured under sunlight conditions were higher in H and LH leaves than in HL and LL leaves.

Comparisons of phenotypes among these mutants allowed us {{to focus on a}} systematic abnormality: the parenchyma cells associated with lateral veins do not fully differentiate into bundle sheath, mesophyll or upper sclerenchyma. The more dramatic expression of Kn 1 mutants—knots, ligule alterations and twisting—is sporadic and dependent on the time when the mutant acts in <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> development. Using lw to mark leaf sectors that lose Kn 1 following X-irradiation, we show that the knotted-leaf phenotype encoded by chromosome 1 L is autonomous. Analysis of sectors lacking a particular Kn 1 gene (Kn 1 -N 2) suggests that Kn 1 itself, rather than a linked modifier gene, is autonomous in the <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium.</b> Aneuploid studies using various translocations involving 1 L and marked by Adh 1 allozymes are compared. The Kn 1 mutant appears to encode a "new" function or a considerable overproduction of an extant product in the leaf.

Antisense NSPHAN leaves show ectopic expression of NTH 20, a class I KNOX gene. Juvenile transgenic leaves have normal adaxial/abaxial polarity and generate leaf blades in the normal position, but the adaxial mesophyll shows disorganized patterns of cell division, delayed maturation of palisade, and ectopic reinitiation of blade primordia along the midrib.

40|$|A {{degree of}} in-crop {{management}} could provide growers with {{the option to}} manipulate growth and development in line with ambient weather conditions. Studies presented in this thesis explored this opportunity, and data so far collected support the 'nutrient diversion' hypothesis that internal resource availability and allocation play important roles in regulation of growth partitioning and phenological development. Different levels of defoliation were conducted on maize and cotton plants growing under contrasting water conditions to measure the effect of partial defoliation on their growth and production. In the environment of water stress with low average control yield, defoliation significantly diminished the negative impact caused by water deficit and led to smaller water-deficit-induced decrease of grain yield of maize plants and harvestable product of cotton plants. The relative yield advantage of defoliated plants in the water deficit environment {{can be attributed to}} defoliation-induced improvement in water status later in the growth cycle as reflected in measures of photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance. Early-stage defoliation, removing different parts of maize plants, resulted in varied developmental responses. Removing only the fully exposed leaf blades did not delay the onset of tassel initiation, but tassel initiation and tassel emergence were significantly delayed by either removal of all the shoot tissues above the second ligule or removal of only the expanding leaves at a height just above the soil surface(with the first three or four fully exposed leaves left intact). Continued removal of the expanding leaves delayed tassel initiation further. This indicates the important role that expanding leaves play in control of the transition to reproductive growth. The elongation rate of leaf primordia underwent a gradual decrease as maize plants increased in size with time. The gradual decrease in rate of <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> elongation and the resultant change in shoot apical architecture (described by relative length of leaf primordia) were strongly associated with floral induction. It is proposed that plant internal resource competition lessened the nutrient supply to the shoot apices and, therefore, affected <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> growth and meristem identity simultaneously. The dynamic competition and interdependency among various plant parts were explored using a dynamic model constructed to simulate resource allocation and growth partitioning at the whole plant level...|$|E
40|$|The {{developmental}} morphology of shoots of Thuja occidentalis L. (eastern white cedar) {{was investigated}} using {{scanning electron microscopy}} to determine the pattern of initiation of two types of leaves characteristic of higher (third and above) order branches. The shoots of eastern white cedar are bilateral in symmetry and bear leaves in an orthogonal decussate phyllotactic pattern. The shoot system is further characterized {{by the presence of}} two alternating and morphologically different pairs of leaves that constitute the basic repeating pattern of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). At maturity the dimorphism between leaf types is marked. Leaves in one plane are wide and flat in comparison with narrower and cup-shaped leaves growing in a plane perpendicular to the other leaf type. The early stages of development of each of the two types of leaves were compared using scanning electron microscopy. During the earliest visible stages of initiation (primordial crest), cup-shaped and flat leaves are very similar in morphology. As individual leaf primordia become more easily delimited as structures by the presence of a furrow between the SAM and the leaf, they differ in terms of width. As they develop further and begin to cover the SAM, the two leaf types are distinguishable morphologically (flat vs. cup shaped). Quantitative parameters such as diameter of the SAM, angle of insertion of individual leaves, and size of leaf primordia (in both a tangential and perpendicular plane) were measured on three categories of leaves: stage 1, earliest visible stage of initiation; stage 2, delineation of <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> from SAM by furrowing; stage 3, <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> partially covering SAM. These measurements corroborate our morphological observations, which show that during early stages of development, flat and cup-shaped leaves are morphologically similar and they diverge in their pattern of development postinitiation, especially as far as leaf width and thickness are concerned.

40|$|WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) {{genes are}} plant {{specific}} transcription factors {{that serve as}} master switches controlling key developmental programs from embryo apical-basal asymmetric patterning to organizing stem cells and development of lateral organs. Recently, we reported the requirement of a WOX 1 /MAW-like gene, STENOFOLIA (STF), for blade outgrowth and leaf vascular patterning in Medicago truncatula and Nicotiana sylvestris. The stf mutant in Medicago produces narrow leaves where mediolateral outgrowth of the blade is severely curtailed while proximodistal growth and trifoliate identity remain unaffected. The lam 1 mutant in N. sylvestris produces leaves devoid of blade tissue with just 1 - 2 layers of rudimentary strips and lacks stem elongation. stf and lam 1 mutants have narrow petals and are female sterile due to defective ovule development. Morphological analysis of mutants and STF expression patterns suggest that STF regulates blade outgrowth mainly by controlling cell division {{in the margins of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium.</b> Both the blade and flower phenotypes of lam 1 can be complemented with WUS expressed under the STF promoter suggesting a conserved mechanism in stem cell maintenance and lateral organ development...|$|E

The leaf permease 1 -mutable 1 (lpe 1 -m 1) mutant of maize exhibits disrupted chloroplast ultrastructure, preferentially affecting bundle sheath choroplasts under lower light. Despite the disrupted ultrastructure, the metabolic cooperation of bundle sheath and mesophyll cells for C 4 photosynthesis remains intact. To investigate this novel mutation, the Activator transposon-tagged allele and cDNAs corresponding to the Lpe 1 mRNA from wild-type plants were cloned.

Specifically, we show how the early pattern of PIN 1 expression appears in the embryo, how the <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> emerges, how convergence points arise on the leaf margin, how the first loop is formed, and how the intricate pattern of PIN shifts during the early establishment of vein patterns in incipient leaves of Arabidopsis. Given our results, we submit that the model provides evidence that many of the salient structural characteristics that have been described at various stages of plant development can arise from the unifor...|$|E
40|$|A plant {{growing in}} the field has the unique ability to sense the {{presence}} of other plants growing near by and adjust its growth rate accordingly. This ability to detect neighbors, which is referred to as shade avoidance response, is mediated by members of the phytochrome family which detect light in the red (R) and far-red (FR) region of the spectrum. Work done by several laboratories has shown that low R/FR provides the signal for shade avoidance response during which the elongation of stem-like organs occurs at the expense of leaf development. However, the mechanism by which the low R/FR signal is transduced to attenuate leaf development has remained largely unknown. In the August issue of Genes and Development, we have shown that low R/FR rapidly and transiently arrests the growth of the <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium.</b> By exploiting mutant analysis in combination with genome wide expression profiling, we have identified a novel regulatory circuit underlying plant response to canopy shade. Together, the data demonstrate that the growth arrest induced by low R/FR depends on auxin-induced cytokinin breakdown in pre-procambial cells of developing primordia. In this addendum, we discuss open questions to be addressed in the future...|$|E
40|$|Within the maize <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium,</b> coordinated cell {{division}} and differentiation patterns {{result in the}} development of two morphologically and biochemically distinct photosynthetic cell types, the bundle sheath and the mesophyll. The bundle sheath defective 2 -mutable 1 (bsd 2 -m 1) mutation specifically disrupts C 4 differentiation in bundle sheath cells in that the levels of bundle sheath cell-specific photosynthetic enzymes are reduced and the bundle sheath chloroplast structure is aberrant. In contrast, mesophyll cell-specific enzymes accumulate to normal levels, and the mesophyll cell chloroplast structure is not perturbed. Throughout mutant leaf development, the large and small subunits of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase are absent; however, both rbcL and RbcS transcripts accumulate. Moreover, chloroplast-encoded rbcL transcripts accumulate ectopically in mesophyll cells. Although the bundle sheath cell chloroplast structure deteriorates rapidly when plants are exposed to light, this deterioration is most likely a secondary effect resulting from cell-specific photooxidative damage. Therefore, we propose that the Bsd 2 gene plays a direct role in the post-transcriptional control of rbcL transcript accumulation and/or translation, both in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells, and an indirect role in the maintenance of bundle sheath cell chloroplast structure...|$|E
40|$|M) and Knudson ‘C ’ (KC) were {{evaluated}} for seed germination and early protocorm development in Epidendrum ibaguense Kunth. Besides, effects of peptone, activated charcoal and plant growth regulators (6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D)) were also studied. Maximum seed germination was achieved on M and PM (~ 90 %) fortified with 2 gl- 1 peptone. Medium supplemented with 1. 0 mgl- 1 BAP improved seed germination {{in contrast to}} basal media whereas 2, 4 -D either singly or in combination with BAP remarkably reduced the germination rate. Activated charcoal in the medium enhanced germination of seed, induced significantly large size protocorms (1. 6318) and early rooting in protocorms. Within two weeks of culture, spherules emerged out due to cracking of the seed coat. The spherules developed into protocorms with a <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium</b> at apical portion after 3 to 4 weeks and gradually produced complete seedlings. Strong and stout root system was induced in in vitro seedlings on transferring in half strength PM and M media fortified with 0. 5 - 1. 0 mgl- 1 indole acetic acid (IAA). Well-rooted seedlings were transferred to green house with 90 % survival...|$|E
40|$|Maize {{leaves are}} divided into {{repeated}} longitudinal units consisting of vascular tissue, bundle sheath (BS), and mesophyll (M) cells. We have carried out a cell lineage analysis of these cell types using six spontaneous striping mutants of maize. We show that certain cell division patterns are preferentially utilized, but not required, to form the characteristic arrangement of cell types. Our data suggest that early in development a central cell layer is formed, most frequently by periclinal divisions in the adaxial subepidermal layer of the <b>leaf</b> <b>primordium.</b> Lateral and intermediate veins are initiated in this central layer, most often by divisions which contribute daughter cells to both the procambium and the ground meristem. These divisions generate "half vein" units which comprise half of the bundle sheath cells around a vein and a single adjacent M cell. We show that intermediate veins are multiclonal both in this transverse direction and along their lengths. BS cells are {{more closely related to}} M cells in the middle layer of the leaf than to those in the upper and lower subepidermal layers. An examination of sector boundaries has shown that photosynthetic differentiation in M cells is affected by the phenotype of neighboring BS cells...|$|E
