5|$|Adventure 2 has 180 emblems, earned for {{a variety}} of tasks. Each <b>level</b> <b>has</b> five missions; only the first is {{required}} to continue the campaign, and other missions include completing a harder version of a level and collecting 100 rings. The player earns emblems by completing missions and other tasks, many related to Chao raising. Collecting all the emblems unlocks a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone stage from the original Sonic the Hedgehog.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks. There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also to cross over. The temple at the highest <b>level</b> <b>has</b> a frieze of Buddha. Each building has a balcony, which provides lovely views of the scenic Paro valley down below. The Monasteries have ancient history of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while the lower <b>level</b> <b>has</b> formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{each level}} the player will either collect a piece of the map or defeat a boss to receive a gem from the Amulet; odd-numbered <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> map pieces, while even-numbered <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> boss fights and gems. The {{exception}} is <b>level</b> 13, which <b>has</b> a boss fight and rewards the player with two gems. Receiving gems also triggers a cutscene.|$|R

5|$|Each <b>level</b> <b>has</b> a {{time limit}} of ten minutes, which ends the game if it is exceeded. A player losing all lives is {{presented}} with a choice to continue or return to the title screen. Power-ups scattered across each world, presented as picture frames, include carrots that extend Robbit's health, extra lives, time-outs that stop the clock and freeze the level's dynamics for a few seconds, hourglasses that extend the player's time, and power pills that make Robbit invincible {{for a short period}} of time. Enemies in the game vary from anthropomorphic versions of creatures to robots and plants.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>level</b> <b>has</b> {{set goals}} {{in the fields of}} {{financial}} attainment, hospital reputation, patients cured, and hospital value. Holding negative funds or allowing sufficient patients to die will bring about losing requirements. When the goals have been met the player has the option to move on to a new, more elaborate hospital with tougher winning conditions and more diseases present, or stick with their current one. If enough rats have been shot, the player is taken to a special level whose goal is to shoot as many as possible.|$|E
5|$|Four {{permanent}} concession {{stands and}} several portable carts {{located on the}} concourse offer traditional ballpark foods including hot dogs, corn dogs, pizza, soft pretzels, ice cream, and popcorn. Each stand also serves foods unique to and common in Nashville and the South, including Nashville hot chicken, pulled pork barbecue sandwiches, and Tennessee chow chow pork chop sandwiches. The stadium's second <b>level</b> <b>has</b> a bar, lounge, and concessions area with views of the field; it is accessible only by those with suite, party-deck, or upper-deck tickets.|$|E

50|$|A palynological {{investigation}} on long cores from Urmia Lake has revealed a nearly 200 kyr record of vegetation and lake level changes. The vegetation {{has changed from}} the Artemisia/grass steppes during the glacial/stadial periods, to oak-juniper steppe-forests during the interglacial/interstadial periods. The lake {{seems to have had}} a complex hydrological history and its water <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> fluctuated greatly in geological history. Very high lake <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> been suggested for some time intervals during the two last glacial periods, as well as during both the Last Interglacial as well as the Holocene. The lowest lake <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> occurred during the last glacial periods.|$|R

5|$|Greater {{cooperation}} between {{federal and state}} agencies on a national <b>level</b> <b>has</b> been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center. Though primarily a collaborative effort between federal agencies to develop a national level fire policy, the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues. Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions. As in the 1988 fires, protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner <b>level</b> <b>has</b> been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be hit (for drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|More boats {{have been}} added, {{including}} the schooner Katherine Ellen which was impounded in 1921 for running guns to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Kennet Canal barge Harriett, and ferrocement barges built in World War II. The last boat was beached in 1965.The ground <b>level</b> <b>has</b> {{built up over}} the years and some of the more recent additions are lying on top of those which had been beached earlier.|$|E
40|$|Sandy levels bearing bicarbonate-sodium waters, having {{hydraulic}} heads sometimes {{higher than}} ground <b>level,</b> <b>have</b> been observed during drillings in the Pliocene-Pleistocene clayey {{formation of the}} Tavoliere area.

40|$|Five <b>levels</b> <b>have</b> been {{recognized}} {{in the history of}} interface research and development. Each of the <b>levels</b> <b>has</b> had its own focus, which has followed the changes in technology and the user base. Consequently, the interface has been moving outwards, further from hardware. We argue that the growing interest in cultural issues in interface design is a part of this general development and foreshadows a new level, which will provide a cultural perspective to interface design...|$|R

5|$|Prevention at the {{population}} <b>level</b> <b>has</b> {{been with the}} universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While {{a certain amount of}} dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism.|$|E
5|$|Sports and {{recreation}} facilities. Social policy in Norway {{both at the}} national and local <b>level</b> <b>has</b> emphasized the connection between athletics at the mass and elite levels, and athletic centers have typically been built both to accommodate spectators, participants, and training. As an example, the Holmenkollen ski jump has been rebuilt several times, the Bislett Stadion was rebuilt in 2004-2005, and virtually every municipality has built year-round facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor <b>level</b> <b>has</b> a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E

The upper <b>level</b> <b>has</b> galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by a carved wood cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} facade, built {{during the}} 16thcentury in the Renaissance Herrera style, is oldest {{part of the}} cathedral and was named after Juan de Herrera, architect of the El Escorial monastery in Spain. While the eastern and western facades are older {{than most of the}} rest of the building, their third <b>level</b> <b>has</b> Solomonic columns which are associated with the Baroque period.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa, led by Captain Price. The first <b>level</b> <b>has</b> {{the player}} {{taking part in}} a sneak attack on German Afrika Korps troops, ending with the destruction of a German supply station. The next <b>level</b> <b>has</b> the player defending a town from overwhelming numbers of Germans sending counter attacks from North, West, South and East; finally achieving victory by destroying much of the German tank force using artillery. This is followed by the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which the player has to fight through several trenches, machine gun nests, 88millimeter guns and finally taking the German field headquarters. The assault on El Dabaa to intercept the remaining Germans in Egypt and destroy several 88millimeter guns soon follows, ending the first British campaign. An addendum to the second set of missions has the player taking on the role of a British tank commander, David Welsh, while engaging enemies in Libya. The first mission of the third campaign in Toujane, Tunisia, has the player immediately under fire, holding a house until they break out and rendezvous with the second squad. They then retake Toujane with reinforcements the next day all before assaulting Matmata. The final British campaign takes place during the Battle for Caen as part of Operation Overlord.|$|E
