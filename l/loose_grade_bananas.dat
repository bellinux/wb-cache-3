40|$|<b>Bananas</b> <b>Grading</b> System (BGS) {{which is}} one of the system using image {{processing}} technique. The purpose of BGS is used to standardize the <b>grading</b> of the <b>banana</b> and distinguish between three differences classes of banana which are unripe,ripe and overripe. This BGS used computer system to analyze and interprets images that correspondent to human eye and mind. This study is taken into account of four types of banana fruits which are ‘Pisang Lemak Manis’,‘Pisang Mas’,‘Pisang Putar’ and ‘Pisang Berangan’. It attempts to form the decision by analysing the skin colour and condition. <b>Bananas</b> <b>Grading</b> System (BGS) is been done manually which brings variation of the results for <b>banana</b> <b>grading.</b> Since the colour is one of the most significant criteria related to fruit identification and fruit quality,it is a good indicator for ripeness. Therefore, fruits grading in present study only considers the colour of the skin of the bananas. The method that is used to develop this BGS is image processing method in term of color histogram of RGB. The color histogram method is evaluating the mean value of red, green and blue in order to classify the banana. In this BGS, fifty sample of banana is tested. From the result,the successful rate of <b>grading</b> the <b>banana</b> is 85 % percent while the error rate is 15 % percent.,based on the objective of this system which is to develop grading system to judge the maturity level and to standardize the <b>banana</b> <b>grading</b> based on maturity level, the objective is successfully achieved the goal. The problem regarding grading system by using Human Visualization System also solved.

40|$|The {{physical}} and chemical compositional changes of Cavendish bananas were investigated according to the ripening stages determined by peel colour as classified in the Banana Ripening Guide. There {{is a need for}} the utilization of second <b>grade</b> <b>bananas</b> that are deemed unsuitable for retail sale, but are still appropriate for human consumption, for the long term sustainability of the banana industry. The optimum stage of ripeness of banana for puree making for food product development was determined through comparisons of the physical, chemical and sensory qualities. Banana pulp samples were analysed for texture, total soluble solids, starch, sugar, total ash, and potassium and magnesium contents at different ripening stages. At stage 5 ripeness, banana pulp had potassium (584 mg/ 100 g), magnesium (58 mg/ 100 g), total sugar (5. 2 g/ 100 g) and starch (1. 8 g/ 100 g) contents. Stage 5 ripened bananas were found to be the most suitable for puree production.

40|$|To {{assess their}} utility for {{profitable}} wastewater bioremediation, banana prawns, Penaeus (Fenneropenaeus) merguiensis (de Man), were stocked at low densities (1 – 5 m- 2) and grown without supplemental feeding in five commercial-prawn-farm settlement ponds (0. 3 to 6. 0 ha). The prawns free-ranged in the variously designed ponds for 160 to 212 days after stocking as PL 15. Survival estimates ranged from 12 % to 60 % with production of 50 – 528 kg ha- 1. Over 1150 kg of marketable product {{was produced in}} the study. Exceptional growth was monitored at one farm where prawns reached an average size of 17 g in 80 days. Nutrients in water flowing into (8 - 40 ML d- 1) {{and out of the}} settlement pond at that farm were assessed twice weekly along with routine water quality measurements. Only small differences in water qualities were detected between waters running into and out of this settlement pond. Total nitrogen levels gradually increased from 1 - 1. 5 mg L- 1 early in the season to over 3 mg L- 1 {{towards the end of the}} season. Total phosphorus levels similarly rose from 0. 1 - 0. 2 mg L- 1 to 0. 3 - 0. 4 mg L- 1 in the middle of the season, but fell to 0. 2 – 0. 3 mg L- 1 towards the end when approximately 12, 000 prawns were harvested with a total weight of 175 kg. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) were detected in the overall acceptability of prawns harvested from each of the 5 settlement ponds in small-scale consumer sensory analyses. The prawns from settlement ponds were rated similarly to banana prawns grown with commercial diets at two other establishments.

From the particle ejection data, the momentum of the individual ballistic sand particles has been calculated; it was found that only 2 % of the water-droplet momentum at impact is transferred to the ballistic sand particles. In addition to the particle tracking, surface profiling of the granular bed postimpact has provided detailed information on its morphology; these data have demonstrated the consistent nature of the craters produced by the impact and suggest that particle agglomerations released from their edges make up about twice the number of particles involved in ballistic ejection.

40|$|Dynamic {{loading of}} embankment, {{foundation}} and pavement structures results in particle breakage of the constituent granular materials, when the stresses imposed on their particles exceed their strength. This paper {{presents the results}} of a number of drained cyclic triaxial tests on <b>loose,</b> uniformly <b>graded</b> samples of Dogs bay carbonate sand. It is observed that particle breakage is dependent on stress level, cyclic stress ratio, and creep and is directly related to volumetric strain. Drained cycling increases volumetric strain and therefore more breakage occurs when larger numbers of cycles are imposed. The increase in particle breakage from one cycle to the next indicates that while particles may not be loaded to their full capacity in a given cycle, they can be crushed in subsequent cycles without any variation in the amplitude of cyclic loading...|$|R

Two types of different cases, stone column and geosynthetic encased stone column were studied at different normal pressures varying from 15 kPa to 75 kPa. Also, the effect of diameter in two cases was considered. A close agreement between the experimental and numerical curves of shear stress - horizontal displacement trend line is observed.

40|$|The {{first quarter}} of 2004 was {{dedicated}} to tree planting activities in two locations in Kentucky. During {{the first year of}} this project there was not available mine land to plant in the Hazard area, so 107 acres were planted in the Martin County mine location. This year 120 acres were planted in the Hazard area to compensate for the prior year and an additional 57 acres were planted on Peabody properties in western Kentucky. Additional sets of special plots were established on each of these areas that contained 4800 seedlings each for carbon sequestration demonstrations. Plantings were also conducted to continue compaction and water quality studies on the newly established areas as well as continual measurements of the first year's plantings. Total plantings on this project now amount to 357 acres containing 245, 960 seedlings. During the second quarter of this year monitoring systems were established for all the new research areas. Weather data pertinent to the research as well as hydrology and water quality monitoring continues to be conducted on all areas. Studies established to assess specific questions pertaining to carbon flux and the invasion of the vegetation by small mammals are being quantified. Experimental practices initiated with this research project will eventually allow for the planting on long steep slopes with <b>loose</b> <b>grading</b> systems and allow mountain top removal areas to be constructed with loose spoil with no grading of the final layers of rooting material when establishing trees for the final land use designation. Monitoring systems have been installed to measure treatment effects on both above and below ground carbon and nitrogen pools in the planting areas. Soil and tissue samples were collected from both years planting and analyses were conducted in the laboratory. Examination of decomposition and heterotropic respiration on carbon cycling in the reforestation plots continued during the reporting period. Entire planted trees were extracted from the study area to evaluate carbon accumulation as a function of time on the mine sites. These trees were extracted and separated into the following components: foliage, stems, branches, and roots. Each component was evaluated to determine the contribution of each to the total sequestration value. The fourth quarter of the year was devoted to analyzing the first two years tree planting activities and the evaluation of the results. These analyses included the species success at each of the sites and quantifying the data for future year determination of research levels. Additional detailed studies have been planned to further quantify total carbon storage accumulation on the study areas. At least 124 acres of new plantings will be established in 2005 to bring the total to 500 acres or more in the study area across the state of Kentucky...|$|R
