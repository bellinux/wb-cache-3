40|$|Recently is a "good" {{discussion}} about the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> (<b>wages).</b> By the example of agriculture we {{argue that there is}} no straightforward relations between the raise in productivity and wages. The number of labour work and the total costs of labour in agriculture decreased since 1989. The gross agricultural product (GAP) calculated by the index of agricultural prices (IAP) presents the change in GAP only, not the real value of GAP in CPI. Thus, the productivity per worker and per one SKK of labour costs increased steeply (200  % or 300 %). However, if the calculation of GAP is done by CPI, than the real GAP of 1996 decreased to one third of 1989 GAP. Thus the productivity decreased to 70 % in 1991 - 1992, but recently raised to the quality of 1989. On the other hand, the productivity of labour costs increased to 164 % respecitvely 174 % in comparison to 1989. More-over, the other costs of production decreased to 32 % that of 1989. The productivity of such costs has not changed largely. After decreasing till 1993 it raised to 115 % that of 1989. Thus the productivity of other costs (capital) is not {{of the quality of the}} labour cost. Therefore it can be argued, that the problem of agriculture are prices of agricultural commodities, responding to the power on the market. productivity, real wages, gross agricultural production, other costs, comparative advantages...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the Korean dairy {{industry}} has been affected by considerable reductions in non-tariff barriers {{as a result of}} trade liberalisation. The dairy marketing system in particular has had many regulations and barriers removed. The question arises as to the effect of trade liberalisation and reductions in protection on imported dairy product marketing margins in Korea. This study determined imported dairy product marketing margins in Korea and assessed how they had changed over the past 15 years. The most important factors responsible for the trends and fluctuations observed in those margins were identified and estimated. An attempt at a product-focused method was made on cheese and skim milk powder (SMP), which are generally representative of dairy products as a whole. Descriptive and econometric methods were both used to identify the most important determinants of the aggregate cost of processing and distributing imported dairy products. A cheese (MMCHE) model and a SMP (MMSMP) model were developed and estimated. The two models estimated cheese and SMP marketing margins respectively as functions of exchange rates, trade liberalisation, wage rates and transportation costs. Both models were estimated using standard and stepwise regressions. Results obtained from this analysis suggest that changes in earnings (wages) were the strongest influence on imported dairy product marketing margins during the past 15 years. However, these results cannot explain the fall in cheese and SMP marketing margins after 1995 as this coincided with a rise in wage rates. The increase in CIF (Cost of Insurance and Freight) prices for these products was largely responsible for the smaller margins. Because exchange rates are a large element of CIF price, it is believed that marketing margins were closely associated with the value of the exchange rate. Conclusions are based on descriptive indicators and an econometric analysis that examined the relationships between economic factors and marketing margins. The impact of trade liberalisation on imported dairy product marketing margins was mixed with other economic factors. This study concludes that trade liberalisation has not in general been associated with lower imported dairy product marketing margins in Korea. <b>Labour</b> <b>costs</b> (<b>wages)</b> appear to have been the most important influence on those margins during the period 1985 - 98...|$|E

40|$|Measures {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} the {{tax burden on labour}} have been advocated to alleviate the EU unemployment problem. Most of the analyses document a relationship between the unemployment rate and the tax burden on labour. Hence, {{it is not possible to}} discern whether the effect on unemployment derives from labour demand, labour supply or through the wage formation mechanism. Moreover, the empirical analyses are usually static, and may be indicative of the steady-state determinants of the unemployment rate and do not reveal the features of the adjustment process. This paper studies the relationship between labour taxes and <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> by modelling the wage formation mechanism in a dynamic context. We test if the composition of labour taxes affects <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in the short- and in the long-run and whether highly centralised bargaining systems have better employment performance than decentralised ones. We apply static and dynamic panel data techniques to a panel of EU countries. Our findings suggest that there is probably some wage resistance in the short-term but not in the long-term, although the transition to the long-term can be very long and therefore the short- term impact and the dynamics of adjustment can be long-lasting.

Lane and Perotti (1998) show that a rise in government wage consumption reduces traded sector output via a rise in private sector wages, which would lead to a deterioration in the current account, if there exist adjustment costs that prevent consumption and investment of traded goods from falling rapidly. 2 Lane and Perotti (2003) find further evidence that higher government wage spending impacts on the supply side by raising the real product wage, thereby depressing profitability. 3 To the extent that a rise in public compensations is financed with resources drawn from the private sector that may take the form of increased labour taxes, the literature on the impact of labour taxes on private sector costs is equally relevant. So, for example, Alesina and Perotti (1997) look specifically at the effects of changes in labour taxes on unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and find that in a bargaining model higher labour taxes increase unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> unless <b>wage</b> negotiations are conducted by a monopoly union that is large enough to internalise the consequences of higher output prices on real consumption and employment.|$|R

Austria's ranking in terms of unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> changed several times over the course of the 1990 s.

40|$|The paper {{challenges}} the present rhetoric used by competition {{policy makers and}} enforcers when advancing economic efficiency {{based on the assumption}} that promoting efficiency will help inefficient market players to leave the market. However, an exit of larger or smaller businesses is always associated with their downsizing or restructuring and, as a result, with job losses.

Revisiting the classical price and wage efficiency theoretic assumptions, the paper {{challenges the}} use of the efficiency benchmark at micro- (industrial organization) and macroeconomic levels.

Finally, the paper seeks to challenge the assumption that ‘new jobs replace old jobs’ following a successful merger.

40|$|An {{explanation}} of inflation {{that focuses on}} the <b>costs</b> of production, <b>wages</b> (or unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs)</b> plays a central role. In South Africa, the recent change to an inflation-targeting monetary policy framework and the relative strong role of trade unions has increased the need to understand and quantify the interaction between inflation and wages. The purpose of the working paper is to investigate this relationship empirically, on both the aggregate and sectoral levels, using multivariate co-integration techniques.

40|$|In an {{international}} hierarchy of <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> Austria ranks 11 th, after Germany, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries, Japan, the U. S. and the Netherlands. The labour factor is most expensive in Germany. At ATS 340 per hour of labour, German manufacturers {{pay more than}} a quarter over the Austrian rate. For Austrian manufacturers, a worker's hour costs ATS 270. 40 in 2000, or 2. 75 percent more than the EU average. Non-wage <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in manufacturing were 90. 2 percent in 2000, a drop of 0. 8 percentage points against 1999, due to lower severance payments. For the Austrian economy, its international position with regard to its unit <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> fluctuated throughout the 1990 s. In {{the first half of the}} last decade, industries in Austria found their situation deteriorating substantially, fuelled by rocketing wage inflation and an appreciation of the schilling in the wake of the EMS crisis, whereas in the second half relative unit <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> came down by 2. 7 percent p. a. compared to the average of Austria's trading partners and calculated in a single currency, the consequence of lower wage inflation, continuously high productivity growth (+ 5. 3 percent p. a.) and a better currency standing. Altogether, the relative unit <b>wage</b> <b>cost</b> position for Austrian manufacturers improved by well over 10 percent in the 1990 s. In 2000, unit <b>wage</b> <b>costs</b> declined by 6. 0 percent, considering that the hourly wage rate went up by 1. 9 percent and hourly productivity grew by 8. 4 percent. Supported by the strong recovery of the yen and dollar, Austria's international unit <b>labour</b> <b>cost</b> ranking improved by 6. 5 percent over the average of its trading partners and by well over 4. 5 percent over the EU average.

An analyse provide to affirmation {{that there was}} quite differential between branches o f economy. The biggest costs are in mining industry. The biggest part of <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> is personal earnings. It is 75 percent of total costs. In comparison with European average <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> in Poland are low but specific <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> (calculate as relation between <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>labour</b> productivity) are similar to average.
