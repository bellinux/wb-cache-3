5|$|On July 1, 2014, Malhotra {{signed as}} a free agent to a one-year deal with the Montreal Canadiens. In the 2014–15 season, Malhotra was {{primarily}} used as the Canadiens fourth <b>line</b> <b>center</b> and face-off specialist. On February 28, 2015, Malhotra scored his first and only goal with Montreal in his 53rd appearance in a 4-0 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. Malhotra completed the season registering only 4 points in 58 contests.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. In the draft, Columbus {{selected}} two players who were projected to go higher in the draft. Boone Jenner, a projected second <b>line</b> <b>center,</b> {{was expected to be}} a first-round selection, but slipped to the second round. Seth Ambroz, a projected third line enforcer, had some believing he would be taken in the second round prior to falling to the fifth. They filled out the other the remainder of their draft with players considered to have a high upside, but in need of time to develop their game. Their final selection, goaltender Anton Forsberg, was taken following the recommendation of Goaltender Coach Ian Clark. Jenner (Canada), third round pick T. J. Tynan (United States), and Forsberg (Sweden) all played for their national teams at the 2012 World Junior Championship.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{they were}} able to {{reinforce}} the team with first class talent. Several successful acquisitions were signed, most memorably Otakar Janecky, who manned the first <b>line</b> <b>center</b> for several seasons, becoming the club's all-time best point scorer; Petri Varis, who became the club's best goal scorer of the 1990s; and forward Antti Törmänen. Together with the above-mentioned junior champions they formed a core of a dynasty of thriving times: Jokerit won Finnish championship in 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1997, and European Cup in 1995 and 1996, plus Finnish silver once and European bronze once.|$|E

25|$|The drama {{surrounding}} Scott Niedermayer {{finally brought}} positive {{news for the}} Ducks, as Burke announced his return on December 5. December 14 marked an important event in Ducks history, as Burke dealt first <b>line</b> <b>center</b> Andy McDonald to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for Doug Weight, Michal Birner and a seventh-round draft pick {{in an attempt to}} clear salary cap space for Niedermayer, whereupon on December 16 Niedermayer made his return to the Ducks' lineup. The team immediately improved and reentered the playoff and Pacific Division pictures. For the 2008 All-Star Game, Ryan Getzlaf and Chris Pronger were selected to participate. Later, Corey Perry and Scott Niedermayer were named as injury replacements, setting a Ducks franchise record for players representing the team at an All-Star Game, with four.|$|E
500|$|Opinion of {{the deal}} shifted {{considerably}} the following season as Conroy established himself as the Flames' first <b>line</b> <b>center</b> alongside Jarome Iginla. The pair developed good chemistry and became strong friends. Conroy scored career highs with 28 goals and 75 points, while Iginla reached the 50-goal plateau {{for the first time}} and led the NHL in scoring. [...] Iginla credited Conroy for making his breakout season possible. Additionally, Conroy was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy for a second time. The Flames named him a co-captain along with Bob Boughner late in the 2001–02 season, and he held the role full-time in 2002–03.|$|E
500|$|In {{their first}} game of April, Vancouver {{attempted}} to improve its offensive production by re-calling their 2011 first round draft choice, Nicklas Jensen, and forward Bill Sweatt. The recalls failed to produce, however, as the Canucks lost to the San Jose Sharks 3–2. The following day, the Canucks acquired centre Derek Roy from the Dallas Stars for Kevin Connauton and a second-round draft pick. The trade {{was believed to be}} an attempt to fill a hole at centre while Kesler was out with an injury. The expectation was that Roy would become the team's third <b>line</b> <b>center</b> once Kesler returned to the line-up, though the possibility of the two playing together was proposed. [...] At the NHL trade deadline, Vancouver failed to trade Luongo. They were reportedly close to a deal with the Toronto Maple Leafs, which eventually fell through. In response to finding out {{that he would not be}} traded, Luongo stated, [...] "My contract sucks — that's what's the problem," [...] and would [...] "scrap it if I could now." [...] The Canucks felt they needed more size and grit in their line-up and attempted to add some though trades. However, they missed out on acquiring Ryane Clowe and Raffi Torres. Clowe chose to waive his no-trade clause to go to the New York Rangers so he could play in the Eastern Conference. The Coyotes traded Torres to the Sharks, as they considered San Jose's third-round pick more attractive than the Canucks' third-rounder.|$|E

Goring's arrival {{is often called}} the [...] "final piece of the puzzle": a strong two-way player, his presence on the second line ensured that opponents {{would no longer be}} able to focus their defensive efforts on the Islanders' first line of Bossy, Trottier and Clark Gillies. Contributions from new teammates, such as wingers Duane Sutter and Anders Kallur and stay-at-home defensemen Dave Langevin, Gord Lane, and Ken Morrow (the latter fresh off a gold medal win at the 1980 Olympics), also figured prominently in the Islanders' playoff success.|$|E
2500|$|On April 9, 2002 on the Hanover-Berlin {{high-speed}} rail line a fault in the LZB <b>line</b> <b>center</b> computer brought four LZB controlled trains {{to a stop}} with two trains in each line direction being halted in the same signalling block (Teilblockmodus - divided block control).

The drivers of the following trains did not proceed however - one driver saw the train {{in front of him}} and the other driver double-checked with the operations center which had warned him prior to departure, so two possible collisions were averted. As a consequence of this incident, the two mainline train operators (DB Cargo and DB Passenger Transport) issued an instruction to their drivers to be especially cautious during periods of LZB outage when the system is running in divided block mode. The cause was a software error.|$|E
