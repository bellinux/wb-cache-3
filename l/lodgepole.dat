5|$|The {{predominant}} tree in Yellowstone, the <b>lodgepole</b> pine, fared poorly from the fires, except {{in areas where}} the heat and flames were very mild. The <b>lodgepole</b> pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of <b>lodgepole</b> pine after 5years. However, the rate of <b>lodgepole</b> regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead <b>lodgepole</b> killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone {{forests are}} {{dominated}} by the <b>lodgepole</b> pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100years as a forest matures. In Yellowstone, a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the <b>lodgepole</b> pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established. The <b>lodgepole</b> pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings. Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur, they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains. By the 1980s much of the <b>lodgepole</b> pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250years old and approaching {{the end of their}} lifecycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle {{is a native}} insect species that is known to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous <b>lodgepole</b> pines and fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and the beetle wiped out areas of <b>lodgepole</b> pine in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above the tree line, in the alpine ecoregion. The tree line in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. <b>Lodgepole</b> pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of <b>lodgepole</b> pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and <b>lodgepole</b> pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (wapiti), bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E
5|$|Other pest {{include the}} coconut hispine beetle, Brontispa longissima, which feeds on young leaves, {{seedlings}} and mature coconut trees, causing serious economic {{damage in the}} Philippines. The mountain pine beetle is a destructive pest of mature or weakened <b>lodgepole</b> pine, sometimes affecting large areas of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Suillus brevipes is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, and {{it develops}} a close symbiotic {{association with the}} roots of various tree species, especially pine. The underground mycelia form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the cortical cells of the root, forming ectomycorrhizae. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying carbohydrates created by photosynthesis. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially <b>lodgepole</b> and ponderosa pine. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus {{has been shown to}} form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, <b>lodgepole,</b> loblolly, eastern white, patula, pond, radiata, and red pines. In vitro mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include Pacific madrone, bearberry, western larch, Sitka spruce, and coast Douglas-fir. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the heavy metals cadmium (350ppm), lead (200ppm), and nickel (20ppm).|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense <b>lodgepole</b> pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, <b>lodgepole</b> becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, <b>lodgepole</b> pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. <b>Lodgepole</b> Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for <b>lodgepole</b> pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated from the heat by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, <b>lodgepole</b> pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from west to east. The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with <b>lodgepole</b> pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|The alpine biome of {{the pass}} extends below it {{on either side}} to an {{elevation}} of approximately , or about the altitude of the Linkins Lake trailhead on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork. Below it is a subalpine zone where <b>lodgepole</b> pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir and aspen dominate the forest. A few patches of those trees persist above that elevation, but they are mostly stunted krummholz.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit of}} Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, {{featuring}} {{plants such as}} Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens). Also noted are Carex atrata var. pullata, Salix desertorum, Platanthera hyperborea, Thalictrum fendleri, Aquilegia canadensis, Chenopodium album, Gentiana detonsa var. hallii, and Bigelovia parryi. Below treeline the mountain is heavily forested, with the lower slopes covered {{with a mixture of}} <b>lodgepole</b> pine, spruce, aspen and fir.|$|E
5|$|Amanita gemmata is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of compatible host plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of A.gemmata with Manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.) and <b>Lodgepole</b> Pine (Pinus contorta), and Nieto and Carbone with Maritime Pine (Pinus pinaster) in Spain. The fungus favours sandy and slightly acidic soils, and is often found in association with Norway Spruce (Picea abies). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in coniferous and mixed forests, especially along paths and roads.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include <b>lodgepole</b> pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline is reached. The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to higher}} {{elevation}} and precipitation, {{the ecology of}} the Black Hills differs significantly from that of the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by coniferous needleleaf evergreens: various types of pines—including ponderosa (covering , or 80% of the Black Hills forest), <b>lodgepole,</b> white, and timber—as well as western red cedar and spruces. Western yellow ponderosa is the most important lumber tree in the area. The South Dakota state tree is the Black Hills spruce. The Red Valley is home to blue-joint and bluegrasses, and wild plum, Juneberry, and chokecherry shrubs grow in the Hills. Violets, thistles, and horse mint are prevalent herbs. Vines grow widely: the woodbine, bittersweet, and wild grape, which is the pattern for Black Hills gold jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of species}} {{of animals and}} plants {{characterize}} the Santa Ana River's diversity of climates and vegetation zones. There are over ten of these vegetation zones in the watershed—including the sparsely vegetated alpine and subalpine zones in the mountains, mid-elevation forests of pine, <b>lodgepole</b> and oak, chaparral, coastal sage scrub, the increasingly rare riparian forest and marshes along the river bed, lined with trees and rushes, and the thinly vegetated coastal areas virtually flush with sea level. The watershed supports up to 200 bird species, fifty mammal species, 13 reptile species, 7 amphibian species, and 15 fish species, including steelhead trout.|$|E
5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a <b>lodgepole</b> pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E
5|$|The Red {{fire started}} near Lewis Lake on July 1 {{and like the}} Shoshone fire, {{advanced}} little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19 and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In {{the midst of a}} large <b>lodgepole</b> pine forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and some of the campground complex were destroyed. After the Red and Shoshone fires combined, they were referred to as the Shoshone fire, since it was much larger.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the <b>lodgepole</b> pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is {{an important}} one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the <b>Lodgepole</b> Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill <b>Lodgepole</b> Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Banff National Park has a subarctic climate {{with three}} ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The forests {{are dominated by}} <b>Lodgepole</b> pine at lower elevations and Engelmann spruce in higher ones below the treeline, above which is primarily rocks and ice. Mammal species such as the grizzly, cougar, wolverine, elk, bighorn sheep and moose are found, along with hundreds of bird species. Reptiles and amphibians are also found but {{only a limited number}} of species have been recorded. The mountains are formed from sedimentary rocks which were pushed east over newer rock strata, between 80 and 55million years ago. Over the past few million years, glaciers have at times covered most of the park, but today are found only on the mountain slopes though they include the Columbia Icefield, the largest uninterrupted glacial mass in the Rockies. Erosion from water and ice have carved the mountains into their current shapes.|$|E
5|$|Over 1,700 {{species of}} trees and other {{vascular}} plants are native to the park. Another 170 species {{are considered to be}} exotic species and are non-native. Of the eight conifer tree species documented, <b>Lodgepole</b> Pine forests cover 80% of the total forested areas. Other conifers, such as Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Whitebark Pine, are found in scattered groves throughout the park. As of 2007, the whitebark pine is threatened by a fungus known as white pine blister rust; however, this is mostly confined to forests well to the north and west. In Yellowstone, about seven percent of the whitebark pine species have been impacted with the fungus, compared to nearly complete infestations in northwestern Montana. Quaking Aspen and willows are the most common species of deciduous trees. The aspen forests have declined significantly since the early 20th century, but scientists at Oregon State University attribute recent recovery of the aspen to the reintroduction of wolves which has changed the grazing habits of local elk.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in North America, and is particularly common in the Pacific Northwest; its range extends north to Alaska and east to North Carolina. In the Puget Sound area of the U.S. state of Washington, it is found in association with Douglas-fir, fir, and hemlock. Along the Oregon Coast it has been collected under <b>lodgepole</b> pine. In addition to North America, the mushroom is widespread in Europe, and its presence has been documented in Italy, Germany, and Scotland. The species is common in the latter location, but becoming increasingly rare in several European countries, such as Norway, The Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. Increased pollution in central Europe has been suggested as one possible factor in the mushroom's decline there. Reports from Iran in 2008 and Korea in 2010 were the first outside Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red {{squirrels}} and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the <b>lodgepole</b> pine. The squirrels get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or <b>lodgepole</b> pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, <b>lodgepole</b> pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
25|$|Mountain pine beetles inhabit ponderosa, whitebark, <b>lodgepole,</b> Scotch, jack pine, and limber pine trees. Normally, these insects play an {{important}} role in the life of a forest, attacking old or weakened trees, and speeding development of a younger forest. However, unusually hot, dry summers and mild winters throughout the region during the last few years, along with forests filled with mature <b>lodgepole</b> pine, have led to an unprecedented epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Trees of San Diego–Tijuana {{included}} chamise, scrub oak, manzanita, live oak, <b>lodgepole</b> pine, {{black oak}} and closed-cone pine forests. Lowland shrubs included California sagebrush, black sage, white sage, California buckwheat, {{as well as}} cacti and succulents.|$|E
25|$|US385 enters Nebraska on the Colorado {{state line}} {{northwest}} of Julesburg, Colorado. Traveling {{to the northwest}} through agricultural fields and alongside <b>Lodgepole</b> Creek, the highway passes beneath I-80 just before it enters the small city of Chappell. The highway has a connection to I-80 south of town via Link 25A. Here, the highway meets up with US30, the Lincoln Highway, running concurrently with it for about 25 miles to the northwest passing through <b>Lodgepole</b> before turning west and passing through the small communities of Sunol and Colton. At the highway approaches Sidney, US385 breaks off from US30 and turns north along {{the east side of}} Sidney.|$|E
25|$|In western North America, {{the current}} {{outbreak}} of the mountain pine beetle and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas of <b>lodgepole</b> pine forest, including more than 16 million of the 55 million hectares of forest in British Columbia. The current outbreak in the Rocky Mountain National Park began in 1996 and has caused the destruction of {{millions of acres of}} ponderosa and <b>lodgepole</b> pine trees. According to an annual assessment by the state's forest service, 264,000 acres of trees in Colorado were infested by the mountain pine beetle at the beginning of 2013. This was much smaller than the 1.15 million acres that were affected in 2008 because the beetle has already killed off most of the vulnerable trees (Ward).|$|E
25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and <b>lodgepole</b> pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and <b>lodgepole</b> pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and <b>lodgepole</b> pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} larger {{supplies}} {{of natural gas}} to meet expanding markets created {{a need for more}} gas processing facilities. Industry responded by developing new fields in the rural west. Occasionally this led to tragedy, {{as in the case of}} the second of Amoco Canada's <b>Lodgepole</b> blowouts.|$|E
25|$|Campgrounds in {{the park}} include three in the foothills area: Potwisha (42 sites), Buckeye Flat (28 sites), and South Fork (10 sites). Four campgrounds are at higher, conifer-dominated elevations, ranging from : Atwell Mill (21 sites), Cold Springs (40 sites), <b>Lodgepole</b> (214 sites), and Dorst Creek (204 sites).|$|E
25|$|Above the mixed-conifer {{forest is}} the major {{community}} of the Red Fir forest. Between elevations of 6,500 and 8,000 feet, Red Fir, Western White Pine, Mountain Hemlock, and <b>Lodgepole</b> Pine dominate a community less diverse than the mixed-conifer forest. Common plants include satin lupine, woolly mule's-ears and pinemat manzanita.|$|E
25|$|Tokopah Falls The {{trail to}} Tokopah Falls starts {{just beyond the}} Marble Fork Bridge in <b>Lodgepole</b> Campground. It is an easy 1.7 mile (one way) walk along the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River to the {{impressive}} granite cliffs and waterfall of Tokopah Canyon. Tokopah Falls is 1,200 feet (365.8 meters) high, and is most impressive in early summer.|$|E
