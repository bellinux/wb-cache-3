25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} {{current transformer}} which surrounds (but is not electrically connected to) the live and neutral conductors.

25|$|The world’s first high-sensitivity {{earth leakage}} {{protection}} system (i.e. a system capable of protecting {{people from the}} hazards of direct contact between a <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> and earth), was a second-harmonic magnetic amplifier core-balance system, known as the magamp, developed in South Africa by Henri Rubin. Electrical hazards were of great concern in South African gold mines, and Rubin, an engineer at the company C.J. Fuchs Electrical Industries of Alberton Johannesburg, initially developed a cold-cathode system in 1955 which operated at 525 V and had a tripping sensitivity of 250 mA. Prior to this, core balance earth leakage protection systems operated at sensitivities of about 10 A.|$|E

25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> stays connected, a dangerous condition arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{supplying}} {{a branch}} circuit {{with more than}} one <b>live</b> <b>conductor,</b> each <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> must be protected by a breaker pole. To ensure that all live conductors are interrupted when any pole trips, a [...] "common trip" [...] breaker must be used. These may either contain two or three tripping mechanisms within one case, or for small breakers, may externally tie the poles together via their operating handles. Two-pole common trip breakers are common on 120/240-volt systems where 240 volt loads (including major appliances or further distribution boards) span the two live wires. Three-pole common trip breakers are typically used to supply three-phase electric power to large motors or further distribution boards.|$|E
2500|$|RCDs operate by {{measuring}} the current balance between two conductors using a differential current transformer. [...] This measures the difference between current flowing through the <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> and that returning through the neutral conductor. [...] If these do not sum to zero, there is a leakage of current to somewhere else (to earth/ground or to another circuit), and the device will open its contacts. Operation {{does not require a}} fault current to return through the earth wire in the installation; the trip will operate just as well if the return path is through plumbing, contact with the ground or any other current path. Automatic disconnection and a measure of shock protection is therefore still provided even if the earth wiring of the installation is damaged or incomplete.|$|E

50|$|Hot sticks {{are used}} in live line work by having the worker remain at a {{specified}} distance from the live parts and carry out the work {{by means of an}} insulating stick. Tools can be attached to the stick, allowing work to be performed with the worker himself safely away from the <b>live</b> <b>conductors.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} connections where voltage or current {{is sufficient to}} cause injury, the part permanently connected to the power source is invariably female, with concealed contacts, to prevent inadvertent touching of <b>live</b> <b>conductors.</b> A male plug, with fully exposed protruding contacts, is installed on the cord of (or directly onto) the device receiving the power.|$|R

50|$|When {{the device}} is placed near a <b>live</b> <b>conductor,</b> a {{capacitive}} voltage divider is established, comprising the parasitic capacitance between the conductor and the sensor, and between the sensor to ground (through the user's body).

For transient effect analysis two elementary implicit methods are used (Finite-Difference Time-Domain method and Wendroff method).

Results are presented in form of voltage and current distribution along a multiconductor transmission line. Typical situations are solved as an illustration of these methods. ...|$|R

50|$|A Wireless {{powerline}} sensor {{hangs from}} an {{overhead power line}} and sends measurements to a data collection system. Because the sensor does not contact anything but a single <b>live</b> <b>conductor,</b> no high-voltage isolation is needed. The sensor, installed simply by clamping it around a conductor, powers itself from energy scavenged from electrical or magnetic fields surrounding the conductor being measured. Overhead power line monitoring helps distribution system operators provide reliable service at optimized cost.|$|E

2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two <b>live</b> <b>conductors,</b> is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the <b>live</b> <b>conductors</b> becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|R

50|$|Many {{maintenance}} workers carry NCVD pens or AC voltage detectors {{in their}} tool belts. This portable device allows workers to quickly check electrical conductors for live voltage without actually touching the bare wire. The NCVD can sense voltage when positioned {{close to the}} <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> without making a hard-wired electrical connection. A voltage portal is used to assist workers in creating an electrically safe work condition {{as part of a}} lockout-tagout procedure before beginning work on electrical or mechanical equipment.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} X10 is {{excessive}} attenuation of signals {{between the two}} live conductors in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other <b>live</b> <b>conductor.</b> Often, there's simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer leg wire to the other; this failure may {{come and go as}} large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an active repeater device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with a coupling device. A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.|$|E
5000|$|It is not {{a closed}} loop, because the second {{terminal}} is passed back {{through the center of}} the toroid core (commonly a plastic or rubber tube) and connected along the first terminal. This allows the coil to be open-ended and flexible, allowing it to be wrapped around a <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> without disturbing it. However, positioning of the measured conductor is important in that case: It has been shown that, with flexible sensors, the effect of the position on the accuracy ranges from 1 to 3%. Another technique uses two rigid winding halves with a precise locking mechanism.|$|E

5000|$|For {{very high}} {{currents}} in electrical apparatus, and for high currents distributed through a building, bus bars can be used. (The term [...] "bus" [...] is a contraction of the Latin omnibus - meaning [...] "for all".) Each <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> {{of such a}} system is a rigid piece of copper or aluminium, usually in flat bars (but sometimes as tubing or other shapes). Open bus bars are never used in publicly accessible areas, although they are used in manufacturing plants and power company switch yards to gain the benefit of air cooling. A variation is to use heavy cables, especially where it is desirable to transpose or [...] "roll" [...] phases.|$|E
50|$|A {{composite}} monitor is any analog {{video display}} that receives input {{in the form}} of an analog composite video signal to a defined specification. A composite video signal encodes all information on a single conductor; a composite cable has a single <b>live</b> <b>conductor</b> plus earth. Other equipment with display functionality includes monitors with more advanced interfaces and connectors giving a better picture, including analog VGA, and digital DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort; and television (TV) receivers which are self-contained, receiving and displaying video RF broadcasts received with an internal tuner. Video monitors are used for displaying computer output, closed-circuit television (e.g. security cameras) and other applications requiring a two-dimensional monochrome or colour image.|$|E
