The models tested for each category are mentioned in Table  1. The details regarding position of proving ring, <b>loading</b> <b>jack,</b> and dial gauge are highlighted in Figs.  2 and 3. ‘The other parameters such as dimensions and location of stiffeners, and the depth of the girder were kept constant to study the behaviour of web post exclusively. For all beams, overall depth was maintained at 100  mm with nominal top and bottom flange width of 55  mm and the corresponding nominal thickness of flange 5  mm and that of web is 4.7  mm. Transverse stiffeners were made of flat plates  25  mm wide and 5  mm nominal thickness. In the fifth model, the stiffeners were not provided, whereas in remaining all specimens the transverse stiffeners were provided at locations where concentrated forces are likely to occur, i.e. at centre of span and at supports, to prevent any modes of failure not required in the studies. All beams tested during experimental and numerical analysis have no lateral restrain, i.e. laterally unrestrained beams.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of block shear of coped beams with a welded clip angle connection is presented in this paper. Twelve full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted. The test parameters included the web block aspect ratio (height to width ratio of the web block connected to the clip angle) and the connection rotational stiffness. Out of the 12 test specimens, eight test specimens failed in block shear of the connection, namely, tensile fracture of the block width (the web underneath the clip angle) and shear yielding of the block height (the web along the vertical side of the clip angle). Two test specimens failed by local web buckling at the cope, one test specimen failed in the welds and the remaining one did not fail due to the limited capacity of the <b>loading</b> <b>jack.</b> The test results showed that in general the block shear capacity of the test specimens increased with increasing web block aspect ratio and increasing connection rotational stiffness. The current design specifications (AISC-LRFD, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, CAN/CSA-S 16 - 01, BS EN 1993 - 1 - 8 - 2005, BS 5950 - 1 : 2000, and AIJ- 1990) provide conservative estimates of the block shear capacity of the test specimens except for the specimen that had the smallest connection rotational stiffness.

40|$|The Fully Encapsulated Resin Bolt (FERB) {{is widely}} {{utilised}} for strata control and ground support in civil and mining applications worldwide, with approximately 6 million installed per annum by the Australian coal mining industry. Independent studies {{have concluded that}} 30 - 35 % of these rockbolts, which represents an annual expenditure of $ 40 million, are ineffective. The anchorage and failure mechanisms of FERB are yet to be quantified, and support systems are designed primarily from empirical rather than scientific methods. There are no standardised methods of assessing FERB components, installation techniques and support behaviour. The majority of research into FERB support systems remains commercial intellectual property, with little information released into the public domain. This thesis investigated several variables of FERB support systems, and also examined differences between field and laboratory pull-out test load distributions. This research was conducted in two phases, with Phase 1 seeking standardised methodology and repeatability in results, while Phase 2 further refined Phase 1 methods and extended the range of tests. The results in both phases were encouraging, with reasonable repeatability attained in all testing series. The findings included: 	Annulus Thickness: There was little change in load capacity with small annulus thickness, however the maximum peak load (MPL) significantly reduced once annulus thickness exceeded 4 mm. 	Resin Installation Spin Time: Underspinning of cartridge resin {{was found to have}} an insignificant effect on rockbolt load/deformation characteristics. Overspinning, however, led to a dramatic reduction in anchorage performance with a lessening in both MPL and stiffness 	Rockbolt Load Transfer: The magnitude of an applied load reduced to zero {{along the length of the}} rockbolt, being greatest nearest the rock free surface (the point of load application). An exponential reduction was found when tested in the manner of laboratory tests, with the <b>loading</b> <b>jack</b> reacting against the free surface. This reduction was linear when the load was applied as in the field, with no load placed on the free surface This basic investigation into FERB support systems has validated many empirical understandings of rockbolts, while highlighting the need for further testing into several key areas...|$|E

40|$|The {{reported}} work {{constituted the}} third phase of a programme of research into the performance of concrete pipes during installation by the pipe-jacked tunnelling technique. This third stage was {{a continuation of the}} on-site monitoring of full-scale pipe jacks during construction. Four schemes were monitored in different ground conditions: London clay, dense fine sand below the water table, stiff glacial till and soft alluvial clay. Pipe sizes ranged from 1000 mm to 1800 mm internal diameter and excavation methods included hand tools, slurry machines and an open face tunnel boring machine. The main objective was to collect information on <b>jacking</b> <b>loads</b> and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete jacking pipe that could be inserted anywhere in the pipe string. <b>Jacking</b> <b>loads</b> and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of <b>jacking</b> <b>load</b> build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between <b>jacking</b> <b>loads,</b> pipeline misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex. Ground movement measurements compared to well established empirical predictive methods show that short-term displacements are related to ground losses caused by closure of the overbreak void between shield and pipe...|$|R

This dissertation reports on laboratory research into the performance of reinforced concrete pipes, assessment of pipe joints {{and the use of}} joint packing materials. The research has addressed specific problems which the tunnelling fraternity have raised. Model pipes have been constructed at scales of 1 : 6 and 1 : 10. 5 using reinforced microconcrete and they have been tested in either a sand filled chamber or between supporting yokes. Current British Standard tests have been used as a control on the quality of pipe manufacture. Data have been recorded of changes in soil pressures, pipe geometry and strains induced in the pipes. The tests have investigated deformation of pipes, deflection angles between consecutive pipes, distribution of stress concentrations and the effects of the use of joint packing materials on allowable <b>jacking</b> <b>loads</b> and induced stress magnitudes in the pipes. A review of current pipejacking practice is presented and recommendations for the control and supervision of pipejacking operations are made. The conclusions include recommendations for fieldwork monitoring and implications of this stage of the research to industry. Recommendations are made for maximum installation <b>jacking</b> <b>loads</b> for any given deflection angle between pipes. The prediction of friction angles at the pipe soil interface have been assessed at different soil stress levels and new recommendations are made. The effects of cyclic loading on the pipejacking system and transfer from <b>jacking</b> <b>load</b> to ground loading once the pipes are installed are presented. The criteria used in the selection of a recommended joint packing material for use in jacking operations have been included.

40|$|The three D-Zero cryostats (2 EC and 1 CC) will rest {{on three}} {{carriages}} {{which in turn}} ride {{on a set of}} hardened ways in the center beam. A pair of Tychoway rollers will be fitted to each of the four corners of the three carriages to provide the rolling support. In the final design, the two EC cryostats will be able to roll out and away from the CC cryostat in order to provide access to the space between each cryostat for maintenance and repairs. The cryostat will be frequently accessed, about once a month. during a collider run. The heaviest cryostat weighs about 360 tons. The large roller weight in one position for such a long period of time, created a concern about the rollers dimpling the hardened ways or even suffering permanent deformations themselves. There is also the possibility that the vertical position of the cryostat will need to be adjusted to align it with the beam line or that the carriage and cryostat will have to be lifted to remove and service the rollers. A device or system was needed to (1) relieve the weight of the cryostats from the rollers and the hardened ways, and (2) minimally adjust the vertical position of the cryostats, if necessary, and/or service the rollers. Compact hydraulic jacks seemed to be the answer. The first and foremost criteria was capacity. It was desired that the jacks be rated to twice the actual <b>load.</b> A <b>jack</b> is to be placed beside each roller, giving a total of eight per cryostat. The <b>load</b> per <b>jack</b> for a 360 ton cryostat would then be 45 tons, leaving 90 tons as the required capacity. The second and equally important criteria to be met was size. After installation of the Tychoway rollers. room to mount these jacks is very limited underneath the carriage. The space surrounding the bottom of the carriage is cluttered with wiring and plumbing and thus further limits available space for the jacks.

40|$|Press-in piling, {{known as}} pile jacking, is a {{relatively}} new technique for foundation construction. Jacked piles are gaining popularity because they are free from vibration and noise during installation. In this thesis, about 100 cases of static loading tests were collected for compiling a database for jacked piles. The data collected were classified according to different types of founding soil and pile. The relationships between final <b>jacking</b> <b>load</b> and ultimate pile capacity were also investigated for different types of founding soil. Time-dependent effects for jacked piles were investigated in the research. During pile installation pauses, the pile capacity and stiffness generally increase by about 30 % per log-time cycle when the reference time t 0 is taken as 1 hour. The change in pile capacity and stiffness with time after pile installation was also studied. Capacity setup was observed in clay and sand, while relaxation was observed in silty sand. The pile stiffness was found to increase with time after pile installation. Behaviour of driven piles and jacked piles was compared in terms of changes in capacity with time. It was found that the setup effect was more significant in driven piles than in jacked piles. From field and centrifugal test results, when a pile was subjected to a low number of loading cycles, a decrease in the toe resistance occurred; meaning a greater portion of load was taken by the pile shaft. However, a decrease in the shaft resistance occurred when the pile was subjected to a larger number of loading cycles. Cumulative pile settlement was found to increase with a declining rate as the number of loading cycles increased. The effect of cyclic loading on the pile stiffness was found to increase with the number of final jacking cycles. Considering {{the pros and cons of}} the cyclic <b>load</b> effects, three <b>jacking</b> cycles was recommended for pile construction...|$|R

Press-in piling machines are capable of installing large tubular piles with up to 4. 6 MN of static jacking force, gaining reaction from adjacent piles within the cell. This technique permits the installation of, for example, bridge foundations, with minimal temporary works. By using static jacking force alone, environmental disturbance through noise and vibration is minimized. Since the press-in method provides a measurement of jacking resistance during installation, this value {{can be used to}} estimate the long-term capacity of the completed foundation. However, group effects and time effects must be accounted for.

30|$|The beam having simply {{supported}} boundary conditions {{was set up}} in the loading frame with sufficient care taken to ensure that the specimen was correctly positioned in the loading frame and the midpoint of the beam was in line with the centre line of the <b>loading</b> hydraulic <b>jack.</b> The specimen was heavily gauged, as shown in Fig.  2, in an attempt to identify a primary mode of failure, i.e. either buckling load for the web post, the formation of plastic hinges, or local buckling of the flange. Prior to application of load on the specimen, all the dial gauges were calibrated properly. Before the actual test, a small preload not exceeding 5  % of the expected ultimate load was applied slowly and removed to eliminate any slack in the support system so that the specimen would be properly seated on the supports. The loading and unloading process was repeated a few times and this procedure also helped to check whether the dial gauges functioned properly. Readings were initialised after ensuring that all instruments worked satisfactorily. The specimen was loaded first up to 20  % of the expected failure load and then unloaded to zero value. It was observed that the deflection readings reached the initial values when unloaded. The procedure was repeated up to 35  % of the expected failure load and the specimen was finally loaded to failure by increasing the load gradually by a predetermined increment. The five dial gauges were installed, three for measurement of vertical deflection placed at L/ 4, L/ 2 and 3 L/ 4, respectively, and two for measurement of lateral deflection of top and bottom flange, respectively, as shown in Fig.  2. The beam was then tested to failure. After the maximum load was attained and unloading occurred with increase in beam deflection, the load was then removed. The ultimate load and the mode of failure for each of the specimens were noted. The same test procedure was adopted for all the specimens.|$|R

Each <b>jack</b> is fitted with a pressure-ratio valve which is used to amplify or attenuate the input pressure signal generated from a common source. Part 1 dealt with the derivation of the static characteristics and equations of motion for the system. Part 2 is concerned with the results of (1) analogue computer investigations using these equations of motion and (2) practical experiments carried out on a hydraulic test rig to verify and to complement the results of the com-putations. The value of simultaneously undertaking the computer and test-rig investigations is demonstrated. The valve, in its basic form, is shown to give rise to transient oscillations even when the load has negligible inertia. When inertia loads are introduced, there is a further tendency to oscillate because of the compressibility of the oil. Both oscillations may be damped by the use of valve-spool centring springs and valve-damping ori-fices. The frequency response characteristics of the system over the normal working frequency range are shown to be quite sensitive to changes in the stiffness coefficients of the centring springs and the orifice-damping co-efficients.

40|$|In {{consideration}} {{of the difficulty of}} monitoring internal deformation in dam model tests, a new optical fiber sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology has been developed. Quasi-distributed FBGs are installed on a slender bar (circular cross-section) along axial direction to make an FBG sensing bar. For the dam physical model in this study, FBG sensing bars can be embedded in predrilled holes within the dam structure and the dam foundation. When the dam is <b>loaded</b> by hydraulic <b>jacks</b> and dam deformations occur, the sensing bar works like an elastic beam under arbitrary transverse and axial loading. According to the bending beam theory, the distribution of both horizontal and vertical displacements can be calculated from the strains measured by the FBGs. The two sensing bars used in the test were calibrated in the laboratory before testing. The calibration results have shown that the displacements measured by the sensing bars were in good agreement with those obtained using other conventional gauges. Recently a two-dimensional gravity dam model was constructed and instrumented with two embedded FBG sensing bars, together with surface mounted displacement transducers and strain rosettes. In the overload test, all the sensors were used to perform real-time monitoring of the model dam deformation. Major monitoring results are presented, compared and analyzed. The displacements measured by the FBG sensing bars in the dam model test are in good agreement with those from displacement transducers. The test results also reveal the deformation mechanism and failure mode of the gravity dam. 考虑到大坝模型试验中内部变形难以监测的现状,研制了一种新型的基于光纤布拉格光栅(FBG) 技术的光纤传感器。这种传感器为圆棒式结构,其表面沿轴向安装了准分布式的光纤布拉格光栅。对于大坝物理模型,该传感器可预埋入坝体和坝基的内部。当大坝受到油压千斤顶荷载产生变形时,该传感器类似于一根一端固定并同时受轴向拉、压和横向弯曲的弹性梁。根据弯梁原理,由光纤布拉格光栅测得的应变结果可反算出大坝沿水平向和竖向的位移分布。室内标定试验结果表明,该传感器测得的变形量与其他常规传感器的读数一致。在一个二维混凝土重力坝物理模型的超载破坏试验中,采用预埋于坝体、坝基内部的光纤传感器以及表面安装式位移计、电阻应变花对该模型进行实时的变形监测。试验结果验证了该光纤传感器在大坝模型内部变形监测中的有效性,同时也揭示了大坝在超载作用下的变形机制和破坏形态。Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

The brook originally {{got its name}} from the plentiful amount of bears that foraged on acorns produced from the large quantities of oaks found alongside its sides. A Mr. Dunning set up a sawmill operation that used logs that had been channelled down through Bear Brook, and which continued on eastward to the South Nation River, the Ottawa River and finally to the St. Lawrence Seaway. Bear Brook now flows with less than half the water it did when settlers first arrived. By the time the mill was set up the town consisted of a hotel, many stores and approximately 200 people in which the vast majority were English speaking of Irish descent. In 1881, the area was named Bearbrook Station. A train station was built which would help transport logs towards the St. Lawrence. In 1886, the community reached a large enough population to gain a post office, which lightened the work <b>load</b> for Mr. <b>Jack</b> Young, who had previously brought the mail in by horse and by snowshoe in winter.Bearbrook Station was difficult to distinguish from the nearby community of Bearbrook; therefore, it was renamed to Vars. There are two stories of how Vars got its name. The first, is that with the building of the new post office, the people of Bearbrook Station decided to name the community after the four people who brought the post office to the area: Mc(V)eigh, (A)rmstrong, (R)onan, and (S)mith. The second story is that the town was given the name by a retired priest from Embrun, Abbé C. Guillame, in memory of the village of Vars, Hautes-Alpes, in France.|$|R
40|$|The {{design process}} of {{segmental}} concrete linings in ground conditions generally refers to standard load cases of de-molding, storage, embedded ground condition and grouting process. Nevertheless, {{the application of}} the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) thrust jack forces is a crucial temporary loading condition during construction, which may govern the design procedure {{as well as the other}} stages. Tunnel segments were traditionally reinforced with conventional rebars in order to resist the tensile stresses at both Serviceability (SLS) and Ultimate Limit States (ULS). In the two last decades, Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) has been also used in several precast tunnel segments with or without conventional rebars. For structural purposes, steel fibers are generally used, even though some types of structural macro-synthetic fibers, which are able to impart significant toughness and ductility to concrete, have been recently introduced in the market. For these reasons, an experimental program aimed to investigate the local splitting behavior in the segment regions under the TBM hydraulic jacks was carried out at the University of Brescia. Tests on concrete prisms (with or without fibrous reinforcement) under Line Load (LL) or Point Load (PL) configurations were carried out in order to evaluate the beneficial effects of polypropylene (PP) fibers in controlling typical splitting cracks occurring under the <b>jack</b> <b>loads,</b> which represent one of the most severe loading conditions for tunnel segments. Experimental results show the feasibility of using polypropylene fibers in tunnel segments, since they significantly enhance both the splitting bearing capacity and the ductility. Fibers lead to a stable development of the splitting crack, which allows a redistribution of stresses after cracking. However, the effectiveness of fibers is influenced by the casting direction, which leads to a different fiber orientation. When the latter is favorable (fibers expected to be mainly transversal to the splitting crack) the bearing capacity is higher than in case of an unfavorable casting direction (fibers expected to be mainly parallel to the splitting crack) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Calculation of {{a railway}} track on the {{strength}} {{is one of the}} sections of the overall complex research problems of interaction track and rolling stock. This paper describes the experimental study of horizontal transverse stiffness of railway rails with various strands of rail fasteners. Materials of this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity of rail yarns with different designs of rail fasteners was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement of rails calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the <b>jack.</b> <b>Load</b> of rails was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections. Measurements were carried out without the creation of vertical load. Findings. With the developed method was found transverse displacement magnitude of rails calculation points at different designs of rail fasteners. Originality. The experimental studies were first found the mentioned horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different rail fasteners. Practical value. The values of horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different rail fasteners that were found by the author make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using correct and corrected values of these characteristics. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{much money}} and effort has been spent by {{manufacturers}} and users of pipe jacking equipment to develop suitable techniques, this work {{appears to be the}} first to study the method at full scale, in a scientific research programme. It has involved monitoring a series of five pipe jacks during construction. In each case a heavily instrumented pipe was incorporated into the pipe string to measure pipe joint stresses, pipe and joint compressions and contact stresses between pipe and ground. Total <b>jacking</b> <b>loads</b> and movements of the pipe string were also measured and all results correlated with a detailed site log, full tunnel alignment surveys, and observed ground conditions. The success of the site monitoring has been highly dependent upon the development of a suitable instrumentation and data acquisition system in conjunction with appropriate site procedures for working in the restricted and physically demanding pipe jack environment without undue disruption to normal site operations. The build up of total jacking force is the result of highly complex soil-pipe interaction. The local interface stresses are essentially frictional in most ground conditions, and can be related to the shear strength of the ground. The problem is in determining the effective radial stresses which are affected by soil insitu stresses, stiffness and strength; groundwater conditions; rate of progress; pipeline misalignment and use of lubricants. Relations between pressure distributions at pipe joints and measured tunnel alignments are presented. That small angular deviations between successive pipes cause severe localisation of stresses on their ends is clearly demonstrated. Careful back analysis shows that the linear stress approach of the Concrete Pipe Association of Australia can adequately match the measured stresses and could be used by pipe manufacturers to provide design data on allowable jacking forces for pipes on the basis of pipe size, packer properties, concrete strength and angular alignment. It is also clear from the small pipe barrel stresses that improved packing materials would allow more of the potential strength of pipes to be achieved. Since relative angular than absolute deviations control transfer mechanisms between pipes, uncritical adherence to specifications based on absolute line and level is counter-productive...|$|R
