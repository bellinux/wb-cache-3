500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be a better word to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much,</b> but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{critics and}} fans have {{generally}} praised Sora's character. When Sora was first revealed in 2002, GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini regarded him as [...] "an appropriate amalgamation of the Square and Disney universes." [...] He also comically noted that Sora [...] "doesn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much,</b> {{but you know}} how it goes." [...] A 1UP.com writer called Sora [...] "one of my all-time favorite Square characters", praising his cheerful personality. Gamasutra commented on Sora's journey along the series in their feature [...] "The Birth of Collecting: The Osiris Archetype In Games" [...] by Jason Johnson; while comparing Sora with Isis, Johnson found Sora's adventure appealing. IGN praised Sora's resilient character, noting how such an ordinary [...] "youngster" [...] could face up to his challenges during his adventures for the sake of friendship, while RPGFan's Nicole Monet Kirk labelled him as an [...] "extremely likable hero". Furthermore, in the book [...] "Interactive Storytelling for Video Games: A Player-Centered Approach to Creating Memorable Characters and Stories", it is noted that while Sora follows a [...] "standard hero archetype", his character becomes more believable and strong when worrying about his friends' fates. Haley Joel Osment, Sora's English voice actor, has also been praised by Gaming Target's Matt Swidder, who mentioned Osment [...] "makes a perfect fit for Sora". While remarking on Osment's work, Louis Bedigian from GameZone mentioned that [...] "Sora had something rarely found in video-game characters: depth" [...] also praising his role in Kingdom Hearts. Game Informers Bryan Vore found that in Kingdom Hearts II, Osment has improved in voicing the character, praising his work. In their Super Smash Bros Brawl list, IGN described Sora as [...] "...the most active and evolved hero on this week's list." [...] IGN listed him as a possible character in Brawl, though he was not chosen as the [...] "reader's choice".|$|E
2500|$|Chocolate Castles {{graphics}} and music received mixed responses. Game Tunnel's reviewers were divided; Prince said [...] "In Chocolate Castle we've got a slickly presented puzzle game polished to a sparkling shine", but John Bardinelli disagreed and stated the game [...] "doesn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> at first glance". William Usher described the graphics as [...] "simplistic", and the chip tune music as [...] "nothing but 80's-gaming incarnate". Tim W. praised the graphics as [...] "sharp", but {{stated that the}} game's lack of music during play was his only complaint; [...] "some people can do without it, but it doesn't feel right to me without background music." [...] Yu said [...] "Joseph White’s games are always brimming with charm and atmosphere, and Chocolate Castle is no exception!" [...] Ochs said [...] "This game's graphics, music, and sound effects won't blow you away, but they still exude a retro charm reminiscent of 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System games".|$|E

2500|$|With {{the news}} of fission {{neutrons}} from uranium fission, Szilárd immediately understood {{the possibility of a}} nuclear chain reaction using uranium. In the summer, Fermi and Szilard proposed the idea of a nuclear reactor (pile) to mediate this process. The pile would use natural uranium as fuel. Fermi had shown much earlier that neutrons were far more effectively captured by atoms if they were of low energy (so-called [...] "slow" [...] or [...] "thermal" [...] neutrons), because for quantum reasons it made the atoms <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> larger targets to the neutrons. Thus to slow down the secondary neutrons released by the fissioning uranium nuclei, Fermi and Szilard proposed a graphite [...] "moderator," [...] against which the fast, high-energy secondary neutrons would collide, effectively slowing them down. With enough uranium, and with pure-enough graphite, their [...] "pile" [...] could theoretically sustain a slow-neutron chain reaction. This would result in the production of heat, as well as the creation of radioactive fission products.|$|E

She herself had accordingly inquired by the stewardess if she might be received in Miss Mavis's own quarters, and the young lady had replied that they were littered up with things and unfit for visitors: she was packing a trunk over. Jasper made up for his devotion to his mother the day before by now spending {{a great deal of}} his time in the smoking-room. I wanted to say to him [...] "This is much better," [...] but I thought it wiser to hold my tongue. Indeed I had begun to feel the emotion of prospective arrival--the sense of the return to Europe always kept its intensity--and had thereby the less attention for other matters. It will doubtless appear to the critical reader that my expenditure of interest had been out of proportion to the vulgar appearances of which my story gives an account, but to this I can only reply that the event was to justify me.

Indeed I had begun to feel the emotion of prospective arrival (I was delighted to be almost back in my dear old Europe again) and had less to spare for other matters. It will doubtless appear to the critical reader that I had already devoted far too much to the little episode of which my story gives an account, but to this I can only reply that the event justified me. We sighted land, the dim yet rich coast of Ireland, about sunset and I leaned on the edge of the ship and looked at it. 'It doesn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much,</b> does it?'

6000|$|These {{would be}} the [...] "opening exercises," [...] the august {{dedication}} of the place. His imagination, he was well aware, got over the ground faster than his judgment; there was much still {{to do for the}} production of his first effect. Foundations were laid and walls were rising, the structure of the shell all determined; but raw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety; he should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the majesty of delay a monument to the religion he wished to propagate, the exemplary passion, the passion for perfection at any price. He was far from knowing as yet where he would end, but he was admirably definite as to where he wouldn't begin. He wouldn't begin with a small show--he would begin with a great, and he could scarce have indicated, even had he wished to try, the line of division he had drawn. He had taken no trouble to indicate it to his fellow- citizens, purveyors and consumers, in his own and the circumjacent commonwealths, of comic matter in large lettering, diurnally [...] "set up," [...] printed, published, folded and delivered, at the expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail. The snail had become for him, under this ironic suggestion, the loveliest beast in nature, and his return to England, of which we are present witnesses, had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined. It marked what he liked to mark, that he needed, on the matter in question, instruction from no one on earth. A couple of years of Europe again, of renewed nearness to changes and chances, refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market, would fall in with the consistency of wisdom, the particular shade of enlightened conviction, that he wished to observe. It didn't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> for a whole family to hang about waiting- they being now, since the birth of his grandson, a whole family; and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world, he felt, on which the question of appearance would ever really again count for him. He cared that a work of art of price should [...] "look like" [...] the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed; but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks.|$|E

50|$|In {{professional}} wrestling, blading is {{the practice}} of intentionally cutting oneself to provoke bleeding. It {{is also known as}} juicing, gigging, or getting color. Similarly, a blade is an object used for blading, and a bladejob is a specific act of blading. The act is usually done a good length into the match as the blood will mix with the flowing sweat to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>much</b> more blood is flowing from the wound than there actually is. The preferred area for blading is usually the forehead, as scalp wounds bleed profusely and heal easily. Legitimate, unplanned bleeding which occurs outside the storyline is called juicing the hard way.|$|E
