50|$|There {{is a small}} {{industry}} in breeding parrots for the pet trade. Breeders may range from small hobby breeders caring for just a pair or two to large breeding farms that may house hundreds of pairs. When chicks are small, breeders may put a specially made closed bird ring (bird band) {{on one of their}} legs with identifying characters stamped into the plastic. A closed ring would not fit over the foot of an adult parrot, so its presence proves that the bird was banded when it was a young chick. Some breeders leave the chicks in the nest longer and thus have to use an open band on the bird's leg. However, some breeders do not band the smaller commonly bred parrots, and some owners may have their bird's band removed after purchase because of the possibility that a band might become caught on a toy or other object and cause injury (removal of a band should be done by a veterinarian or experienced person). Bands are the main method for identifying an individual bird, which is helpful if the bird is lost. Sometimes the larger and more expensive parrots are micro-chipped with a tiny security device, as well as being tagged with a <b>leg</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mate choice {{decisions}} of female zebra finches are generally thought {{to rely on}} the assessment of male quality, which includes the specific ornamentation of males. A commonly used paradigm to experimentally manipulate a male's attractiveness is to add a coloured <b>leg</b> <b>ring</b> to the bird. Some studies have shown that female zebra finches prefer or alter their investment in males that have an additional red <b>leg</b> <b>ring</b> compared with males with green leg rings. Whether the coloured artificial ornaments need to be attached to the male's body or whether environmental colouration could have a similar effect on male attractiveness remains unclear. Here, I investigated this novel context to determine whether female choice between males is affected by environmental colour cues that are not directly attached to the male's body in four experiments involving 220 zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). A first experiment revealed that females chose males with red colour cues in the environmental background over males with green cues in the background. Based on this finding, I conducted follow-up experiments to obtain a deeper understanding of how environmental colour cues affect mate choice. Therefore, I examined whether female choice behaviour or male behaviour was altered in two additional experiments. Both experiments failed to show any effects of environmental colour cues on female choice or on male behaviour. Therefore, I replicated the initial experiment in a fourth experiment. Again replication failed; thus, the initial results indicating that environmental colouration affects mate choice behaviour of female zebra finches were not supported by the three subsequent experiments; thus, the outcome of the first experiment seems to be a false positive. Taking my results together, I found no robust support for the idea that environmental colour cues that are not directly attached to the body of male zebra finches affect female mate choice decisions...|$|E

First, they gave the males a red <b>leg</b> <b>ring,</b> and showed them to females {{on the other side}} of a transparent partition. When the males and females could see each other, they gave each other more attention when males were wearing their attractive red leg ring-the female gave positive feedback and the male responded by courting her more.

But when the females did not respond to the males because they could not see the amount of time the males spend courting was not related to which ring he was wearing...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of adult barnacles of Fistulobalanus pallidus (Darwin) and Fistulobalanus albicostatus (Pilsbry) attached to field-readable plastic leg rings on the Lesser Black-backed Gull Larus fuscus in Northern Europe is reported. L. fuscus is a long-distance palaearctic migrant, breeding in temperate areas spreading widely over inland and marine habitats outside the breeding season. The species {{is known to}} perform long-distance migration to Africa and the Middle East. Combining present knowledge on the birds ’ migratory pattern and the home range of the barnacle species, it is concluded that the cypris larvae of F. pallidus must have settled in African waters, whereas the area where F. albicostatus settled on the bird leg rings is less certain. The barnacles were of adult size and must thus have been attached {{for a period of}} no less than 2 months. More than 30 individual barnacles could occur together on a single field-readable plastic <b>leg</b> <b>ring.</b> The barnacles could therefore, if ported alive to a new area, reproduce successfully and thus either introduce the species or genetically affect other native populations. This may pose a new and wholly unexpected transportation pathway for barnacles as invasive species...|$|E
40|$|Females mated to {{attractive}} {{males are}} predicted to produce male-biased broods. Previous studies on zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which colored leg rings {{were used to}} alter male attractiveness, support this hypothesis. However, because molecular sexing techniques were not available, it was not known when during development this bias arose. Also, because both attractive (red-ringed) and unattractive (green-ringed) males were within the same aviary, assortative mating between treatments may have confounded the results. Using two different experimental designs, we tested whether the sex ratio of zebra finch eggs and chicks differed in response to paternal ring color whilst controlling for assortative mating between treatments. In the aviary experiment, birds could interact socially, but all males in an aviary had the same <b>leg</b> <b>ring</b> color. In the cage experiment, each female was randomly assigned a red- or green-ringed mate, thus also eliminating assortative mating within treatments. Offspring were sexed based on plumage or using a molecular method. The sex ratio at laying did not differ between treatments in either the aviary (n = 313 eggs) or cage (n = 151 eggs) experiments, suggesting that female zebra finches do not manipulate the primary sex ratio in response to their mate's ring color. However, in the cage experiment we found greater male embryonic mortality in the attractive group, {{which resulted in a}} female-biased sex ratio at sexual maturity, that is, in the opposite direction to that found in previous studies. Possible explanations for the disparity between our results and those of previous studies are considered.

5000|$|As {{with other}} species of Avicularia, juveniles have distinctively {{different}} colour patterns to adults. Juveniles of A. juruensis lack any kind of metallic sheen, have black tarsi contrasting {{with the rest of}} the leg which is lighter, and also have a reddish upper surface to the abdomen with a central longitudinal black stripe and separated transverse black stripes. Adults lose the stripes on the abdomen and gain a metallic sheen. There are two colour forms or [...] "morphotypes". Morphotype 1 has a golden and pink sheen, a whitish carapace and whitish <b>leg</b> <b>rings</b> and longer light brown hairs evenly distributed over shorter darker hairs.

40|$|There is {{much concern}} about the {{potential}} for invasive species to enter the only marine region left with no known exotics - the Southern Ocean. Attention has focused on planktonic larval travel, shipping (ballast water and hull fouling) and marine debris as transport mechanisms. There is, however, another source of transport for biota across the Polar Frontal Zone - hitchhiking on megafauna, such as seals. In this study we report the frequency and burden of barnacles Lepaa australis attached to Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella coming ashore to breed at Bird Island, South Georgia. In the austral summers of 2001 / 2002, 2002 / 2003 and 2003 / 2004, female fur seals with barnacles attached arrived at Bird Island in late November/early December and peaked in mid-December. About 4 % of female fur seals carried barnacles, with the mean burden being - 10 barnacles. Pedunculate barnacles seem, therefore, to be entering the Southern Ocean in large numbers every year in the South Georgia region and probably elsewhere. We also found adult barnacles attached to a macaroni penguin and (perhaps the furthest and fastest travelling marine larvae) young stages (cyprids) on the <b>leg</b> <b>ring</b> of a wandering albatross. Barnacle plates provide a hard substratum to which other fouling marine organisms can attach, and thus travel as secondary hitch-hikers. We found polychaete worms (Spirorbidae) and a bryozoan colony (Ceneporella antarctica) encrusting a stalked barnacle attached to a pycnogonan (Collosendeis scotti). We suggest that fouling hitch-hiking barnacles (on migrating megafauna) offer a considerable natural mechanism for potential colonisers of Antarctic waters, This is of particular importance at the current time given the context of strong regional warming in the Scotia Arc-Antarctic Peninsula region...|$|E

40|$|The {{differential}} allocation hypothesis (DAH) {{predicts that}} an individual should vary its reproductive investment according to the attractiveness of its mate. A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i. e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i. e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment {{can be made by}} the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red <b>leg</b> <b>rings</b> to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green <b>leg</b> <b>rings</b> to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from greenringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that {{the costs and benefits of}} differential allocation vary among individuals and across contexts...|$|R

We controlled for parental genetic quality by manipulating male attractiveness using coloured <b>leg</b> <b>rings</b> and by randomly assigning mating pairs. The potential confounding effect of differential nestling care was controlled for by cross-fostering clutches and by allowing for variance due to foster father attractiveness in general linear models.

This provides strong evidence for maternal effects in response to mate attractiveness.
