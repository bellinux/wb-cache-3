The sites of the colonial towns of St. Philippe and Harrisonville were submerged by the Mississippi River, in flooding caused by deforestation of river banks during the steamboat years. Crews cut so many trees that banks destabilized and collapsed in the current, making the river wider and more shallow from St. Louis to the confluence with the Ohio River.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{research has been}} performed in order to study the flow distribution in a bipolar plate of a commercial PEM fuel cell. Planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) trace tracking {{has been applied to}} visualize the flow pattern and to measure the velocity in the plate channels. Simultaneously, the problem has been studied numerically, simulating the flow under similar operational conditions as those fixed in the experiments. Results obtained reveal a defective design of the bipolar plate.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to implement nanocircuitry in different forms. These include Nanowires, Single-Electron Transistors, Quantum dot cellular automata, and Nanoscale Crossbar Latches. However, likely nearer-term approaches will involve incorporation of nanomaterials to improve MOSFETs. These currently form the basis of most analog and digital circuit designs, the scaling of which drives Moore's Law. A review article covering the MOSFET design and its future was published in 2004 comparing different geometries of MOSFETs under scale reduction and noted that circular cross-section vertical channel FETs are optimal for scale reduction. This configuration is capable of being implemented with a high density using vertical semiconductor cylindrical channels with nanoscale diameters and Infineon Technologies and Samsung have begun research and development in this direction resulting in some basic patents using nanowires and carbon nanotubes in MOSFET designs. In an alternative approach, Nanosys uses solution based deposition and alignment processes to pattern pre-fabricated arrays of nanowires on a substrate to serve as a <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> of an FET. While not capable of the same scalability as single nanowire FETs, the use of pre-fabricated multiple nanowires for the channel increases reliability and reduces production costs since large volume printing processes may be used to deposit the nanowires at a lower temperature than conventional fabrication procedures. In addition, due to the lower temperature deposition a wider variety of materials such as polymers may be used as the carrier substrate for the transistors opening the door to flexible electronic applications such as electronic paper, bendable flat panel displays, and wide area solar cells.|$|E

40|$|Confluences {{are basic}} {{building}} blocks in river networks at all scales. When two rivers merge at a confluence, rapid changes in fluid velocity and turbulence intensity cause {{changes in the}} bed geometry. Usually, a deep scour hole and a depositional point bar are present at the confluence. One important phenomenon that has been overlooked in previous studies is the progressive penetration of the scour hole into the tributary channel. This progressive penetration may jeopardize the structural safety of the <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> in {{the proximity of the}} main channel. In this study, dimensional analysis techniques are used to develop a general equation for the prediction of maximum scour hole penetration (P sc) into the tributary. Eventhough, the penetration of the scour hole into the <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> is a time-dependent process, in developing the formula the maximum value after the equilibrium condition has been achieved is used. A series of 73 experimental tests with different confluence angle (θ), lateral to downstream channel discharge ratio (Q r), lateral to main channel width ratio (B r) and downstream densimetric Froude number (F g) in an asymmetrical confluence has been conducted to test the proposed formulation. The results show that P sc increases with Q r, θ and F g and decreases with B r. The degree of penetration defines two types of scour holes: In the first type the scour hole penetration only reaches the toe of the <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> wall closer to the downstream junction corner whereas in the second type the scour hole reaches both <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> walls. The second type is associated with higher values of Q r, ? and F g and lower values of B r. Statistical analysis showed that the mean error of the developed formula is of the order of 24 %...|$|E

Sampling sites contained between 12 and 63 species. The pond-like (disconnected) appearance, the good quality of the ground water, the surrounding rather natural landscape, the presence of well vegetated gently-sloping margins and the very low densities of fishes were positive factors.

40|$|The {{heritability}} of frontal EEG asymmetry, {{a potential}} endophenotype for depression, was investigated using a large set of adolescent and young adult twins. Additionally, {{the relationship between}} polymorphisms within three serotonin genes, two receptor genes and one transporter gene, and frontal EEG asymmetry was also investigated. Using Falconer's estimate, frontal EEG asymmetry was shown to be more heritable at lateral compared to medial cites across nearly all reference montages, and greater in males compared to females. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), and investigating both additive (ACE) and non-additive (ADE) models of genetic heritability, males displayed consistently greater additive genetic contributions to heritability, with greater lateral contributions than medial ones. For female twins pairs, the additive genetic model data provided a mixed picture, with more consistent heritability estimates observed at medial sites, but with larger estimates shown at <b>lateral</b> <b>channels.</b> For non-additive genetic models, male twin pairs demonstrated exclusive non-additive contributions to heritability across channels within AVG and CZ referenced data, with metrics in the CSD and LM montages more mixed between additive and non-additive contributions. However, consistent with Falconer's estimates, <b>lateral</b> <b>channels</b> were nearly always estimated to be more heritable than medial channels regardless of gender. These models demonstrate some combination of additive and non-additive contributions to the heritability of frontal EEG asymmetry, with the CSD and AVG montages showing greater lateral compared to medial heritability and CZ and LM montages showing mixed contributions with additive heritability at <b>lateral</b> <b>channels</b> and non-additive primarily at medial channels. The complex interaction of gender and reference montage on the heritability estimates highlight the subtle yet important roles of age, gender, and recording methodology when investigating proposed endophenotypes.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of transport and deposition of fine sediment in alluvial rivers, including their floodplains, is essential for improved understanding of sediment budgets and prediction of river morphological changes. Previous work in the Root River indicates that channel-floodplain sediment exchange exerts strong control on the sediment flux of this system. In addition, improvements in agricultural practices and increases in high and low flows {{during the past five}} decades have led us to believe that sediment sources in the Root River may be shifting from uplands to near-channel sources. This thesis estimated the total amount of fine sediment contributed to the channel from near-channel sources due to the processes of <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> adjustment (channel migration and channel widening) using a quantitative approach based on the use of multiple epochs of aerial photographs (1930 s- 2010 s), lidar data available for the entire watershed from 2008, and other GIS analysis.

In addition, we found that the Root River presents a marked division between its <b>lateral</b> <b>channel</b> adjustment trends before and after the 1970 s.
