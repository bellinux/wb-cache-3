5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands of <b>light</b> <b>that</b> evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope, which {{cannot be}} pointed {{directly}} at the Sun, used the Moon as a mirror to study the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> had passed through the atmosphere of Venus {{in order to determine}} its composition.

5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that {{tend to be very}} dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E

50|$|Intelligent street {{lighting}} refers to public street <b>lighting</b> <b>that</b> adapts to movement by pedestrians, cyclists and cars. Intelligent {{street lighting}}, {{also referred to}} as adaptive street lighting, dims when no activity is detected, but brightens when movement is detected. This type of lighting is different from traditional, stationary illumination, or dimmable street <b>lighting</b> <b>that</b> dims at pre-determined times.|$|R
5|$|An absorption-re-emission atomic {{line filter}} absorbs the desired {{wavelength}} {{of light and}} emits <b>light</b> <b>that</b> bypasses broadband filters. In passive absorption-re-emission ALFs, a high-pass filter blocks all low-energy incoming light. The vapor cell absorbs the signal, which coincides with the vapor's thin absorption line, and the cell's atoms become excited. The vapor cell then re-emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency. A low-pass filter blocks radiation above {{the frequency of the}} fluorescent light. In an active ALF, optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths. For active ALFs, other systems of conventional filters may be needed.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving <b>light</b> <b>that</b> is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} {{has also}} been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 Hubble Space Telescope data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered <b>light</b> <b>that</b> indicates a hydrogen geocorona. The amount of hydrogen present in Callisto's atmosphere varies depending {{on the stage of}} its orbit.|$|E

A type {{facsimile}} of a copy held by the British Museum, edited and introduced by Richard Herne Shepherd, was published as a limited edition in 1884. Another copy of Tamerlane and Other Poems was published in a 1941 facsimile by Thomas Ollive Mabbott, who provided the introduction; his correction and additions to this are found in a subsequent publication.|$|E

The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E

The star is slightly hotter than the Sun; while HD 2039 has a temperature of 5935 K, the Sun's surface temperature lies nearly 200 kelvins lower at 5778 K. HD 2039 is unusually metal-rich, which has attracted the attention of astrophysicists.|$|E

The Hymns are similar in theme to the Discourses, but are written with poetic meter and rhyme. He began writing them {{at the same time as}} the Discourses but only finished editing them during the last thirteen years of his life at the monastery of St. Macrina. There are 58 hymns totaling approximately 11,000 verses.|$|E

5|$|On {{the weekend}} of August17–18, 2009, another serious traffic jam occurred, in which it took some drivers two hours {{to get to the}} Thruway from the mall. Officials cited several factors: the heavy traffic on Route17 that weekend for both the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Music Festival in Sullivan County and the observances of the anniversary of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's death in Kiryas Joel, a few miles to the west. A traffic <b>light</b> <b>that</b> had been {{malfunctioning}} after a recent lightning strike may also have contributed.|$|E
5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of <b>light</b> <b>that</b> it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
