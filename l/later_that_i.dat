25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, I probably would have deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when I pulled it up on the laptop <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> realised what I had.|$|E
500|$|Hedren gave Spoto {{an account}} of the {{director}} as a sexual predator for his 1983 book, The Dark Side of a Genius (1983). Spoto wrote that Hitchcock made [...] "an overt sexual proposition that she could neither ignore nor answer casually." [...] Hedren alleged in Spoto's 2009 book, Spellbound by Beauty: Alfred Hitchcock and His Leading Ladies, that Hitchcock actually asked her to [...] "make myself sexually available and accessible to him – however and whenever and wherever he wanted." [...] Spoto was the first person Hedren told her story to. She said: [...] "It was embarrassing and insulting—there were a lot of reasons why I didn’t want to tell the story. I didn’t want it to be taken advantage of, twisted, turned and made into an even uglier situation than it was. It wasn’t until years <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> told Donald the story. (...) He is absolutely true and honest in this book." [...] She previously said, in 1973, while Hitchcock was still alive, that a major life-style difference caused a split in their relationship. [...] "He was too possessive and too demanding. I cannot be possessed by anyone. But, then, that's my own hangup." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her. I really got to know the character, and she had so many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E

50|$|Many {{characters}} hear Id's {{name and}} express doubt or fear throughout the story. It is <b>later</b> shown <b>that</b> <b>Id</b> traveled back in time, and had adventures {{in the past}} that would lead to the infamy of the name Id.|$|R
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the script}} was finished, they {{sent it to}} Paramount. Gross says that Jeff Berg (Walter’s agent), Larry Gordon and Michael Eisner, head of Production at Paramount, [...] "got {{into some kind of}} a fight when the script was finished. We learned <b>later</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> believe, Eisner {{rejected}} it {{on the grounds that it}} was too similar to Indiana Jones. Conceptually. So they didn’t pull the trigger and Berg ended up selling it to Universal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Demmin's current chronicler, then 14 years old, recalls:My {{mother was}} also raped. And then, {{together}} {{with us and}} with neighbors, she hurried towards the Tollense river, resolutely prepared to jump into it. [...] My siblings [...] realized only much <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had held her back, that I had pulled her out {{of what may be}} called a state of trance, to prevent her from jumping into the water. There were people. There was screaming. The people were prepared to die. Children were told: 'Do you want to live on? The town is burning. These and those are dead already. No, {{we do not want to}} live any more.' And so, people went mostly into the rivers. [...] That made even the Russians feel creepy. There are examples where Russians, too, tried to pull people out or hinder them. But these hundreds of people, they were unable to withhold. And the population here was extremely panicked.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{was leaving}} the room, last of our party, {{he said to me}} in a quiet, well-bred voice, [...] "You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, <b>later</b> on, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did what I could to {{convince}} you tonight." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Later</b> <b>that</b> day <b>I</b> met Steele at Hoden's and {{was with}} him when he looked at the body and the written message which spoke so tersely of the enmity toward him. We left there together, and I hoped Steele would let me stay with him from that moment.|$|R
2500|$|Barks later reflected, [...] "Scrooge in 'Christmas on Bear Mountain' {{was only}} my first {{idea of a}} rich, old uncle. I had made him too old and too weak. <b>I</b> {{discovered}} <b>later</b> on <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to make him more active. I could not make an old guy like that do the things I wanted him to do." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} a month <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> learned of Mr. Doomer's death.|$|E
60|$|But it wasn't till {{two weeks}} <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got {{all that was}} coming to me out of Herkimer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no. Not at all so bad,' I answered; and it wasn't till much <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{realised}} {{that we had}} exchanged the countersign {{which runs}} clear round the Empire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she answered, [...] "we {{can think}} of <b>that</b> <b>later.</b> <b>I</b> have borne enough to-day. This {{has been a little}} hard upon me, Gregory." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{was a total}} {{surprise}} when [...] manager Reg Freeman pulled me aside at the training ground to tell me of The Blues' interest. I was so excited <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> {{went back to the}} training session I lost concentration and went sliding off onto the gravel edge. When I met up with Blues officials <b>later</b> <b>that</b> day <b>I</b> had both my hands bandaged and found it hard to sign the contract!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When I was 16, I {{played the}} Club Harlem in Philly and I {{was on the}} same bill as Charlie Parker. He died <b>later</b> <b>that</b> year. <b>I</b> was there {{with him for a}} week and I learned what it would {{normally}} take two years to pick up. Bird told me if I kept struggling I'd go a long way, and I've never forgotten his words." [...] -Billy Paul ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{has said}} {{anything}} to the contrary? As for bearing it, we must take it as it comes,--both of us. You may as well know now as <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have done with racing--for ever." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been several hours <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> awakened to find a young man {{standing}} before me. In one hand he bore a light, in the other a receptacle containing a gruel-like mixture--the common prison fare of Barsoom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{that it was very}} hastily but very honestly written, and it is fair to add that it was not until <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew {{for the first time that}} those gentle and wonderful eyes, which I was thinking of as being closed forever, had ever rested kindly upon a line of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|A little <b>later</b> <b>that</b> day <b>I</b> {{heard him}} {{talking about it}} in the club. [...] "Yes," [...] he was saying, [...] "a submarine. It torpedoed William,--my {{gardener}}. I have both a chauffeur and a gardener at the war. William was picked up on a raft. He's in pretty bad shape. My son Alfred had a cable from him that he's coming home. We've both telegraphed him to stick it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By my old enemies, Watson. By {{the charming}} society whose leader {{lies in the}} Reichenbach Fall. You must {{remember}} that they knew, and only they knew, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was still alive. Sooner or <b>later</b> they believed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this morning they saw me arrive." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Je me réveillai guérie et j'ai compris plus tard que j'avais été un des rares cas réussis de lobotomie" [...] (I woke {{up better}} and <b>later</b> {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was one of}} the rare lobotomy success stories). In 1952, she was released. The same year, she came back on stage at the Casa Loma and the Montmartre, but her efforts were impeded by taboos about mental problems and she never regained the same level of popularity.|$|R
60|$|It {{may have}} been a {{fortnight}} <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> divined the secret of the writing-pad. My wretch (it leaked out) wrote letters for a paper in the West, and had filled a part of one of them with descriptions of myself. I pointed out to him that he had no right to do so without asking my permission.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was just}} a {{fortnight}} <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> received quite unexpectedly a telegram from Rome directed to me at my London lodgings. I tore it open hastily; it was signed by Emily, and contained only these few words: [...] "We have found the Museum Wulfric. The superintendent is coming over to identify and reclaim it. Can you manage to run across immediately with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{had been}} seen of Nugent, when I reached this house. It was not till {{a quarter of an}} hour <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> heard his voice at the door, calling to me, and asking if I had come back. I answered, and he joined me in the sitting-room. Nugent's first words to me were these:--" [...] 'Oscar, I have come to ask your pardon, and to bid you good-bye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe there}} has been a change in that respect," [...] Philip said; [...] "but you will hear <b>that</b> <b>later</b> on. <b>I</b> am only here to see that all is in readiness." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{was drawn}} to panel A. 04 because of my {{interests}} in place-based pedagogy. In fact, <b>later</b> <b>that</b> day <b>I</b> gave a presentation on a place-based approach to mobile composition, drawing examples from my teaching (C. 05). One of the aspects of this panel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found particularly engaging was the way that each presenter took {{a different approach to}} his or her attention to issues of place. The projects were quite diverse, but there were clearly overlapping connections in terms of how our local geographies, urban spaces, and communities have important implications for the teaching of writing and rhetoric. I walked away from the panel energized with a swirl of ideas for teaching and research...|$|R
5000|$|In her autobiography, The Wroughten Director, Vsych writes: [...] "When I was {{learning}} to read, I tried sounding out {{the name of a}} sign I saw on Venice Boulevard, 'WROUGHT IRON.' Mom said it was pronounced 'rot,' and it meant that the iron was very good, very well-crafted. <b>Later</b> <b>that</b> afternoon, <b>I</b> went to nursery school and painted with Matilda Gomez. When Matilda painted a really good picture of a boat, I said, 'That's wroughten.' She said, 'It is NOT!' and stabbed me in the eye with her paintbrush.".|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had nothing}} to ask of me--nothing, that is, but not to stay any longer. She did to that extent want to see me. She had {{supposed}} at first--after he had been with her--that I had seen the propriety of taking myself off. Then since I hadn't--seeing my propriety as I did in another way--she found, days <b>later,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was still there. This," [...] said Densher, [...] "affected her." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was some}} fifteen minutes <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{heard in the}} {{distance}} the engines of an automobile. The headlights gleamed through the trees, and presently the car swept round the bend of the drive and drew up at the front door. A portly figure got down and rang the bell. I observed these things from {{a window on the}} first floor, overlooking the front steps; and it was from this window that I spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are a lot}} of formalities and bridesmaids and {{ministers and}} things that have got to be taken into {{consideration}} before I am yours. And anyway there is no necessity for mussing me up so. You might as well know now as <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> utterly loathe this cave-man stuff. And really, Harold, there is nothing about your appearance that suggests a cave-man, which is probably one reason that I like you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Later</b> <b>that</b> night <b>I</b> heard other {{footsteps}} in the pond, {{and opened}} my lantern upon three deer, a doe, a fawn {{and a large}} buck, feeding at short intervals among the lily pads. The buck was wild; after one look he plunged into the woods, whistling danger to his companions. But the fawn heeded nothing, knew nothing for the moment save the fascination of the wonderful glare {{out there in the}} darkness. Had I not shut off the light, I think he would have climbed into the canoe in his intense wonder.|$|R
5000|$|Jeff Porcaro was {{initially}} dubious, {{and found it}} hard to believe that Fleetwood, a drummer he admired, had no clue what he was doing. [...] "It was only after we continued to talk <b>that</b> Jeff realized <b>I</b> wasn't kidding around. We eventually had a tremendous laugh about it, and when <b>I</b> <b>later</b> told him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was dyslexic, it finally made sense." ...|$|R
2500|$|It was chiefly from {{comments}} made <b>later</b> by Daphne <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was able to}} reconstruct the full picture of Gertrude's inner conflict during her stay in London. Daphne spoke of Gertrude's moodiness, her variability, her sense of vague self-dissatisfaction. To other English friends, Gertrude talked wistfully of wanting to remain in England, [...] "where I belong." ...|$|R
