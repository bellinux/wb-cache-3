40|$|ABSTRACT- The task of <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> from <b>a</b> support table, {{holding it}} in the air and then {{replacing}} it on the table seems to be organized in the following way: distinct phases are linking together, each phase characterized by a pattern of muscular activity, specific sensory gating and processing, and by parameters primarily concerned with the magnitude of muscular activity. The transition from one phase to another is triggered by phase-dependent patterns of short-lasting sensory inputs. The parameters em-ployed depend on previous experience, visual and haptic information, and sensory information gathered during the execution of the task. Available data strongly suggest that the motor behavior displayed by humans is best described as a discrete event driven control rather than a continuous closed-loop control. Thus, the control mechanisms active when <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> in <b>a</b> precision grip are basilically anticipatory in nature and makes "intermittent " use of sensory information to update task phase parameters or to shift from one phase to another...|$|R

40|$|Two {{classes of}} hand action {{representations}} are {{shown to be}} activated by listening to {{the name of a}} manipulable object (e. g., cell-phone). The functional action associated with the proper use of an object is evoked very soon after the onset of its name, as indicated by primed execution of that action. Priming is sustained throughout the duration of the word's enunciation. Volumetric actions (those used to simply <b>lift</b> <b>an</b> <b>object)</b> show a negative priming effect at the onset of a word, followed by a short-lived positive priming effect. This time-course pattern is explained by a dual-process mechanism involving frontal and parietal lobes for resolving conflict between candidate motor responses.

40|$|The {{actions of}} <b>a</b> robot like <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> are often best {{thought of as}} {{low-level}} processes with uncertain outcome. A highlevel robot plan {{can be seen as}} a description of a task which combines these processes in an appropriate way and which may involve nondeterminism in order to increase a plan's generality. In a given situation, a robot needs to turn a given plan into an executable program for which it can establish, through some form of projection, that it satisfies a given goal with some probability. In this paper we will show how this can be achieved in a logical framework. In particular, low-level processes are modelled as programs in pGOLOG, a probabilistic variant of the action language GOLOG. High-level plans are like ordinary GOLOG programs except that during projection the names of low-level processes are replaced by their pGOLOG- definitions. 1 Introduction The actions of <b>a</b> robot like <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> are often best thought of as low-level processes with uncertain ou [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there are}} an {{infinite}} number of ways that humans can <b>lift</b> <b>an</b> <b>object,</b> they tend to reach in a predictable manner. This suggests that people are aware of, and optimizing, some sort of loss function. This paper outlines a natural loss function that may be used to predict people’s actions in everyday reaching tasks. The loss function is based on the physics of object manipulation and the assumption that people are planning for the intended motion of the object. Using this framework, we are able to make predictions about how people should reach if they are minimizing their expected risk. To test the model, we required people to reach to objects at varying orientations. Our experimental results indicate that people are reaching in a manner that minimizes their expected risk for the task. These findings suggest that people planning for the intended motion of the object and that our brain is aware of the physics involved with object manipulation...|$|E
40|$|Using virtual {{objects that}} {{provided}} haptic feedback we studied two-fingered movements of reaching to grasp and <b>lift</b> <b>an</b> <b>object.</b> These reach-grasp-lift movements {{were directed to}} objects of identical physical size but with the different physical properties of mass, and coefficient of friction between the floor and object. For each condition, the resulting forces and kinematic properties of movements were recorded after a brief amount of practice with reaching to grasp and lift the object. It was found that for conditions where the object was more stable to perturbation, such as large mass or high friction, the contact force with the object was greater. This suggests that {{the stability of the}} object, is quickly and easily learned and subsequently influences the accuracy of the movement. The possibility is discussed that such programming of contact force is incorporated into the planning of grasps and how this would interact with the execution of grasps to virtual objects with and without haptic feedback Keywords grasping, haptic interaction, virtual reality, motor contro...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{dexterous}} volitional {{control of}} an upper-limb prosthetic device will require multimodal sensory feedback {{that goes beyond}} vision. Haptic display is well-positioned to provide this additional sensory information. Haptic display, however, includes a diverse set of modalities that encode information differently. We have be-gun to make a comparison between two of these modalities, force feedback spanning the elbow, and amplitude-modulated vibrotac-tile feedback, based on performance in a functional grasp and lift task. In randomly ordered trials, we assessed the performance of N= 11 participants (8 able-bodied, 3 amputee) attempting to grasp and <b>lift</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> using an EMG controlled gripper under three feed-back conditions (no feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and force feed-back), and two object weights that were undetectable by vision. Preliminary results indicate differences between able-bodied and amputee participants in coordination of grasp and lift forces. In ad-dition, both force feedback and vibrotactile feedback contribute to significantly better task performance (fewer slips) and better adap-tation following an unpredicted weight change. This suggests that the development and utilization of internal models for predictive control is more intuitive {{in the presence of}} haptic feedback...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the mechanisms underlying the intermanual transfer of sensorimotor memory when <b>lifting</b> <b>an</b> <b>object.</b> Twenty healthy subjects grasped and <b>lifted</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> with constant mechanical properties {{with the right}} hand (RH) first {{and then with the}} left hand (LH). Ten of the subjects lifted the object with the RH in a regular wrist angulation (WA), followed by lifts with the LH in a regular WA. The remaining 10 subjects lifted the object with the RH in a hyper-flexed WA, followed by lifts with the LH in a regular WA. Subjects generated greater peak grip force (GF) rates, grip and lift forces when lifting the object with the wrist in a regular WA compared to lifts with the wrist in hyper-flexion. Importantly, subjects transferred the predictive scaling of GF from the RH to the LH, regardless of the WA. Biomechanical properties of the object {{do not seem to be}} used by the CNS as a first line information to evaluate GF when handling <b>an</b> <b>object</b> or transferring information about the grasp to the opposite hemisphere.

The study of this material was analyzed using computer software that can calculate the finite element of linear stress analysis of each mechanical components of robotic arm.

In addition, the selection of electrical components used in the robotic arm is also taken into account by calculating the inverse kinematic and forward kinematic of this robotic arm movement. Besides that, the forces exerted on the robotic arm are also calculated to ensure the mechanical components of the robotic arm is not easily broken or damaged. Referring to the result obtained, a robotic arm resistance depends on the motor used. Therefore, the compatibility of motor torque with the robotic arm design is made is important because it affects the stability of the robotic arm...|$|E
