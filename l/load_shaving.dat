An implicit assumption that all outcomes are equally likely underpins most randomization tools used in common games of chance (e.g. rolling dice, shuffling cards, spinning tops or wheels, drawing lots, etc.).

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. This thesis {{discusses}} the different strategies used to perform peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> through {{the means of}} distributed generation and energy storage systems from the Utility???s perspective. Peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} load leveling or peak shifting, consists of the schemes used to eliminate the peaks and valleys in the load profile. This practice offers vast benefits to utilities in cost generation, line loss reduction, and volt support which is further discussed. Prior work for peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> has been mainly focused on approaches such as linear and dynamic programming, and heuristic approaches such as particle-swarm optimization. The proposed algorithm here is based on a simple approach which compares the load profile with its average in a certain period and shares the charge/discharge among the energy storage devices based on defined weighting factors. In particular, the thesis focuses on the usage of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and distributed generations to accomplish this task. Results show that the proposed algorithm offers a simple, fast and effective way for peak-load shaving without heavy computational burdens often needed in other methods. As a result, it can be easily implemented in the Utility main substation for controlling the charge/discharge of storage devices throughout the distribution system.

30|$|Firstly, {{to capture}} {{operation}} aspects which can affect planning stage, a bi-level model is adopted {{to achieve the}} collaborative optimization between planning and operation of ESS. For the purpose of giving expression to multiple roles of MESS in ADSs, a fuzzy multi-objective model is adopted, which consists of peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving,</b> restraining volatility, and improving the reserve capability of ESS.|$|E
30|$|The most {{prominent}} roles of ESS to ADSs are elected to be optimal objectives: 1) peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> and valley load filling aiming at deferral of system investment, 2) restraining the volatility {{with the purpose}} of alleviating the fluctuation of load and REGs, and 3) improving the reserve capability of ESS seeking to take some degree of responsibility for system support.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{thermal energy}} storage systems (TESS) are {{essential}} to rationalize the energy management {{and the use of}} environmental energy potential. Concepts including phase change material (PCM) are technically mature for building applications and innovations. Among the existing concepts of TESS, PCM to air heat exchanger can directly be integrated in building ventilation systems in order to store energy for heating peak <b>loads</b> <b>shaving</b> [1]. A similar system could also be used for cooling purposes, as presented in [2]. Here, during the off-peak period, the air is heated by a heat pump and passes through the heat exchanger to store energy. This energy is released during the peak period to heat the building and reduce the required heating load. The objective is to stop the heat pump without affecting the thermal indoor comfort. Quantitatively, the heat exchanger is designed so it can replace about a 1 kW heating system during 2 hours. The second issue of this work is to provide detailed results suitable with the validation of numerical models. On this subject, data from several experiments are collected and presented in [3] and the authors are underlining the lack of data. For this reason, the geometry of the exchanger will be detailed here and the uncertainty associated with the heating power measurement will be given. In this paper, the design and the instrumentation of the heat exchanger is first presented. Next, the tests simulating a ventilation system, and realized in our laboratory setup, are presented and discussed. In the conclusions, design guidelines are given {{in order to meet the}} storage unit specification requirements...|$|R

40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is a common}} problem, which {{has been linked to}} {{repetitive}} lifting and highloading. Previous studies investigating the relationship between lifting and spinal <b>load</b> <b>shave</b> failed to consider the separate elements of the back. This study aims to compare different lifting techniques (weightlifting and manual handling) using a multi-segmental model of the spine. The loading and movement characteristics of the lumbo-pelvic joint during sagitally symmetric lifting were investigated. Kinematic and kinetic data were acquired with the 'Flock of Birds' electromagnetic sensors and a custom-built forceplate. Weighted boxes and Olympic barbells were used to simulate occupational lifting and athletic weightlifting respectively. The results indicate a shift to back-driven lifting and a reliance on the momentum of the upper body to move heavier weights. Over-extension of lumbar spine and pelvis during the heavy lifts implies the increased role of the hip and back extensors in force production. Moment did not increase significantly with load suggesting a physiological limit to the moment that can be generated by the muscles; other factors must affect lifting ability once this maximum has been reached. A simultaneous study investigated the potential of the 'balance board' method for measuring pelvic segment mass. Despite previous studies reporting the ease and accuracy of this method for measuring segmental mass, the results were not deemed to be sufficiently accurate for use. This is the first study that attempts to compare lifting technique between subjects with differing types and levels of training. Some training effects were seen to transfer between tasks. These findings would imply that a compromise might be reached, combining the advantages of manual handling and competitive lifting, which could result in a safer and more effective lifting technique. From a clinical perspective, this may be helpful in both treating patients and reducing healthcare costs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a methodology for substation optimal planning considering DG for peak shaving. Utility can take effective demand-side management (DSM) to encourage customer-owned DG {{to participate in}} peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving,</b> and it can also construct utility DG to meet the peak load demand. In this paper, the impact of DG on peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> is analyzed, and DG is taken as a complement to T&D system to meet load demand, which is considered in the substation planning. Substations sizing and location and new-built utility DG capacity is optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), in which supply area of each substation is obtained by Voronoi diagram method. Case study shows that planning result considering DG for peak shaving can defer T&D system expansion so that considerable investment can be saved.

30|$|The {{planning}} of ESS in ADSs should consider not only minimizing of costs, but also significant roles of ESS. To demonstrate multiple roles of ESS, two statuses of ADSs should be considered: 1) the normal status with roles of peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> and restraining volatility, 2) the failure status {{with the responsibility}} for system support. Moreover, the time-variable nature of load and REGs is another essential factor {{that needs to be}} considered.|$|E

Sizes may vary {{but they may be}} no more than 86 cm long, 6 cm in diameter, or 38 oz in mass. The standard bat barrel diameter for both slowpitch and fastpitch softball is 2 inches. Many players prefer a smaller barrel, which reduces mass and allows higher swing speed. Although {{there are a variety of}} bats used, there are several that are banned due to performance enhancement. These bats are determined to be illegal by the Amateur Softball Association of America. Several bats are banned because of the harm it may place upon other teams and/or giving them an unfair advantage. For example, with a thinner wall, players are able to swing the bat faster, which allows the ball to go faster, harder, and further. Major League Softball, played at Recreational Parks, include a variety of teams; Men's, Women's, Co-Ed.

We also use the notations T and T' to denote the total number of the system dispatch intervals and the TCL control intervals, respectively.|$|E

30|$|The {{daily average}} grid load {{profiles}} {{for four months}} are shown in Fig.  4. As observed in the figure, the active power demand varies between 150 kW and 410 kW in the Fall season. The maximum loading without PEV loads at this transformer is 40 % of the rated power. The peak and lowest demands occur around 21 : 00 and 05 : 00, respectively. The time frame where peak loading occurs also coincides with the vehicle home arrival times. According to the triple tariff determined by the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK) of Turkey, the peak times correspond to the hours between 17 : 00 and 22 : 00. As shown in the figure, peak loading mostly occurs in these hours but also extends beyond 24 : 00. If the <b>loads</b> were <b>shaved</b> according to the peak hour definition by EPDK, the peak shaving operation would not be fulfilled effectively.

40|$|In this Thesis, {{we propose}} to utilize a battery system {{together}} with its power electronics interfaces and bidirectional charger as a distributed P-Q resource in power distribution networks. First, we present an optimization-based approach to operate such distributed P-Q resources {{based on the}} characteristics of the battery and charger system as well as the features and needs of the power distribution network. Then, we use the RTDS Simulator, which is an industry-standard simulation tool of power systems, to develop two RTDS-based design approaches. The first design is based on an ideal four-quadrant distributed P-Q power resource. The second design is based on a detailed four-quadrant distributed P-Q power resource that is developed using power electronics components. The hardware and power electronics circuitry as well as the control units are explained for the second design. After that, given the two-RTDS designs, we conducted extensive RTDS simulations to assess the performance of the designed distributed P-Q Power Resource in an IEEE 13 bus test system. We observed that the proposed design can noticeably improve the operational performance of the power distribution grid in at least four key aspects: reducing power loss, active power peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> at substation, reactive power peak <b>load</b> <b>shaving</b> at substation, and voltage regulation. We examine these performance measures across three design cases: Case 1 : There is no P-Q Power Resource available on the power distribution network. Case 2 : The installed P-Q Power Resource only supports active power, i. e., it only utilizes its battery component. Case 3 : The installed P-Q Power Resource supports both active and reactive power, i. e., it utilizes both its battery component and its power electronics charger component.

The approach {{consists of two}} stages: off-line and on-line processing. The desired level of <b>loading</b> after peak <b>shaving</b> and the time period for V 2 G service are first determined. These parameters depend only on the load profile characteristic and can be forecasted off-line. Then, the discharging power rates for PEVs connected to the grid are simultaneously determined. As the load profile varies with time, discharging PEVs at variable rates by considering the peak load level and the available capacities of PEVs would be more effective. Therefore, the discharging power rates for each PEV in V 2 G service are updated adaptively whenever a new PEV {{is connected to the}} grid for V 2 G service.|$|R
