40|$|This thesis {{present a}} path and {{navigation}} system, {{used in a}} autonomous net landing system for a fixed wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). A <b>landing</b> <b>path</b> of a UAV can be constructed as a straight line path, but {{in order for a}} UAV to follow the <b>landing</b> <b>path</b> it must be in a position from which it has a feasible path to the start position of the <b>landing</b> <b>path.</b> This motivates the development of a approach path logic towards the <b>landing</b> <b>path</b> entry position from any initial start position in the air space. In addition to a path generation system the UAV require a robust high accurate navigation system. This is accomplished by applying Real Time Kinematic GNSS (RTK-GNSS), which can provide centimeter level position accuracy. A shortcoming of the RTK-GNSS system is that it may loose its lock on satellites leading to loss of functionality. In this work this is compensated for by introducing a secondary Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) system. To handle a RTK-GNSS drop out a robust RTK-GNSS system is proposed, where previous valid RTK-GNSS position solutions are fused together with the secondary GNSS system, {{to be used as a}} compensator for the external navigation system. The compensator is designed to enable the external navigation system to achieve the same position accuracy level as the RTK-GNSS system for a short duration, until the RTK-GNSS is either reconnected or completely disconnected. With the compensator the UAV navigation system becomes robust against short drop out of the RTK-GNSS, and the availability of the RTK-GNSS is prolonged. Experimental testing, in addition to Software In the Loop (SIL) verification, of the ability of UAV to land in a stationary arbitrary placed net has been performed. For improved navigation and performance, an mobile sensor unit have been utilized to provide the required position data of the net. This sensor unit was used during testing, where it showed to provide the intended contribution...|$|R

40|$|In {{search and}} rescue (SAR) and {{emergency}} planning operations real-time response is critical, particularly when lives are endangered. Until recently, such operations were planned manually by {{experts in the field}} using tools such as templates, protractors and calculators. An initiative from the Department of National Defence of Canada has recommended the development of a prototype computerized tool to help the experts in the planning phase of these operations. This thesis, which was carried out under PRECARN project Passport, addresses two types of algorithms that are at the core of SAR and emergency planning operations: airborne path planning for surveillance and search, and <b>land</b> <b>path</b> planning for mobility analysis and rescue route determination. The major limitation associated with these algorithms is the high computational cost incurred from the treatment of vast amounts of data representing elevation, transportation networks, vegetation and other soil characteristics. In addition, the programming complexity of these algorithms is not negligible. These issues demand the high performance computing capabilities and relative ease of programming of today's multiprocessor shared-memory computers, as well as algorithms that are scalable and highly efficient. Parallel algorithms for visibility analysis and path planning using digital terrain data are proposed. The algorithms have been implemented on a Sun symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) SPARC 20 machine and integrated with the Passport airborne path planning and <b>land</b> <b>path</b> planning software. Results of experiments are presented. Some results are compared with a previous implementation on the MasPar MP- 1 and MP- 2 massively parallel computers...|$|E
40|$|Shinran (1173 - 1263 CE), {{the founder}} of True Pure Land Buddhism (Jōdo Shinshū), is widely {{appreciated}} for {{the depth of his}} psychological insight, especially his exploration of the inner dimensions of faith. Struggling with doubts and turbulent emotions, he came to the realization that in the Pure <b>Land</b> <b>path,</b> "nirvana is attained without severing karmic afflictions. " This dissertation examines the soteriological basis for this striking claim by analyzing a passage from section 9 of the Tannishō [A Record Lamenting Divergences]. In that passage, he deviates from long-held Buddhist tradition to argue that the very presence of karmic afflictions, rather than their complete elimination, is assurance of one's salvation. In interpreting this well-known passage, the dissertation brings two new perspectives to Shinran studies: his relation to traditional Tendai Amidist practices and an often overlooked terminological distinction in his writings. First, by examining his deployment and reframing of religious practice in light of his training at Enryakuji on Mt. Hiei, this dissertation uncovers striking continuitie...|$|E

40|$|Extant paper {{records of}} the early analog seismic network of Taiwan {{represent}} a large resource for earthquake studies in several disciplines. In this study, we report on T waves generated from offshore earthquakes, based on analog observations. The T phases were identified from their stable apparent velocity of about 1. 5 km s- 1 and other observations using data recorded by stations in eastern Taiwan and on two nearby islands. The observed T phases are recorded {{for the first time}} from Taiwan, and in particular are observed by the network in the distal range of local earthquakes. Most of the T waves are observed at island stations at epicentral distances greater than 100 km. For earthquakes that occurred a great distance east of Taiwan, the T phases are always the most dominant phases observed at island stations east of Taiwan, and are also seen at some inland stations with smaller amplitudes. No T phases from inland events were observed by stations on Taiwan or on nearby islands. The observations indicate that the amplitude of the T phase is highly attenuated on its <b>land</b> <b>path</b> and that the propagation direction of the T phase is affected by water depth...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the Numata Conference in Buddhist Studies / “Violence, Nonviolence, and Japanese Religions: Past, Present, and Future,” held in Honolulu, Hawaii, March 20 – 21, 2014 This paper explores Shinran’s use of {{narrative}} as {{a mode of}} reflection and a means for recognizing and coming to terms with violence—including violence suffered, but in particular the violence one has inflicted on others. The most prominent among such narratives in Shinran’s writings stems from what {{is often referred to as}} the “tragedy of RājagṛhaRajāgṛha”—the story of Ajātaśatru’s murder of his father, King Bimbisāra, and imprisonment of his mother, Vaidehī, in order to seize the throne of the kingdom of Magadha. For Shinran, this sutra narrative is a crucial element of the Buddhist teaching, a drama enacted precisely to occasion Śākyamuni’s expounding of the Pure <b>Land</b> <b>path</b> historically and to communicate the self-aware hermeneutical stance that embodies genuine engagement with it. In Shinran, narrative broadly defined as an ordered account of events, however brief, plays a significant role in the articulation of the nature of religious awareness and historical consciousness as it pervades everyday life. Here, violence signifies not primarily the overt acts of coercion or callous injury inflicted through authoritarian power or martial force, but the roots of afflicting passion scarcely beneath of surface of social life that hold the potential of moving oneself and others to irreconcilable conflict. His use {{of narrative}} to contextualize personal existence as an occurrence of Buddhist truth within the flux of temporal events may be have seen resulted from histo share characteristics of the endeavor to deal with the intense emotions resulting from violence suffered and inflicted, as depicted seen in some types of medieval tale literature and noh drama...|$|E

Yet, this is crucial for the stable expression of balanced biosynthesis pathways, i. e. for the efficient production of target molecules. To tackle this problem, we are developing a new technique called genomic Serine Integrase Recombinational Assembly (gSIRA). By exploiting the Streptomyces phiC 31 integrase and its att sites as <b>landing</b> <b>paths</b> in the yeast’s genome, a whole pathway of genes can be directionally assembled and integrated at a desired locus.
