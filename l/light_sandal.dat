Not Carmagnoles, rude 'whirlblasts of rags,' as Mercier called them 'precursors of storm and destruction:' no, soft Ionic motions; fit for the <b>light</b> <b>sandal,</b> and antique Grecian tunic! Efflorescence of Luxury has come out: for men have wealth; nay new-got wealth; and under the Terror you durst not dance except in rags. Among the innumerable kinds of Balls, let the hasty reader mark only this single one: the kind they call Victim Balls, Bals a Victime. The dancers, in choice costume, have all crape round the left arm: to be admitted, it needs that you be a Victime; that you have lost a {{relative}} under the Terror. Peace to the Dead; let us dance to their memory! For in all ways one must dance.|$|E

All were barefooted, except that Stanley wore a pair of the <b>lightest</b> leather <b>sandals.</b> They went noiselessly up to the window; the guard, as before, responding to Meinik's hiss. Without a word, one after another entered the chamber. The trooper had been sitting at the table, evidently anxiously expecting their arrival.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Travers {{clasped her}} hands behind her head. The wide sleeves {{slipping}} back bared {{her arms to}} her shoulders. She was wearing a Malay thin cotton jacket, cut low in the neck without a collar and fastened with wrought silver clasps from the throat downward. She had replaced her yachting skirt by a blue check sarong embroidered with threads of gold. Mr. Travers' eyes travelling slowly down attached themselves to the gleaming instep of an agitated foot from which hung a <b>light</b> leather <b>sandal.</b>|$|R

Joshua Belter, {{the author of}} The Book of Rules: The Right Way to Do Everything, points out that wearing socks with sandals reduces the amount of cooling feet experience.

60|$|Now Theseus was {{not wearing}} <b>light</b> shoes or <b>sandals,</b> like the golden sandals of Ægeus, which he carried in his wallet. He was wearing thick boots, with bronze nails in the soles, {{and the upper}} leathers were laced high up his legs, for the Greeks wore such boots when they took long walks on {{mountain}} roads. As soon as Theseus had trained Sciron {{to stand in the}} proper position, he bade him stoop to undo the lacings of his boots.

40|$|Farmers {{represent}} {{the largest group}} of Zlarin inhabitants. In an attempt to describe the patterns of their daily life, our research was directed at certain asp 2 ̆ 7 ects of the so-called material culture under the headings of 2 ̆ 7 habitation 2 ̆ 7 (housing and eating) and 2 ̆ 7 work 2 ̆ 7 (farming and handicraft activities). 12 ̆ 7 he aim was to establish typical developments and patterns of behaviour of Zlarin farmers between the mid-nineteenth and the mid-twentieth century. The material presented here comes from authentic statements made to the author by many Zlarinlans during her visit to the island and from her own observations. The chapter on housing discusses the prevailing building practices and describes typical forms of family housing. In addition to the architectural characteristics, the interior arrangement and furnishing are also described in considerable detail. The description includes not only the living quarters and domestic farm buildings, but also other farm buildings and structures in the village and outside. The characteristics of the two villages, Borovica and Zlarin, are dealt with {{only to the extent that}} they throw light on the patterns of life of the farmers. The dominant agricultural branches in Zlarin were olive and wine growing. Oil and wine were produced not only for the farmers 2 ̆ 7 own needs but also for the market. Vegetables from family gardens and home-grown frnits were the staple food, while wheat and barley were grown only in small quantities. Livestock breeding was mainly confined to sheep raising. For each of these activities, the annual sequence of jobs is described, together with the tools and processing utensils. The first part of the chapter on eating patterns lists the main foodstuffs and describes how meals were prepared. The foodstuffs included cereals and their products, vegetables, fruits, wild-growing edible plants, fish, meat and related products, milk and dairy products, and eggs. The second part describes the meals eaten on weekdays (with seasonal variations), then on Sundays, on the occasion of important work in the field, In connection with folk customs and village feasts, on special occasions in life, and at the time of food shortage and famine. The chapter on handicraft activities deals only with those whose traces can still be followed. The most important such activity was the making of textile articles from domestically grown and processed wool. Two other activities are also discussed: the making of <b>light</b> leather <b>sandals</b> and wicker baskets. Finally, the author notes that the material culture of the Zlarin peasants in the period under review was a product of different earlier cultures integrated in a living and dynamic mechanism in which recent elements are found side by side with elements of paleo-Mediterranean, Illyrian, Slav, Venetian-Italian, and Dinaric provenance. In this context, the role of women in the Zlarin farming society is once again stressed...|$|R
