5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of <b>local</b> <b>effect,</b> bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1944, the {{division}} returned {{north to the}} security zone, basing the infantry battalions in the villages of Kurukaja, Vukovije (south of Foča), Osmaci and Srebrnik. Almost immediately, the Partisan 3rd Corps commenced an offensive, attacking II/28 at Srebrnik. It held on despite being pressed hard during two days of fighting against the 11th Krajina Division. By {{the end of the}} first week in September, divisional supply columns were being attacked by Chetniks, sensing German weakness and looking for arms and supplies. Three members of {{the division}} were killed in these attacks. Over the same week, the Allies conducted Operation Ratweek throughout the Balkans, which involved Allied air power pounding Axis troop concentrations and key infrastructure in order to impede the German withdrawal from Greece. The <b>local</b> <b>effect</b> was to complicate the division's logistics through destruction of the Sarajevo-Brod railway and mass desertions of NDH troops tasked with securing supply lines.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this <b>local</b> <b>effect</b> on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
40|$|Health risks {{resulting}} from occupational exposure to chemicals {{are controlled by}} the establishment of acceptable dermal and respiratory exposure levels. Due {{to a lack of}} route-specific toxicity data, acceptable levels are frequently established by means of route-to-route extrapolation. A pitfall in route-to-route extrapolation is the occurrence of <b>local</b> <b>effects.</b> Often, the results of acute irritation studies are used to assess the likelihood of the occurrence of <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> also following repeated exposure and thereby the validity of route-to-route extrapolation. We questioned this working practice and considered whether <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> observed in a given study are of any predictive value with respect to the occurrence of <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> after repeated exposure. Our database analysis indicates that substances inducing skin and/or eye irritation frequently induce <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> after repeated respiratory exposure. In contrast, observations made in any type of study show little or no positive predictive value for the occurrence of <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> after repeated dermal exposure. Notably, the absence of any indication of <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> in any type of study does not exclude the occurrence of <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> on repeated dermal or respiratory exposure. We conclude that the presumed reliability of route-to-route extrapolation in the absence of route-specific toxicity data can be questioned. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

25|$|Snakebite {{first aid}} {{recommendations}} vary, {{in part because}} different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little <b>local</b> <b>effect,</b> but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom {{in the region of}} the bite by pressure immobilization is desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and immobilization may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy. Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary.|$|E
40|$|Land-cover change (LCC) happens locally. However, {{in almost}} all {{simulation}} studies assessing biogeophysical climate <b>effects</b> of LCC, <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> (due to alterations in a model grid box) are mingled with nonlocal effects (due to changes in wide-ranging climate circulation). This study presents a method to robustly identify <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> by changing land surface properties in selected “LCC boxes” (where <b>local</b> plus nonlocal <b>effects</b> are present), while leaving others unchanged (where only nonlocal effects are present). While this study focuses on the climate effects of LCC, the method presented here is applicable to any land surface process that is acting locally but is capable of influencing wide-ranging climate when applied on a larger scale. Concerning LCC, the method is more widely applicable than methods used in earlier studies. The study illustrates the possibility of validating simulated <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> by comparison to observations {{on a global scale}} and contrasts the underlying mechanisms of <b>local</b> and nonlocal <b>effects.</b> In the MPI-ESM, the change in background climate induced by extensive deforestation is not strong enough to influence the <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> substantially, at least as long as sea surface temperatures are not affected. Accordingly, the <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> within a grid box are largely independent of the number of LCC boxes in the isolation approach...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the one-dimensional modulation instability of broad optical beams in biased photo refractive-photovoltaic crystals under steady-state conditions. We obtain the one-dimensional modulation instability growth rate by globally treating the space-charge field and by considering distinction between values of Eo in nonlocal <b>effects</b> and <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> in the space-charge field, where Eo is the field constant correlated with terms in the space-charge field, which depends on the external bias field, the bulk photovoltaic effect, and {{the ratio of the}} optical beam&# 39;s intensity to that of the dark irradiance. The one-dimensional modulation instability growth rate in <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> can be determined from that in nonlocal effects. When the bulk photovoltaic effect is neglectable, irrespective of distinction between values of Eo in nonlocal <b>effects</b> and <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> in the space-charge field, the one-dimensional modulation instability growth rates in nonlocal <b>effects</b> and <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> are those of broad optical beams studied previously in biased photorefractive-nonphotovoltaic crystals. When the external bias field is absent, the one-dimensional modulation instability growth rates in nonlocal <b>effects</b> and <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> predict those of broad optical beams in open- and closed-circuit photorefractive-photovoltaic crystals.

The Labor government says the project's western section may still be built, though not in the government's first term. The government initially proposed its West Gate Distributor as a lower-cost port link for heavy freight vehicles, but in early 2015 unveiled plans by infrastructure company Transurban to build the multibillion-dollar Western Distributor as a more expansive route, providing a second major river crossing and a partial western bypass in the city's inner west.

For, in fact, with double coppers the sectional area of the interposed acid becomes nearly double that with single coppers, and therefore it more freely transfers the electricity. Double coppers are, however, effective, mainly because they virtually double the acting surface of the zinc, or nearly so; for in a trough with single copper plates and the usual construction of cells, that surface of zinc which is not opposed to a copper surface is thrown almost entirely out of voltaic action, yet the acid continues to act upon it and the metal is dissolved, producing very little more than <b>local</b> <b>effect</b> (947. 996).

Dr. Arnott was informed that death usually took place within an hour; that the hairs and nails dropped off after death, and it was believed that the application of heat assisted its poisonous qualities.

At the core junctions, large stress gradients occur owing to local bending {{of the face}} sheets and tension and compression of the adjacent cores.

Analytical estimates of the boundaries of adiabatic behaviour are made which show that TSA cannot capture the <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> using practical loading frequencies with thin aluminium face sheets, and this is confirmed experimentally. An experimental model of the sandwich beam is designed that shows that the <b>local</b> <b>effects</b> can be captured using TSA.
