40|$|The {{effects of}} glucose on renal {{bicarbonate}} reabsorption were investigated in the dog. The infusion of {{small amounts of}} glucose calculated to slightly exceed the renal threshold for glucose absorption increased bicarbonate reabsorption in bicarbonate <b>loaded</b> <b>dogs.</b> Galactose in similar doses also increased the reabsorption of filtered bicarbonate. This effect is not due to insulin secretion since insulin alone did not alter bicarbonate reabsorption and the infusion of glucose into alloxan-diabetic dogs given a steady infusion of insulin also enhanced bicarbonate reabsorption. It {{is more likely that}} the increased tubular reabsorption of glucose, secondary to an increased filtered load, resulted in the increase in bicarbonate reabsorption since phlorizin reversibly inhibits the effect of glucose...|$|R
60|$|To {{make matters}} worse, this {{dangerous}} river travel {{could not be}} done in the dark, and their working day was reduced to the six hours of twilight. Every moment was precious, and they strove never to lose one. Thus, before the first hint of the coming of gray day, camp was broken, sled <b>loaded,</b> <b>dogs</b> harnessed, and the two men crouched waiting over the fire. Nor did they make the midday halt to eat. As it was, they were running far behind their schedule, each day eating into the margin they had run up. There were days when they made fifteen miles, and days when they made a dozen. And there was one bad stretch where in two days they covered nine miles, being compelled to turn their backs three times on the river and to portage sled and outfit over the mountains.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1981, the Strange Tenants [...] {{played their}} first ever gig at the Lygon St Festival. Tours around Australia and support gigs with {{overseas}} touring bands like UB40, U2 and the Style Council helped broaden their appeal outside the ska scene. The main venues {{in the early}} 1980s Melbourne ska scene were the Aberdeen Hotel (an old hotel in Fitzroy later to be renamed the <b>Loaded</b> <b>Dog),</b> the Bat Cave (a small mod-oriented venue in Richmond), the Greyhound Hotel (Richmond) and The Chevron Hotel. A pivotal figure in the Melbourne ska scene was 'Aunty' Carol Baxter who, in the early days, managed both Strange Tenants and No Nonsense and booked and promoted all the bands at the Aberdeen Hotel. As the ska bands of the eighties were playing the style of UK bands The Specials, Madness and The Beat, a style known as Two Tone it was this brand of ska that was introduced to Australian audiences. Australian bands quickly developed strong followings that could support many ska bands with No Nonsense and Loonee Tunes often working five nights a week.|$|R

40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} (VL) control {{strategies in}} Brazil {{are based on}} the early detection and treatment of the patients, vector control by insecticide and the serological screening and euthanasia of positive dogs. Thus, canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) diagnosis must accurately identify canine reservoir hosts to ensure the efficiency of screening. Considering that the humoral immune response of dogs to natural Leishmania spp. infection is dependent on parasite load, our aim was to evaluate if outcomes of the diagnostic kits currently used in canine seroepidemiological surveys in Brazil (DPP-BioManguinhos™ rapid test and EIA-ELISA Indirect ELISA BioManguinhos™) could be related to the blood parasite <b>loads</b> in <b>dogs.</b> Six hundred and 10 dogs from the VL endemic region of Northwest São Paulo State were sampled for this evaluation. Positivity varied from 15. 9 to 68. 4 % between diagnostic techniques, due to differences in test sensitivity and specificity.

40|$|Animals that {{scavenge}} in {{and around}} human localities need to utilize {{a broad range of}} resources. Preference for any one kind of food, under such circumstances, might be inefficient. Indian free-ranging dogs, Canis lupus familiaris are scavengers that are heavily dependent on humans for sustaining their omnivorous diet. The current study suggests that because of evolutionary <b>load,</b> these <b>dogs,</b> which are descendants of the decidedly carnivorous gray wolf, still retain a preference for meat though they live on carbohydrate-rich resources. The plasticity in their diet probably fosters efficient scavenging in a competitive environment, while a thumb rule for preferentially acquiring specific nutrients enables them to sequester proteins from the carbohydrate-rich environment...|$|R
40|$|The present {{studies were}} {{designed}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that midline laparotomy promotes selective inhibition of the transversus abdominis muscle during cough as it does during expiratory threshold <b>loading.</b> Anesthetized <b>dogs</b> were studied in the supine posture, and cough was induced by mechanical stimulation of the airways. Midline laparotomy had virtually no effect on the cough-induced activation of the triangularis sterni or the external oblique. On the other hand, the activation of the transversus abdominis was markedly reduced in all animals. Despite this marked inhibition, however, peak pleural pressure and expiratory flow were preserved. This suggests that this inhibition does not {{play a significant role in}} determining the occurrence of bronchopulmonary infection after abdominal surgery.

40|$|Effects of {{angiotensin}} II on plasma {{antidiuretic hormone}} and renal water excretion. The effects of intravenous (i. v.) and intracarotid (IC) angiotensin II (AII) infusion on systemic and renal hemodynamics, renal water excretion, and plasma antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels {{were examined in}} six conscious <b>dogs</b> under water <b>loaded</b> and hydropenic conditions. In {{the first group of}} seven studies, AII in a mean dose of 12. 7 ng/kg/min was administered i. v. to water <b>loaded</b> <b>dogs.</b> The infusion induced a significant increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP, 99 to 118 mm Hg, P < 0. 001), and significant reductions in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR, 67 to 57 ml/min, P < 0. 05) and para-aminohippurate clearance (CPAH, 280 to 212 ml/min, P < 0. 005) occurred. Despite this decrement in renal hemodynamics, urine remained maximally dilute (Uosm, 58 to 61 mOsm/kg H 2 O, NS). Furthermore, plasma ADH was suppressed maximally after water load and did not increase after i. v. AII infusion. The IC infusion of AII (mean dose 5. 8 ng/kg/min) produced similar changes in hemodynamics; plasma ADH remained undetectable. When AII was administered i. v. to hydropenic animals (mean dose 8. 3 ng/kg/min), MAP again increased (86 to 111 mm Hg, P < 0. 001) as GFR (81. 3 to 68. 6 ml/min, NS) and CPAH (291 to 223 ml/min, P < 0. 05) declined modestly. In these animals, Uosm decreased significantly (1429 to 1114 mOsm/kg H 20, P < 0. 005) and plasma ADH did not change significantly (1. 66 to 1. 88 pg/ml, NS). When IC AII (4 ng/kg/min) was repeated in hydropenic dogs pretreated with indomethacin, neither Usom (1787 to 1664 mOsm/kg H 2 O, NS) nor plasma ADH were altered. In summary, these results provide no evidence for an effect of AII to alter water excretion or plasma ADH either in {{the presence or absence of}} prostaglandin inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Dogs {{infected}} with Leishmania infantum showed {{a reduction in}} the number of lymphocytes T. PD- 1 (Programmed cell death 1) a new member of the B 7 -CD 28 family, it is expressed by cells of the immune system and its binding to PD-L 1 (CD 274) or PD-L 2 (CD 273) induces deactivation of T cells or apoptosis. This study aimed to evaluate the PD- 1 expression and its ligands as well as their role in T lymphocyte induction of apoptosis, TNF-α and IL- 4 secretion, nitric oxide production and parasite <b>load</b> in <b>dogs</b> with visceral leishmaniasis.

40|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used bioresorbable scaffold is made of beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP); it is hoped that scaffolds made of a mixture of hydroxyapatite (HA) and poly-D/L-lactide (PDLLA) will be able to act as novel bioresorbable scaffolds. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the utility of a HA/PDLLA scaffold compared to β-TCP, at a <b>loading</b> site. <b>Dogs</b> underwent surgery to replace a section of tibial bone with a bioresorbable scaffold. After the follow-up period, the scaffold was subjected to histological analysis. The HA/PDLLA scaffold showed similar bone formation and superior cell and tissue infiltration compared to the β-TCP scaffold, as seen after Villanueva Goldner staining. Moreover, silver staining and immunohistochemistry for Von Willebrand factor and cathepsin K demonstrated better cell infiltration in the HA/PDLLA scaffold. The fibrous tissue and cells that had infiltrated into the HA/PDLLA scaffold tested positive for collagen type I and RUNX 2, respectively, indicating that the tissue and cells that had infiltrated into the HA/PDLLA scaffold had the potential to differentiate into bone. The HA/PDLLA scaffold is therefore likely to find clinical application as a new bioresorbable scaffold...|$|R

40|$|It {{seems clear}} that {{potassium}} metabolism may be disturbed {{in the presence of}} renal disease. The variation of serum potassium in chronic renal diseases were analysed on the aspect of the renal ability to excrete potassium, and the renal mechanisms of potassium excretion were researched in experimental animals. The results obtained are summarized as follows. The concentration of serum potassium in chronic renal diseases were observed to be mostly within the normal range. The considerable variation in values for serum potassium appeared in chronic renal insufficiency, but among patients who have similar high degree of chronic renal lesion, the values of serum potassium were increased in some and normal or even subnormal in others. But it is evident that the content of potassium in the serum may become abnormally high not only at the terminal phase but in many cases with renal insufficiency below GFR 30 ml/min. In these cases of renal insufficiency, TRFk were found to be fall, on the other hand the values of potassium clearance were decreased. Therefore, the renal abilities to excrete and support potassium were both disturbed in these cases. The concentration of urine potassium in renal insufficiency were usually fixed to be dilute, including diurnal and daily and when the hypertonic solutions were loaded. Therefore, the appearances of the abnormalities of serum potassium in chronic renal failures were influenced by the amount of their volumes of urine. In several cases with severe renal failure excreted potassium in urine exceeded the amount that was filtered, suggesting of tubular secretion of potassium. In <b>dogs</b> <b>loading</b> potassium with similar pathologic condition to these clinical cases, the renal mechanism of potassium excretion were analysed by clearance methods, including the loading of several hypertonic solutions and stop-flow method. The observation might give a result that urinary excreted potassium : glomerular filtered potassium ratio was greater than unit, indicating secretion of potassium from proximal tubule. In <b>dog</b> <b>loading</b> potassium with experimentally produced lesion of the proximal tubules, similar data to the pattern of urinary potassium excetion in clinical observations was obtained...|$|R
40|$|When {{dogs are}} fed or infused with sodium chloride, sodium {{excretion}} and glomerular filtra-tion rate (GFR) both increase. Since filtered sodium usually increases more than sodium ex-cretion (1, 2), {{it is commonly}} assumed that the sodium diuresis {{can be explained by}} the increase in filtered load (3). It has occasionally been sug-gested, however, that augmented sodium excretion is due to decreased tubular reabsorption of so-dium rather than to increased filtration. For ex-ample, de Wardener, Mills, Clapham, and Hayter (4) recently reached this conclusion from experi-ments in which saline was infused into mineralo-corticoid-treated dogs. In about one-half of their studies, sodium excretion increased in spite of ap-parent decreases in GFR. The error of measurement of GFR is probably about 5 % (5). Since sodium excretion even at the height of a saline diuresis is usually a small fraction of filtered sodium, it is difficult to rule out the possibility that small errors in measure-ment are sufficient to account for occasional in-stances of apparent dissociation between filtered and excreted sodium. To circumvent this diffi-culty in the present experiments, an aortic clamp has been used to reduce GFR reproducibly be-low control levels after saline <b>loading</b> in <b>dogs</b> treated with mineralocorticoids. Since under these conditions sodium excretion is nevertheless increased above control rates, part of the sodium diuresis that follows saline administration in the dog must be due to a factor other than increased filtered load or decreased mineralocorticoid activ-ity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Leishmania infantum chagasi liver {{parasite}} load {{was compared}} to hemostatic abnormalities, {{as well as to}} clinical, laboratorial, and histopathological findings in dogs with visceral leishmaniasis. The liver parasite <b>load</b> of 30 <b>dogs</b> L. infantum chagasi naturally-infected was evaluated by quantitative real- time PCR and the results were compared with serum biochemistry and primary and secondary hemostasis findings. Moreover, hepatic histological lesions were described in these dogs. Prolonged bleeding time, prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), were observed in the group with visceral leishmaniasis. Eleven dogs presented inflammatory liver lesions, with predominance of mild multifocal mononuclear periportal hepatitis. No association between the presence of parasites and abnormalities in screening tests was observed by Spearman&# 8217;s rank correlation coefficient. The clinical progression in leishmaniasis is associated with the occurrence of hemorrhagic diathesis, which depends not only on the presence of the parasite but also the inflammatory process, compromised immunological response, hepatic and renal failure in symptomatic dogs...|$|R

40|$|Systemic {{chemotherapy}} is {{not effective}} {{in the treatment of}} prostate-confined cancer. We developed biodegradable, doxorubicin-loaded cylinders for intraprostatic implantation and evaluated the feasibility of using regional intraprostatic drug therapy to treat prostate-confined cancer. Cylinders were prepared using poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) or PLG copolymers. The in vitro and in vivo drug release, intraprostatic pharmacokinetics, and histopathology in dogs implanted with the cylinders were studied. The doxorubicin-loaded cylinders made of PLG polymers of 7. 9 to 54 kDa molecular weight (MW) had a diameter of ∼ 800 μm, drug loading of 10 % to 30 % (wt/wt), and even distribution of crystalline drug throughout the matrix. Burst release varied from 3 % to 73 %, and 7 -day cumulative release from 4 % to 90 %. Decreasing polymer MW and increasing drug loading were associated with higher initial burst release and overall release rates. The in vivo drug release from cylinders (33 -kDa PLG, 30 % drug <b>loading)</b> in <b>dog</b> prostates was rapid (∼ 80 % in 48 hours). Spatial drug distribution, visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy, showed high concentrations confined to the lobule containing the implant (referred to as the implanted lobule), with steep concentration gradients over the septa separating the lobules. Concentrations in the implanted lobule were about 8 times higher than concentrations delivered by an intravenous injection. The implants caused necrotic cell death in the implanted lobule, without damage to prostatic nerve bundles or the urethra. These results indicate the feasibility of using biodegradable PLG cylinders as intraprostatic implants to selectively deliver high drug concentrations to prostate tissue...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} relationship between vascular smooth muscle α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes was investigated by simultaneous measurement of contractile and fluorescence ratio in fura- 2 <b>loaded</b> rings of <b>dog</b> saphenous vein (DSV). Prazosin, {{as well as}} rauwolscine, at 0. 1 μM, substantially antagonized contractions and associated cytosolic [Ca 2 +] rises induced by UK 14304, while rauwolscine, as well as prazosin, antagonized similar effects of phenylephrine (PE). These antagonisms were characterized by a parallel rightward shift of the concentration-response curves. In the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, PE as well as UK 14304 caused simultaneous transient elevation of contractile force and cytosolic [Ca 2 +], although the UK 14304 responses were smaller than PE responses. We propose that DSV smooth muscle cells possess interacting α 1 - and α 2 -ARs which have overlapping functional domain sensitive to the agonists and antagonists of either α-AR subtype. Both α-AR subtypes appear to utilize similar signaling mechanisms via Ca 2 + release from the same intracellular stores and Ca 2 + entry across the plasma membrane...|$|R
