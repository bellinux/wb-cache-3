40|$|High {{precision}} weighing <b>lysimeter</b> allow a {{more reliable}} water flux estimation across the upper- and lower boundary of soils [1]. In recent years, much {{work has been}} done on <b>lysimeter</b> design [2, 3] and on the processing of <b>lysimeter</b> weight records affected by noise [4 - 9]. Noise prone measurements prevent a direct estimation of water fluxes from <b>lysimeter</b> weight changes as each small increase or decrease of weight change will be interpreted as precipitation or evapotranspiration. Therefore the estimation of precipitation and evapotranspiration from high resolution <b>lysimeter</b> data depends on the appropriate use and functionality of the noise reduction method (filter-algorithm). However it is still unclear how to validate the procedure of individual state of the art filter-algorithms [10] on <b>lysimeter</b> observations, as long as noise affect the change of the <b>lysimeter</b> weight. The lack of a known noise free reference water flux on the upper <b>lysimeter</b> boundary (e. g. precipitation) makes it impossible to validate and to compare the impact of different filter-algorithms on the estimation of precipitation or evapotranspiration from <b>lysimeter</b> measurements. In order to define the impact of different filter–algorithms on the separation of water exchange between the soil-plant–atmosphere continuums, we will present an experimental <b>lysimeter</b> set-up with a predefined upper boundary condition for several precipitation events. Within our experimental approach, we will apply a known input “precipitation” signal from a permanently weighted (high resolution 1 g) water reservoir on the <b>lysimeter</b> upper boundary. The <b>lysimeter</b> surface will be covered to omit weight changes due to evaporation or transpiration processes and the irrigation water will be collected in a tank which will be installed {{on the top of the}} <b>lysimeter.</b> Three different irrigation events which can be distinguished by its irrigation intensity will be used to measure parallel the noise free (irrigation) and the noise affected weight change of precipitation on the <b>lysimeter.</b> The experimental set-up enables us to validate the performance of different state of the art filter-algorithms by a comparison of the derived goodness of fit between the observed (irrigation) and processed precipitation (filter-algorithms) data’s.   1.

Initially, plans were made to use a datalogger owned by the USWB to collect the data. However, it is not reliable, and a system of strip chart recorders had to be procured to record the data. This proved to be time consuming, and subjected the data to possible human error when it was reduced to numerical form from the strip charts. Research-Results - Either the combination method of van Bavel or the Bowen Ratio will provide a fair estimate of evaporation from a wet soil surface in the area. In general, the combination method tends to overestimate while the Bowen Ratio tends to underestimate evaporation. This {{is due to the}} fact that the combination method places a strong emphasis on this parameter. Average wind speeds in the area commonly exceed 4 m/sec. Conductivity Studies - The conductivity of the Olton loam soil is very low at fairly low soil water pressures corresponding to high contents. This is an asset in preventing evaporation losses, but may be detrimental to crop production in that the crops need to develop extensive root systems to use the stored soil moisture. Canopy Effects on Evaporation - Evaporation within a cotton crop canopy following rains is related to the net radiation reaching the soil surface.

The added bacterial pathogens were not found in any leachate samples during the entire study period of 212 days. Under the study conditions with repacked soil, limited macropores and low water velocity, bacterial pathogens seemed to be retained in the soil matrix and died-off before leaching to groundwater. However, viruses may leach to groundwater and represent a health risk as for some viruses only few virus particles are needed to cause human disease. The bacterial pathogens and the phage 28 B were found on the potato samples harvested just after the application of microbial tracers was terminated. The findings of bacterial pathogens and phage 28 on all potato samples suggest that the main risk associated with subsurface drip irrigation with low quality water is faecal contamination of root crops, in particular those consumed raw...|$|R
