40|$|Auroral kilometric {{radiation}} (AKR) is a high-density {{radio wave}} radiation {{in the frequency}} band from 50 to 750 kHz, with a peak around 250 kHz, that has been observed emanating from the auroral zone. In connection with its low frequency, the radiation can not penetrate through the ionosphere to earth, so all observations {{have been made by}} satellite. The AKR is closely correlated with the occurrence of discrete auroral arcs, which are believed to be generated by intense inverted V electron precipitation bands. A review is presented of several theories which have been proposed to explain the observed AKR. Attention is given to the conversion of electron cyclotron wave to O mode, the coherent amplification of gyroemission by velocity space instabilities, beam-driven electromagnetic instability via low-frequency turbulence, soliton radiation, <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>instability,</b> nonlinear beating of electrostatic waves, and the beam amplification of electromagnetic wave via coherent EIC density fluctuations...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two body relaxation in a spherical {{system with}} a <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> Considering two-dimensional angular momentum space, we focus on "empty loss cone" systems, where the typical scattering during a dynamical time j_d is smaller than {{the size of the}} <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> j_ lc. As a result, the occupation number within the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> is significantly smaller than outside. Classical diffusive treatment of this regime predict exponentially small occupation number deep in the <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> We revisit this classical derivation of occupancy distribution of objects in the empty <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> regime. We emphasize the role of the rare large scatterings and show that the occupancy does not decay exponentially within the <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> but it is rather flat, with a typical value ∼ [(j_d/j_ lc) ]^ 2 ^- 2 (j_ lc/j_) compared to the occupation in circular angular momentum (where j_ is the smallest possible scattering). Implication are that although the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> for tidal break of Giants or binaries is typically empty, tidal events which occurs significantly inside the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> (β≳ 2), are almost as common as those with β 1 where β is the ratio between the tidal radius and the periastron. The probability for event with penetration factor >β decreases only as β^- 1 rather than exponentially.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} for the possible diurnal modulation of outer radiation belt electron precipitation {{by considering the}} effect of the convection electric field on geomagnetically trapped electrons. The modulation flux is the flux due to electrons in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> i. e., those which drift into the bounce <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> The electron flux in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> is related to the time allowable for diffusion from the stably trapped population to the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> for precipitation at a specific geographic location. This time, which is termed the maximum L-shell lifetime, is obtained by computing electron trajectories, using a realistic magnetic field model and a simple model for the electric field. The maximum L-shell lifetimes are taken to be the times between successive entries into the bounce <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> Conservation of the first two adiabatic invariants, as electrons are slowly energized by the convection electric field, leads to variations in pitch angle, maximum L-shell lifetimes, and, consequently, to changes in the electron flux in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> These results are compared with observations of precipitating electrons made with sounding rocket payloads...|$|R

Some {{characteristics}} of sudden decreases in the observed radio emission {{from the sun}} at decameter wavelengths are presented, and possible interpretations are discussed. These 'absorption bursts' occurred during periods of steady continuum emission and also during long duration emission bursts.

The {{most common type of}} burst was one in which the fall in intensity and subsequent rise are smooth and structureless. Other types of bursts were characterized by their split time profiles or by their long duration.

40|$|International audienceTwo {{electron}} heating {{events have}} been identified on 20 May 1996 when Polar was in the polar cap/polar cusp boundary layer. The electron heating events were located within magnetic holes/cavities/bubbles and were accompanied by nonlinear ± 14 nT peak-to-peak (f ~ 0. 6 to 0. 7 f cp) obliquely propagating proton cyclotron waves. The electrons appear to be heated isotropically. Electric bipolar pulse (electron hole) onset events were also detected within the heating events. We propose a scenario which can link the above phenomena. Nonlinear Alfvén waves, generated through cusp magnetic reconnection, propagate down magnetic field lines and locally heat electrons through the ponderomotive force. The magnetic cavity is created through the diamagnetic effect of the heated electrons. Ion heating also occurs through ponderomotive acceleration (but {{much less than the}} electrons) and the protons generate the electromagnetic proton cyclotron waves through the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>instability.</b> The obliquely propagating electromagnetic proton cyclotron waves accelerate bi-streaming electrons, which are the source of free energy for the electron holes...|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} by Zhou et al. (2003), an approaching fast-moving forward shock compresses the magnetosphere, {{leading to a}} smaller cavity by moving the magnetopause earthward, which consequently increases the magnetic field. Both effects produce a heating of the plasma in the perpendicular direction and increases the temperature anisotropy under the assumption of the conserved first adiabatic invariant. The <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>instability</b> will occur and subsequently result in plasma wave growth, such as whistler mode chorus waves mentioned above. It is known that the increasing instability of plasma wave is capable of causing pitch angle scattering and has the strongest growth at the equator plane (Zhou and Tsurutani 1999). Thus, the waves are the most intense near the equatorial plane. The instability grows after the SI onset and wave-particle interactions subsequently produce abundant electron precipitation. Those electrons entering the loss cone due to the adiabatic compression will precipitate along the geomagnetic field lines into the polar atmosphere and uniformly distribute in large area (Tsurutani et al. 2001). The precipitating particles with enhanced energy flux collide with the atmospheric atoms and molecules, producing unstructured diffuse-type aurora with no sharp structure as shown in Fig.  4. We thus interpret the fast poleward-moving signature presented in Fig.  4 {{as the result of}} the onset of energetic electron-wide falling, rather than as a material motion.|$|E
40|$|A {{model in}} which a {{partially}} filled drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> plays a prominent role is presently used to investigate relativistic electron data obtained by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program spacecraft in the outer belt region. The good agreement obtained between model predictions and observations indicates that electron drift in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> which is known to dominate electron precipitation phenomena at lower latitudes, is also important at outer beta latitudes. In conjunction with the degree of partial filling of the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> this effect indicates that slow pitch angle diffusion dominates the morphology of outer belt electrons. It is concluded {{that half of the}} electron precipitation from the outer belt is due to wave-particle interactions, and the other half by auroral activity and electron drift in the drift <b>loss</b> <b>cone...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{second type}} of event, with an {{apparent}} upward-going conic (58 % of observations), has a similar <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> to the first, but with enhanced flux surrounding this <b>loss</b> <b>cone.</b> The flux enhancement consists of “wings” on the upward-going half of the distribution extending in the perpendicular velocity direction, suggestive of perpendicular heating of the electrons. As above, the width and depth of the observed <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> varies {{among the members of}} this population, but the form of the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> and the apparent oblique flux enhancement remains very consistent in the solar wind frame. The energy dependent <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> clearly appears in all frames, indicating a truly energy-dependent reflection process. The conic, on the other hand, appears more prominently in the solar wind frame than the dHT frame, indicating that it arises partly from reflection from a moving obstacle, as also observed in the terrestrial foreshock (Fitzenreiter et al., 1990). In essence, the conic results partially from the parallel translation in velocity space of a <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> distribution. However, a weak conic signature also remains in the dHT frame, possibly indicating that some other heating process operates. Alternatively, this signature could result from errors in our frame transformation over crustal magnetic fields or from non-adiabatic effects resulting from the small spatial scale of the reflection region.|$|R
30|$|The first type of event, with no {{apparent}} upward-going flux enhancement (30 % of observations), does in fact display features broadly consistent with adiabatic reflection of the incoming solar wind distribution. The energy dependence of the <b>loss</b> <b>cone,</b> on average, suggests {{the presence of a}} negative potential on the order of a few tens of volts below the spacecraft, located between the spacecraft and the surface. This inferred value varies among the members of this population, but the form of the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> remains very consistent. Individual observations have a sharper <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> than the median distribution presented herein (since averaging over variability inevitably “smears out” this feature), but we never observe perfectly sharp <b>loss</b> <b>cones,</b> possibly indicating the presence of processes that act to smooth out the sharp discontinuity in the electron distribution at the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> boundary. We find a smaller amount of energy dependence in the dHT frame, indicating that the energy dependence results partly from reflection from a moving obstacle. However, the reflection process apparently has some intrinsic energy dependence even in the dHT frame, consistent with reflection by a downward parallel electric field.|$|R
30|$|Other conic {{formation}} mechanisms include parallel heating/acceleration by time-varying electric fields (Andre and Eliasson, 1992) {{or other}} stochastic mechanisms (Temerin and Cravens, 1990), and perpendicular wave heating (Menietti and Burch, 1985; Roth et al., 1989). Parallel heating alone probably cannot explain the observed conics, given the enhanced perpendicular flux (Temerin and Cravens, 1990). One interesting possibility is a perpendicular heating mechanism identified by Roth et al. (1989), {{consisting of a}} <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>instability</b> that excites upper hybrid waves, which in turn heat electrons in the perpendicular direction. This mechanism {{has a number of}} attractive features. First the mechanism requires both a warm electron population with a loss cone distribution, and a cold electron distribution. At the Moon, the incoming solar wind distribution naturally provides the former, and the component of photoelectrons and/or secondary electrons that escapes from the near-surface sheath region naturally provides the latter. The predicted heating resulting from this process should be efficient at parallel electron velocities a few times the thermal speed of the warm population, or in our case a few tens of eV, in relatively good agreement with our observations. Furthermore, this model naturally provides for different efficiencies of conic generation above crustal magnetic fields, since the mechanism will likely vary in efficiency with the size of the loss cone, and with the ratio of escaping cold flux from the surface to incident and/or reflected solar wind flux.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that highly anisotropic electron pancake distributions are the result of pitch angle diffusion by electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic (ECH) and whistler mode waves in the equatorial region. Here we present pitch angle diffusion rates for ECH wave spectra centered at different frequencies with respect to the electron gyrofrequency Ωe corresponding to spacecraft observations. The wave spectra are carefully mapped to the correct resonant electron velocities. We show that previous diffusion calculations of ECH waves at 1. 5 Ωe, driven by the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>instability,</b> result in large diffusion rates confined to a small range of pitch angles near the loss cone and therefore cannot account for pancake distributions. However, when the wave spectrum is centered at higher frequencies in the band (> 1. 6 Ωe), the diffusion rates become very small inside the loss cone, peak just outside, and remain large over a wide range of pitch angles up to 60 ° or more. When the upper hybrid resonance frequency ωUHR is several times Ωe, ECH waves excited in higher bands also contribute significantly to pitch angle diffusion outside the loss cone up to very large pitch angles. We suggest that ECH waves driven by a loss cone could form pancake distributions as they grow if the wave spectrum extends from the middle to {{the upper part of the}} first (and higher) gyroharmonic bands. Alternatively, we suggest that pancake distributions can be formed by outward propagation in a nonhomogeneous medium, so that resonant absorption occurs at higher frequencies between (n + ½) and (n + 1) Ωe in regions where waves are also growing locally at < 1. 5 Ωe. The calculated diffusion rates suggest that ECH waves with amplitudes of the order of l mV m− 1 can form pancake distributions from an initially isotropic distribution on a timescale of a few hours. This is consistent with recent CRRES observations of ECH wave amplitudes following substorm injections near geostationary orbit and the timescales for pancake formation. Persistent but much weaker ECH waves can further intensify and maintain pancake distributions during magnetically quiet periods...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we perform a {{statistical}} analysis of the ionospheric echo response observed by six radars of the SuperDARN network in the Northern Hemisphere, over 236 Sudden Impulses (SI) of solar wind dynamic pressure events (from 1997 through 2000). For that purpose, we make use of MRS, the Mean Rate of Scattering, {{as a function of}} time during the SI event. We classify the events in sudden increases (I events, 144 cases) and decreases (D events, 92 cases) of the solar wind dynamic pressure. Moreover, we make use of the AE index to define two distinct conditions of the ionosphere under which each event may take place: Quiet and Disturbed. Regarding Quiet conditions, for both I and D events, we find that MRS displays an increase related to the SI time. On the contrary, for Disturbed conditions, D events display an increase in MRS, while I events show a clear dip. The similarity of response for I and D events under Quiet conditions is briefly discussed, but the smaller number of D events does not allow one to further analyse them. As for the I events, a latitudinal analysis shows that the MRS increase for Quiet conditions is seen both at low latitudes (60 °– 70 ° ?) and at high latitudes (70 °– 80 ° ?); for Disturbed Is the MRS decrease is stronger at high latitudes. We suggest that the MRS increase for Quiet Is can be due to two different mechanisms: 1) a soft electron precipitation induced by Field Line Resonances (FLR) or <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>instability</b> at lower latitudes; 2) an enlargement of the cusp at higher latitudes, which in turn may induce enhanced particle precipitation. For what concerns Disturbed Is, the MRS decrease can be produced by a higher energy electron precipitation (> 1 keV), that enhances the electron density in the E and D regions. This provokes a strong absorbtion of the radio waves in the D region and a higher refraction in the E region, leading to a decrease in MRS, especially at higher latitudes. For I events a further classification has been {{made on the basis of}} IMF orientation: this suggests that the effects summarized above are due to the SI itself. Keywords.

In this paper, the dependence of the resonant loss on the density, the temperature, the magnetic field, the magnetic axis and the pitch angle is clarified. According to the present analysis, the dip in the spectrum becomes deeper with the outer shift of the magnetic axis. The dependence of the dip depth on the density or temperature, i. e., the electric field is in accord with theoretical prediction.

40|$|The {{stability}} of ring current protons with an injection spectrum modeled by a <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> distribution function is examined for typical ring current parameters. It is {{found that a}} quasi-electrostatic ion <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> mode can be excited with frequencies just below and growth rates {{of the order of}} 0. 01 times the ion plasma frequency. The instability is strongest in the moderate beta about equal to 1, low-density region just outside the plasmapause; for the beta much greater than 1 auroral regions and the high-density plasmasphere the mode is nearly stable. For the same ring current parameters the electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave is almost nonconvectively unstable, with growth rates of the order of 0. 1 times the ion cyclotron frequency. The combination of the two unstable modes results in a large quasi-linear diffusion coefficient throughout most of the proton velocity space. Unless it is maintained by rapid inward convection, the ring current injection anisotropy will be reduced by diffusion toward the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> on time scales short in comparison to the minimum precipitation lifetime...|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} a two stage model of dichromatic color perception {{that consists of}} a first sensor layer with gain control followed by an opponent encoding transformation. We propose a method for estimating the unknown parameters in the model by utilizing pre-existing data from psychophysical experiments on unilateral dichromats. The model is validated using this existing data and by using predictions on known test images for detecting dichromacy. Using the model and analysis we evaluate the feasibility of <b>cone</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>cone</b> replacement hypotheses that have previously been proposed for modeling dichromatic color vision. Results indicate that the two stage model offers good agreement with test data. The <b>cone</b> <b>loss</b> and <b>cone</b> replacement models are shown to have fundamental limitations in matching psychophysical observations.

Some important physics issues: the penetration of the ions injected outside the last closed magnetic surface into {{the core of the}} plasma confinement volume if they have the transition orbits in order to control the electric field in plasma, the study of the cold alpha-particles removal, the removal of the impurity ions from the confinement volume, can be checked experinrentally.

40|$|A selfconsistent {{analysis}} is developed {{to determine the}} radial electric field and <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> boundary in Torsatron/Heliotron plasmas {{under the influence of}} non-classical ion losses such as the <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> <b>loss</b> and charge exchange loss of fast ions with neutrals. Analysis is applied to the NBI heated plasmas in the Compact Helical System (CHS) device. Comparison is made between theoretical results and experimental observations. The increased ion particle losses caused by the orbit loss and charge exchange loss with neutrals make the radial electric field more negative than the value of purely neoclassical calculation. The partition of the injection energy among the shine through, direct orbit loss, change exchange loss and bulk heating is evaluated by using the selfconsistent electric field profile. On-going experiments in the CHS device are briefly introduced. ...|$|R
40|$|Energetic {{particles}} {{found in}} planetary magnetospheres and other plasmas often display a power law and an anisotropy (including <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> and temperature anisotropy). In a recent study, a full relativistic kappa-loss cone (KLC) distribution f κL is initially introduced to model energetic particles, but f κL is only associated with <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> anisotropy. We extend this previous study {{and develop a}} generalized relativistic kappa-type (KT) distribution f κT which incorporates either temperature anisotropy or both <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> and temperature anisotropy. We carry out numerical calculations for a direct comparison between the new KT distribution, the previous KLC distribution and the kappa distribution f κ, respectively. We find that (a) analogous to f κL, f κT satisfies the power law not only at lower energies but also at relativistic energies; (b) analogous to f κ, f κT contains either temperature anisotropy or both <b>loss</b> <b>cone</b> and temperature anisotropy; (c) the regular kappa distribution is found to decrease faster than the KT distribution with kinetic energy Ek especially when θ 2 increases (where θ 2 is the thermal characteristic parameter), e. g. f κ/f κT 10 − 2 for Ek 2. 0 MeV and θ 2 0. 3; (d) no big difference occurs between both KT and kappa distributions through energies up to ∼ 500 keV for θ 2 0. 03 and (e) the three distributions show different anisotropy behaviors even for the same overall anisotropy. The {{results suggest that the}} new generalized KT distribution may be applied in space plasmas and other plasmas including laboratory machines where highly energetic particles exist. 1...|$|R
