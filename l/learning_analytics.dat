Introduction There are two general approaches to learning classification rules.

40|$|The {{shift from}} common {{diagnosis}} practices to continuous monitoring based on body sensors has transformed healthcare from hospital-centric to patient-centric. Continuous monitoring generates huge and continuous {{amount of data}} revealing changing insights. Existing approaches to analyze streams of data {{in order to produce}} validated decisions relied mostly on static <b>learning</b> and <b>analytics</b> techniques. In this paper, we propose an incremental <b>learning</b> and adaptive <b>analytics</b> scheme relying on evident data and rule-based Decision Support System (DSS). The later continuously enriches its knowledge base with incremental learning information impacting the decision and proposing up-to-date recommendations. Some intelligent features augmented the monitoring scheme with data pre-processing and cleansing support, which helped empowering data analytics efficiency. Generated assistances are viewable to users on their mobile devices and to physician via a portal. We evaluate our incremental <b>learning</b> and <b>analytics</b> scheme using seven well-known learning techniques. The set of experimental scenarios of continuous heart rate and ECG monitoring demonstrated that the incremental learning combined with rule-based DSS afforded high classification accuracy, evidenced decision, and validated assistance...|$|R

SNA {{developed from the}} work of sociologists like Wellman and Watts, and mathematicians like Barabasi and Strogatz. The work of these individuals has provided us with a good sense of the patterns that networks exhibit (small world, power laws), the attributes of connections (in early 70's, Granovetter explored connections from a perspective of tie strength and impact on new information), and the social dimensions of networks (for example, geography still matters in a digital networked world). It is particularly used to explore clusters of networks, influence networks, engagement and disengagement, and has been deployed for these purposes in <b>learning</b> <b>analytic</b> contexts.|$|R
