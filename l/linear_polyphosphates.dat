40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} the antithrombin effects of various phosphate-containing polyanions (including <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphates,</b> polynucleotides and the phosphoserine glycoprotein, phosvitin) on the glycosaminoglycan-binding plasma proteinase inhibitors, antithrombin III (ATIII) and heparin cofactor II (HCII). These phosphate-containing polyanions accelerate the HCII-thrombin reaction, as much as 1600 -fold {{in the case of}} phosvitin. The HCII-thrombin reaction with both phosvitin and polynucleotides appears to follow the ternary complex mechanism. The HCII-thrombin complex is rapidly formed in the presence of these phosphate polyanions (each at 10 μg/ml) when 125 I-labeled thrombin is incubated with human plasma (ex vivo). None of these phosphate polyanions accelerate the ATIII-thrombin reaction. Our results suggest that the antithrombotic effect of these phosphate-containing polyanions is mediated by HCII activation and not by ATIII...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} between diepoxides and difunctional acids of phosphorus was {{studied as}} a potential route to linear polyesters of phosphoric acid. The reaction between diepoxide and P-OH groups in H 3 PO 4 and related acids leads to linear phosphates, but cyclic phosphates are also formed as side products. The formation of such unreactive groups terminates polyaddition. However, cyclization is practically eliminated when the epoxide ring is fused to another ring, such as in cyclohexene oxide. A commercially available diepoxide containing two cyclohexene oxide moieties, 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexylmethyl- 3, 4 -epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate (ERL), was, therefore, used for polyaddition studies. Indeed, in the polyaddition of ERL with ethylphosphoric acid, high molecular weight (number-average molecular weight up to 10 ^ 4) <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphates</b> were obtained. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the anti-erosive effect of solutions containing sodium fluoride (F: 225 ppm of fluoride), sodium fluoride + stannous chloride (F + Sn: 225 ppm of fluoride + 800 ppm of stannous), sodium fluoride + stannous chloride + sodium <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (F + Sn + LPP: 225 ppm of fluoride + 800 ppm of stannous + 2 % of sodium <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphate),</b> and deionized water (C: control), using a four-phase, single-blind, crossover in situ clinical trial. Methods In each phase, 12 volunteers wore appliances containing 4 enamel specimens, which were {{submitted to a}} 5 -day erosion-remineralization phase that consisted of 2 h of salivary pellicle formation with the appliance in situ, followed by 2 min extra-oral immersion in 1 % citric acid (pH 2. 4), 6 x/day, with 90 min of exposure to saliva in situ between the challenges. Treatment with the test solutions was performed extra-orally for 2 [*]min, 2 x/day. At {{the end of the}} experiment, surface loss (SL, in μm) was evaluated by optical profilometry. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 0. 05). The surface of additional specimens was evaluated by x-ray diffraction after treatments (n = 3). Results C (mean SL ± standard-deviation: 5. 97 ± 1. 70) and F (5. 36 ± 1. 59) showed the highest SL, with no significant difference between them (p > 0. 05). F + Sn (2. 68 ± 1. 62) and F + Sn + LPP (2. 10 ± 0. 95) did not differ from each other (p > 0. 05), but presented lower SL than the other groups (P < 0. 05). Apatite and stannous deposits on specimen surfaces were identified in the x-ray analysis for F + Sn and F + Sn + LPP. Conclusions Sodium fluoride solution exhibited no significant anti-erosive effect. The combination between sodium fluoride and stannous chloride reduced enamel erosion, irrespective of the presence of <b>linear</b> sodium <b>polyphosphate.</b> Clinical significance Under highly erosive conditions, sodium fluoride rinse may not be a suitable alternative to prevent enamel erosion. A rinse containing sodium fluoride and stannous chloride was shown to be a better treatment option, which was not further improved by addition of the sodium <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphate...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a major}} outer membrane protein, OmpP, in Vibrio parahaemolyticus was induced by growth in media deficient in phosphate. The gene, ompP, encoding this protein was cloned. Synthesis of OmpP in Escherichia coli was regulated by the availability of phosphate, and this control required the function of pho regulatory genes of E. coli. Analysis of gene fusion strains constructed by mutagenesis with transposon mini-Mulux revealed that ompP was transcriptionally regulated in V. parahaemolyticus. Impaired growth of a strain with an ompP defect was observed in media which contained large <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphates</b> as the phosphate source. This and other evidence suggested that OmpP functions as a porin channel for the entry of phosphate into the cell. A number of other proteins or activities were induced by phosphate limitation including hemolysin, phospholipase C, and phosphatase activities. A regulatory locus controlling expression of phosphate-regulated genes was identified and cloned. This regulatory locus cloned from V. parahaemolyticus was shown to complement E. coli strains with defects in pho regulatory genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} osmotic shocks on {{polyphosphates}} {{and on the}} vacuolar fluorescent indicator atebrin have been investigated to test whether acidic vacuoles in the halotolerant alga Dunaliella salina {{have a role in}} osmoregulation. Upshocks and downshocks induce different patterns of polyphosphate hydrolysis. Upshocks induce rapid formation of new components, tentatively identified as 5 or 6 <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphates,</b> formed only after upshocks with NaCl and not with glycerol, indicative of compartmentation of Na+ into the vacuoles. Conversely, downshocks induce a slower transient accumulation of tripolyphosphates, indicating activation of a different hydrolytic process within the vacuoles. Osmotic shocks do not lead to release of atebrin from acidic vacuoles, indicating that they do not induce a major intravacuolar alkalinization. However, osmotic shocks induce transient permeability changes measured by amine-induced atebrin release from vacuoles. Hypoosmotic shocks transiently increase the permeability (up to 20 -fold), whereas hyperosmotic shocks induce a rapid drop in permeability. Electron micrographs of osmotically shocked cells also reveal transient changes in the surface and internal organelles of D. salina cells. It is suggested that hyperosmotic and hypoosmotic shocks induce different changes within acidic vacuoles and in the organization and/or composition of the plasma membrane in Dunaliella...|$|E

40|$|Ethyl metaphosphate' or tetrapolyphosphate esters are a {{potentially}} useful starting {{material for the}} preparation of polynucleotides. The kinetics of the reactions of the esters with excess water and ethanol have been measured by means of p{sup 31 } n. m. r. and IR spectroscopy. Upon the addition of specific amounts of water or ethanol, substances could be prepared which consist mainly of linear tetrapoly-, tripoly- or pyrophosphate esters containing smeller amounts of other polyphosphates and orthophosphates in an equilibrium composition. Diethyl hydrogen orthophosphate reacts with cyclic polyphosphate esters to open the ring; with linear esters it reacts to form polyphosphates with a lesser degree of condensation. This latter reaction also proceeds to an equilibrium. No reactions between <b>linear</b> and cyclic <b>polyphosphate</b> esters were observed at room temperature, which implies that the rates of the disproportionation of the <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> esters were low. Some organic solvents previously employed for the dehydrating polymerization of sugars, amino acids or nucleotides destroy the tetrapolyphosphate esters.

40|$|We {{observed}} that wild-type Escherichia coli utilized a <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> {{with a chain}} length of 100 phosphate residues (poly-P 100) as the sole source of phosphate in growth medium. A mutation in the gene phoA of alkaline phosphatase or phoB, the positive regulatory gene, prevented growth in this medium. Since no alkaline phosphatase activity was detected outside the wild-type cells, the periplasmic presence of the enzyme was necessary for the degradation of polyphosphate. A 90 % reduction in the activity of periplasmic acid phosphatase with a pH optimum of 2. 5 (delta appA mutants) did not affect polyphosphate utilization. Of the porins analyzed (OmpC, OmpF, and PhoE), the phoB-inducible porin PhoE was not essential since its absence did not prevent growth. To study how poly-P 100 diffused into the cells, we used high-resolution 31 P nuclear magnetic resonance (31 P NMR) spectroscopy. The results suggest that poly-P 100 entered the periplasm and remained in equilibrium between the periplasm and the medium. When present individually, porins PhoE and OmpF facilitated a higher permeability for poly-P 100 than porin OmpC did. The degradation of polyphosphate by intact cells of E. coli observed by 31 P NMR showed a time-dependent increase in cellular phosphate {{and a decrease in}} polyphosphate concentration...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} the dissolving ability (DA) of linear pentasodium tripolyphosphate (PSTP), cyclic trisodium metaphosphate (TSMP), polymeric sodium metaphosphate (SMP) on synthetic crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) and on crystalline aggregates of menisci from patients with chondrocalcinosis (CC).  METHODS—Synthetic CPPD crystals were mixed with {{phosphate buffered saline}} (PBS), which contained the different polyphosphates, for one hour at 37 °C. The calcified menisci {{were obtained from the}} knees of four female patients with CPPD disease who underwent total arthroscopic meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal lesions. Meniscal cryosections and fragments were incubated in SMP (15  mg/ml PBS) at 37 °C for one hour and 24  hours, respectively. Histological evaluation on meniscal samples after polyphosphate incubation was carried out by ordinary transmitted light microscopy and polarised light microscopy. The dissolution of CPPD crystals by polyphosphates was assessed by atomic absorption spectroscopy, which determined the amount of calcium liberated from synthetic crystals and meniscal fragments. Cytotoxicity of SMP was evaluated by tetrazolium salt assay and by an ultrastructural study on cultured chondrocytes.  RESULTS—SMP and PSTP showed higher DA on CPPD crystals than TSMP. Analysis of the DA values at increasing concentrations of SMP showed that a concentration of 15  mg/ml completely dissolved 2. 0  mg CPPD crystals. The solution of meniscal CPPD crystals showed a significant increase of calcium concentration after three hours and 24  hours of SMP incubation (p= 0. 0001; Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance) compared with fragments incubated in PBS control solution. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of meniscal specimens showed a notable reduction of CPPD deposits. A 50 % inhibitory dose on cultured chondrocytes was reached at the maximum concentration of SMP used in this work (15  mg/ml); ultrastructural analysis did not show morphological alterations in the treated cells.  CONCLUSION—The results {{of this study indicate that}} <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphates</b> are effective in dissolving both synthetic and ex vivo CPPD crystal aggregates. This suggests a potential therapeutic use for these molecules in the treatment of symptomatic CC. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} the erosive potential {{of orange juice}} modified by food additives in enamel and dentine. MethodsCalcium lactate pentahydrate (CLP), xanthan gum (XG), sodium <b>linear</b> <b>polyphosphate</b> (LPP), sodium pyrophosphate tetrabasic (PP), sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) {{and some of their}} combinations were added to an orange juice. Pure orange juice and a calcium-modified juice were used as negative (C−) and positive (C+) controls, respectively. In phase 1, 15 modified orange juices were tested for erosive potential using pH-stat analysis. In phase 2, the additives alone and the combination with good results in phase 1 and in previous studies (CLP+LPP) were tested in an erosion–remineralization cycling model. In phase 3, the erosion and remineralization episodes were studied independently. Enamel was analysed by surface microhardness (SMH) and profilometry, whilst dentine by profilometry. ResultsIn phase 1, reduction of the erosive potential was observed for all additives and their combinations, except XG alone. In phase 2, no detectable enamel loss was observed when CLP, LPP and CLP+LPP were added to the juice. XG, STP and PP had enamel loss similar to C− (p> 0. 05). Amongst additives, the combination CLP+LPP showed the highest SMH values followed by CLP (p 0. 05). For dentine, only CLP+LPP lead to surface loss values lower than C− (p< 0. 05). In phase 3, CLP, LPP and CLP+LPP seemed to protect against erosion; whilst none of the tested compounds seemed to interfere with the remineralization process. ConclusionsCLP and LPP reduced erosion on enamel and this effect was enhanced by their combination. For dentine, only the combination CLP+LPP reduced erosion...|$|R
40|$|Phosphate is {{essential}} for all major life processes, especially energy metabolism and signal transduction. A <b>linear</b> phosphate polymer, <b>polyphosphate</b> (polyP), linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds, can interact with various proteins, playing important roles as an energy source and regulatory factor. However, polyP-binding structures are largely unknown. Here we proposed a putative polyP binding site, a positively-charged semi-tunnel (PCST), identified by surface electrostatics analyses in polyP kinases (PPKs) and many other polyP-related proteins. We found that the PCSTs in varied proteins were folded in different secondary structure compositions. Molecular docking calculations revealed a significant value for binding affinity to polyP in PCST-containing proteins. Utilizing the PCST identified in the β subunit of PPK 3, we predicted the potential polyP-binding domain of PPK 3. The discovery of this feature facilitates future searches for polyP-binding proteins and discovery of the mechanisms for polyP-binding activities. This should greatly enhance {{the understanding of the}} many physiological functions of protein-bound polyP and the involvement of polyP and polyP-binding proteins in various human diseases...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Inorganic <b>polyphosphates,</b> <b>linear</b> {{polymers}} of orthophosphate, occur naturally throughout {{biology and}} have many industrial applications. Their biodegradable nature makes them attractive for {{a multitude of}} uses, {{and it would be}} important to understand how polyphosphates are turned over enzymatically. Studies of inorganic polyphosphatases are, however, hampered by the lack of high-throughput methods for detecting and quantifying rates of polyphosphate degradation. We now report chromogenic and fluorogenic polyphosphate substrates that permit spectropho-tometric monitoring of polyphosphate hydrolysis and allow for high-throughput analyses of both endopolyphosphatase and exopolyphosphatase activities, depending on assay configuration. These substrates contain 4 -nitrophenol or 4 -methylumbelliferone moieties that are covalently attached to the terminal phosphates of polyphosphate via phosphoester linkages formed during reactions mediated by EDAC (1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -(dimethylamino) propyl) carbodiimide).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the erosive potential of orange juice modified with food-approved additives: 0. 4 g/l of calcium (Ca) from calcium lactate pentahydrate, 0. 2 g/l of <b>linear</b> sodium <b>polyphosphate</b> (LPP) or their combination (Ca+LPP) were added to a commercially available orange juice (negative control, C-). A commercially available calcium-modified orange juice (1. 6 g/l of calcium) was the positive control (C+). These juices were tested using a short-term erosion in situ model, consisting of a five-phase, single-blind crossover clinical trial involving 10 subjects. In each phase, subjects inserted custom-made palatal appliances containing 8 bovine enamel specimens in the mouth and performed erosive challenges for a total of 0 (control), 10, 20, and 30 min. Two specimens were randomly removed from the appliances after each challenge period. Enamel surface microhardness was measured before and after the clinical phase and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%SMC) was determined. Before the procedures, in each phase, the subjects performed a taste test, where the juice assigned to that phase was blindly compared to C-. Overall, C+ showed the lowest %SMC, being the least erosive solution (p 0. 05). LPP and C- were the most erosive solutions (p < 0. 05). Taste differences were higher for C+ (5 / 10 subjects) and Ca (4 / 10 subjects), but detectable in all groups, including C- (2 / 10 subjects). Calcium reduced the erosive potential of the orange juice, while no protection was observed for LPP. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Cyclotriphosphate (C 3 P) is of interest to soil scientists because it demonstrates little or no retention by soil constituents. Non-sorption is desirable in the development of mobile P fertilizers. Work was expanded to include cyclotetraphosphate (C 4 P), a larger but commercially unavailable cyclic P compound that is more stable than C 3 P in solution. High-purity C 4 P was prepared by ethanol precipitation of the hydrolysis products Of P 4010. Improved methods of ion chromatography were applied to the analysis of cyclic P and all hydrolysis products extracted from soil using a water/ 0 - 5 M H 2 SO 4 / 1. 0 M NAOH extraction procedure developed for this work. Separation and direct quantitative analysis of <b>linear</b> and cyclic <b>polyphosphates</b> were accomplished in less than 15 minutes. The rapidity and ease of these analyses represent a vast improvement over previous methods of polyphosphate analysis. Four diverse Texas soils received 1 00 and 400 gg cyclic P g- 1 soil as either C 3 P or C 4 P and were incubated under different water, temperature, biological activity, and time regimes. The larger C 4 P was not appreciably sorbed in soil and was more stable than C 3 P under all conditions. Rate constants and the time to one half of initial P concentration were determined for each P. Kinetic data suggested that the hydrolysis of cyclic P in soils is complex, but cyclic P hydrolysis most likely follows first-order kinetics. The mechanism of C 4 P hydrolysis- particularly at low P application rates-may involve direct conversion of C 4 P to diphosphate and triphosphate (in addition to tetraphosphate), possibly due to phosphatase action in C 4 P hydrolysis. Temperature dependency of C 3 P and C 4 P hydrolysis was examined. All treatments showed Qlo < 2. 0, indicating the prominence of biological hydrolysis in cyclic P decomposition in soils. Energy of activation (EA) was 45. 8 and 61. 1 kJ mol- 1, respectively, for C 3 P and C 4 P on Falba sandy loam at the low P rate (38. 6 and 51. 2 kJ mol-I for the same treatments on Branyon clay). Nineteen soil parameters were examined for correlation with C 3 P and C 4 P hydrolysis. Numerous significant correlations (P < 0. 05) were reported, but high intercorrelation among related soil factors was suspected, thus reducing the value of correlation analysis...|$|R
