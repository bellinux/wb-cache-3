40|$|The {{effects of}} soil {{compaction}} and cultivation on soil mineral N dynamics were investigated through an 18 -month, in situ N mineralisation experiment during the inter-rotation and early establishment {{period of a}} second rotation (2 R) hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A.

Treatments were 0, 1 and 16 passes of a fully <b>laden</b> forwarder (gross <b>weight,</b> 40. 2 Mg) and cultivation by disc plough (zero cultivation and cultivation). Nitrate N was the dominant form of mineral N throughout the 18 -month sampling period in both non-cultivated and cultivated soils, varying between 10 and 40 kg ha- 1 whilst ammonium N remained < 10 kg ha- 1. Compaction had no significant effect on N mineralisation or nitrification. However, the remediation {{of the effects of}} compaction on soil through the use of the disc plough had significant impacts on N mineralisation, nitrification and N leaching. On a seasonal basis, the mean net N mineralisation increased from around 30 to 53 kg ha- 1, nitrification from 28 to 43 kg ha- 1 and nitrate N leaching from around 10 to 73 kg ha- 1 following cultivation.

60|$|While Balaklava harbor {{was crowded}} with ships full of huts, clothing, and fuel, {{the men at the}} front were dying in {{hundreds}} from wet, cold, and insufficient food. Between them and abundance extended an almost impassable quagmire, in which horses and bullocks sank and died in thousands, although <b>laden</b> only with <b>weights</b> which a donkey in ordinary times could carry. Had the strength of the regiments in front been sufficient, the soldiers might have been marched down, when off duty, to Balaklava, to carry up the necessaries they required. But so reduced were they by over-work and fatigue, that those fit for duty had often to spend five nights out of seven in the trenches, and were physically too exhausted and worn-out to go down to Balaklava for necessaries, even of the most urgent kind. Many of the regiments were almost annihilated. Large numbers of fresh troops had come out, and drafts for those already there, but the new-comers, mostly raw lads, broke down under the strain almost as fast as they arrived, and in spite of the number sent out, the total available strength did not increase. One regiment could only muster nine men fit for duty. Many were reduced to the strength of a company. The few survivors of one regiment were sent down to Scutari until fresh drafts should arrive and the regiment could be reorganized, and yet this regiment had not been engaged in any of the battles. Scarce a general of those who had commanded divisions and brigades at the Alma now remained, and the regimental officers had suffered proportionally. The regiments which had won the Alma still remained before Sebastopol, but their constituents had almost entirely changed, and the proportion of those who had first landed in the Crimea that still remained there when Jack returned was small indeed.|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} have been defined by stereotypes of cultural production of limited historical meaning but tenacious shelf life, and few more so than Mexico. The visual culture of Mexico has been <b>laden</b> with the <b>weight</b> of representational meaning since the first contact of Europe and the Americas in the fifteenth century. The flora and fauna of Mexico has been explained and described, its inhabitants recognisably characterised for {{both internal and external}} audiences. Definitions of national culture have ranged from simplistic stereotypes to complex attempts at reconciling the political tensions of a racially divided post-colonial society but the visual manifestations of these processes of definition draw on a shared heritage of symbolic representations. For artists, Mexican identity has become a commodity to be packaged, sold and resold. Containment of its meaning has applied a patent copyright that allows for the themed fast food restaurant or the decoration of European suburban homes in a 'Mexican style' purchased at the local superstore. A longstanding theme of this commodified Mexico, however, has been the association of 'death' and 'Mexicanness', from the fascination with Aztec deities through to the popularity of the 'day of the dead' phenomenon. For many audiences and curators alike death remains a keyword in the evocation of Mexican culture. In many ways the association of art and death is so accepted a signifier of 'Mexicanness' that for international audiences it has become a required characteristic of authentic cultural expression and geographically determined meaning. It {{can be seen in the}} popularity of José Guadalupe Posada's skeletal caricatures on T-shirts and accessories, to the visions of barbarism underpinning a film such as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. In fact, obsession with the physicality of death and Mexico are frequently constructed as synonymous. Descending from the propagandist polemics of the Spanish conquest and given new impetus by the complex debates of post revolutionary Mexico, the role of death, and its imagery, has long been a constituent part of constructions of 'Mexicanness'. A fascination with the forensics of death is not in itself an unusual focus of interest for such artists and curators but recently the work of Teresa Margolles has attracted the attention of an increasingly large audience. Her reputation has been growing since the 1990 s, based on her work as a founder member of the Mexico City based collective SEMEFO (an acronym derived from Servicio Médico Forense /Forensic Medical Service). In recent years it has become established outside of Mexico and expanded from dedicated followers of her work to encompass a more general critical interest, with her intervention at the Venice Biennial 2009 receiving widescale critical acclaim. While deeply political, the themes of Margolles' art grow out of her fascination with what she has called 'the life of corpses' and the ways that even in death, social hierarchies and injustices remain. The materials that she uses in her art break taboos of realism even in the reality-addicted societies we inhabit and the re-use in her art of human remains, body parts and fluids contaminated with the 'real' processes of the afterlife, repel and frighten many, but nonetheless force her audiences to encounter those aspects of the passage of death usually hidden from conscious thought. This lecture will discuss the intersecting of traditions of cultural stereotype with the processes of contemporary cultural production and how this relates to the specifics of Mexico...|$|R
