40|$|Background: Temporomandibular {{disorders}} {{are the most}} common cause of chronic orofacial pain, but, except where they occur subsequent to trauma, their cause remains unknown. This cross-sectional study assessed chewing function (habitual chewing side) and the differences of the chewing side and condylar path and <b>lateral</b> anterior <b>guidance</b> angles in participants with chronic unilateral temporomandibular disorder. This is the preliminary report of a randomized trial that aimed to test the effect of a new occlusal adjustment therapy. Methods: The masticatory function of 21 randomly selected completely dentate participants with chronic temporoman-dibular disorders (all but one with unilateral symptoms) was assessed by observing them eat almonds, inspecting the lateral horizontal movement of the jaw, with kinesiography, and by means of interview. The condylar path in the sagittal plane and the <b>lateral</b> anterior <b>guidance</b> angles with respect to the Frankfort horizontal plane in the frontal plane were measured on both sides in each individual.

50|$|Lateral {{navigation}} (LNAV) {{refers to}} navigating over a ground track with guidance from an electronic device {{that gives the}} pilot (or autopilot) error indications in the lateral direction only {{and not in the}} vertical direction. In aviation, lateral navigation is one of two guidance types: linear guidance and angular guidance. In linear guidance, the aircraft's deviation to the left or right of the desired ground track is given as a distance between the aircraft's current position and the desired track. In angular guidance, the error indication is given in degrees of angle from the desired line relative to a ground-based navigation device. To provide an illustration, as the aircraft approaches the ground device with a constant angular error, its distance to the desired ground line decreases. In the context of aviation instrument approaches, an LNAV approach (one that uses lateral navigation) is implied to be a GPS-based approach and to have linear <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b> A VOR-based approach will have angular <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{accuracy}} and reliability of {{the methods used for}} programming the semi-adjustable articulators determine the accuracy in occlusion. The current recommended average settings using the Hanau's formula commonly used by clinicians is questionable, and thus reassessment is needed. This study was carried out to evaluate and compare the lateral condylar guidance: (1) Using the Hanau's formula and the computerized jaw tracking device (Kinesiograph). (2) On the right and left sides using both these methods. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 completely edentulous patients (14 male and 6 females) within 40 – 60 years of age were selected. Jaw relation was recorded followed by face bow transfer. Extraoral Gothic arch tracing was recorded; three protrusive records were obtained and condylar <b>guidance</b> was calculated. <b>Lateral</b> condylar <b>guidance</b> was then calculated using Hanau's formula, followed by the computerized jaw tracking device.

5000|$|The <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> {{from the}} ILS {{localiser}} would however be usable {{right to the}} end of the landing roll, and hence is used to feed the rudder channel of the autopilot after touchdown. As aircraft approached the transmitter its speed is obviously reducing and rudder effectiveness diminishes, compensating to some extent for the increased sensitivity of the transmitted signal. More significantly however it means the safety of the aircraft is still dependent on the ILS during rollout. Furthermore, as it taxis off the runway and down any parallel taxiway, it itself acts a reflector and can interfere with the localiser signal. This means that it can affect the safety of any following aircraft still using the localiser. As a result, such aircraft cannot be allowed to rely on that signal until the first aircraft is well clear of the runway and the [...] "Cat. 3 protected area".|$|E
5000|$|The second {{culmination}} {{point was}} a 1758 km {{trip in the}} fall of 1995 from Munich in Bavaria to Odense in Denmark to a project meeting and back. Both longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> were performed autonomously by vision. On highways, the robot achieved speeds exceeding 175 km/h (roughly 110 mph; there is no general speed limit on the German Autobahn). Publications from Dickmann's research group indicate a mean autonomously driven distance without resets of ~9 km; the longest autonomously driven stretch reached 158 km. More than half of the resets required were achieved autonomously (no human intervention). This is particularly impressive considering that the system used black-and-white video-cameras and did not model situations like road construction sites with yellow lane markings; lane-changes at over 140 km/h, and other traffic with more than 40 km/h relative speed have been handled. In total, 95% autonomous driving (by distance) was achieved.|$|E

This runway change forced Captain Lutz to abandon his planned ILS approach and required First Officer Loehrer to consult the Jeppesen charts for runway 28. The charts included a new set of approach parameters, of which the higher MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude) was the most crucial piece of information.|$|E

Several topics are studied in detail: (1) vehicle error-state model for <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> based on Ackerman steering and (2) <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of a low-speed vehicle using fuzzy logic. Independently written research papers address each topic. The first paper presents a second order 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 kinematic model based on Ackerman steering appropriate for studying the <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of low-speed vehicles traversing on roads of constant curvature. <b>Lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of vehicles is {{of great interest to}} the Advanced Vehicle Control Systems (AVCS) Division of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) community. Both linear and nonlinear models are derived in detail. The error states considered are the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s lateral error and heading error measured with respect to the instantaneous road centerline tangent. In addition to the derivation, both simulation and experimental results are presented with very good correspondence being achieved. The second paper investigates the performance of several different controllers used to perform <b>lateral</b> <b>guidance</b> control of a low-speed vehicle described as a linear nonminimum-phase 2 ̆ 2 error-state 2 ̆ 2 bicycle model based on Ackerman steering. Both a conventional type I proportional-integral (PI) controller and a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are considered.

40|$|Background. Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{disorders}} (TMD) {{are defined}} as a subgroup of craniofacial pain problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the temporomandibular joints (TMJs), and associated structures. Pain and/or limited mouth opening are the main symptoms. The prevalence of treatment need for TMD in adults {{was estimated to be}} 15. 6 %. The cause of TMD remains unknown; however, TMJ overloads are a recognized factor. Aims. The main goal of this work is to assess an association between functional, dynamic and anatomical characteristics of the masticatory system in patients suffering TMD-pain condition and in healthy groups. With this in mind, our team conducted a series of studies to explain this situation, using strictly the scientific method. Method. The masticatory function of 21 completely dentate participants with chronic temporomandibular disorders (all but one with unilateral symptoms) was assessed by observing them eat almonds, inspecting the lateral horizontal movement of the jaw, with kinesiography, and by means of interview. The condylar path in the sagittal plane and the <b>lateral</b> anterior <b>guidance</b> angles with respect to the Frankfort horizontal plane in the frontal plane were measured on both sides in each individual. Results. Sixteen of 20 participants with unilateral symptoms chewed on the affected side; the concordance (Fisher’s exact test, P =. 003) and the concordance-symmetry level (Kappa coefficient k = 0. 689; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 38 to 0. 99; P=. 002) were significant. The mean condylar path angle was steeper (53. 47 (10. 88) degrees versus 46. 16 (7. 25) degrees; P =. 001), and the mean <b>lateral</b> anterior <b>guidance</b> angle was flatter (41. 63 (13. 35) degrees versus 48. 32 (9. 53) degrees P =. 036) on the symptomatic side. Study power: with a sample size of 19, and assuming a two-sided test at the 0. 05 level, the study had power of 0. 8 to detect a value of Kappa of 0. 6 or larger when testing the null hypothesis that Kappa = 0. Interpretation. The results of this study support the use of a new term based on etiology, ‘‘habitual chewing side syndrome’’, instead of the nonspecific symptom-based ‘‘temporomandibular joint disorders’’; this denomination is characterized in adults by a steeper condylar path, flatter <b>lateral</b> anterior <b>guidance,</b> and habitual chewing on the symptomatic side. Additionally, because muscular activity is responsible for TMJ-loads, muscular coactivation was assessed using surface electromyography (sEMG); although limited, sEMG could inform about some subclinical condition and about the type of muscular co-activation and their asymmetry in TMD patients, that could be of interest to elucidate the physiology of this conditionand showing moderate discriminatory capacity between TMD or healthy subjects. Lastly, this study evaluated incisal forces and muscular coactivation simultaneously. It is suggested that mean incisal forces promote equilibrated muscular coactivation; however, submaximal incisal effective forces required the activation mainly of masseter muscles; due that masseter muscles are responsibles for TMJ-loads, this study allow infer TMJ loads increases during submaximal incisal bitting; probably this task should be avoided in TMD patients.

Tolerance to variations of condylar guidance without changing lateral tooth contacts was determined by increasing and decreasing the value of condylar guidance until lateral tooth contacts changed.
