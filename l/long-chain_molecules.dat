25|$|The lipid world theory postulates {{that the}} first {{self-replicating}} object was lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation—the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic <b>long-chain</b> <b>molecules</b> also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves {{the same size and}} composition of lipids in the two progenies. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for information storage, and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.|$|E

30|$|The term “surfactant” {{represents}} a <b>long-chain</b> <b>molecule</b> containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Surfactants are extensively {{used in a}} number of applications because of their abilities to alter the properties of surfaces and interfaces. The applications of surfactants in petroleum industries are significant and diverse, especially in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes (Grigg et al. 2004; Grigg and Mikhalin 2007).|$|R
50|$|Fatty acids are <b>long-chained</b> <b>molecules</b> {{having an}} alkyl group {{at one end}} and a {{carboxylic}} acid group at the other end. Fatty acid viscosity (thickness) and melting temperature increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated fatty acids have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated fatty acids (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than saturated fatty acids (no double bonds). Monounsaturated fatty acids are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated.|$|R

30|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) is a non-cellular structural component {{that exists between}} and around the cells, in all tissues and organs, and contains many fibrous proteins and polysaccharides [12]. The composition of ECM is unique to each tissue and produces a different range of elastic moduli, which define the density and spatial organization of the protein <b>molecules.</b> These <b>long-chained</b> <b>molecules</b> provide the ECM with its elasticity and stiffness. The structure and mechanics of the ECM {{play a major role}} in cell migration, as many cells receive biochemical and biomechanical cues through it. It thus acts as a medium for cell-to-cell communication.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{techniques}} of EOR: gas injection, thermal injection, and chemical injection. Gas injection, which uses gases such as natural gas, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide (CO2), accounts for nearly 60 percent of EOR {{production in the}} United States. Thermal injection, which involves the introduction of heat, accounts for 40 percent of EOR production in the United States, with most of it occurring in California. Chemical injection, which can involve the use of <b>long-chained</b> <b>molecules</b> called polymers to increase the effectiveness of waterfloods, accounts for about one percent of EOR production in the United States. In 2013, a technique called Plasma-Pulse technology was introduced into the United States from Russia. This technique can result in another 50 percent of improvement in existing well production.|$|R

The biological use of sulfur {{as an alternative to}} carbon is purely hypothetical, especially because sulfur usually forms only linear chains rather than branched ones. (The biological use of sulfur as an electron acceptor is widespread and can be traced back 3.5 billion years on Earth, thus predating the use of molecular oxygen. Sulfur-reducing bacteria can utilize elemental sulfur instead of oxygen, reducing sulfur to hydrogen sulfide.) ...|$|E
50|$|The current {{understanding}} of shear induced fibrillation requires polymer chains to undergo the following {{series of steps}} i) <b>long-chain</b> <b>molecules</b> are stretched, ii) and form persistent point nuclei, which iii) align under flow into rows and then iv) grow to create a crystalline fibrils. For these fibrils to remain, {{the temperature of the}} sample must be lowered to below the polymers melt point. This process is analogous to the fibrilogenesis of natural silk-polymers in which proteins align (refold), nucleate (denature), and crystallize (aggregate). However, for silks, fibrils persist without the need for a drop in temperature.|$|E
50|$|The {{feedstock}} to FCC {{is usually}} {{that portion of}} the crude oil that has an initial boiling point of 340 °C or higher at atmospheric pressure and an average molecular weight ranging from about 200 to 600 or higher. This portion of crude oil {{is often referred to as}} heavy gas oil or vacuum gas oil (HVGO). In the FCC process, the feedstock is heated to a high temperature and moderate pressure, and brought into contact with a hot, powdered catalyst.

25|$|While {{there are}} close to 4,000 {{varieties}} of potato, it has been bred into many standard or well-known varieties, {{each of which has}} particular agricultural or culinary attributes. In general, varieties are categorized into a few main groups, such as russets, reds, whites, yellows (also called Yukons) and purples—based on common characteristics. Around 80 varieties are commercially available in the UK. For culinary purposes, varieties are often differentiated by their waxiness. Floury, or mealy (baking) potatoes have more starch (20–22%) than waxy (boiling) potatoes (16–18%). The distinction may also arise from variation in the comparative ratio of two potato starch compounds: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose, a <b>long-chain</b> <b>molecule,</b> diffuses from the starch granule when cooked in water, and lends itself to dishes where the potato is mashed. Varieties that contain a slightly higher amylopectin content, a highly branched molecule, help the potato retain its shape when boiled.|$|R
50|$|His work on phase {{separation}} in fluids with <b>long-chain</b> <b>molecules</b> explained why different experiments {{carried out to}} different time regimes seem to produce contradictory results. His group's large-scale simulation on aggregation kinetics in dense particulate systems explained Christopher Sorensen's research group's experimental observation of speed up in the kinetics of aggregation in a dense system and developed the concept of cluster crowding in aggregating systems. Chakrabarti and Christopher Sorensen, Cortelyou-Rust University Distinguished Professor of physics at Kansas State University, have published a recent invited review that provides a comprehensive description of their research of how a system of particles evolves from a dilute sol to a gel. This paper identifies new regimes of aggregation.|$|E
50|$|Flory {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} excluded volume, coined by Werner Kuhn in 1934, to polymers. Excluded volume refers {{to the idea that}} one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing <b>long-chain</b> <b>molecules</b> in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough, and led to the explanation of several puzzling experimental results of the day. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics - the long-range interactions arising from excluded volume are eliminated, allowing the experimenter to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory correctly identified that the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution if excluded volume interactions were neutralized by experimenting at the theta point.|$|E

This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.Within the hypothesis of a lipid bilayer membrane composed of a mixture of various distinct amphiphilic compounds there is the opportunity of a huge number of theoretically possible combinations in the arrangements of these amphiphiles in the membrane. Among all these potential combinations, a specific local arrangement of the membrane would have favoured the constitution of a hypercycle, actually a positive feedback composed of two mutual catalysts represented by a membrane site and a specific compound trapped in the vesicle. Such site/compound pairs are transmissible to the daughter vesicles leading to the emergence of distinct lineages of vesicles which would have allowed Darwinian natural selection.|$|E

5000|$|The Redlich-Kwong {{equation}} {{was designed}} largely {{to predict the}} properties of small, non-polar molecules in the vapor phase, which it generally does well. However, it has been subject to various attempts to refine and improve it. In 1975, Redlich himself published an equation of state adding a third parameter, {{in order to better}} model the behavior of both <b>long-chained</b> <b>molecules,</b> as well as more polar molecules. His 1975 equation was not so much a modification to the original equation as a re-inventing of a new equation of state, and was also formulated so as to take advantage of computer calculation, which was not available at the time the original equation was published. [...] Many others have offered competing equations of state, either modifications to the original equation, or equations quite different in form. It was recognized by the mid 1960s that to significantly improve the equation, the parameters, especially a, would need to become temperature dependent. As early as 1966, Barner noted that the Redlich-Kwong equation worked best for molecules with an acentric factor (ω) close to zero.

40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) are continually emitted from plants and are also a component of smoke during vegetation fire. Although vegetation fire events {{have been shown to}} have implications for the dynamics of soil water repellency (SWR) and there have been anecdotal reports that forest smoke can induce water repellency, the role of BVOCs in this process has not been explored. Accordingly, we investigated a selection of major BVOCs (cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol; levoglucosenone; 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol; cineole; α-phellandrene; α-terpinene) that are emitted from the dominant native vegetation of Australia during fire. The potential of each compound to induce SWR was investigated by applying different loadings on acid washed sand (AWS) (300 – 350 µm diameter) and then assessing water repellency with the molarity of ethanol drop test. A <b>long-chain</b> amphiphilic <b>molecule</b> (palmitic acid) was also applied to AWS for comparison. Although palmitic acid was effective at inducing water repellency, the BVOCs were not, even at high loadings (5 × 10 − 4 mol g− 1). Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations complemented the experimental measurements. These studies suggested that poor expression of water repellency by the BVOCs could be explained by their tendency to exhibit weak interactions towards the quartz surface but strong molecule–molecule attractions.
