5|$|Another {{example is}} the city of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The only exception is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5|$|The Cummer oak {{is a large}} <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> tree, {{estimated}} to be between 175 and 200 years old, that stands prominently over the gardens. It is 80 feet tall, 138 feet across, and has a trunk circumference of 21 feet.|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>live</b> <b>oaks</b> {{retain their}} leaves nearly year-round, {{they are not}} true evergreens. <b>Live</b> <b>oaks</b> drop their leaves {{immediately}} before new leaves emerge in the spring. Occasionally, senescing leaves may turn yellow or contain brown spots in the winter, leading to the mistaken belief that the tree has oak wilt, whose symptoms typically occur in the summer. A <b>live</b> <b>oak's</b> defoliation may occur sooner in marginal climates or in dry or cold winters.|$|R

5|$|The fruit bodies grow in {{clusters}} or {{scattered on the}} decomposing leaves and acorns of oak trees, such as Coast <b>Live</b> <b>Oak,</b> Valley Oak and Black Oak. It is common in the coastal oak woodlands of California, where it appears from late autumn to early winter.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies grows solitary, scattered, or {{clustered}} {{together on}} soil in both coniferous and deciduous woods, typically {{in spring and}} summer.

5|$|On average, the Aransas Bay {{system is}} 3 meters deep, and covers {{approximately}} 539 square kilometers. The system {{is made up}} of the bay itself and its extensions. The main extensions include: Saint Charles Bay, to the east of the Lamar peninsula; Copano Bay, to the west of both the <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> and Lamar peninsulas, Mesquite Bay to the bay's northeast, and Redfish Bay to the southwest. Redfish Bay is sometimes considered an extension of Corpus Christi Bay.|$|E
5|$|The north {{promontory}} {{is anchored}} by a circular grass area, {{which serves as}} a heliport in case of emergencies, and the south promontory is anchored by a succulent plant and cactus garden. The complex is also encircled by access roads that lead to loading docks and staff parking garages on both the west and east sides of the buildings. The hillside around the complex has been planted with California <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> (Quercus agrifolia) trees.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon <b>live</b> <b>oak.</b> A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E

5|$|Appearing from January to April, A. ocreata occurs {{later in}} the year than other amanitas except A. calyptroderma. It is found in mixed {{woodland}} on the Pacific coast of North America, from Washington south through California to Baja California in Mexico. It may feasibly occur on Vancouver Island in British Columbia though this has never been confirmed. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus agrifolia), as well as hazel (Corylus spp.). In Oregon and Washington, it may also be associated with the Garry oak (Quercus garryana).|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north {{to the mouth of}} the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> peninsula. The peninsula is located on the eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast to the mouth of the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and to the mouth of Port Bay.|$|E

5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern <b>live</b> <b>oak.</b>|$|E
5|$|SR94 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System; west of SR188, it {{is part of the}} National Highway System, {{a network}} of {{highways}} that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR94 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. In 2014, SR94 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 440 vehicles at <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> Springs Road, and 179,000 vehicles between I-805 and 47th Street, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E
5|$|The Cummer Gardens are 1.45 {{acres of}} {{historic}} gardens {{made up of}} native Florida plants, large <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> trees, {{and a number of}} reflecting pools, fountains, ornaments and sculptures. They are split into three themed gardens and a large lawn on the St. Johns River. Many of the original trees on the property were felled in order to make room for flower beds, but those that remained grew up to 150 feet in size. Ninah Cummer adopted the lion as her personal motif, and lion details can be found all over the gardens.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Boletus abruptibulbus grow singly or in groups in sand. The species is known {{only from the}} Gulf Coast of the Florida Panhandle, where fruiting occurs on older sand dunes, {{particularly}} {{in areas where the}} habit changes from coastal scrub to oak-pine woods. This latter habitat is characterized by the presence of the tree species Sand <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> (Quercus geminata), Myrtle Oak (Q.myrtifolia), and Sand Pine (Pinus clausa). Fruiting occurs from December to March. Boletus abruptibulbus is one of only three North American Boletaceae species that occur in coastal sand dunes; the others are Leccinum arenicola, found in New Brunswick, Canada, and Phylloporus arenicola, described from Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> Peninsula is the only substantial community that borders the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a few miles away, and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 miles southeast of San Antonio and about 40 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{local governments have}} {{implemented}} tree and landscape ordinances, which will help communities by providing shade during summer. Tree protection is an ordinance that does not allow someone to prune or remove trees without a city permit. An example is the city of Glendale, California: Through the Indigenous Tree Ordinance, the city of Glendale protects the following species of trees, the California sycamore, the coast <b>live</b> <b>oak,</b> mesa oak, valley oak, scrub oak, California bay. Anyone who is planning on removing or trimming the trees has to obtain an indigenous tree permit. Within the permit they have to provide detailed information {{about the number of}} trees affected, trunk diameter and the health of the tree itself. They also have to submit photographs of the site, and a site plan sketch.|$|E
