50|$|Rothko {{received}} a second mural commission project, {{this time for}} a wall of paintings for the penthouse of Harvard University's Holyoke Center. He made twenty-two sketches, from which ten murals were painted, six were brought to Cambridge, MA, and only five were installed: a triptych on one wall and opposite two individual panels. Harvard President Nathan Pusey, following {{an explanation of the}} religious symbology of the Triptych, had the paintings hung in January 1963, and later shown at the Guggenheim. During installation, Rothko found the paintings to be compromised by the room's lighting. Despite the installation of fiberglass shades, the paintings were all removed by 1979 and, due to the fugitive nature of some of the red pigments, in particular <b>lithol</b> <b>red,</b> were placed in dark storage and displayed only periodically. The murals are on display from November 16, 2014 - July 26, 2015 in the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, for which the fading of the pigments has been compensated by using an innovative color projection system to illuminate the paintings.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lithol</b> <b>Red</b> salts {{are one of}} the commonest 20 th century red {{synthetic}} organic pigments. We {{characterized the}} sodium, barium, and calcium <b>Lithol</b> <b>Red</b> salts with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The sodium and calcium salts were synthesized and compared to commercial samples. The single crystal structure of calcium <b>Lithol</b> <b>Red</b> is reported here for the first time. Light aging experiments show that the neat powder is very lightfast but that the pigment has poor light stability within paint systems. This suggests that the binding medium facilitates the photodegradation of the pigment for the latter case...|$|E
40|$|The first {{systematic}} {{series of}} single-crystal diffraction structures of azo lake pigments is presented (<b>Lithol</b> <b>Red</b> with cations=MgII, CaII, SrII, BaII, NaI and CdII) and includes {{the only known}} structures of non-Ca examples of these pigments. It is shown that these commercially and culturally important species show structural behaviour that can be predicted from a database of structures of related sulfonated azo dyes, a database that was specifically constructed for this purpose. Examples of the successful structural predictions from the prior understanding of the model compounds are that 1) the Mg salt is a solvent-separated ion pair, whereas the heavier alkaline-earth elements Ca, Sr and Ba form contact ion pairs, namely, low-dimensional coordination complexes; 2) all of the <b>Lithol</b> <b>Red</b> anions exist as the hydrazone tautomer and have planar geometries; and 3) the commonly observed packing mode of alternating inorganic layers and organic bilayers is as expected for an ortho-sulfonated azo species with a planar anion geometry. However, the literature database of dye structures has no predictive use for organic solvate structures, {{such as that of}} the observed Na <b>Lithol</b> <b>Red</b> DMF solvate. Interestingly, the Cd salt is isostructural with the Mg salt and not with the Ca salt. It is also observed that linked eight-membered [MOSO] 2 rings are the basic coordination motif for all of the known structures of Ca, Sr and Ba salts of sulfonated azo pigments in which competing carboxylate groups are absent...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen {{commonly}} used dyes and 16 of their metabolites or derivatives {{were tested in}} the Salmonella-mammalian microsome mutagenicity test. Mutagens active with and without added Aroclor-induced rat liver microsome preparations (S 9) were 3 -aminopyrene, <b>lithol</b> <b>red,</b> methylene blue (USP), methyl yellow, neutral red, and phenol red. Those mutagenic only with S 9 activation were 4 -aminopyrazolone, 2, 4 -dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, methyl red, and 4 -phenyl-azo- 1 -naphthylamine. Orange II was mutagenic only without added S 9. Nonmutagenic azo dyes were allura red, amaranth, ponceau R, ponceau SX, sunset yellow, and tartrazine. Miscellaneous dyes not mutagenic were methyl green, methyl violet 2 B, and nigrosin. Metabolites of the azo dyes that were not mutagenic were 1 -amino- 2 -naphthol hydrochloride, aniline, anthranilic acid, cresidine salt, pyrazolone T,R-amino salt (1 -amino- 2 -naphthol- 3, 6 -disulfonic disodium salt), R-salt, Schaeffer's salt (2 -naphthol- 6 -sulfonic acid, sodium salt), sodium naphthionate, sulfanilamide, and sulfanilic acid. 4 -Amino- 1 -naphthalenesulfonic acid sodium salt was also not mutagenic. Fusobacterium sp. 2 could reductively cleave methyl yellow to N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine which was then activated to a mutagen...|$|E
