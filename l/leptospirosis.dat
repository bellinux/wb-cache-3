5|$|Following {{the passage}} of Mitch, disease {{outbreaks}} occurred throughout Central America, including cholera, <b>leptospirosis,</b> and dengue fever. Over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported, killing 34people. Guatemala was most affected by the bacterium, {{where most of the}} deaths occurred from contaminated food. 450 cases of <b>leptospirosis</b> were reported in Nicaragua, killing seven people. There were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported, though no deaths were reported from the disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, after contact {{had been made}} with Europeans, large numbers of the {{indigenous}} peoples in the northeast {{of what is now}} the United States were killed by virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox, measles, influenza, and perhaps <b>leptospirosis.</b> Between 1617 and 1619, smallpox killed approximately 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, <b>leptospirosis,</b> tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. <b>Leptospirosis</b> can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Following Erica's heavy rains, it was {{feared that}} the already {{existing}} dengue fever epidemic would become more widespread. Prior to Erica, there were already 437 cases of dengue fever in 2003 alone. The risk for <b>leptospirosis</b> was also increased by Erica. High winds and strong rains resulted in damages of at least US$15 million, particularly to schools. Two fatalities total were reported {{as a result of}} Erica. The name Erica was retired after the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, <b>leptospirosis,</b> viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with <b>leptospirosis</b> and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused outbreaks of malaria, dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses. Ongoing flooding caused {{an outbreak of}} <b>Leptospirosis,</b> notably in Cortés Department. There were widespread food and water shortages, leaving villagers near-starvation. Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, <b>leptospirosis,</b> brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|Argentina's geomorphic {{characteristics}} {{make the}} country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, {{increase the risk of}} diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, {{which is one of the}} main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are at highest risk for flooding, particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper water drainage. Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods can last for months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water. A <b>leptospirosis</b> outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted hyenas in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, <b>leptospirosis,</b> bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from hyenas and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted hyenas has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted hyenas in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted hyenas may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in hyenas in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leptospirosis</b> causes similar {{symptoms}} {{and is also}} carried by rodent vectors, but it {{is due to a}} bacterial spirochete rather than a virus. Presumptive treatment of <b>leptospirosis</b> with penicillin (and other) antibiotics is often started for severe symptoms when a diagnostic dilemma between the two diseases is encountered.|$|E
25|$|For dogs living in/visiting {{rural areas}} or areas frequented by wildlife, another {{important}} vaccine {{is to consider}} is against <b>Leptospirosis,</b> a disease characterized by weakness, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and kidney and liver failure. <b>Leptospirosis</b> comes from standing water containing urine from animals infected with leptospira, and the disease can be transmitted to humans via contaminated water or food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leptospirosis</b> is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by a}} spirochaete. Symptoms include liver and kidney failure and vasculitis.|$|E
25|$|Rats {{can serve}} as {{zoonotic}} vectors for certain pathogens and thus spread disease, such as bubonic plague, Lassa fever, <b>leptospirosis,</b> and Hantavirus infection.|$|E
25|$|Where rabies occurs, rabies {{vaccination}} of dogs may {{be required}} by law. Other canine vaccines include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, <b>leptospirosis,</b> bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease, among others.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} and prophylaxis of anthrax and <b>Leptospirosis.</b> It is also effective against Yersinia pestis (the infectious agent of bubonic plague), and is prescribed for {{the treatment}} of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{differential diagnosis}} is extensive and requires consideration {{of many other}} infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, shigellosis, rickettsial diseases, cholera, sepsis, borreliosis, EHEC enteritis, <b>leptospirosis,</b> scrub typhus, plague, Q fever, candidiasis, histoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, measles, and viral hepatitis among others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leptospirosis</b> {{infection}} {{associated with}} cat urine {{has been identified}} as an emerging bacterial pathogen in some European countries. In infected humans, jaundice {{may or may not be}} a symptom. If jaundice is a symptom the infection becomes more severe and rapidly progresses.|$|E
25|$|Uveitis* is {{inflammation}} {{within the}} eye. Anterior uveitis (inflammation of the iris and ciliary body) is {{most common in}} dogs. The disease is usually immune-mediated in dogs, but may also be caused by trauma, cataracts, infectious canine hepatitis, <b>leptospirosis,</b> ehrlichiosis, or systemic fungal infections.|$|E
25|$|July 23–29, 2009 – An {{epidemic}} of <b>Leptospirosis</b> hit the Burundian and Ugandan military camps in Mogadishu killing three Burundian and two Ugandan soldiers. Another 18 Burundian soldiers {{were placed in}} quarantine. About 50 Burundian and 17 Ugandan soldiers were evacuated for medical treatment to Nairobi, Kenya.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leptospirosis,</b> {{also known}} as field fever is an {{infection}} caused by Leptospira. Symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers; to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. Leptospira is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, most commonly by rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or by water or soil containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose.|$|E
25|$|Increased climate variability, that is {{associated}} with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in stagnant water which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. People are often stranded inside their homes and are exposed to water-borne diseases such as dengue and <b>leptospirosis.</b> Better early warning systems are needed to manage the risk associated with increased rainfall.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of the Dominican Republic distributed emergency supplies to 145,000families following the storm, including food, blankets, mattresses, and mosquito nets. The relief aid amounted to about $3million (USD). The government requested a $200million (USD) loan from the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank on November 1. Storm flooding led to an outbreak of <b>leptospirosis</b> in the Dominican Republic in the weeks following the passage of Noel, causing 25deaths and infecting 193others. The {{government of}} Haiti allocated about $1.5million (USD) for those affected by the storm.|$|E
25|$|Infections {{that are}} {{transmitted}} from animals to humans are called zoonoses. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, {{but others are}} much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the semen, vaginal fluids, urine, saliva, feces and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are Brucellosis, Q fever, <b>leptospirosis,</b> and toxocariasis. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. Allergic reactions to animal semen may occur, including anaphylaxis. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, three kayakers {{contracted}} <b>leptospirosis</b> {{and suffered}} bouts of delusion and lung hemorrhaging after swallowing Yarra river water. Tests {{were conducted in}} the Yarra River and the Mullum Mullum Creek and the levels of many pathogens {{were found to have}} breached local and international standards for recreational water. This is documented in a 2007 report by EPA Victoria in which levels of Human faecal matter and E. coli were recorded and documented. Other major pollutants entering the creek via stormwater drains and surface runoff include dog feces, cigarette butts, packaging and other post-consumer waste.|$|E
25|$|One more {{death was}} {{confirmed}} on 30 August. The 49-year-old patient with heart problems {{was brought to}} Melaka Hospital after suffering from fever, cough and vomiting which persisted for 2 days. He was given antiviral drugs and antibiotics {{and he was also}} tested for tuberculosis, typhoid, dengue, <b>Leptospirosis</b> and H1N1 but all of the tests came back negative. The patient's condition deteriorate and was confirmed dead on 19 August due to severe pneumonia with septic shock and H1N1. The post-mortem biopsy report based on lung samples tested positive for Influenza A(H1N1) on 24 Aug.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people living}} in Haiti {{are at high risk}} for major {{infectious}} diseases. Food or water-borne diseases include bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, typhoid fever and hepatitis A and E; common vector-borne diseases are dengue fever and malaria; water-contact diseases include <b>leptospirosis.</b> Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake. The infant mortality rate in Haiti in 2013 was 55 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to a rate of 6 per 1,000 in other countries.|$|E

500|$|Frenchman Samuel de Champlain had {{explored}} the area extensively in 1605. He had specifically explored Plymouth Harbor, {{which he called}} [...] "Port St. Louis," [...] and made an extensive and detailed map {{of it and the}} surrounding lands. The native Patuxet village upon which the town of Plymouth was later built was shown by Champlain as a thriving settlement. However, an epidemic wiped out up to 90% of the Native Americans along the Massachusetts coast in 1617–1619, including the Patuxet, before the arrival of the Mayflower. The epidemic has traditionally been thought to be smallpox, but a recent analysis has concluded that {{it may have been a}} lesser-known disease called <b>leptospirosis.</b> The absence of any serious native opposition to settlement by the Pilgrims may have been a pivotal event to their success and to English colonization in the Americas.|$|E

2500|$|The {{countries}} {{with the highest}} reported incidence {{are located in the}} Asia-Pacific region (Seychelles, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand) with incidence rates over 10 per 1000,000 people s well as in Latin America and the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, El Salvador, Uruguay, Cuba, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) However, the rise in global travel and eco-tourism [...] has led to dramatic changes in the epidemiology of <b>leptospirosis,</b> and travelers from around the world have become exposed to the threat of <b>leptospirosis.</b> Despite decreasing prevalence of <b>leptospirosis</b> in endemic regions, previously non-endemic countries are now reporting increasing numbers of cases due to recreational exposure [...] International travelers engaged in adventure sports are directly exposed to numerous infectious agents in the environment and now comprise a growing proportion of cases worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Leptospirosis</b> is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused by bacteria {{of the genus}} Leptospira. Humans and dogs become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin. In dogs, transmission most commonly occurs by drinking puddle, pond, or ditch water contaminated by urine from infected wildlife such as squirrels or raccoons. [...] The liver and kidney are most commonly damaged by <b>leptospirosis.</b> [...] Vasculitis can occur, causing edema and potentially disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). [...] Myocarditis, pericarditis, meningitis, and uveitis are also possible sequelae.|$|E
2500|$|Leptospira (Greek leptos, [...] "fine, thin" [...] and Latin spira, [...] "coil") is a genus of spirochaete bacteria, {{including}} {{a small number}} of pathogenic and saprophytic species. [...] Leptospira was first observed in 1907 in kidney tissue slices of a <b>leptospirosis</b> victim who was described as having died of [...] "yellow fever." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} {{bacteria}} that are contagious from dog to dog. [...] The most notable {{of these are}} Bordetella bronchiseptica, one {{of the causes of}} kennel cough, Leptospira sp, which cause <b>leptospirosis,</b> and Brucella canis, cause of brucellosis in dogs. [...] There are also common tick-borne bacterial diseases, including Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E
2500|$|The above signs, {{especially}} fever, respiratory signs, neurological signs, and thickened footpads {{occurring in}} unvaccinated dogs strongly indicate canine distemper. [...] However, several febrile diseases match {{many of the}} signs of the disease and only recently has distinguishing between canine hepatitis, herpes virus, parainfluenza and <b>leptospirosis</b> been possible. [...] Thus, finding the virus by various methods in the dog's conjunctival cells or foot pads gives a definitive diagnosis. [...] In older dogs that develop distemper encephalomyelitis, diagnosis may be more difficult, since many of these dogs have an adequate vaccination history.|$|E
2500|$|Vaccinations are an {{important}} preventative animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for dogs varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless {{of any of these}} factors, it is usually highly recommended that dogs be vaccinated against rabies, canine parvovirus, canine distemper, and infectious canine hepatitis (using canine adenovirus type 2 to avoid reaction). [...] The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases, including <b>leptospirosis,</b> Lyme disease, Bordetella bronchiseptica, parainfluenza virus, and canine coronavirus, should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the dog.|$|E
