2500|$|Race 2 narrative: Alinghi {{received}} a penalty {{for being in}} the pre-start area before the designated time. There was very little pre-start maneuvering. BMW Oracle Racing started on starboard tack ahead of Alinghi on port tack. Alinghi sailed faster than during the previous race and benefited from a 20-degree wind shift, which put the Swiss boat in the lead at about {{the midpoint of the}} first leg. But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind after tacking for the <b>lay</b> <b>line.</b> BMW Oracle Racing then proved to be much faster on the first reach, pulling about 2 kilometers ahead (26.8 kt vs. 25.2 kt average speed). [...] The final delta includes the penalty turn by Alinghi. Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 to gybe mark, 0h39 to finish.|$|E

This order also reduces the risk that a diver will become separated from the team if the line-layer has to stop for any reason.|$|E

50|$|On August 19th, 2016, Vancouver Fire Dispatch {{received}} a complaint of possible {{smoke in the}} area of Kingsway and Joyce. Dispatch tapped out Engine 5, Engine 15, Quint 15, Quint 20, Medic 9 and Battalion 2 to the scene. While crews were en route to the call, dispatch received multiple calls from area residents and passerby's about smoke billowing out of the roof of Carleton Elementary School. The call was quickly upgraded to structure fire and all crews responding were notified of the development. Upon arrival Engine 5 assumed command of the scene and, confirmed reports of smoke coming from the roof. Engine 5 radioed for Quint 20 to <b>lay</b> <b>line</b> {{at the rear of the}} structure, and requested all other apparatus to remain at level 1 staging. Quint 20 laid a 1/4 inch hoseline into the building and preceded to the 3rd floor where heavy fire was present. Command requested a working fire assignment and ordered all other rigs to lay lines accordingly. Before Quint 20 could contain the situation, the flames had already spread into the attic and upper cock loft area, which led to command requesting a 2nd alarm assignment. Quint 20s crew was able to clear fire from the main fire floor and proceed into the attic space however, the attic was quite tight due to the structure being around for over 100 years. A 3rd alarm assignment was called in for manpower as crews cleared the building quickly to resupply on breathing apparatus which ran low. Ladder 17 setup on Mckinnon st, and made an effort to assault the fire from the side of the structure which seemed to have only a small impact on the fire. Crews were unable to assault the fire from above as crews were directly underneath in the attic with hose lines. Command upgraded the call to a 4th Alarm as additional manpower was needed. Three firefighters had to be taken to hospital, as two members suffered smoke inhalation and one member strained his back. The fire was contained several hours later and crews remained on scene to investigate. The fire investigator revealed that someone had broken into the school, and had poured an accelerant near the door to the third floor.|$|E
40|$|PosterInternational audienceEntanglement {{has evolved}} from being a spooky {{interaction}} towards a key resource of real-life applications such as absolute secure communication. Today, quantum networking devices are commercially available, typically taking advantage of time-bin or polarisation entanglement, the latter one doubtlessly being easier to analyse thanks to interferometer free set-ups. The communication distance of such systems is generally limited to a few hundreds of kilometres due to intrinsic fibre transmission losses and imperfect detectors. It was shown that the communication distance can be greatly increased when combining entangled pairs of photons and quantum memories. But the narrow absorption bandwidth of current quantum memories is in contrary to the widely used broadband entanglement sources based on non linear inter- actions. More precisely, {{there is a lack}} of ultra narrowband sources in the telecom C-band, where fibre losses are minimal and high performance guided-wave optics are available. Here we introduce a high quality polarisation entanglement engineering scheme based on a birefringent de- <b>lay</b> <b>line</b> (BDL). This BDL is applied to generate polarization entanglement from a high efficiency ultra narrowband tele- com photon pair source where no polarisation entanglement is available initially...|$|E

50|$|The Tramways Act 1870 (c. 78) was an {{important}} step in the development of urban transport in Britain.

50|$|Line traps {{are places}} that a line can pass through but are too tight for a diver, making it {{impossible}} to follow the line by feel.

50|$|They {{preferred}} {{to work as}} a syndicate, where the railway contracts would be taken by one or two of major contractors of them and then sub-let to fellow Mistri contractors belonging to their 19 villages. Thus they held sway in many divisions of Railways in British India. There was a dearth of skilled persons in India who were ready to work in difficult mountain and jungle terrain, due to the risk of being killed by diseases like malaria, cholera, plague and by wild animals or gangs of robbers and outlaws. The early British records of many railway companies have noted that many British engineers and laborers resigned, left or even perished due to diseases like malaria or cholera and from the effects of the heat and sun while <b>laying</b> the railway <b>lines.</b> Working as a railway contractor in these early days meant staying away from home for many months, or even years.
