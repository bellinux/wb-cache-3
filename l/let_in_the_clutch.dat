Time : 10.841 sec., which made the motorcycle riders whistle a bit.There were no arguments about the dragster's performance this time and [...] "sack-cloth and ashes" [...] were handed out to all dis-believers and certain Editors! Sydney Allard- but a kilometre is a long quarter-mile and I still maintain that the dragster didn't live up to Allard high pressure pre-Brighton publicity.-ED." [...] Sadly few spectators witnessed this achievement. According to Jenkinson: [...] "Allard's temperamental machine eventually did 10.48 sec on its best run," [...] for the standing-start quarter mile, which took place at Debden, Essex on 14 April 1962.
