Since nuclear reactors have <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> than fossil-fired plants, with lower steam quality, the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds, but with four-pole generators, to reduce erosion of turbine blades.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{temperature}} and maximum density of a cloud in a magneto-optical trap {{is limited by}} the spontaneously emitted photon in cooling each cycle. While the asymmetry in atom excitation gives cooling and trapping forces, the emission of the spontaneously emitted photon is in a random direction, and therefore contributes to a heating of the atom. Of the two ħk kicks the atom receives in each cooling cycle, the first cools, and the second heats: a simple description of laser cooling which enables us to calculate a point at which these two effects reach equilibrium, and therefore define a <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit,</b> known as the Doppler cooling limit.|$|E

The <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> was not evident from the Van Eenennaam et al. 2005 study, although hatching rate decreased at 11 °C and hatched green sturgeon embryos were shorter, compared to 14 °C. The mean total length of hatched green sturgeon embryos decreased with increasing temperature, although their wet and dry weight remained relatively constant (Van Eenennaam et al. 2005). Van Eenennaam et al. 2005 concluded that temperatures 17-18 °C may be the upper limit of the thermal optima for green sturgeon embryos. Growth studies on younger juvenile green sturgeon determined that cyclical 19-24 °C water temperature was optimal (Allen et al. 2006).|$|E

A few species from this genus have been reported from shallower depths, notably B. miyarei between 22 and 280 m, the poorly known B. decemspinosus between 70 and 80 m and B. doederleini as shallow as 100 m. The depth record for any giant isopod is 2500 m for B. kensleyi, but this species also occurs as shallow as 300 m. Over 80 percent of B. giganteus are found at a depth between 365 and 730 m.

40|$|The {{growth of}} all {{microorganisms}} {{is limited to}} a specific temperature range. However, it has not previously been determined to what extent global protein profiles change in response to temperatures that incrementally span the complete growth temperature range of a microorganism. As a result it has remained unclear to what extent cellular processes (inferred from protein abundance profiles) are affected by growth temperature and which, in particular, constrain growth at upper and <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limits.</b> To evaluate this, 8 -plex iTRAQ proteomics was performed on the Antarctic microorganism, Methanococcoides burtonii. Methanococcoides burtonii was chosen due to its importance as a model psychrophilic (cold-adapted) member of the Archaea, and the fact that proteomic methods, including subcellular fractionation procedures, have been well developed. Differential abundance patterns were obtained for cells grown at seven different growth temperatures (- 2 °C, 1 °C, 4 °C, 10 °C, 16 °C, 23 °C, 28 °C) and a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify trends in protein abundances. The multiplex analysis enabled three largely distinct physiological states to be described: cold stress (- 2 °C), cold adaptation (1 °C, 4 °C, 10 °C and 16 °C), and heat stress (23 °C and 28 °C). A particular feature of the thermal extremes was the synthesis of heat- and cold-specific stress proteins, reflecting the important, yet distinct ways in which temperature-induced stress manifests in the cell. This is the first quantitative proteomic investigation to simultaneously assess the response of a microorganism to numerous growth temperatures, including the upper and <b>lower</b> growth <b>temperatures</b> <b>limits,</b> and has revealed a new level of understanding about cellular adaptive responses...|$|R
30|$|The {{reproducibility}} of {{the data}} can easily be asserted: the two cooling runs essentially coincide over the entire temperature range, whereas the heating runs do so everywhere except at the lowest transition.

The results are compared with the operating <b>temperature</b> <b>limits</b> for Type 316 austenitic stainless steel. Several factors define the allowable operating temperature window for structural alloys in a fusion reactor. The <b>lower</b> operating <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> in all body-centered cubic and most face-centered cubic alloys is determined by radiation embrittlement (decrease in fracture toughness), which is generally most pronounced for irradiation temperatures below ~ 0. 3 TM where TM is the melting <b>temperature.</b> The <b>lower</b> operating <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> for SiC/SiC composites will likely be determined by radiation-induced thermal conductivity degradation, which becomes more pronounced in ceramics with decreasing temperature. The upper operating <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> of structural materials is determined by one of four factors, all of which become more pronounced with increasing exposure time: 1) Thermal creep (grain boundary sliding or matrix diffusional creep), 2) high temperature He embrittlement of grain boundaries, 3) cavity swelling (particularly important for SiC and Cu alloys), or 4) coolant compatibility/corrosion issues.

40|$|In this work, {{the effect}} of {{physical}} parameters on the yield of fullerene, synthesized in a hollow cathode plasma reactor is investigated.

The aim of this work was to show that the fullerene yield depends on physical parameters - carbon concentration, carbon flow rate from the interelectrode gap, axial temperature and temperature gradient between the arc channel and the chamber walls as well. It was found that fullerene synthesis occurs in an inert heat bath with dimensions determined by the temperature gradient. The <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> is around 2000 K and the value of the upper limit is the value of the axis temperature which depends on the discharge conditions.

40|$|The {{activities}} of two enzymes, beef liver catalase (EC 1. 11. 1. 6) and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (EC 3. 1. 3. 1), have been measured down to − 97 °C and − 100 °C, respectively. Enzyme activity has not previously been measured at such low temperatures. For catalase, the cryosolvents used were methanol:ethylene glycol:water (70 : 10 : 20) and DMSO:ethylene glycol:water (60 : 20 : 20). For alkaline phosphatase, methanol:ethylene glycol:water (70 : 10 : 20) was used. All of the Arrhenius plots were linear {{over the whole}} of the temperature range examined. Since the lowest temperatures at which activity was measured are well below the dynamic transition observed for proteins, the results indicate that the motions which cease below the dynamic transition are not essential for enzyme activity. In all cases the use of cryosolvent led to substantial increases in Arrhenius activation energies, and this imposed practical limitations on the measurement of enzyme activity below − 100 °C. At even lower temperatures, enzyme activity may be limited by the effect of solvent fluidity on substrate/product diffusion, but overall {{there is no evidence that}} any intrinsic enzyme property imposes a <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limit</b> for enzyme activity...|$|E

The present work focuses on measurements of concentration and <b>temperature</b> flammability <b>limits</b> of four pure hydrocarbon fuels, as well as traditional and alternative aviation fuels, including Jet-A, HEFA, SIP, and FT-S 8.

Minor deviations which occurred between theoretically perfect and obtained temperature gradients were reproducible and readily measured.

40|$|In recent years, an {{innovative}} system for power augmentation {{has been presented}} by the authors. The system is based on gas turbine inlet air cooling by means of liquid nitrogen sprayers. This system is not characterized by the limits of water evaporative cooling (i. e. <b>lower</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>limited</b> by air saturation) and refrigeration cooling (i. e. effectiveness limited by pressure drop in the heat exchangers), but the injection of {{a large amount of}} liquid nitrogen at gas turbine inlet section can be disputable. In fact, the air composition changes, though not considerably, after nitrogen injection. The oxygen content always seems high enough to allow a regular combustion. In any case, local effects should be further investigated. In this paper, the effect of the increase in nitrogen molar fraction of combustion air is evaluated. A micro gas turbine combustion chamber geometry (i. e. a reverse flow tubular combustor) is taken into consideration since its model has been widely validated by the authors. The analyses are performed by considering two different fuels: methane (which is the design fuel) and syngas. The results are compared in terms of overall performance (e. g. TIT, pollutant emissions) and local distributions (e. g. flow fields, flame shape and position) ...|$|R
