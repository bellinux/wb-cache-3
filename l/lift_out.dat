25|$|The first {{purpose built}} stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was {{much larger than}} any other {{trawlers}} then in operation and inaugurated {{the era of the}} 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. Lord Nelson followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} arose during the {{conversion}} was a dispute between land-based and maritime unions over conversion jobs. The United States Coast Guard had final say. Queen Mary was deemed a building, {{since most of}} her propellers had been removed and her machinery gutted. The ship was also repainted with its red water level paint at a slightly higher level than previously. During the conversion the funnels were removed, as this area was needed to <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> the scrap materials from the engine and boiler rooms. Workers found that the funnels were significantly degraded and they were replaced with replicas.|$|E
25|$|In both cases, {{having a}} crew member lift {{the end of the}} mast out of the water may help speed the process, as the {{greatest}} challenge of righting a capsized boat is shedding the weight of the water from the sails. A helpful step, where possible (on a loose footed sail), is to disconnect the clew of the sail from the boom, which prevents the sail from scooping up water as the sail lifts out of the water. The bow of the capsized vessel should be pointed towards the wind so that when the sail starts to <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> of the water the wind can catch underneath the sail and help right the boat.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a {{circular}} device that was set {{to the side of}} the boat and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> a much greater haul of up to 60 tons.

25|$|Baruto had a {{solid and}} {{straightforward}} yotsu-sumo style, concentrating on techniques which involved grabbing the opponent's mawashi or belt. He preferred a migi-yotsu grip, {{with his right hand}} inside and left hand outside his opponent's arms. His most common winning kimarite or technique was overwhelmingly yori-kiri, or force out. Due to his great strength he was known for using tsuri-dashi, or <b>lift</b> <b>out,</b> a technique which has declined in recent years because of the increasing weight of wrestlers. Baruto used this technique three times in the July 2009 tournament alone. He also frequently used uwatenage, or overarm throw. He was forced to change his yotsu style in his successful ōzeki promotion basho of March 2010, as his thumb injury meant he was less effective on the mawashi, and he used a more aggressive slapping and thrusting attack instead.|$|E
25|$|Hokutoumi was {{primarily}} a oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques that got his opponents {{out of the ring}} as quickly as possible. He had a powerful tachi-ai, or initial charge, and his speciality was nodowa, a single-handed push to the throat. To do this he would lock up his opponent's right arm with his left (a technique known as ottsuke) and thrust with his right. His most common winning kimarite by far were oshi-dashi and yori-kiri, which together accounted for around 60 percent of his wins at sekitori level. When fighting on the mawashi he preferred a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip. He {{said in an interview with}} Channel 4 television that the technique he most enjoyed was tsuri-dashi or <b>lift</b> <b>out,</b> although he was only credited with this kimarite once in official tournament competition (against Terao in November 1989).|$|E

25|$|Brereton ordered MARKET to {{be flown}} in daylight. The conference {{allocated}} directives {{to the three}} airborne divisions, giving the southernmost objectives to the 101st Airborne Division so that the flight paths of aircraft bringing it from its bases in southern England would not cross those bring the 82nd Airborne Division from the Grantham area. Another fateful decision taken at the conference was to only have C-47s tow a single glider. Double-towing gliders was difficult and dangerous, but single-towing meant stretching the glider <b>lift</b> <b>out</b> over four days. The next day, Williams held a conference with his wing and group commanders. Two routes were considered, a northern one that ran across the occupied Netherlands, and a southern route that approached through Belgium. The northern route was shorter and simpler but the southern was safer. In the end Williams decided to use both, with the British 1st Airborne Division and the 82nd Airborne Division taking the northern route and the 101st Airborne Division using the southern one. Once again, the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would work with the 82nd Airborne Division while the 53rd Troop Carrier Wing worked withb the 101st Airborne Division.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his career, Chiyonofuji's {{trademark}} kimarite or {{technique was}} uwatenage, or overarm throw. He preferred a migi-yotsu, or left hand outside, right hand inside {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi. His left hand outer grip was so effective that some commentators {{referred to it as}} his [...] "death grip." [...] Uwatenage was his second most common winning technique at sekitori level after yorikiri, or force out. He was also well known for tsuridashi, or <b>lift</b> <b>out.</b> He had knowledge {{of a wide range of}} other techniques as well, employing 41 different kimarite in his career. In January 1987, he won with the very rare amiuchi, or fisherman's net casting throw, and joked to the press afterwards that it was appropriate for him as he was the son of a fisherman. Chiyonofuji's muscular physique, athleticism and dramatic throws made him the most successful and one of the most popular wrestlers of his day.|$|E
