2500|$|Britain {{pioneered the}} use of petrol powered, 4-wheel {{synchromesh}} mechanical drive locomotives (known as tractors) for daylight use within visual range of the front. In 1916 the War Office required [...] "Petrol Trench Tractors" [...] of 600-mm gauge that were capable of drawing 10 to 15 tons at [...] per hour. [...] Early tractors weighed 2 tons. Total production was 102 [...] Ernest E. Baguley <b>tractors,</b> 580 [...] <b>Motor</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>tractors</b> and 220 [...] <b>Motor</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>tractors.</b> An additional two-hundred [...] petrol-electric tractors were produced by British Westinghouse and Dick, Kerr & Co..|$|R
50|$|In 1936 a new {{diesel tractor}} was acquired, a 20 hp 'Planet' (F. C.

This was later named Dolgarrog and used in the 1970s to lay power cables alongside the Llanberis Lake Railway, this being followed by a spell {{on display in the}} Dolgarrog Power Station Museum, together with some wagons from the tramway.|$|R
30|$|Chira-Chavala et al. [14] {{investigated}} the characteristics and probable causes of <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> transit system accidents {{and developed a}} crash severity model for the Santa Clara County Transit Agency. A binary logit model was applied to predict the probability of injury accident {{as a function of}} explanatory variables such as speeds before collision of <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> vehicles and <b>motor</b> vehicles, movement of the motor vehicle before collision, etc. As reported in the study, left-turn vehicle movements, higher speeds of the motor vehicle, or the LRV and accident occurring during peak hours increased the probability of injury accidents.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} {{usage of}} draisines concerned, first of all, armoured draisines. They were <b>light</b> armoured <b>rail</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles, intended for reconnaissance, scouting, track patrolling, and other auxiliary combat tasks, usually belonging to armoured trains. Early vehicles {{of this kind}} were built in Russia during World War I. Later, often armoured cars were used as armoured draisines, after exchanging their wheels to railroad ones, or fitting them with additional retractable railroad rollers. Some countries, however, manufactured purpose-built armoured draisines between the wars, such as the USSR and Czechoslovakia. Peculiar vehicles were Polish armoured draisines - they were tanks or tankettes fitted with special rail chassis, able to be used on rails or on the ground, leaving the rail chassis on the rails. Some countries developed railtrack armoured draisines, with retractable tracks railroad wheels; they were not widely used, however. Different armoured draisines were used during the Second World War, starting from the invasion of Poland carried out by Nazi Germany.|$|R
40|$|Octopus card is an {{electronic}} travel ticket with built-in microchip jointly issued by five major public transportation companies in Hong Kong.

Mass Transit Railway (MTR), Kowloon Canton Railway (KCR) East <b>Rail,</b> KCR <b>Light</b> <b>Rail,</b> Kowloon <b>Motor</b> Bus (KMB), Citybus, and Hong Kong & Yaumati Ferry (HYF). The system has been launched in Hong Kong since September 1997. At the launching phase of this system, some operational problems lie wrong fare deduction, card damage, inaccurate display of remaining balance on buses with the use of Octopus card were observed and brought up in the public. This study aimed at finding out the ways of satisfying the customer needs {{with the use of the}} system with consideration of changing technology development. The work in this study included identification of the quality dimensions of using Octopus card, conducting questionnaires survey on the users, applying usability testing to evaluate the overall performance of Octopus card and employing Quality Function Deployment to translate the customer voices into technical specifications. With the results of this study, strategies for improving the performance of Octopus card were finally recommended...|$|R

50|$|At 1:30pm on 1 April 2011, a Zig Zag Railway {{maintenance}} vehicle (the Hi-Rail), {{collided with a}} two-car <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> on the No 1 Viaduct, Top Road, between Clarence and Top Points stations. The Hi-Rail, with a Driver and Passenger on board, was freewheeling down the hill in reverse in the section from Clarence towards Top Points. The <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor,</b> operated by a Driver, was travelling empty {{in the opposite direction}} from Top Points. The <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> Driver saw the approaching vehicle and applied the brakes. However, the two persons on board the Hi-Rail, facing the opposite direction, did not see the <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> before the collision. The force of the collision compacted the body of the Hi-Rail such that neither cab door would open. The two occupants of the Hi-Rail were injured in the collision and were assisted out of the Hi-Rail and onto the <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> by the <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> Driver who was uninjured. The force of the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. The investigation established that the collision resulted from the Driver of the <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> and the Driver of the Hi-Rail not being aware that they were travelling towards each other on the same track in the Top Points-Clarence section. This lack of situational awareness resulted from procedural errors. The <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> Driver departed Top Points without communicating his intention to his Guard or the Hi-Rail crew, and the <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> Guard exceeded his authority by authorising the Hi-Rail to leave a worksite and proceed to Top Points. A number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications and operational safeworking errors. Other safety issues identified during the investigation included delayed notification of the accident; poor maintenance of Train Register Books; passengers travelling in the <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> driver's cab; <b>Rail</b> <b>Motor</b> Driver's fatigue; and excess speed of the Hi-Rail.|$|R
