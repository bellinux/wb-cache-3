5|$|The {{youngest}} terrain {{observed on}} Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas {{that must have}} formed {{over a long period}} of time, judging by their varying levels of cratering. The plains are found on the floors of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, with solid ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> tidal heating.|$|E

25|$|Possible trace {{amounts of}} methane in the {{atmosphere}} of Mars were first discovered in 2003 with earth based telescopes and fully verified in 2004 by the ESA Mars Express spacecraft in orbit around Mars. As methane is an unstable gas, its presence indicates {{that there must be}} an active source on the planet in order to keep such levels {{in the atmosphere}}. It is estimated that Mars must produce 270 ton/year of methane, but asteroid impacts account for only 0.8% of the total methane production. Although geologic sources of methane such as serpentinization are possible, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> volcanism, hydrothermal activity or hotspots are not favorable for geologic methane. It has been suggested that the methane was produced by chemical reactions in meteorites, driven by the intense heat during entry through the atmosphere. Although research published in December 2009 ruled out this possibility, research published in 2012 suggest that a source may be organic compounds on meteorites that are converted to methane by ultraviolet radiation.|$|E

2500|$|Thorium abundance. A LFTR breeds thorium into uranium-233 fuel. The Earth's crust {{contains}} {{about three to}} four times as much thorium as U-238 (thorium is about as abundant as lead). It is a byproduct of rare-earth mining, normally discarded as waste. Using LFTRs, there is enough affordable thorium to satisfy the global energy needs {{for hundreds of thousands of}} years. [...] Thorium is more common in the earth’s crust than tin, mercury, or silver. A cubic meter of average crust yields the equivalent of about four sugar cubes of thorium, enough to supply the energy needs of one person for more than ten years if completely fissioned. Lemhi Pass on the Montana-Idaho border is estimated to contain 1,800,000 tons of high-grade thorium ore. Five hundred tons could supply all U.S. energy needs for one year. Due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> demand, the U.S. government has returned about 3,200 metric tons of refined thorium nitrate to the crust, burying it in the Nevada desert.|$|E

40|$|HCN {{channels}} are becoming pharmacological targets mainly in cardiac diseases. But {{apart from their}} well-known role in heart pacemaking, these {{channels are}} widely expressed in the nervous system where they contribute to the neuron firing pattern. Consequently, abolishing Ih current might have detrimental consequences in a big repertoire of behavioral traits. Several studies in mammals have identified the Ih current as an important determinant of the firing activity of dopaminergic neurons, and recent evidences link alterations in this current to various dopamine-related disorders. We used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster to investigate how <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> Ih <b>current</b> affects dopamine levels and the behavioral consequences in the sleep:activity pattern. Unlike mammals, in Drosophila {{there is only one}} gene encoding HCN channels. We generated a deficiency of the DmIh core gene region and measured, by HPLC, levels of dopamine. Our data demonstrate daily variations of dopamine in wild-type fly heads. <b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> Ih <b>current</b> dramatically alters dopamine pattern, but different mechanisms seem to operate during light and dark conditions. Behaviorally, DmIh mutant flies display alterations in the rest:activity pattern, and altered circadian rhythms. Our data strongly suggest that Ih current is necessary to prevent dopamine overproduction at dark, while light input allows cycling of dopamine in an Ih current dependent manner. Moreover, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> Ih <b>current</b> results in behavioral defects that are consistent with altered dopamine levels...|$|R
