This way, an AutoAnalyzer can analyze hundreds of samples every day with one operating technician. Early AutoAnalyzer instruments each tested multiple samples sequentially for individual analytes.

50|$|Hemorrhagic {{cystitis}} is rare when ifosfamide {{is given}} with mesna. A common and dose-limiting side effect is encephalopathy (brain dysfunction). It occurs {{in some form}} in up to 50% of people receiving the agent. The reaction is probably mediated by chloroacetaldehyde, one of the breakdown products of the ifosfamide molecule, which has chemical properties similar to acetaldehyde and chloral hydrate. The symptoms of ifosfamide encephalopathy can range from mild (difficulty concentrating, fatigue), to moderate (delirium, psychosis), to severe (nonconvulsive status epilepticus or coma). In children, this can interfere with neurological development. Apart from the brain, ifosfamide can also affect peripheral nerves. The severity of the reaction can be classified according to either the National Cancer Institute or the Meanwell criteria (grade I-IV). Previous brain problems and low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> in the blood {{increase the likelihood of}} ifosfamide encephalopathy. In most cases, the reaction resolves spontaneously within 72 hours. If it develops during an infusion of the drug, discontinuing the infusion is advised. The most effective treatment for severe (grade III-IV) encephalopathy is an intravenous solution of methylene blue, which appears to shorten the duration of encephalopathy; the exact mechanism of action of methylene blue is unclear. In some cases, methylene blue may be used as a prophylaxis before further doses of ifosfamide are administered. Other treatments include albumin and thiamine, and dialysis as a rescue modality.|$|E
50|$|Some {{bone and}} heart {{disorders}} {{can lead to}} an increase in ALP and the aminotransferases, so the first step in differentiating these from liver problems is to compare the levels of GGT, which will only be elevated in liver-specific conditions. The second step is distinguishing from biliary (cholestatic) or liver (hepatic) causes of jaundice and altered laboratory results. The former typically indicates a surgical response, while the latter typically leans toward a medical response. ALP and GGT levels will typically rise with one pattern while aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rise in a separate pattern. If the ALP (10-45 IU/L) and GGT (18-85) levels rise proportionately about as high as the AST (12-38 IU/L) and ALT (10-45 IU/L) levels, this indicates a cholestatic problem. On the other hand, if the AST and ALT rise is significantly higher than the ALP and GGT rise, this indicates an hepatic problem. Finally, distinguishing between hepatic causes of jaundice, comparing levels of AST and ALT can prove useful. AST levels will typically be higher than ALT. This remains the case in most hepatic disorders except for hepatitis (viral or hepatotoxic). Alcoholic liver damage may see fairly normal ALT levels, with AST 10x higher than ALT. On the other hand, if ALT is higher than AST, this is indicative of hepatitis. Levels of ALT and AST are not well correlated to the extent of liver damage, although rapid drops in these levels from very high levels can indicate severe necrosis. Low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> tend to indicate a chronic condition, while it is normal in hepatitis and cholestasis.|$|E

40|$|Excretion <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> in {{the urine}} is highly variable, ranging from nondetectable {{quantities}} to milligrams <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> and even grams <b>of</b> <b>albumin.</b> Microalbuminuria is defined as low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> urinary <b>albumin</b> excretion <b>of</b> 30 to 300 mg/d. Microalbuminuria is highly prevalent; in hypertensive and diabetic populations, its prevalence varies from 10 to 40 %. It is interesting that microalbuminuria also is found frequently in seemingly healthy individuals (5 to 7 %). The variable excretion <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> {{in the urine}} {{is related to the}} risk for the individual to develop cardiovascular (CV) disease: Absence or very low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> albuminuria is associated with low CV risk, whereas the CV risk increases markedly with increasing amount <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> in the urine (even within the now considered normal range). The predictive power <b>of</b> urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>levels</b> for CV risk is independent of other CV risk factors and not only is present in individual with diabetes and/or hypertension but also in healthy individuals. Treatments that lower albuminuria are associated with CV protection, as demonstrated in randomized, controlled trials of patients with diabetes as well as in patients with hypertension. There is preliminary evidence that albuminuria lowering is CV protective in healthy individuals with an elevated albumin excretion rate. Differences between individuals in their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>albumin</b> excretion are already observed {{at a very early age}} (just after birth). In fact, the interindividual variability seems to be relatively constant in the first 5 decades of life, indicating that microalbuminuria is not necessarily a consequence of vascular damage at later age. Higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> urinary <b>albumin</b> seem to reflect the ordinary interindividual variability in (renal and systemic) endothelial function. Experimental data show that between strains and even within strains, rats at young age show a remarkable difference in individual endothelial function, and this is strongly related to the susceptibility of that rat to organ damage. In conclusion, albuminuria seems to be a sensitive marker very early in life for the susceptibility of an individual to CV disease. It therefore may be an ideal target for early primary prevention using CV-protective therapy regimens...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albumin,</b> total protein and phosphorous in normal pregnancy and preeclamptic women. Methods: In this case-control study, 100 pregnant women aged 20 to 30 years with the gestational age of 28 to 40 weeks were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: 50 women as case group (preeclamsia) and 50 women as control group (normal pregnancy). The serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Albumin,</b> total protein and phosphorous were measured in both groups. Results: There were no significant difference between two groups in demographic factors and mean maternal age but duration of pregnancy was significantly different in the two groups (36. 29 ± 3. 2 weeks in case group and 38. 19 ± 2. 5 in control group) (P< 0. 0001). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressurse and body mass index were significantly different in both groups (P< 0. 0001). The mean systolic blood pressure in preeclamptic women was 149. 8 ± 13. 39 and in normal group was 108. 7 ± 9. 73 and the mean diastolic blood pressure in preeclamptic women was 95 ± 8. 57 and in normal group was 67. 4 ± 10. 72.
