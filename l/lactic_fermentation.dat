50|$|Cheese from camel milk is more {{difficult}} to make than cheese from the milk of other dairy animals. It does not coagulate easily and bovine rennet fails to coagulate the milk effectively. In camel herding communities camel milk cheeses use spontaneous fermentation, or <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> to achieve a sour curd. In camel farms in Sudan, the Rashaida tribe use this method to store surplus milk in the rainy season, pulverising the dried curds and adding water for consumption in the dry season. In Mongolia camel milk is consumed as a product at various stages of the curd-making process. Recent advances in cheese making technology have made it possible to coagulate camel milk with a vegetable rennet and camel rennet.|$|E
5000|$|Other than etymology, [...] "naan", {{as we know}} it today, {{originates}} from Central and South India with {{influence from}} the Middle-East. The most familiar and readily available varieties of naan in Western countries are the South Asian varieties. In Iran, from which the word ultimately originated, nān (نان) does not carry any special significance, as it is merely the generic word for any kind of bread, as well as in other West Asian nations or ethnic groups in the region, such as amongst Kurds, Turks, Azerbaijanis (from both Azerbaijan and Iran), etc. Naan in parts of South Asia usually refers to a specific kind of thick flatbread (another well-known kind of flatbread is chapati). Generally, it resembles pita and, like pita bread, is usually leavened with yeast or with bread starter (leavened naan dough left over from a previous batch); unleavened dough (similar to that used for roti) is also used. Naan is cooked in a tandoor, from which tandoori cooking takes its name. This distinguishes it from roti, which is usually cooked on a flat or slightly concave iron griddle called a tava. Modern recipes sometimes substitute baking powder for the yeast. Milk or yogurt may also be used to impart distinct tastes to the naan. Milk used instead of water will, as it does for ordinary bread, yield a softer dough. Also, when bread starter (which contains both yeast and lactobacilli) is used, the milk may undergo modest <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> {{of foods}} {{increases}} {{the availability of}} iron as shown {{in a number of}} studies throughout the years. Several explanations have been provided such as decreased content of inhibitory phytate, increased solubility of iron, and increased content of lactic acid in the fermented product. However, to our knowledge, there are no data to support that the bioavailability of iron is affected by <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Objectives The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether the bioavailability of iron from a vegetable mix was affected by <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation</b> and to propose a mechanism for such an event, by conducting human and cell (Caco- 2, HepG 2) studies and iron speciation measurements (voltammetry). We also investigated whether the absorption of zinc was affected by the <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Results In human subjects, we observed that lactic-fermented vegetables served with both a high-phytate and low-phytate meal increased the absorption of iron, but not zinc. In vitro digested fermented vegetables were able to provoke a greater hepcidin response per ng Fe than fresh vegetables, indicating that Fe in the fermented mixes was more bioavailable, independent on the soluble Fe content. We measured that hydrated Fe 3 + species were increased after the <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation,</b> while there was no significant change in hydrated Fe 2 +. Furthermore, lactate addition to Caco- 2 cells did not affect ferritin formation in response to Fe nor did lactate affect the hepcidin response in the Caco- 2 /HepG 2 cell system. Conclusions The mechanism for the increased bioavailability of iron from lactic-fermented vegetables is likely an effect of the increase in ferric iron (Fe 3 +) species caused by the <b>lactic</b> <b>fermentation.</b> No effect on zinc bioavailability was observed...|$|E
