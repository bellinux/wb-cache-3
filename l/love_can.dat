5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that <b>love</b> <b>can</b> create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that <b>love</b> <b>can</b> continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

25|$|In The Art of Courtly Love, Andreas Capellanus, Andrew the chaplain, {{refers to}} the court of Poitiers. He claims that Eleanor, her {{daughter}} Marie, Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne, and Isabelle of Flanders would sit and listen to the quarrels of lovers and act as a jury to the questions of the court that revolved around acts of romantic love. He records some twenty-one cases, the most famous of them being a problem posed to the women about whether true <b>love</b> <b>can</b> exist in marriage. According to Capellanus, the women decided that it was not at all likely.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard {{published}} {{three more}} books {{about love and}} faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries {{to see if the}} new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how <b>love</b> <b>can</b> be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.|$|E

25|$|From {{the effort}} to resolve the {{conflicts}} brought about between love and reason there arises spiritual progress. As lower forms of love come in conflict with higher ones, human love is limited by many factors. Lust, greed and anger are limiting factors mentioned in many philosophies. The only hope of breaking these limits is {{the appearance of a}} pure form of love, called Divine love. This <b>love</b> <b>can</b> only arise through the grace of spiritual Masters. This is not a momentary event. The Avatar comes to awaken humanity to this higher love. An individual has to develop a conscious longing for this love and has to give up all forms of desires except for the desire to attain it. In human love the duality of the lover and the Beloved persist. In Divine love, lover and Beloved are indivisibly one.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between homosexuality and religion can vary greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and sects, and regarding different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality, current authoritative bodies and doctrines of the world's largest religions generally view homosexuality negatively. This can range from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, to explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality. Some teach that homosexual orientation itself is sinful, others state that only the sexual act is a sin, others are completely accepting of gays and lesbians, while some encourage homosexuality. Some claim that homosexuality can be overcome through religious faith and practice. On the other hand, voices exist within many of these religions that view homosexuality more positively, and liberal religious denominations may bless same-sex marriages. Some view same-sex love and sexuality as sacred, and a mythology of same-sex <b>love</b> <b>can</b> be found around the world.|$|E

500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in <b>love</b> <b>can</b> know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that <b>love</b> <b>can</b> enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance <b>love</b> <b>can</b> make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself. There is pleasure with its seductive power, the multiplicity with its bewildering distractions, the moment with its infatuating importance and the conceited laboriousness of busyness and the careless time-wasting of light-mindedness and the gloomy brooding of heavy-mindedness-all this will draw us away from ourselves to itself in order to deceive us. [...] But you, who are the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement.
