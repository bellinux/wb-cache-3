For a leakage-free IAW, all displacement fields must be evanescent along the normal to the boundary inside both solids, but leaky IAWs may also exist depending on the selected combination of materials. When {{at least one of}} the bonded solids is a piezoelectric material, the IAW can be excited by an interdigital transducer (IDT) located at the interface, provided one can fabricate the transducer and access the electrical contacts. We discuss here the fabrication and characterization of IAW resonators made by indirect bonding of <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> onto silicon via an organic layer. In our fabrication process, IDTs are first patterned over the surface of a Y-cut <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> <b>wafer.</b> A thin layer of SU- 8 photo-resist is then spun over the IDTs and <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> to a thickness below one micrometer.

40|$|A {{previous}} investigation, {{discovered a}} new technique to surface machine <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystals, named as `Etching During the Indiffusion of Titanium&# 039; (EDIT). In this technique, an unprocessed `top&# 039; <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> <b>wafer,</b> placed {{on top of a}} `bottom&# 039; Ti patterned <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> <b>wafer</b> and annealed in a wet oxygen atmosphere, is etched corresponding to the Ti pattern on the `bottom&# 039; wafer. The resulting etched surfaces were found to be very smooth in nature. Furthermore, the bulk material properties are maintained under the etched region, with no trace of impurities. However, unexpectedly, it was observed that trenches fabricated by this technique appeared to support optical waveguiding. This thesis investigates the optical waveguiding effect observed under EDIT etched trenches. It is demonstrated that the region under an EDIT etched trench is indeed an optical waveguide and supports optical modes. The mode behaviour depends on the trench depth and polarisation of the light input. Evidence suggests that the optical waveguiding is due to a stress induced refractive index change, under an EDIT etched trench. Single mode waveguides at 633 nm wavelength are demonstrated on x, y and z-cut congruent <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> and z-cut 5 mol% Mg-doped congruent <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate.</b> It is shown that in the EDIT technique, when the `bottom&# 039; wafer is maintained constant as x-cut congruent <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate,</b> a consistent etch depth is obtained irrespective of the crystal orientation of the <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> `top&# 039; <b>wafer.</b> However, in the case of stoichiometric <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> a significant reduction in the etch depth is observed, indicating that vacant lithium sites in the crystal lattice are of significance during the EDIT process. Evidence suggests that the observed waveguiding under EDIT etched trenches occurs due to a combination of a topography change and surface tension reshaping. This is evidenced by the observation of optical waveguiding under trenches produced using hydrofluoric acid etching and reshaping such trenches, by annealing them in the same environmental conditions of the EDIT process. When a <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystal is annealed, the surface reshapes and smoothens to minimise surface energy. When cooled to room temperature, the smoothened surface is not in equilibrium with the underlying substrate. To obtain an energetically favourable condition there is induced stress between the reformed surface and the underlying substrate, thereby, causing an increase in the refractive index via the photo-elastic effect. The EDIT technique is used to fabricate single mode optical waveguides at 1550 nm wavelength in z-cut 5 mol% Mg-doped congruent <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate.</b> Furthermore, the electric field poling technique is applied to EDIT processed crystals to fabricate periodically domain inverted structures on EDIT etched trenches, which offers great potential for applications in nonlinear integrated optics. In summary, the region under the EDIT etched trench is an optical waveguide. It is proposed that the physical mechanism behind the formation of EDIT waveguides is a combination of change in surface topography and surface tension reshaping. The resulting waveguides are impurity free and maintain the bulk material properties. Such waveguides show promise for the development of nonlinear integrated optical devices...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{rectification}} with tilted pulse fronts in <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystals {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising methods to generate terahertz (THz) radiation. In order to achieve higher optical-to-THz energy efficiency, it is necessary to cryogenically cool the crystal not only to decrease the linear phonon absorption for the generated THz wave but also to lengthen the effective interaction length between infrared pump pulses and THz waves. However, the refractive index of <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystal at lower temperature is not the same as that at room temperature, resulting in the necessity to re-optimize or even re-build the tilted pulse front setup. Here, we performed a temperature dependent measurement of refractive index and absorption coefficient on a 6. 0 mol% MgO-doped congruent <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> <b>wafer</b> by using a THz time-domain spectrometer (THz-TDS). When the crystal temperature was decreased from 300 K to 50 K, the refractive index of the crystal in the extraordinary polarization decreased from 5. 05 to 4. 88 at 0. 4 THz, resulting in ~ 1 ° change for the tilt angle inside the <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> crystal. The angle of incidence on the grating for the tilted pulse front setup at 1030 nm with demagnification factor of − 0. 5 needs to be changed by 3 °.

The physical applications of surface plasmon polaritons are less common, but promises to be useful in nonlinear effects such as frequency doubling. The propagation length of a surface plasmon polariton is low (typically 10 to 100 μm) due to absorption, radiation and coupling. The propagation length might be longer for long wavelengths.

40|$|In {{ballistic}} transport, heat carriers such as phonons {{travel through}} the solid without any scattering or interaction. Therefore, there is no temperature gradient in the solid, which seems to transport the heat without getting heated itself. Ballistic transport is typically seen in high purity crystals at either temperatures below ~ 10 K, or physical size below ~ 100 nm, where the mean free path of the carrier {{is larger than the}} solid itself. In this letter, we show evidence of ballistic transport at room temperature in <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> <b>wafers</b> in the in-plane and cross-plane directions under both steady state and high frequency heating that are monitored using both infrared and resistance thermometry. We report phonon mean free path in <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> around 425 microns, which is about 50 times higher than the largest phonon mean free path in the literature at room temperature.

Our observations will impact phonon-based electronics such as thermal transistor, thermal logic gate and memory currently impossible at room temperature.

40|$|We {{report a}} beam {{deflection}} technique that exploits electric-field controlled deflection and {{total internal reflection}} at the interface between two anti-parallel domains realized in a single crystal <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> <b>wafer.</b> The LiNbO 3 z-cut sample was 500 -µm-thick and was photolithographically patterned and poled {{by means of an}} applied electric field, in order to realize two adjacent regions of opposite domain orientation. The boundary between these domains should be very regular and free from residual stress, but in practice, a small residual index difference exists at the interface. An electric filed Ez applied across the interface region, produces equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, refractive index variations between the adjacent anti-parallel domains. For sufficiently large index variation, and for grazing incidence geometry, that is when the incidence angle is between 87 ° and 89 °, we obtain a high efficient beam deflection. Furthermore, if the incidence angle approaches the limit angle, which is about 89 °, the Total Internal Reflection (TIR) occurs, producing an abrupt beam switch from transmission to reflection, characterized with a theoretical 100 % switching contrast. However, the residual interface stress generates significant Fresnel reflection from this interface at high grazing angles, limiting the switching contrast ratio achievable at 20 dB.

The two most common techniques for photonic device fabrication on <b>lithium</b> <b>niobate</b> are titanium diffusion and proton exchange.
