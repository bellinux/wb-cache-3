40|$|AbstractThe {{relations}} between the good soldier syndrome and work satisfaction, personality and socio-demographic variables were investigated in two correlational independent studies, conducted in Romania on contract-based employees from the army and employees from public and private organizations, respectively. The results show that people satisfied with their work tend to frequently adopt organizational citizenship behaviours. These behaviours {{are associated with the}} self-efficacy, the internality, and <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> within the organization. In public organizations, the availability to contributing with extra-role behaviours in the work place is more intensive than in the private ones. People having higher education levels get more involved in volunteer behaviours...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} {{policy makers}} and educators in Michigan have advocated increasing participation of land use planning officials in land use-related education and training. The Michigan Land Use Leadership Council, commissioned by Governor Granholm, recommended that 60 % of planning and zoning officials complete basic land use planning, zoning, and smart growth educational programs by 2010. However, while demographic information has been gathered on planning officials, little empirical {{research has been conducted}} on the determinants of participating in land use education and training. This paper uses regression analysis to estimate and interpret a demand function for participation in land use-related education and training. Results indicate willingness to participate in land use-related training is a function of education, perceived benefit, and <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>service.</b> These findings have important programmatic and policy implications. Training programs should be geared towards those planning officials who are beginning to serve. Educators should focus on promoting and educating communities and planning officials on the potential benefits of land use-related training.

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the timeliness of corporate internet reporting by U. K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The research examines the significance of several corporate governance and firm-specific characteristics as potential determinants of the timeliness of corporate internet reporting. Our primary analysis provides evidence of a significant association between timely corporate internet reporting and the corporate governance characteristics of board experience and board independence. Our findings provide evidence that boards with less cross directorships, more experience in terms of the average age of directors, and lower <b>length</b> <b>in</b> <b>service</b> for executive directors provide more timely corporate internet reporting. We find that board independence is negatively associated with timely corporate internet reporting. Follow-up analysis provides additional evidence of a significant association between the timeliness of corporate internet reporting and board experience. The evidence indicates that role duality and block ownership are associated with less timely corporate internet reporting. Our findings also reveal strengths and weaknesses in the Internet reporting of U. K. listed companies. Companies need to voluntarily focus on improving the timeliness dimension of their corporate internet reporting so that the EU and U. K. accounting regulators do not replace recommendations with regulations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

To keep pace with this change is possible with both developing the organizations' physical and technological possibilities and improving human resources. Especially, the prime duty of hospitals which appear in health sector is to produce service. Due to this feature, human resources have a greater importance than the other sectors. Organizations want their employees to show maximum level of performance. However, employees may show negative attitudes about organizations because of some reasons. This attitude is explained by the concept 'cynism' whose origin is based on ancient Greek. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the employees' organizational cynism levels. What's more, the aim is to determine whether there is a significant difference between employees' organizational cynism levels and their age, educational status, <b>length</b> of <b>service</b> <b>in</b> the profession and the <b>length</b> of <b>service</b> <b>in</b> the hospital. Within the scope of the study, a questionnaire was applied to 391 nurses and the results were analyzed statistically. At the result of the study, it can be expressed that nurses show intermediate level of organizational cynism behavior. Furthermore, a significant difference was found between nurses' the <b>length</b> of <b>service</b> <b>in</b> the profession and behavioral dimension which is out of organizational cynism dimensions, between cognitive dimension and the length of work, between affective dimension with the cognitive dimension and educational status.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the levels of life {{satisfaction}} among academicians in Turkey and to investigate the effects of demographics on levels of life satisfaction among academicians. A questionnaire-based study was conducted in 648 academicians working in the Universities of Turkey. Data were collected using Diener et al. ’s Life Satisfaction Scale. The life satisfaction levels of the academicians were found to be moderately high in the study. The results of the study indicated that professors have a higher level of life satisfaction as compared to assistant professors, instructors and research assistants. Professors have the highest level of life satisfaction among the all academicians. Among the demographic variables, gender, age, income level, <b>length</b> of <b>service</b> <b>in</b> present university, <b>length</b> of <b>service</b> <b>in</b> higher education, and abroad experience were significantly related to life satisfaction.
