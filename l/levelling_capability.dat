30|$|We {{populate}} the model with 1000 agents and solve it 1000 times. At {{the end of}} each solution, the organisations which have acquired the innovation are deemed capable of carrying out a relatively low level attack, which we describe as <b>Level</b> 1 <b>capability.</b> The model is reinitialised, a new agent is selected at random to acquire an innovation, and the process is repeated. At the end of this, more agents will have acquired <b>Level</b> <b>capability.</b> And those which acquired it in the first solution and in addition acquire it in this new one are deemed to have acquired <b>Level</b> 2 <b>capability.</b> In other words, they have acquired sufficient technical skill to mount more serious attacks, with presumed higher levels of fatalities. Finally, we repeat the process again, and those agents which acquire the innovation on all three occasions are deemed capable of Level 3 attacks.|$|R

40|$|Subsidiary-level change {{requires}} the alignment of subsidiary charters and capabilities. Yet, the mechanisms {{through which the}} alignment of charters and capabilities unfolds are not yet well understood. In this paper, we investigate alignment {{from the perspective of}} managerial coordination. Drawing on a longitudinal study of a global IT firm, we identify three coordination mechanisms (charter-, experience-, and interaction-based coordination). By tracing the shifts in these coordination mechanisms over time and by specifying the implications of each mechanism for <b>capability</b> <b>level</b> change, we explain how managerial coordination influences alignment via subsidiary <b>level</b> <b>capability</b> change as well as alignment via the potential renegotiation of charters. This also allows us to provide new insights into situations of misalignment by explaining that particular mechanisms of coordination may become a source of decoupling between subsidiary actions and HQ mandates and may also result in <b>capability</b> <b>level</b> inertia. Moreover, while prior research has already acknowledged the role of interaction-based coordination for <b>capability</b> <b>level</b> change we show how and why such a mechanism of coordination emerges...|$|R

50|$|The {{capabilities}} {{involved in}} value chain management {{are very much}} interlinked and overlapping. The fact that the elements {{go hand in hand}} supports the need to have an upper level construct of value chain management capability. When changes in one area affect also the other areas of the higher <b>level</b> <b>capability,</b> {{it is important to be}} aware of the big picture. Synthesizing the individual capabilities into the upper level construct gives a more extensive view of the phenomenon and enables indeed finding linkages between the capabilities.|$|R
