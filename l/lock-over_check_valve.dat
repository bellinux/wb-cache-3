The experiment results show that reducing the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> thickness or diameter ratio can both increase the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> opening height, and decrease the air block probability. Through experiment, the optimum combination of the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> structure is obtained within the samples: as the thickness is 0. 02 mm, the diameter ratio is 1. 2, the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> opening height gets 252 µm, and within the given bubble volume, the air block probability is less than 2 %...|$|R
40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valve</b> in a {{pipeline}} {{is supposed to}} prevent the reverse flow and to allow the flow in the positive direction. The construction of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> follows these requirements, but the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> must not cause pressure pulsations in transients. It means when the fluid is accelerating or decelerating. The article describes an experimental investigation of a swing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> when the flow is changing its direction. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> was placed in an experimental circuit, where {{the pressure on the}} upstream and downstream side of the valve was measured and the current value of flow rate was determined.

50|$|Other {{causes of}} water hammer are pump failure and <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam (due to sudden deceleration, a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> may slam shut rapidly, {{depending}} on the dynamic characteristic of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and {{the mass of the}} water between a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.|$|R

The experimen-tal results show that the <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> with low inertia, assisted by springs or small travelling distance/angle, gave better performance under pressure transient conditions as compared to <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> without these features. Although different amounts of air entrainment were found to affect the experimental readings, the general characteristics of each <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> remain the same when compared between valves.

A solution method is presented which replaces the pressure and the flowrate of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> as a function of one new variable.

40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> for <b>checking</b> reverse {{water flows}} in {{drainage}} systems sometimes make large impacts through their sudden closure caused by accidental cutoff of drain pumps. In order to characterize such phenomena {{and to find}} design criteria for impactless <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> we observed the motion of a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and measured its impact acceleration and pressures in the drainage pipe, using a subscale drainage system. Two peaks of impact acceleration were observed; The first one seemed due to collision of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and the valve seat, whereas the second one did due to water column separation and recombination caused by the low pressure during the closure state of the valve. The former can be reduced by adding mass to the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and by setting an appropriate valve-seat angle. The latter possibly can be reduced by relaxing the low pressure during the closure.

40|$|The use of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. When the forces are known itis easier designing systems that will endure these slams. A commonly used software {{in the nuclear}}industry is RELAP 5 (Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program), its main purpose is to calculatetransients in piping systems. This program can also be used when calculating a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. Buthow precise is the code compared to the real event? By doing an experiment measuring pressures created by swing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> during slams, the codewas compared to real data and analyzed to decide what was of importance when modeling for thesetypes of simulations. The RELAP 5 code was not initially designed to calculate transients during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. This isclearly shown when the code overestimates the pressure waves in the system when using themanufacturer data for the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> model. Matching the data from the simulations in RELAP 5 withthe data recorded from the experiment is not easy. The parameters used for this have no connection tothe specifications for the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> which means that transients are hard to estimate withoutexperimental data...|$|R

40|$|A semi-empirical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. The method is based on parameterized valve models and dimensionless valve characteristics, which may be obtained from experiments. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is considered as a black box with certain input and output characteristics. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure and associated pressure surges are the dominant phenomena. Undamped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be considered as a}} special case of damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> Much attention is paid to the description of the hydrodynamic (fluid) forces on the internal, moving valve elements. These elements may be considered as translating or rotating bodies with (at least) one plane of symmetry. The equations of motion for the constrained, unsteady motion of such a body in an unconfined, unsteady fluid flow are based on the dynamical theory of Kirchhoff, extended to an unsteady fluid flow. The equivalent equations for a body in a confined fluid are based on Lagrange's method of generalized coordinates. A general (dimensionless) valve equation of motion is developed, which is valid for most of the existing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> types. Basic differential equations are derived for the transient flow in a pipe with constant initial flow deceleration. The equations are applied to describe the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure under reflection free and reflecting boundary conditions in the form of dimensionless, analytical equations. The theory is based on conventional waterhammer theory. The pipe and valve equations are coupled via the integral form of the momentum equation. The uncoupled and coupled, (dimensionless) pipe and valve equations show formally which (dimensionless) variables and valve, system and fluid parameters are relevant to the dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. In that sense they are used in a dimensional analysis to develop (dimensionless) valve characteristics and dynamic scale laws. Based on the dimensionless valve characteristics, models for undamped and damped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are developed and implemented in the waterhammer computer code CVWP (<b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Waterhammer Program). Experiments are performed in the test facility at Delft Hydraulics to measure several valve characteristics of weakly and strongly damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The dynamic scale laws are validated by means of numerical simulations. The valve models are validated against experimental data. The study has been performed within the <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Research Project (CVRP) ...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{reciprocating}} motion {{in a high}} frequency with the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> as the pump’s core component tends to make the valve generate fatigue damage. Especially when the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is working in the fluid, it can generate a large stress which may easily lead to stress concentration, thus aggravating the fatigue damage and causing failure of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> As a result of that, the piezoelectric pump will not work properly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> {{are also}} often used when {{multiple}} gases are mixed into one gas stream. A <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is installed {{on each of}} the individual gas streams to prevent mixing of the gases in the original source. For example, if a fuel and an oxidizer are to be mixed, then <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> will normally be used on both the fuel and oxidizer sources to ensure that the original gas cylinders remain pure and therefore nonflammable.|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} work {{performed}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relative to nuclear industry <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> performance, no information was readily available regarding the failure characteristics of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> based on valve type (e. g., swing check, lift check). Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including valve type. Since the valve type identification is not inherently included within the NPRDS engineering record for each component, ORNL had to rely upon input from NIC, valve manufacturers, and catalogs to supply the missing information. As {{a result of this}} effort, approximately 77 % of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> failures occurring during the 1991 - 1996 study period and nearly 62 % of the overall installed population were identified according to type. This data provided the basis to perform previously unavailable cross-correlations between parameters such as valve type versus failure mode and failure cause. Design characteristics and service applications differ markedly among <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> types, resulting in discernible differences in performance.

40|$|This study {{systematically}} {{explores the}} relatively neglected surge protection strategy of installing an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> at an intermediate point within a pipeline. The in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is selected to isolate {{part of the}} system from a high-pressure source of fluid subsequent to a low-pressure water hammer event, in this way greatly reducing or eliminating any return surge. A typical application involving a pipeline with an isolated high point within its profile is numerically investigated. The low pressure transient event first opens an air-vacuum valve at the line’s high point. However, the violent expulsion and collapse of this air cavity is thereafter avoided, and thus the resulting water hammer pressures dramatically reduced, by an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> installed between the high point and the downstream reservoir. The effectiveness of the surge protection is shown to depend on hydraulics and topology of the line (particularly the position of the high point), on the position of the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> and on both the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> only protects the lower (normally upstream) portion of the line from the return surge, the transient response of the remainder of the line can sometimes be improved through installing either a bypass around the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or by perforating the <b>check</b> <b>valve’s</b> working element. The role and function of any pressure-relieving function at the valve is also numerically investigated and is shown to be a compromise between upstream and downstream protection. Bryan W.

5000|$|An in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{similar to}} the lift <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> However, this valve {{generally}} has a spring that will 'lift' when there is pressure on the upstream side of the valve.
