Of course, if we don't come upon a flat stone we shall conclude that they put a layer of sand and fine gravel over the slabs covering the vaults, and must then, as I say, get up one stone and gradually lift all the rest, clearing out the gravel as we go to the depth of a foot or so.

5000|$|William Friedman, {{director}} of the US Army's Signals Intelligence Service, devised a system to correct for this attack by truly randomizing {{the motion of the}} rotors.

When a letter was pressed on the keyboard the signal would be sent through the rotors {{as it was in the}} Enigma, producing an encrypted version. In addition, the current would also flow through the paper tape attachment, and any holes in the tape at its current location would cause the corresponding rotor to turn, and then advance the paper tape one position. In comparison, the Enigma rotated its rotors one position with each key press, a much less random movement. The resulting design went into limited production as the M-134, and its message settings included the position of the tape and the settings of a plugboard that indicated which <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> on the tape controlled which rotors.

5000|$|A simple {{vertical}} crack with {{a freshly}} fractured surface and old rust {{marks on the}} face was easily distinguished {{to the side of}} the centre joint, extending from the bottom flange to the top of the girder. This was associated with a casting defect hidden behind a surface skin of sound metal at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the joint flange. The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> Whilst the metal appeared to be of good quality to the naked eye, the tested tensile strength of the metal varied widely from the lowest of ~4.5 tsi (c 70 MPa) (close to the honeycombing) with a mean of 7.5 tsi (c 115 MPa).The accident report says that the girder if sound would have had a breaking strength of 80 tons and concludes that the theoretical strength of the girder was ‘above but only just above’ the Board of Trade requirement (live load x 6 + dead load x 3) (However this appears inconsistent with the figures quoted by the report for dead weight (21 ton shared between 2 girders) and live load (21 ton shared between two girders))The actual strength fell below this because of the casting defect; [...] "The sectional area of the bottom flange would at one place be reduced from 36 (sq) ins to only 28 (sq) ins, thus enormously reducing the strength of the girder" ...|$|E
5000|$|The concentrating {{machine for}} slimes, which has {{hitherto}} {{been a great}} favourite, is the round buddle, and this was perhaps due to the great simplicity of its construction, which permitted its being made out of the odds and ends of machinery usually to be found on a mine. The fixed and revolving cast-iron heads, shafting, bevel wheels, and driving pulleys, are usually procured from a firm of machinery makers.The buddle itself consists of a shallow circular pit formed in the ground from 14 ft. to 22 ft. diameter, and from 1 ft. to 1½ ft. deep. The poorer the slimes the greater the diameter, and as the product from the buddle always requires re-treatment, it is usual to concentrate first in a machine of small diameter, and then to re-treat the concentrates thus produced in one of a larger diameter. The sides of the buddle pit are formed of stone or brick, set in mortar, and the floor, which has an inclination outwards of 1 in 30, is made either of smooth planed boards or cement run upon a layer of concrete. The centre head is from 6 ft. to 10 ft. in diameter, and may even be less. A revolving head is fixed to the shaft, and this carries four arms. The revolving head receives the slime waters from the trough, and distributes them on an even layer over the fixed head the liquid stream, which {{should be in a}} uniform thin film, falls {{over the edge of the}} fixed head, and distributes itself outwards over the sloping floor of the buddle towards the circumference, depositing in its passage the rich ore it contains, according to its specific gravity, the richest first, close to the fixed head, and the poorest at the circumference. To each of the four arms a board is attached, carrying a cloth or a series of brushes, which sweep round and smooth out each successive layer of mineral as soon as it is formed. In some cases sprays of fresh water are used instead of the cloths or brushes, the number of revolutions in either case being 3 or 4 per minute.The outflow of the waste waters takes place through the small sluice gate shown in the circumference of the huddle. In the door of this sluice is a vertical <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> and, as the layer of mineral thickens on the floor, a plug is placed in the lowest hole, and so successively up the series, until the full thickness of the deposit equal to the height of the cone is reached. At this point the machine is stopped, a groove is cut from the cone to the circumference, and samples of the ore are taken and washed on a vanning shovel. By this means an idea is formed as to where the divisions should be made for at the head the concentrates are rich in galena, and then follow the mixed ores, either of galena, blende, and gangue, if blende is present, or of galena and gangue, if it is absent. Two qualities of the mixed ores are formed. Rings are formed around the deposit on the buddle to indicate the division lines. The rich heads are taken out and reworked once in another buddle, when they will be rich enough to be sent to the dolly tub. The middles are likewise re-treated, the ores of approximately the same percentage being treated in the same machine until all the mineral is abstracted, and the waste contains not more than ½ per cent. of lead, and 1 to 1½ per cent. of zinc. By successive re-treatment the minerals may thus be enriched up to 50 to 60 per cent. Pb., and when blende is present, to about 42 per cent. Zn. These concentrates may either be sold as they are, or further enriched in a dolly tub.The great drawbacks to the round buddle are the facts that no clean products can be made straight away. The mineral must be handled several times, always a costly proceeding, and the machine must be stopped when full, and lie idle until emptied. A large number of buddles are always required to cope with the slimes from even a small mill, while in large mills, especially when blende is present, from sixteen to twenty would be needed.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} results of a {{numerical}} and theoretical study of buckling in elastic columns containing a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> Buckling is a common failure mode of elastic columns under compression, found over scales ranging from metres in buildings and aircraft to tens of nanometers in DNA. This failure usually occurs through lateral buckling, described for slender columns by Euler’s theory. When the column is perforated with a regular <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> a new buckling mode arises, in which adjacent holes collapse in orthogonal directions. In this paper, we firstly elucidate how this alternate hole buckling mode coexists and interacts with classical Euler buckling modes, using finite-element numerical calculations with bifurcation tracking.

Secondly, we develop a novel predictive model for the buckling of columns perforated with large holes. This model is derived without arbitrary fitting parameters, and quantitatively predicts the critical strain for buckling. We extend the model to sheets perforated with a regular array of circular holes and use it to provide quantitative predictions of their buckling...|$|E

40|$|Tunability and {{programmability}} {{are highly}} demanded for silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs) {{to expand their}} applications in the next-generation photonics. The main objective of this thesis is to develop several reconfigurable and programmable photonic crystal (PC) devices. In Chapter 2, we developed a relatively general nanofabrication process for integrating PC devices with movable mechanical components on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers. We also investigated grating coupling technology, to facilitate coupling lights {{into and out of}} PC devices. In Chapter 3, we developed an all-optical programmable PC device that integrates digital micromirror device (DMD), photo-responsive LC, and PC technologies. We demonstrated the functionality and programmability of the device, by forming a point-defect cavity, a straight waveguide, and a waveguide bend on the single device. In Chapter 4, we developed two types of reconfigurable PC devices by leveraging the strengths of optical nanobeam and nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS) technologies. The first device consists of an array of movable nanobeams. Each nanobeam is an electrostatically tunable photonic element in a PC waveguide. We demonstrated the capability of the device to engineer different photonic bandgaps, by tuning one unit in group of two neighboring nanobeam units, tuning one or two in group of three units, and forming two reconfigurable PCs, on the single device. To achieve a higher-level integration, we also theoretically studied another reconfigurable PC integrating an array of mechanical tunable nanobeams with an array of fixed pillars into the top silicon layer of a SOI wafer. In Chapter 5, we developed two tunable photonic crystal-cantilever cavity (PC 3) resonators. The first device has an NEMS cantilever embedded into a L 6 cavity in a PC slab. The second device has a similar cantilever to insert into a nanobeam-base waveguide. We studied bending characteristics of the cantilever and optical characteristics of these two devices at different applied voltages. In Chapter 6, we conducted theoretical investigation on a nano-opto-mechanical reconfigurable PIC device consisting of an array of silicon plugs and a 2 D PC slab. We theoretically demonstrated that a point-defect cavity, a line-defect waveguide, and a waveguide bend can be configured in the PC slab, by inserting different plugs into an air hole, a straight <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> and an L-shape <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|E

Three or four charges of powder were placed in each; a stick of a quarter of an inch in diameter was then placed in each hole, and pounded ice was rammed tightly in around it until the holes were filled up, a few drops of water being poured in on the top, so as to freeze the whole into a solid mass. There was no fear of the powder being wetted, for the frost was intense. Then the sticks were withdrawn and the holes left filled with powder. With the heated ramrods little troughs were sunk half an inch deep, connecting the tops <b>of</b> the holes; <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> powder were placed in these trenches; narrow strips of skin were laid over them, and the snow was then thrown on again. The two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> trenches were connected at the ends at the shore, so that they could be fired simultaneously.|$|R
