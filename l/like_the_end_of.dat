500|$|Following the Master of Reality {{world tour}} in 1972, Black Sabbath took its first break in three years. As Ward explained: [...] "The band started to become very {{fatigued}} and very tired. We'd {{been on the}} road non-stop, year in and year out, constantly touring and recording. I think Master of Reality was kind of <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an era, the first three albums, and we decided to take our time with the next album." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing {{sessions}} for the band's fifth studio album first began in 2009, {{shortly after the}} band released Daisy, Lacey stated that the band had new material {{that they were looking}} to record, dismissing rumors that Daisy would be their last full-length album. Discussing the musical direction of the fifth album, Lacey stated that he believed Daisy [...] "was <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a road" [...] and that they would likely backtrack and explore an alternative direction to take their new music. The band were booked to enter a recording studio in April 2012, however the band ultimately used this time for personal musical projects as opposed to recording Brand New.|$|E
500|$|U.S. {{reconnaissance}} {{discovered on}} 5 April 1966, that the North Vietnamese were constructing positions {{for what could}} only be surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries. The air force and navy then filed a joint appeal to Washington for permission to strike the sites, but they were refused {{since most of the}} sites were near the restricted urban areas. Then, on 24 July, an F-105 was shot down by a SA-2 Guideline missile. Three days later, a one-time strike was authorized against the two offending missile sites. The Americans, however, fell for an elaborate trap when the sites turned out to be dummies surrounded by anti-aircraft artillery defenses. One American pilot described the action which followed as [...] "looking <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the world." [...] Six of the strike craft were destroyed (two of the pilots were killed, one missing, two captured, and one rescued) during the ambush.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} written in 4/4 or common time, but Walt Disney {{felt it was}} too much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> a Broadway show and wanted a song that was more [...] "breezy", <b>like</b> a waltz. <b>The</b> song was recrafted into a 3/4 waltz-like arrangement.|$|R
500|$|The orchestral {{portions}} of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] reflect Lennon and McCartney's {{interest in the}} work of avant-garde composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, Luciano Berio and John Cage. To fill the empty 24-bar middle section, Lennon's request to George Martin, the band's producer, was that the orchestra should provide [...] "a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the world". McCartney suggested having the musicians improvise over the segment. To allay concerns that classically trained musicians would be unable to do this, Martin wrote a loose score for the section. Using the rhythm implied by Lennon's staggered intonation on the words [...] "turn you on", the score was an extended, atonal crescendo that encouraged the musicians to improvise within the defined framework. The orchestral part was recorded on 10 February 1967 in Studio One at EMI Studios, with Martin and McCartney conducting a 40-piece orchestra. The recording session was completed at a total cost of £367 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) for the players, an extravagance at the time. Martin later described explaining his score to the puzzled orchestra: ...|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club's Zach Handlen graded {{the episode}} with an A-, praising the opening as [...] "quite good" [...] and believing the tie between Walter and his past {{research}} [...] "changes the game" [...] ("Having Walter be, in a way, {{the source of}} the current disturbance suddenly made everything that much more important"). Jane Boursaw of TV Squad liked the revelation about Walter's safe deposit boxes, but questioned Olivia's logic to get out of her SUV when fleeing her kidnappers. SFScope's Sarah Stegall exclaimed, [...] "Now this is science fiction! I was absolutely thrilled by this week's episode". She elaborated by praising Olivia's [...] "B story" [...] about her and John Scott's memories, the series' use of [...] "cold-blooded" [...] villains, and believed [...] "the elements of the show are finally achieving some balance." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted [...] "Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and it really does feel <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a chapter. What started as the 'wacky science project of the week' builds to an episode that feels like a mini season finale." ...|$|E
500|$|Sakanaction {{found that}} {{after moving to}} Tokyo, where the band stood in the Japanese music scene was a lot clearer to them. The album's sound was {{inspired}} by Tokyo, and was a search to more consciously define what Sakanaction's identity was, compared to their first two albums. As a result, Shin-shiro felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the first chapter of}} Sakanaction to the band members. The music the band created on Shin-shiro was a mix of everything that the band wanted to try musically, and an attempt to make a more [...] "colorful" [...] album inspired by both new wave and live performance-style arrangements. They increased the tempo on the songs for the album, and focused on the beat of each song more than whether each song was structurally a pop song or not. Consciously attempting to create an album with a more popular sound, Yamaguchi was anxious about how his works would be received, and felt that these anxieties expressed themselves more on the album. For the song [...] "Enough", however, Yamaguchi wanted to create one song on the album that expressed his own thoughts on the album without being influenced by these pressures. The final studio takes of the songs were recorded in September 2008.|$|E

500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
500|$|As {{the last}} chord of the [...] "Sgt. Pepper" [...] reprise plays, an {{acoustic}} guitar strumming offbeat quavers begins, introducing what Moore describes as [...] "one {{of the most}} harrowing songs ever written". [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] consists of four verses by Lennon, a bridge, two aleatoric orchestral crescendos and an interpolated middle part written and sung by McCartney. The first crescendo serves as a segue between the third verse and the middle part, leading to a bridge known as the [...] "dream sequence". The idea to use an orchestra was McCartney's; he drew inspiration from the avant-garde composers John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. The 24-bar crescendos feature forty musicians selected from the London and Royal Philharmonic Orchestras and tasked with filling the space with what Womack describes as [...] "the sound of pure apocalypse". Martin notes Lennon's request for [...] "a tremendous build-up, from nothing up to something absolutely <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the world". Lennon recalled drawing inspiration for the lyrics from a newspaper: [...] "I was writing the song with the Daily Mail propped {{up in front of}} me at the piano... there was a paragraph about 4000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire". For [...] "A Day in the Life", he wanted his voice to sound like Elvis Presley on [...] "Heartbreak Hotel". Martin and Emerick obliged by adding 90 milliseconds of tape echo. Womack describes Starr's performance as [...] "one of his most inventive drum parts on record", a part that McCartney encouraged him to attempt despite his protests against [...] "flashy drumming". The thunderous piano chord that concludes the track and the album was produced by recording Lennon, Starr, McCartney and Evans simultaneously sounding an E major chord on three separate pianos; Martin then augmented the sound with a harmonium. Riley characterises the song as a [...] "postlude to the Pepper fantasy... that sets all the other songs in perspective", while shattering the illusion of [...] "Pepperland" [...] by introducing the [...] "parallel universe of everyday life". MacDonald describes the track as [...] "a song not of disillusionment with life itself, but of disenchantment with the limits of mundane perception". According to him, it [...] "remains among the most penetrating and innovative artistic reflections of its era", representing the Beatles' [...] "finest single achievement".|$|E

2500|$|Just {{two days}} after the {{play-off}} defeat, it was announced, following much speculation, that Paul Buckle would be leaving Torquay after four seasons to become the new manager of Bristol Rovers. [...] It was a position he had been linked with since the previous December after the sacking of Paul Trollope and, when his successor Dave Penney was also sacked after just two months, there was a certain inevitability to Buckle's eventual move to the Memorial Stadium. [...] With Buckle also taking first team coach Shaun North with him to Rovers, there was now a huge rebuilding job to be done at Plainmoor. [...] With uncertainty hanging over those players whose contracts were soon to expire as well as the loan players which had performed admirably over the final few months of the season, it was looking <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an era for Torquay United and {{the beginning of a new}} one.|$|E
2500|$|Rashi read Balaam's request in [...] to [...] "die {{the death}} of the upright" [...] to mean that Balaam sought to die among the Israelites. Judah Halevi, however, saw in Balaam's prophetic prayer that his death might be made easy and his end be {{as the end of the}} Israelites an allusion to the {{immortality}} of the soul, the afterlife, and the resurrection of the dead. Similarly, Ibn Ezra stated his belief that Balaam wanted his end to be <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Israel, who are God's portion and granted a share in the World To Come. Ibn Ezra also noted that others said that [...] "my end" [...] repeats [...] "let me die," [...] for Balaam knew that he would die by the sword. Similarly, Nachmanides wrote that Balaam saw that the righteous would be inheritors of the Garden of Eden and life after death, and that Israel's [...] "portion is in [...] life" [...] (in the words of [...] ) and not in Gehenna and destruction. Thus Nachmanides read Balaam's prophecy to say that God does not want the Jews to be cursed and their end will be good, according to the way of the righteous. And the early 14th century Spanish commentator Bachya ben Asher also read Balaam to wish for death, provided that his death would an eternal future like the Israelites, who Bachya saw as an integral part of God. Citing Ibn Ezra, Bachya noted that Balaam had foreseen a violent death by the sword for himself. Bachya read Balaam's prophecy to reveal that there is a world after death of the body consisting of disembodied souls, and that there is also a resurrection at a later time when these disembodied souls will be reunited with their former bodies. In Bachya's view, Balaam expressed the hope that when he died, his soul would qualify for immediate transfer to that world (and not to the place where his soul would be being judged). Bachya concluded that Balaam's wish for this kind of death and afterlife for himself was proof that he paid the Jewish people the greatest possible compliment.|$|E
