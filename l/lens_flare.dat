5|$|ILM's {{computer}} graphics division {{was responsible for}} creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis. Meyer's idea for the effect was influenced by The Poseidon Adventure; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the Poseidon to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a <b>lens</b> <b>flare</b> simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail texture mapped to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{also wanted}} the {{lighting}} to look realistic and evoke the science fiction films of his youth. He thought that Pixar captured {{the physics of}} being underwater with Finding Nemo and so for WALL-E, he wanted to push that for air. While rewatching some of his favorite science fiction films, he realized that Pixar's other movies had lacked the look of 70 mm film and its barrel distortion, <b>lens</b> <b>flare,</b> and racking focus. Producer Jim Morris invited Roger Deakins and Dennis Muren to advise on lighting and atmosphere. Muren spent several months with Pixar, while Deakins hosted one talk and was requested to stay on for another two weeks. Stanton said Muren's experience came from integrating computer animation into live-action settings, while Deakins helped them understand not to overly complicate their camerawork and lighting. 1970s Panavision cameras were used to help the animators understand and replicate handheld imperfections like unfocused backgrounds in digital environments. The first lighting test included building a three-dimensional replica of WALL-E, filming it with a 70mm camera, {{and then trying to}} replicate that in the computer. Stanton cited the shallow lens work of Gus Van Sant's films as an influence, as it created intimacy in each close-up. Stanton chose angles for the virtual cameras that a live-action filmmaker would choose if filming on a set.|$|E

500|$|Gizmodo editor Diaz {{discussed}} the correspondence between Apple and a reader about purple flare in pictures taken on iPhone 5 camera. Apple's {{response to the}} issue was that it is normal and advised the customer to aim the camera away from bright light sources when taking photos. Tests conducted by TechCrunch indicate that the problem existed on the iPhone 4S but was more distinct and pronounced on the iPhone 5. Consumer Reports found that the purple haze effect occurred on several other manufacturers' phones including the Samsung Galaxy S III and Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, {{and that it was}} not less pronounced on the iPhone 4S.

500|$|Reviewers' overall {{impressions}} of the game were positive. [...] Games Master UK called it a [...] "timeless classic" [...] with a [...] "reasonable download price".

500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face {{made her want to}} blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a <b>lens</b> <b>flare,</b> which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.|$|E

500|$|For the new pilot, Fox made {{it clear}} that they would not air the episodes in the {{widescreen}} format. Whedon and company felt they had to [...] "serve two masters" [...] by filming widescreen for eventual DVD release, but keeping objects in frame so it could still work when aired in pan and scan full frame. To obtain an immersive and immediate feel, the episodes were filmed in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, giving them the look of [...] "found footage", with deliberately misframed or out-of-focus subjects. As Whedon related: [...] "...don't be arch, don't be sweeping—be found, be rough and tumble and docu and you-are-there". Computer-generated scenes mimicked the motion of a hand-held camera. This style was not used, however, when shooting scenes that involved the central government, the Alliance. Tracking and steady cameras were used to show the sterility of this aspect of the Firefly universe. Another style employed was lens flares harking back to 1970s television. This style was so desired that the director of photography, David Boyd, sent back the cutting-edge lenses which reduced <b>lens</b> <b>flare</b> in exchange for cheaper ones.|$|E
500|$|Vaughn said he {{shot the}} film {{in a way it}} resembled the {{productions}} of the 1960s, with [...] "very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang", and using the anamorphic format [...] "to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the James Bond films". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did [...] "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" [...] of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the look he wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, [...] "keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as <b>lens</b> <b>flare</b> and chromatic aberration and edge fringing." [...] The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that [...] "could be done with traditional optical". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the Bond films.|$|E
500|$|Ion Storm {{solicited}} {{feedback from}} fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998, and assured {{inclusion of a}} multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, [...] "It {{is going to be}} very cinematic and about as non-linear as you can get. Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." [...] Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, <b>lens</b> <b>flare,</b> and volumetric fog. The gaming press received Anachronox well; one reporter wrote the game was [...] "stunningly beautiful... some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be [...] "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the [...] "Most Promising Game" [...] and [...] "Best RPG" [...] categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, [...] "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for Anachronox.|$|E

500|$|The script posed several {{technical}} {{challenges to}} both the puppet and special effects departments of Century 21 Productions. The [...] "blurring" [...] of the structures making up the Mysteron city was accomplished by mounting a sheet of glass between the camera and the effects set, with Vaseline placed on the glass at the necessary points to create <b>lens</b> <b>flare.</b> Complex scale model shots of Captain Blue's SPV navigating the spiral structure of the Car-Vu were simplified by turning the road surface instead of the vehicle, thus eliminating the requirement to manipulate the wires (or move the camera). Since the spinning blades reduced the practicality of overhead wire control, the scenes of Spectrum Helicopter A42's dogfight with the jetpack-wearing Blue were filmed upside-down (with wires supporting {{the base of the}} helicopter model) and flipped during post-production. A sequence of the World President and Captain Brown standing on a moving walkway while undergoing security checks at the Maximum Security Building was particularly difficult to film, since it was essential that the puppet operators, working from a gantry overhead, keep pace with the speed of the conveyor belt powering the set below. The Captain Scarlet [...] "grimacing" [...] head, used for the reaction shot immediately after the reconstruction is hit by Blue's bullet, was sculpted especially by the puppet workshop for its one-off appearance in this episode. In his DVD audio commentary for the episode, Gerry Anderson remembered how, on a technical level, [...] "everything had to be perfect" [...] for the filming of the first episode of the new series.|$|E

J. Abrams jealous, a woman dancing in lace lingerie, and Drake. It's a fitting video– its film noir, Twin Peaks-y vibe perfectly matches the track's subtle sexy-creepy energy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similar colored {{fringing}} around highlights {{may also}} be caused by <b>lens</b> <b>flare.</b> Colored fringing around highlights or dark regions {{may be due to}} the receptors for different colors having differing dynamic range or sensitivity – therefore preserving detail in one or two color channels, while [...] "blowing out" [...] or failing to register, in the other channel or channels. On digital cameras, the particular demosaicing algorithm is likely to affect the apparent degree of this problem. Another cause of this fringing is chromatic aberration in the very small microlenses used to collect more light for each CCD pixel; since these lenses are tuned to correctly focus green light, the incorrect focusing of red and blue results in purple fringing around highlights. This is a uniform problem across the frame, and is more of a problem in CCDs with a very small pixel pitch such as those used in compact cameras. Some cameras, such as the Panasonic Lumix series and newer Nikon and Sony DSLRs, feature a processing step specifically designed to remove it.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{the female}} lead (Héloïse Godet and Zoé Bruneau) {{and the male}} lead (Kamel Abdeli and Richard Chevallier) were {{intentionally}} cast to physically resemble each other. The scenes with Bruneau and Chevallier were shot in the summer, while the scenes with Godet and Abdeli were shot in the winter. The actors waited {{two and a half}} years to begin shooting after first being cast due to constant delays. After rehearsing for two years, Abdelli travelled from Paris to Rolle for the first day of shooting, only to discover that Godard had changed his mind. Bruneau's 2014 memoir Waiting for Godard chronicles the making of the film. Godard often re-wrote scenes the night before filming and allowed no improvisation on set, aside from minor screen blocking. One such improvisation involved an actress sitting in front of a lamp, resulting in <b>lens</b> <b>flare</b> that Aragno called [...] "magic" [...] in 3D. Godet said that Godard's direction was [...] "very precise and very gentle, but clear and no discussion about it." [...] There was very little rehearsal time for the actors, but Aragno took a lot of time to set up each shot. French film historian Florence Colombani was asked to travel to Godard's home and act in the film, then discovered that he only wanted to film her hands drawing the Cross of Lorraine while she spoke her dialogue.|$|E
2500|$|... A {{few weeks}} later, our dog {{got hit by}} a {{snowplow}} and I forgot all about the problem of names. Until college, when I learned to play the guitar, and, as an exercise, started writing songs (very poorly executed) {{in the same way that}} Henry Ford produced the automobile: assembly-line-style. I wrote songs for the days of the week (poor Monday!). Songs for the planets (poor Pluto!). Songs for the Apostles (poor Judas!). And, finally, when all else failed, I started a series of songs for names. [...] Each piece was a rhetorical, philosophical, musical rumination on all the possible names I had entertained years before when my parents had given me the one chance to change my own. Oh fates! I sang these songs in the privacy of my dorm room, behind closed doors, pillows and cushions stuffed in the air vents so no one would hear. And then I almost failed Latin class, my grades plummeted, my social life dissolved into ping pong tournaments in the residence halls, and, gradually, my interest in music (or anything divine, creative, fruitful, enriching) completely waned. I turned to beer. And cigarettes. And TV sitcoms. And candy bars. Oh well! A perfectly good youth wasted on junk food! That is, until a few months ago, when I came across some of the old name songs, stuffed onto tape cassettes, 4-track recorders, forgotten boxes, forgotten shelves, forgotten hard drives. It was like finding an old diary, or a high school yearbook, senior picture with <b>lens</b> <b>flare</b> and pockmarks, slightly cute and embarrassing. What was I thinking? [...] " ...|$|E
