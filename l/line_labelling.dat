40|$|Several {{researches}} {{had worked}} {{on the development of}} sketch interpreters. However, very few of them gave a complete cycle of the sketch interpreter which can be used to transform an engineering sketch to a valid solid object. In this paper, a framework of the complete cycle of the sketch interpreter is presented. The discussion in this paper will stress out on the usage of <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> and graph coloring application in the validation of two dimensional (2 D) line drawing phase. Both applications are needed to determine whether the given 2 D line drawing represent possible or impossible object. In 2008, previous work by Matondang et al., has used <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> algorithm to validate several 2 D line drawings. However, the result shows that <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> algorithm itself, is not adequate, as the algorithm does not have a validation technique for the result. Therefore, in this research study, {{it is going to be}} shown that if a 2 D line drawing is valid as a possible object by using the <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> algorithm, then it can be colored using graph coloring concept with a determine-able minimum numbers of color needed. This is equal in vice versa. By that way, it is said that the 2 D line drawings is valid. The expected output from this phase is a valid-labeled of 2 D line drawing with differen...|$|E
40|$|A tool {{which can}} quickly {{interpret}} line drawings (with hidden lines removed) of engineering objects as boundary representation CAD models {{would be of}} significant benefit {{in the process of}} engineering design. Inflation of the drawing to produce a frontal geometry, a geometric realisation of that part of the object visible in the drawing, is an important stage of this process. Previous methods of producing frontal geometries have relied on the technique of <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> (labelling edges as convex, concave or occluding). Although restricted subsets of the line-labelling problem have known solutions, reliable methods have not been found for the general line-labelling problem, and traditional methods, when adapted to drawings with non-trihedral junctions, are unacceptably slow. Many other papers assume that <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> is an essential step. Here, we show this is not necessarily true, and that comparable results can be obtained by a novel alternative approach. Firstly, we consider what outputs from <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> are essential to the production of frontal geometry. Secondly, we investigate by what other means these outputs can be produced. Our work indicates that the only essential output from <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> for frontal geometry is the determination of which T-junctions in a drawing are occluding and which are non-occluding. This information is required for inflation, and also for detection of symmetry and for constructing hidden topology. Thus, we propose and analyse a new method which, in the absence of line labels, simultaneously inflates a drawing to produce the frontal geometry and attempts to determine whether each T-junction is occluding or not. For drawings of objects with holes or pockets, and for cases where <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> is particularly unreliable, our new method can provide a better alternative...|$|E

40|$|The task {{of obtaining}} a <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> from a {{greyscale}} image of trihedral objects presents difficulties {{not found in}} the classical <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> problem. As originally formulated, the <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> problem assumed that each junction was correctly pre-classified as being of a particular junction type (e. g. T, Y, arrow); the success of the algorithms proposed have depended critically upon getting this initial junction classification correct. In real images, however, junctions of different types may actually look quite similar, and this pre-classification is often difficult to achieve. This issue is addressed by recasting the <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> problem in terms of a coupled probabilistic system which <b>labels</b> both <b>lines</b> and junctions. This results in a robust system, in which prior knowledge of acceptable configurations can serve to overcome the problem of misleading or ambiguous evidence. ...|$|R

This paper {{describes}} the POLL (Perceptual Organization and <b>Line</b> <b>Labeling)</b> system for obtaining <b>labeled</b> <b>line</b> drawings from single intensity images using an integrated blackboard system. This system emphasizes the data driven extraction of 3 D geometric information from intensity images. The robustness {{of the system}} comes from it being implemented in an integrated framework in which the errors made by one module can be diagnosed and corrected by the constraints imposed by other modules. The system is able to generate an initial line drawing from an intensity image {{in the domain of}} piecewise smooth objects. Four modules were used as knowledge sources: weak membrane edge detection, curvilinear grouping, proximity grouping, and curvilinear <b>line</b> <b>labeling.</b> An initial representation of the image data is built using the rst three knowledge sources. This representation is analyzed using a modied curvilinear <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> algorithm developed in this paper that uses gure{ ground separation to constrain legal line labelings. This modied <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> algorithm can diagnose problems with the initial representation. The modied <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> algorithm can nd errors such as missing edges, improperly typed vertices, and missing phantom junctions. Errors in the representation can be xed using a set of heuristics that were created to repair common mistakes. If no irreparable errors are found in the representation, then the modied <b>line</b> <b>labeling</b> algorithm produces a 3 D interpretation of the data in the input image without explicitly reconstructing 3 D shape. ...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{creation}} of B-rep models of engineering objects from freehand sketches would benefit designers. A subgoal {{is to take}} a single line drawing (with hidden lines removed), and from it deduce an initial 3 D geometric realisation of the visible part of the object. Junction and line labels, and provisional depth coordinates, are important components of this frontal geometry. Most methods for producing frontal geometry use <b>line</b> <b>labelling,</b> but this takes little or no account of geometry. As a result, the line labels produced can be unreliable. Previously, we proposed an approach which inflates a drawing to produce provisional depth coordinates, and uses these to make deductions about line labels. Even a naïve implementation can outperform previous <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> methods in certain cases. In this paper, we further enhance this approach. We extend the algorithm to non-isometric-projection drawings, consider improved ways of realising some of the concepts, and also consider how to combine this approach with other labelling techniques to gain the benefits of each. We test our approach using to be drawings of what we consider representative samples of engineering objects; these exemplify difficulties not considered in many previous papers on <b>line</b> <b>labelling.</b> Our results, based on this test set, show that the enhancements result in significant benefits...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method of}} constructing a B-rep solid model from a single hidden-line removed sketch view of a 3 D object. The main steps of our approach are as follows. The sketch is first tidied in 2 D (to remove digitisation errors). <b>Line</b> <b>labelling</b> is used to deduce the initial topology of the object and to locate hidden faces. Constraints are then produced from the <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> and features in the drawing (such as probable symmetry) involving the unknown face coefficients and point depths. A least squares solution is found to the linear system and any grossly incompatible equations are rejected. Vertices are recalculated as the intersections of the faces to ensure we have a reconstructible solid. Any incomplete faces are then completed {{as far as possible}} from neighbouring faces, producing a solid model from the initial sketch, if successful.

However, the results are not sufficiently robust because the existing <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> methods do not have any validation method to verify their own result. In this research paper, the concept of graph colouring is applied to a validation technique for a labelled 2 D line drawing. As a result, a graph colouring algorithm for validating labelled 2 D line drawings is presented. A high-level programming language, MATLAB R 2009 a, and two primitive 2 D line drawing classes, prism and pyramid are used to show how the algorithms can be implemented. The proposed algorithm also shows that the minimum number of colours needed to colour the labelled 2 D line drawing object is equal to 3 for prisms and n − 1 for pyramids, where n is the number of vertices (junctions) in the pyramid objects...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{creating}} 2 1 2 D models from line drawings of opaque solid objects. We allow the artist to draw naturally, differing from many previous approaches. Our system allows both perspective and orthographic projection to be used and makes no a priori assumptions about the type of model to be produced (i. e. planar, curved, normalon). The frontal geometry is reconstructed by placing constraints at the contours and solving a 2 D variational system for the smoothest piecewise smooth surface. An analysis of <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> allows us to determine what constraints are possible and/or required for each input line. However, because <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> produces a combinatorial explosion of valid output geometries, we allow the user to guide the constraint selection and optimization with a simple user interface that abstracts the technical details away from the user. The system produces candidate reconstructions using different constraint values, from which the user selects the one that most closely approximates the model represented by the drawing. These choices allow the system to determine the constraints and reconstruct the model. The system runs at interactive speeds.

One step aims {{to take a}} line drawing (with hidden lines removed), and from it deduce an initial three-dimensional (3 D) geometric realization of the visible part of the object, including junction and <b>line</b> <b>labels,</b> and depth coordinates. Most methods for producing this frontal geometry use <b>line</b> <b>labeling,</b> which takes little or no account of geometry. Thus, the <b>line</b> <b>labels</b> produced can be unreliable. Our alternative approach inflates a drawing to produce provisional depth coordinates, and from these makes deductions about <b>line</b> <b>labels.</b> Assuming many edges in the drawing are parallel {{to one of three}} main orthogonal directions, we first attempt to identify groups of parallel lines aligned with the three major axes of the object.

We then inflate the drawing in a coordinate system based on the plane of the drawing and depth perpendicular to it. Finally, we use this geometry to identify which lines in the drawing correspond to convex, concave, or occluding edges. We discuss alternative realizations of some of the concepts, how to cope with nonisometric-projection drawings, and how to combine this approach with other labeling techniques to gain the benefits of each.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{interpreting}} line drawings of scenes composed of opaque regular solid objects bounded by piecewise smooth surfaces with no markings or texture on them. It is assumed that the line drawing has been formed by orthographic projection of such a scene under general view-point, that the line drawing is error free, {{and that there are}} no lines due to shadows or speculanties. Our definition implicitly excludes laminae, wires, and the apices of cones. A major component of the interpretation of line drawings is <b>line</b> <b>labelling.</b> By <b>line</b> <b>labelling</b> we mean (a) classification of each image curve as corresponding to either a depth or orientation discontinuity in the scene, and (b) further subclassification of each kind of discontinuity. For a depth discontinuity we deter-mine whether it is a limb-a locus of points on the surface where the line of sight is tangent to the surface-or an occluding edge-a tangent plane discontinuity of the surface. For an orientation discon-tinuity, we determine whether it corresponds to a convex or concave edge. This paper presents the first mathematically rigorous scheme for labelling line drawings of the class of scenes described. Previous schemes for labelling line drawings of scenes containing curved objects were heuristic, incomplete, and lacked proper mathematical justification. By analyzing the projection of the neighborhoods of different kinds of points on a piecewise smooth surface, we are able to catalog all local labelling possibilities for the different types of junctions in a line drawing. An algorithm is developed which utilizes this catalog to determine all legal labellings of the line drawing. A local minimum complexity rule-at each vertex select those labellings which correspond to the minimum number of faces meeting at the vertex-is used in order to prune highly counter-intuitive interpretations. The labelling scheme was implemented and tested on a number of line drawings. The labellings obtained are few and by and large in accordance with human interpretations. ...|$|E

A minority of ~ 6 % of interneurons co-expressed PV and SOM in the presubiculum of Sst-Cre animals. The electrophysiological and morphological properties of fluorescent interneurons from Pvalb-Cre, Sst-Cre and X 98 mice differed. Distinct physiological groups of presubicular interneurons were resolved by unsupervised cluster analysis of parameters describing passive properties, firing patterns and AP shapes. One group consisted of SOM-positive, Martinotti type neurons with a low firing threshold (cluster 1). Fast spiking basket cells, mainly from the Pvalb-Cre line, formed a distinct group (cluster 3). Another group (cluster 2) contained interneurons of intermediate electrical properties and basket-cell like morphologies. These labeled neurons were recorded from both Sst-Cre and Pvalb-Cre animals. Thus, our results reveal a wide variation in anatomical and physiological properties for these interneurons, a real overlap of interneurons immuno-positive for both PV and SOM as well as an off-target recombination in the Sst-Cre line, possibly linked to maternal cre inheritance...|$|E
