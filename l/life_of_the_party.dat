25|$|Many of Arbuckle's films, {{including}} the feature <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> (1920), survive only as worn prints with foreign-language inter-titles. Little or no {{effort was made}} to preserve original negatives and prints during Hollywood's first two decades. By the early 21st century, some of Arbuckle's short subjects (particularly those co-starring Chaplin or Keaton) had been restored, released on DVD, and even screened theatrically. Arbuckle's early influence on American slapstick comedy is widely recognised.|$|E

25|$|Before {{his death}} in 1997, comedian Chris Farley {{expressed}} interest in starring as Arbuckle in a biography film. According to the 2008 biography The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts, Farley and screenwriter David Mamet agreed {{to work together on}} what would have been Farley's first dramatic role. In 2007, director Kevin Connor planned a film, The <b>Life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party,</b> based on Arbuckle's life. It was to star Chris Kattan and Preston Lacy. However the project was shelved. Like Farley, comedians John Belushi and John Candy also considered playing Arbuckle, but each of them died before a biopic was made. Farley's film was signed with Vince Vaughn as his co-star.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{received}} generally well by critics. Brian Zoromski of IGN stated that: [...] "Any episode that places Michael and Dwight {{outside of their}} normal office environment is set up for some very funny (and usually awkward) situations and 'The Convention' is no exception. Some of the episode's best uncomfortable moments centered on Michael believing he's the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> and that he's Jim's friend. Michael and Dwight pretending to laugh along to an inside joke made by Jim's new boss, Josh, is a prime example. Michael's comment, 'I love inside jokes. Love {{to be part of}} one someday,' creates the kind of uncomfortable silence that The Office excels at." [...] Also on IGN, the show received a 9.8 out of 10 [...] "incredible" [...] rating from the site's editorial staff.|$|E

Her character was well received, and garnered her the Telugu Filmfare Award for Best Actress, besides Nandi Special Jury Award and Santosham Award for Best Actress. Sify concluded about her acting in their review that, [...] "The scene stealer is Genelia with her innocent looks and cute mannerisms.

500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1916 season started, {{it became clear}} that the Dodgers were one of the better teams in the league.

He was the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> and just kept all us old-timers [...] pepped up all season." [...] Stengel, mostly playing right field, hit [...]279 with eight home runs, one less than the team leader in that category, Wheat. Stengel's home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, who won 33 games that year, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 30, provided the margin of victory as the Dodgers went into first place to stay, qualifying for their first World Series, against the Boston Red Sox. Despite getting two hits in a Game 1 loss at Boston, Stengel was benched for Game 2 because the Red Sox were pitching a left hander, Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn's only victory of the series. He was benched again in Game 4 against left hander Dutch Leonard, though he was inserted as a pinch runner, and got another hit in the Game 5 loss, finishing 4 for 11, [...]364, the best Dodger batting average of the Series.|$|E

60|$|This {{evening he}} was the <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>party,</b> and his open {{communicative}} disposition, free from all disguise, soon put them in possession of his history.
