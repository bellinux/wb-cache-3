5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} Glacier Bay existed during {{a minimum of}} four Glacial periods ending with the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, which has a 4,000-year-old record, as the latest period. All glaciers in the park today {{are said to be}} {{remnants}} of this glacial period.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various warming and cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|Retreat of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost about one-quarter of their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age caused crop {{failures}} and famines in Europe. The 1690s saw the worst famine in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe famine in 1696–1697, during which {{about one-third of}} the Finnish population died.|$|E
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age.|$|E
5|$|For example, in the 17th century, {{the solar}} cycle {{appeared}} to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum. This coincided {{in time with the}} era of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures. Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Glaciers {{were present}} on the volcano until the {{conclusion}} of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, {{at the beginning of the}} 20thcentury. Pleistocene glaciers have largely eroded Thielsen's calderaleading to exposure of its contents. The small Lathrop Glacier in the northern cirque of the volcano is the only extant glacier on Mount Thielsen. While the glaciation was extensive, volcanic ash from eruptive activity at Mount Mazama has almost certainly masked contents.|$|E
5|$|The Sawtooth Mountains {{were last}} {{extensively}} glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, which ended around 1850AD. Evidence of past glaciation is {{abundant in the}} Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, {{as well as the}} north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of the glaciers include glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and arêtes.|$|E

5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great Famine of 1315–17. The causes of the Great Famine included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|The rocky cliffs, common {{features}} downstream of the Minho's estuary, disappear in Póvoa de Varzim, {{giving way to}} a coastal plain. The plain {{is located in a}} cuspate foreland, an old marine plateau from the Plio-Pleistocene, conferring a sandy soil to the coastal lands. The sand dunes in the Northwestern coast formed during the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age and started piling up in the 15th or 16th century. Wandering along the coast one discerns Cape Santo André, the tip of the cuspate foreland and the Avarus Promontory, referred to by Ptolemy.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Famines became {{common in}} {{northern}} China {{in the early}} 17th century because of unusually dry and cold weather that shortened the growing season – effects of a larger ecological event {{now known as the}} <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age. Famine, alongside tax increases, widespread military desertions, a declining relief system, and natural disasters such as flooding and inability of the government to properly manage irrigation and flood-control projects caused widespread loss of life and normal civility. The central government, starved of resources, could do very little to mitigate the effects of these calamities. Making matters worse, a widespread epidemic spread across China from Zhejiang to Henan, killing an unknown but large number of people. The deadliest earthquake of all time, the Shaanxi earthquake of 1556, occurred during the Jiajing Emperor's reign, killing approximately 830,000 people.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} Middle Ages, England's climate {{differed}} from that in the 21st century. Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period, a prolonged period of warmer temperatures; in the early 13th century, for example, summers were around 1°C warmer than today and the climate was slightly drier. These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north. The Warm Period was followed by several centuries of much cooler temperatures, termed the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age; by the 14th century spring temperatures had dropped considerably, reaching their coldest in the 1340s and 1350s. This cold end to the Middle Ages significantly affected English agriculture and living conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{chromosphere}} of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, granulation, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated with the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland {{in the early}} modern era covers {{all aspects of the}} land in Scotland, including physical and human, between the sixteenth century and the beginnings of the Agricultural Revolution and industrialisation in the eighteenth century. The defining factor in the {{geography of}} Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the Lowlands into the fertile Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture and {{horticulture}} seek {{to optimize}} the capture of solar energy in order {{to optimize the}} productivity of plants. Techniques such as timed planting cycles, tailored row orientation, staggered heights between rows and the mixing of plant varieties can improve crop yields. While sunlight is generally considered a plentiful resource, the exceptions highlight the importance of solar energy to agriculture. During the short growing seasons of the <b>Little</b> <b>Ice</b> Age, French and English farmers employed fruit walls to maximize the collection of solar energy. These walls acted as thermal masses and accelerated ripening by keeping plants warm. Early fruit walls were built perpendicular {{to the ground and}} facing south, but over time, sloping walls were developed to make better use of sunlight. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier even suggested using a tracking mechanism which could pivot to follow the Sun. Applications of solar energy in agriculture aside from growing crops include pumping water, drying crops, brooding chicks and drying chicken manure. More recently the technology has been embraced by vintners, who use the energy generated by solar panels to power grape presses.|$|E
