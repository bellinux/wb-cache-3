During invasive electrophysiology studies, the catheter handle is manipulated by an interventionalist to guide the catheter's distal section toward endocardium for pacing and ablation. Catheter manipulation requires dexterity and experience, and exposes the interventionalist to ionizing radiation. Through the course of this research, a platform was developed to assist and enhance the navigation of the catheter inside the cardiac chambers. This robotic platform replaces the interventionalist's hand in catheter manipulation and provides the option to force the catheter tip in arbitrary directions using a 3 D input device or to automatically navigate the catheter to desired positions within a cardiac chamber by commanding the software to do so. To accomplish catheter navigation, the catheter was modeled as a continuum manipulator, and utilizing robot kinematics, catheter tip position control was designed and implemented. An electromagnetic tracking system was utilized to measure the position and orientation of two key points in catheter model, for position feedback to the control system. A software platform was developed to implement the navigation and control strategies and to interface with the robot, the 3 D input device and the tracking system. The catheter modeling was validated through in-vitro experiments with a static phantom, and in-vivo experiments on three <b>live</b> <b>swines.</b> The feasibility of automatic navigation was also veri ed by navigating to three landmarks in the beating heart of swine subjects, and comparing their performance with that of an experienced interventionalist using quasi biplane fluoroscopy.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{detailed}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the U.

The functional unit was defined as one kilogram (2. 2 pounds) of <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> at the farm gate, ready for transport to the abattoir. This assessment focused on the three highest producing USDA regions, which encompassed the Midwest (Regions 5 and 7) and the Southeast (Region 4), representing 86 % of U. S. market hog production. First, a literature review was conducted to summarize the most current information and knowledge regarding the status of land use accounting in agriculture and livestock production. The literature review identified work reported by other researchers and organizations, nationally and internationally, and was used to guide the methods and help create the life cycle inventory (LCI) for the detailed LCA. The study showed that the average land occupation required to produce 1 kg of <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> weight (LW) in the U. S. was 4. 22 m 2 a. This result is based on a feed ration that was intended to represent a typical U. S. swine ration, referred to as the baseline. Regional results were calculated assuming corn, DDGs, and soybean meal were sourced within each production region, excluding Region 4, which assumed 70 % of the feed was a commodity average. Swine in Region 4 had the highest land occupation at 4. 59 m 2 a/kg LW, followed by 4. 13 m 2 a/kg LW in Region 5 and 4. 11 m 2 a/kg LW in Region 7. In addition to the baseline diet, six diet scenarios were modeled to assess the impact of ration composition. A linear programming model was used to construct four ration manipulation strategies intended to lower cost, carbon footprint, water use, and land use.

An additional 4 porcine crystalline lenses were touched with either the HV or GV for 1 minute. Following PPV, human vitreous was removed and processed for electron microscopy (EM). Eyes and lenses were fixed and sectioned for light microscopy (LM). There were no macroscopic retinal or optic nerve defects associated with either HV or GV PPVs. Cadaveric retinal specimens showed separation of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and vacuolization and fragmentation at the nerve fiber layer (NFL) and the ganglion cell layer (GCL). ILM fragmentation and separation were found after PPV in <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> with both vitrectors. Small disruptions of the posterior capsule or structural lens defects were found after HV touch.

Ultrasound has been used previously to predict subcutaneous fat thickness and IMF in the longissimus muscles of line pigs and Real-time ultrasound has also been reported as a reliable method for estimating IMF in live pigs. So we estimate the correlation between meat quality traits and IMF percentage to investigate the possibility of utilizing real-time ultrasound technology for predicting IMF percentage in line pigs to improve pork quality. The genetic and phenotypic correlations for chemical intramuscular fat (CIMF) and ultrasound intramuscular fat (UIMF) were estimated to be 0. 75 and 0. 76, respectively.

Differences in proportions of T-cell subpopulations in peripheral blood among individuals under same conditions provide evidence of genetic control on these traits, but {{little is known about the}} genetic mechanism of them, especially in swine. Identification of the genetic control on these variants may help the genetic improvement of immune capacity through selection. Results To identify genomic regions responsible for these immune traits in swine, a genome-wide association study was conducted. A total of 675 pigs of three breeds were involved in the study. At 21 days of age, all individuals were vaccinated with modified <b>live</b> classical <b>swine</b> fever vaccine. Blood samples were collected when the piglets were 20 and 35 days of age, respectively. Seven traits, including the proportions of CD 4 +, CD 8 +, CD 4 +CD 8 +, CD 4 +CD 8 âˆ’, CD 4 âˆ’CD 8 +, CD 4 âˆ’CD 8 âˆ’ and the ratio of CD 4 + to CD 8 + T cells were measured at the two ages. All the samples were genotyped for 62, 163 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) using the Illumina porcineSNP 60 k BeadChip. 40833 SNPs were selected after quality control for association tests between SNPs and each immune trait considered based on a single-locus regression model. To tackle the issue of multiple testing in GWAS, 10, 000 permutations were performed to determine the chromosome-wise and genome-wise significance levels of association tests. In total, 61 SNPs with chromosome-wise significance level and 3 SNPs with genome-wise significance level were identified. 27 significant SNPs were located within the immune-related QTL regions reported in previous studies. Furthermore, several significant SNPs fell into the regions harboring known immunity-related genes, 14 of them fell into the regions which harbor some known T cell-related genes. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that genome-wide association studies would be a feasible way for revealing the potential genetics variants affecting T-cell subpopulations.

M. flocculare, a commensal bacterium, is genetically {{closely related}} to M. hyopneumoniae, the causative agent of enzootic porcine pneumonia. M. hyorhinis is also pathogenic, causing polyserositis and arthritis. In this work, we present the genome sequences of M. flocculare and M. hyopneumoniae strain 7422, and we compare these genomes with the genomes of other M. hyoponeumoniae strain and to the a M. hyorhinis genome. These analyses were performed to identify possible characteristics that may help to explain the different behaviors of these species in swine respiratory tracts. Results: The overall genome organization of three species was analyzed, revealing that the ORF clusters (OCs) differ considerably and that inversions and rearrangements are common. Although M. flocculare and M. hyopneumoniae display {{a high degree of}} similarity with respect to the gene content, only some genomic regions display considerable synteny. Genes encoding proteins that may be involved in host-cell adhesion in M. hyopneumoniae and M. flocculare display differences in genomic structure and organization. Some genes encoding adhesins of the P 97 family are absent in M. flocculare and some contain sequence differences or lack of domains that are considered to be important for adhesion to host cells. The phylogenetic relationship of the three species was confirmed by a phylogenomic approach. The set of genes involved in metabolism, especially in the uptake of precursors for nucleic acids synthesis and nucleotide metabolism, display some differences in copy number and the presence/absence in the three species. Conclusions: The comparative analyses of three mycoplasma species that inhabit the swine respiratory tract facilitated the identification of some characteristics that may be related to their different behaviors. M. hyopneumoniae and M. flocculare display many differences that may help to explain why one species is pathogenic and the other is considered to be commensal.

Peripheral blood cells were isolated over the course of vaccination/infection and stimulated with C-strain or UK 2000 / 7. 1 viruses. Virus-specific responses of peripheral blood cells isolated from C-strain vaccinated pigs were dominated by the production of IFN-Î³. IFN-Î³ production in response to the C-strain virus was first detected in vaccinates 9 days post-vaccination and was sustained over the period of observation. In contrast, cells from challenge control animals did not secrete IFN-Î³ in response to stimulation with C-strain or UK 2000 / 7. 1 viruses. Supernatants from UK 2000 / 7. 1 infected animals contained significant levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines from day 8 post-infection and these cytokines were present in both virus and mock stimulated cultures.

We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H 1 N 1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, {{as well as other}} socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which {{may have contributed to the}} emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H 1 N 1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen wil...|$|E
40|$|Background: The swine is {{a common}} {{preclinical}} large-animal model for medical research because of the resemblance of its tissue structures to those of humans. However, the lymphatic system in swine is poorly understood. The authors investigated the lymphatic system and defined territories (lymphosomes) in swine using the microinjection technique. Methods: Six swine (two male and four female 17. 5 - to 50 -kg Sus domesticus) were used. Real-time indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography was performed in four <b>live</b> <b>swine.</b> After the animals were killed, the authors injected a radiocontrast mixture consisting of barium sulfate and hydrogen peroxide with red acrylic dye directly into lymphatic vessels in six swine carcasses. Courses of the lymphatic vessel were analyzed radiographically. The lymphatic vessels were dissected meticulously and chased until they connected to the first-tier (sentinel) lymph node. This procedure was repeated throughout the body until all {{the relationships between the}} lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes were defined. Results: The authors successfully mapped the superficial lymphatic vessels and their corresponding lymph nodes. Indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography and subsequent radiography revealed that the swine lymphatic system contained seven lymphosomes: parotid, mandibular, dorsal cervical, ventral cervical, subiliac, inguinal, and popliteal territories. Of note, no lymph nodes existed in the superficial axillary region. Conclusions: The swine could be a useful large-animal model for lymphatic research because of the anatomical consistency of the lymphosomes among animals and the sizable lymphatic vessels. However, swine lack the superficial axillary lymph node found in humans, suggesting that swine may not be a good model for breast cancerâ€“related lymphedema. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{documents the}} development of a new illumination technique for use in the studies of retinal oximetry and fundus spectroscopy. Intravitreal illumination is a technique where the back of the eye is illuminated trans-sclerally using a scanning monochromator coupled into a fiber optic illuminator. Retinal oximetry is the processof measuring the oxygen saturation of blood contained in retinal vessels by quantitative measurement of the characteristic color shift seen as blood oxygen saturation changes from oxygenated blood (reddish) to deoxygenated blood (bluish). Retinal oximetry was first attempted in 1963 but due to a variety of problems with accuracy and difficulty of measurement, has not matured to the point of clinical acceptabilityor commercial viability. Accurate retinal oximetry relies in part on an adequate understanding of the spectral reflectance characteristics of the fundus. The use of intravitreal illumination allows new investigations into the spectral reflectance properties of the fundus. The results of much research in fundus reflectance and retinal oximetry is detailed in thisdocument, providing new insight into both of these related fields of study. Intravitreal illumination has been used to study retinal vessel oximetry and fundus reflectometry resulting in several important findings that are presented in this document. Studies on enucleated swine eyes have provided new insight into the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of the fundus. Research on <b>live</b> <b>swine</b> hasshown accurate measurement of retinal vessel oxygen saturation and provided the first in vivo spectral transmittance measurement of the sensory retina. A secondary discovery during this research suggests that vitrectomy alters the retinal vasculature,a finding that should spawn new research in its own right...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the first prevalence of antibodies and experimental inoculation of suspected samples of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from ELISA positive pigs from swine herds in Brazil. Based on {{the hypothesis that}} this agent is present in swine herds worldwide, {{the objective of this}} work was to establish a diagnostic methodology and to investigate the occurrence of PRRSV in Brazilian swine herds. Fifty-four swine herds, the total number which imported genetic material (<b>live</b> pigs or <b>swine</b> semen) from countries where PRRS was endemic from 1990 to December 2000, from eight Brazilian States all included in this study. The sampling used was such as to detect a prevalence of infection of 5 %, with a confidence level of 95 %. A total of 3785 serum samples were tested for PRRSV antibodies by ELISA. Following the ELISA test, which was performed with two different commercial kits, all serum positive pigs were retested, examined and additional materials were collected. Viral isolation in permissive tissue culture cells and swine bioassays were performed. Additionally, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested RT-PCR were also performed. We could not demonstrate the presence of PRRSV or RNA of PRRSV by viral isolation or RT-PCR (or nested RT-PCR), respectively in all of the analyzed samples. Furthermore, the pigs inoculated with PRRSV suspicion samples did not seroconvert nor produce characteristic PRRS lesions in the swine bioassay. Thus, our results indicate no evidence of PRRSV in the samples analyzed from swine herds in this study...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination with <b>live</b> {{attenuated}} classical <b>swine</b> fever virus (CSFV) vaccines can rapidly confer {{protection in}} the absence of neutralizing antibodies. With an aim of providing information on the cellular mechanisms that may mediate this protection, we explored the interaction of porcine natural killer (NK) cells and Î³Î´ T cells with CSFV. Both NK and Î³Î´ T cells were refractory to infection with attenuated or virulent CSFV, and no stimulatory effects, as assessed by the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (MHC-II), perforin, and gamma interferon (IFN-Î³), were observed when the cells were cultured in the presence of CSFV. Coculture with CSFV and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) showed that pDCs led to a partial activation of both NK and Î³Î´ T cells, with upregulation of MHC-II being observed. An analysis of cytokine expression by infected DC subsets suggested that this effect was due to IFN-Î± secreted by infected pDCs. These results were supported by ex vivo analyses of NK and Î³Î´ T cells in the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes from pigs that had been vaccinated with live attenuated CSFV and/or virulent CSFV. At 5 days postchallenge, there was evidence of significant upregulation of MHC-II but not perforin on NK and Î³Î´ T cells, which was observed only following a challenge of the unvaccinated pigs and correlated with increased CSFV replication and IFN-Î± expression in both the tonsils and serum. Together, these data suggest that it is unlikely that NK or Î³Î´ T cells contribute to the cellular effector mechanisms induced by live attenuated CSFV...|$|R
40|$|People who <b>live</b> near {{industrial}} <b>swine</b> {{operations have}} reported decreased health {{and quality of}} life. To investigate these issues, we surveyed residents of three rural communities, one {{in the vicinity of}} an approximately 6, 000 -head hog operation, one in the vicinity of two intensive cattle operations, and a third rural agricultural area without livestock operations that use liquid waste management systems. Trained interviewers obtained information about health symptoms and reduced quality of life during the previous 6 months. We completed 155 interviews, with a refusal rate of 14 %. Community differences in the mean number of episodes were compared with adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and employment status. The average number of episodes of many symptoms was similar in the three communities; however, certain respiratory and gastrointestinal problems and mucous membrane irritation were elevated among residents {{in the vicinity of the}} hog operation. Residents in the vicinity of the hog operation reported increased occurrences of headaches, runny nose, sore throat, excessive coughing, diarrhea, and burning eyes as compared to residents of the community with no intensive livestock operations. Quality of life, as indicated by the number of times residents could not open their windows or go outside even in nice weather, was similar in the control and the community in the vicinity of the cattle operation but greatly reduced among residents near the hog operation. Respiratory and mucous membrane effects were consistent with the results of studies of occupational exposures among swine confinement-house workers and previous findings for neighbors of intensive swine operations. Long-term physical and mental health impacts could not be investigated in this study...|$|R
