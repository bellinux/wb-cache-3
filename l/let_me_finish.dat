2500|$|The London show's sixth anniversary {{performance}} {{was held on}} 21 May 2008, a week after its actual anniversary due to the unavailability of Brian May. For {{the first time since}} the show opened, the Killer Queen character performed the entire song [...] "Don't Stop Me Now", a musical number which is normally interrupted by the Khashoggi character. This unique performance is acknowledged by Killer Queen's dialogue: [...] "No, you didn't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>finish,</b> you never <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>finish.</b> For six long years, night after night, week after week, year after year. Well, tonight, I'm going to finish." [...] To which Khashoggi replied: [...] "It's not in the script!" [...] The Killer Queen proceeded to yell [...] "Screw the script!" [...] before continuing the song. Additionally, May joined Killer Queen and the dancers on stage for the performance. After the encore, Elton made a thank you speech, after which the entire cast performed [...] "The Show Must Go On", accompanied by May on guitar.|$|E

40|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> say, to <b>finish</b> this review, {{that the}} {{achievements}} of Field"s book are undeniable. He offers a paracomplete logic that preserves the principles and features that enable us to use the truth predicate as a logical device of quantification over sentences. His logic, moreover, validates an impressively high number of classical principles and contains an operator {{that can be used}} to characterize paradoxical sentences without at least apparently falling prey of new paradoxes. That is, doubtless, a remarkable feat and the use Field makes of fixed point constructions and revision rules, together with his discussion of well-known solutions to the Liar Paradox constitute a major contribution to the literature on this topic. If my remarks here pursue often what the book leaves out (rather than what it contains), that is, partly, because I think that the real philosophical significance of Field"s achievements will emerge in discussing some of the issues that could not be developed in STFP...|$|R

40|$|Though only my name {{appears on}} the cover of this dissertation, a great many of people have contributed to its production. I owe my {{gratitude}} to all those people. First, my advisor Prof. Dr. Mira Mezini, who gave me the opportunity to conduct my {{research in the area of}} intelligent IDEs and who supported me with countless discussions and helpful comments. Also, I owe her many thanks for enabling me to present my ideas to a much larger audience than I ever expected to reach, and for providing kind words at times when things did work as well as they should. I would also like to thank my co-advisor Prof. Dr. Andreas Zeller for his time spent on critically reading the work and all other committee members who <b>let</b> <b>me</b> successfully <b>finish</b> and conclude this chapter of my life. Many thanks also go to all my co-authors for the amazing and hard work they put into the project, and of course to all of my 58 students that supported this research work – it was my pleasure to learn from and work with you!
