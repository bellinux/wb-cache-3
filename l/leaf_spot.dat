5|$|American {{gooseberry}} mildew and {{powdery mildew}} can infect {{the leaves and}} shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (Drepanopeziza ribis) is another disease of blackcurrants, {{but it is not}} usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{including}} bacteria, fungi, {{and viruses}} are important as plant pathogens, causing disease to crop plants. Fungi cause serious crop {{diseases such as}} maize leaf rust, wheat stem rust, and powdery mildew. Bacteria cause plant diseases including <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> and crown galls. Viruses cause plant diseases such as leaf mosaic. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes potato blight, contributing to the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s.|$|E
40|$|Several foliar {{diseases}} are being reported in corn at this time, {{and it is}} important to be able to differentiate between the various <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> because management options will vary. Some <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> are caused by bacteria and therefore cannot be managed with a foliar fungicide. Development of other <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> will slow considerably in the extreme hot temperatures we are currently having. However, there are some <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> that favor these hot, humid conditions and, depending on disease pressure and hybrid susceptibility, management with a foliar fungicide may be warranted...|$|R
40|$|Samples of two toxic weeds, Solanum glaucophyllum and Xanthium strumarium, bearing <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> {{symptoms}} were found. Cercospora apii was found associated to these <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> in both plants.

50|$|In mature palms, if {{the fungus}} {{is limited to}} only <b>leaf</b> <b>spots,</b> the disease may not be very serious and damaging. However, the fungus can {{severely}} affect juvenile plants if only a few <b>leaf</b> <b>spots</b> are present because {{they have yet to}} develop a trunk and only have a few leaves.|$|R
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} Spodoptera picta (Crinum grub) as well as Pseudococcidae (Mealybugs), large, and small narcissus bulb flies (Eumerus strigatus and E funeralis), thrips, mites, aphids, snails and slugs. A fungal disease attacking Hippeastrum is Stagonospora curtisii (red blotch, red <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> or red fire). The leaves are also eaten by grasshoppers, and grasshoppers commonly plant egg pods in the ground near Hippeastrum bulbs, which erupt in the spring, covering the plant with nymphs.|$|E
5|$|Other fungi {{affect the}} {{remainder}} of the plant. Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds and stems (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves and stems.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and <b>leaf</b> <b>spot.</b> The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E

40|$|Cost of {{the apple}} {{production}} that’s keep increasing because pesticide price of disease control was more expensive. The microbe isolation of rhizosfir {{can be used to}} overcome pathogen as cause of disease of flour dew and <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> at the apple leaf by antagonist test. The ability of resistivity was value of antagonist ability to pressure the growth of pathogen as cause of flour dew and <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> disease. The research objective was to find out microbe antagonist rhizosfir that can control pathogen of flour dew and <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> disease at the apple. Isolation in this research was conducted at flour dew and <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> disease as pathogen cause of disease. Isolation of rhizosfir uses dilution method as anthagonist microbe. The research sample was taken from Batu town East Java. Microbe as result of isolation was tested by test phases: (1) purification of microbe: (1. a) purification of <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> pathogen and flour dew by observed large of microbe surface during for 7 days, (1. b) purification of antagonist microbe as many microbe gain from rhizosfir, (2) antagonistic test: (2. a) test of antagonist microbe by flour dew pathogen, (2. b) test of antagonist microbe by <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> pathogen, (3) calculation of antagonist resistivity toward flour dew and <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> pathogen on the seventh days after inoculation. Based on calculation, can be concluded that: (1) Gain 2 pathogen as cause of flour dew disease (Podoshaera leucotricha) and <b>leaf</b> <b>spotted</b> (Marssonina coronaria J. J.

5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing <b>leaf</b> <b>spot,</b> fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore <b>leaf</b> <b>spot,</b> caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Strawberry {{plants can}} {{fall victim to}} a number of diseases. The leaves may be {{infected}} by powdery mildew, <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> (caused by the fungus Sphaerella fragariae), leaf blight (caused by the fungus Phomopsis obscurans), and by a variety of slime molds. The crown and roots may fall victim to red stele, verticillium wilt, black root rot, and nematodes. The fruits are subject to damage from gray mold, rhizopus rot, and leather rot. To prevent root-rotting, strawberries should be planted every four to five years in a new bed, at a different site.|$|E

25|$|The {{imperfect}} fungus Tubakia dryina Sutton is a leaf parasite {{reported to}} occur {{on a wide}} range of host plants, including species of Sweet Gum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2–5mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of D.dryina were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. D.dryina infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red <b>leaf</b> <b>spot.</b> Results of this investigation indicate that D.dryina can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and chlorosis caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of Dicarpella dryina. Tannins (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by D.dryina.|$|E

Research has been carried out by not-for-profit inter-governmental organisation CABI in the UK. Following earlier studies imported Japanese knotweed psyllid insects (Aphalara itadori), whose only food source is Japanese knotweed, were released at a number of sites in Britain in a study running from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2014. In 2012, results suggested that establishment and population growth were likely, after the insects overwintered successfully.|$|E
2500|$|Patellifolia {{is related}} to the {{economically}} important cultivated beets (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, with sugar beet, beetroot, chard and fodder beet). Therefore, Patellifolia is of great interest as Crop wild relative and potential gene donor. They seem to be resistant {{to some of the most}} serious diseases of sugar beets, to <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> disease caused by Cercospora beticola, curly top virus, rhizomania, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni). All three species proved to be highly resistant to the Beet cyst eelworm (Heterodera schachtii). The three species differ in their resistance level, whereas Patellifolia patellaris is not completely immune, but eelworms never develop to maturity in the other two species.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{types of}} Xanthomonas cause {{localized}} <b>leaf</b> <b>spot</b> or leaf streak while others spread systemically and cause black rot or leaf blight disease. [...] They inject {{a number of}} effector proteins, including TAL effectors, into the plant via their type III secretion system. [...] TAL effectors have several motifs normally associated with eukaryotes including multiple nuclear localization signals and an acidic activation domain. [...] When injected into plants, these proteins can enter {{the nucleus of the}} plant cell, bind plant promoter sequences, and activate transcription of plant genes that aid in bacterial infection. [...] Plants have developed a defense mechanism against type III effectors that includes R (resistance) genes triggered by these effectors. [...] Some of these R genes appear to have evolved to contain TAL-effector binding sites similar to site in the intended target gene. [...] This competition between pathogenic bacteria and the host plant has been hypothesized to account for the apparently malleable nature of the TAL effector DNA binding domain.|$|E
