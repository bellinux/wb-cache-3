40|$|Abstract- Design of new fixture is a {{modified}} {{over the old}} fixture due to some drawback. The old fixture is not suitable for drum having slot on top face. This {{is because of the}} brake drum is seated on fixture ring instead of button so there is no gap maintained. Without sufficient gap it is difficult to machine the brake drum bore(pilot diameter), as well as brake drum surface in single set up to achieve the concentricity. Also current fixture is complicated in design and there is more work in fitting the button to fixture ring. So we designed new <b>lathe</b> <b>fixture</b> over the old fixture. In new modified <b>lathe</b> <b>fixture,</b> pads are provided instead of buttons and it could be suitable for brake drum having slot on the top face and other drum also. By trail run this <b>lathe</b> <b>fixture</b> is more comfortable than old fixture. So this fixture can be used in brake drum (cargo) manufacturing companies because of its simple design and less cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 3 -D {{model of}} the <b>lathe</b> tool <b>fixture</b> and tool carrier in CNC Machine Tool for guide disc is {{established}} through Solidworks. Then, the 3 -D model is input into ANSYS, simulating the stress map and the nephogram of displacement deformation of the <b>lathe</b> tool <b>fixture</b> and tool carrier, which plays a important role in designing the <b>lathe</b> tool <b>fixture</b> and tool carrier. Intorduction The CNC Machine Tool for guide disc, which is mainly used in the guide disc producing in the product line of the hot rolling seamless steel tube, {{is a sort of}} special-purpose machine tool for metal cutting. Meanwhile, working face accuracy of the guide disc has a direct effect on the surface quality of seamless steel tube. Thereintoï¼Œlathe tool fixture is designed to fix the lathe tool, lengthen the arbor and enhance the strength of the arbor as well. It is fixed tightly in the tool carrier because of which the vibration caused by cutting can be lowered or absorbed in some case. In a word, machining accuracy of the guide disc working face is directly affected by the design of <b>lathe</b> tool <b>fixture...</b>|$|R
