500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants are so great I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E
2500|$|M.B. {{said that}} during the September 19 visit he noticed a webcam pointed at Clementi's bed and thought the {{position}} [...] "was kind of strange", {{although he did not}} think that anyone was actually watching. In cross-examination, he noted he remembered this only when it later became relevant. M.B. also said that when he lay in Clementi's bed, he heard people joking and laughing in the courtyard, and it [...] "seemed like the jokes were at somebody else's expense". When he left the room, there were about five students who [...] "seemed to be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> it seemed kind of unsettling".|$|E

60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> laughed, {{but that}} laugh was uncommonly like a snarl.|$|R
60|$|My wife <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> {{then slowly}} withdrew her hands from my arm.|$|R
2500|$|In 1945, aged 62, Bardsley married 45-year-old Gertrude Cope, {{his wife}} {{until his death}} in 1954. [...] The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: [...] "I was just {{thinking}}," [...] said the old cricketer, [...] "what a great bloke old Doc was. [...] I was thinking of him, and then I just happened to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. [...] By cripes, he's looking old. [...] And then I thought, Well, I suppose some of them are <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> saying, 'Poor old Bards. [...] By cripes, he's looking old! [...] That's just the trouble. [...] We are all just poor old So-And-So's." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Utterly {{impossible}} {{to fill a}} tenor," [...] remarked the restless-eyed gentleman, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> speaking to the worried-looking gentleman. [...] "Ever tried?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his {{brooding}} {{eyes seemed}} to scan my face.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> Charmian <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{knew she}} {{wondered}} where I had got it.|$|R
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{smiled a}} little abstractedly. Then {{she turned to the}} table.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> you are {{thinking}} of something," [...] she said, with her strange breathless rapidity of utterance. [...] "What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think my}} memory has got {{as short as}} my breath,' said Mr. Omer, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> shaking his head; 'for I don't {{remember}} you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They gave 'er ten minutes' start, {{and then}} Cap'n Tarbell, arter <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> shaking his 'ead, {{said he was}} afraid they must be going.|$|E
50|$|The song {{is used in}} the 2004 film <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> the 2012 film Moonrise Kingdom.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{saw that}} he did not know what I meant. I explained.|$|R
60|$|The lanthorn on the chariot {{was burning}} bright. And I saw Patty <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "My hi, what a pin!" [...] said a stable-boy, who {{was smoking}} a cigar, to the guard, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> putting {{his finger to}} his nose.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Creakle, at whom {{of course}} I looked, {{shook his head}} without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> stopped up a sigh with a very large piece of buttered toast.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] {{she said}} deliberately, still <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{with all her}} pose {{conveying}} her finality. She seemed to brace herself for the outbreak that must follow.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and,</b> {{with that}} {{extraordinary}} penetration {{which used to}} disconcert me, shook her head.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> he <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{seen that}} he had got it in the neck, right enough.|$|R
60|$|Euphemia <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{then the}} little pelican between us {{began to shake}} violently as we laughed.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I at him, for fully a minute. Then he beckoned to me {{with his}} whip--a slight but imperious gesture. I rose and walked to his side.|$|E
60|$|He stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{his face}} had set {{like that of a}} man who is having a hard fight with himself. It was a long two minutes before he spoke.|$|E
60|$|She gave no heed to this; {{she turned}} away. But {{in a moment}} she came back, and stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> her {{beautiful}} solemn eyes seemed to shine in the dimness of the room.|$|E
60|$|Guest <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> away {{out of the}} window. Ad√®le {{was behind}} us, and out of hearing.|$|R
60|$|Now, while Pereira was mocking and bragging of his prowess, Pieter Retief <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{our eyes}} met.|$|R

6000|$|The giant stood awhile <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and,</b> as he stood, Indaba-zimbi {{walked across}} the ring behind me, muttering as he passed, [...] "Keep cool, Macumazahn, and wait for him. I will make it all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{was silent}} for a while. [...] "Is it to be never, then?" [...] I said. [...] "Never," [...] he {{repeated}} dreamily without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> then flew into sudden activity. [...] "Jove! Two o'clock, and I sail at four!" ...|$|E
60|$|So I was pondering, when I looked up, and saw Charlotte {{standing}} in the entrance between the court and garden, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> smiling, as she shaded {{her eyes with her}} hand from the sun, and then she ran to me lightly as a lapwing.|$|E
60|$|After {{the noisy}} {{congratulations}} were {{over and the}} Rube had gone, Spears <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked a}} little to and fro after saying this to himself with a shudder, <b>and</b> then <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> brightened, and came and sat down again {{with his hands in}} his pockets.|$|R
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> fell {{a victim}} to my {{confidence}} of manner. The petulancy died {{out of his}} face.|$|R
