25|$|Unlike other therapsids, dicynodonts {{had very}} short snouts and no teeth {{except for the}} tusk-like upper canines. Dicynodonts are {{generally}} thought to have had horny beaks like those of turtles, for shearing off pieces of vegetation which were then ground on a horny secondary palate when the mouth was closed. The jaw joint was weak and moved backwards and forwards with a shearing action, instead of the more common sideways or up and down movements. It is thought that the jaw muscles were attached unusually far forward on the skull and took up a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> {{on the top and}} back of the skull. As a result, the eyes were set high and well forward on the skull, and the face was short.|$|E

25|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} {{wiped out by}} a lockout, and the Bruins had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> within the new salary cap {{implemented}} for 2005–06. Bruins management eschewed younger free agents in favor of older veterans such as Alexei Zhamnov and Brian Leetch. The newcomers were oft-injured, {{and by the end}} of November, the Bruins team traded their captain and franchise player, Joe Thornton (who went on to win the Art Ross and Hart Trophies). In exchange, the Bruins received Marco Sturm, Brad Stuart and Wayne Primeau from the San Jose Sharks. After losing 10 of 11 games before the trade, the Bruins came back with a 3–0 victory over the league-leading Ottawa Senators, as rookie goaltender Hannu Toivonen earned his first career NHL shutout. When Toivonen went down with an injury in January, journeyman goalie Tim Thomas started 16-straight games and brought the Bruins back into the playoff run. Two points out of eighth place at the Winter Olympic break, the Bruins fired General Manager Mike O'Connell in March and the Bruins missed the playoffs for the first time in five years.|$|E
500|$|After posting the demos {{on their}} Myspace page, the xx drew the {{interest}} of Young Turks, an imprint label of XL Recordings. They submitted the demos to XL's head office at Ladbroke Grove and were subsequently signed to a recording contract. The group worked with producers such as Diplo and Kwes, to no success before they were introduced to audio engineer Rodaidh McDonald by the xx's manager Caius Pawson, who gave him three CDs of demos titled [...] "Early Demos", [...] "Recorded in Rehearsal Space", and [...] "What Producers Did Wrong". McDonald {{was impressed by the}} intimate quality and use of silence on the demos, which both he and the band felt may have challenged other producers who wanted to incorporate their individual tastes: [...] "They'd worked with about four other producers before then that had—and no discredit to them—I guess they'd seen a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> to add a kind of stamp on. There was a lot of empty space in the xx's music, even then, in the 'Early Demos'. But we just found that the best stuff was the most sparse." ...|$|E

According to [...] writer Lucy O'Brien, De Vries and Orbit had {{originally}} composed and produced the track before Ray of Light had been conceived. During the sessions, Orbit found De Vries' contribution [...] "off-putting", to which the latter confessed, [...] "On all the collaborations I'd left a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> for him, but for this I wanted to put something {{on the table and}} say, 'This is what I think'". De Vries had added electronic noise frequencies during the first chorus of the song, stating that he had a [...] "vision on how the song should be finished". Orbit did not like the addition since it sounded to him that the [...] "DAT's broken". De Vries defended his contribution saying that {{it was supposed to be}} [...] "like that [...] It's quite slow for a dance tune of that nature, not a pacey tune." [...] Madonna had enjoyed all three of their contributions to the track, and as a result, Orbit reluctantly left it on. In J.

500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of {{recording}} The Joshua Tree, the band twice paused to participate in benefit concerts. On 17 May 1986, U2 performed at Self Aid in Dublin. Intended to help alleviate Ireland's unemployment crisis by raising funds and job pledges, the event was harshly criticised in the media for taking pressure off the Irish government to resist Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. The band in particular were labelled hypocrites for their participation. Their appearance included a cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "Maggie's Farm", reinterpreted as a criticism of Thatcher. Hot Press Niall Stokes called their performance [...] "the blackest and most ferocious set of their entire career". In June 1986, U2 embarked on the six-show Conspiracy of Hope tour for Amnesty International, halting the album's recording sessions for about two months. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new music and provided extra focus on {{what they wanted to}} say. For Clayton, the tour validated the [...] "rawness of content" [...] and their attempts to capture the [...] "bleakness and greed of America under Ronald Reagan". The band used soundchecks on the tour to test out various guitar compositions they had. Meegan believed that U2's time with the other artists on the tour affected their own sound: [...] "Their musical heroes were bleeding into the music and they weren't embarrassed by it, which gave them a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> to work in." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Miyazaki {{stated that}} Howl's Moving Castle was his {{favorite}} creation, and explained his choice by saying [...] "I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I don't think that's changed." [...] In the film, Sophie is shown to overcome extreme challenges by learning to put the well-being of those she cares about above her own self-interest, a quality which Miyazaki refers to as devotion. Several of the protagonists in Miyazaki's films, such as Ashitaka and San in Princess Mononoke and Sheeta and Pazu in Castle in the Sky learn to survive by learning the same lesson. Cavallaro states that Miyazaki spreads this moral through the entire film, to convey human beings' ability to be compassionate, such as when the scarecrow holds an umbrella over Sophie's head when it rains. Over {{the course of the}} film, Howl, its most vain and selfish character, also learns to put others before himself. When Madame Suliman returns the Witch of the Waste to her true form as a decrepit old woman, Sophie takes her in and cares for her, despite the witch being responsible for Sophie's curse, thus strongly demonstrating the idea of compassion. The witch then nearly destroys Howl through her selfish behavior, but also helps save the castle at the end. Parsons writes that [...] "In Miyazaki's balancing act, old women can be powerful and weak, positive and negative, nurturing and selfish, maligned and loved; in short, they can not be simply categorized or stereotyped, and they can not be dismissed as fantasy malefactors embodied by evil witches." [...] They are also given a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> in the film as active characters, something not commonly found in western movies.|$|E

Mitsuda also asked guitarist Tomohiko Kira and singer Yoko Ueno to appear to the album after an acquaintance introduced him to them. [...] Hidenobu [...] "KALTA" [...] Ootsuki worked on the album as an arranger and felt his work was made easier by his familiarity with Mitsuda's music—Creid was his second arrangement project with Mitsuda, after , which he had worked on three years before. According to Ootsuki, Mitsuda and he were complementary in style, which resulted in an album leaving a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and freedom for the listeners' imagination. He felt that, since Chrono Trigger, Mitsuda's musical style had changed to use less [...] "strong" [...] notes and include more sophistication; upon hearing the Xenogears tracks he [...] "literally" [...] "couldn't wait" [...] to arrange them. Mitsuda has described their collaborative style as that he would first create the [...] "basic backbone" [...] of the song and form the idea of how he wanted the song [...] "to turn out", then take the result to Ootsuki for them to arrange together. The end result would then be changed {{in the process of}} recording, as [...] "what sounds good on a synth module doesn't always sound good on live instruments", and occasionally the recording artists would [...] "ad-lib" [...] parts that would make it into the final product. Mitsuda generally also chose the specific percussion instruments to be used while recording, rather than beforehand; he feels that [...] "as long as the final product turns out to be like what I want it to be, the process doesn't really matter too much". As working with the other artists gave him a sense of celebration, Mitsuda named the [...] "imaginary band" [...] of performers Millennial Fair and credited them as such in the album.|$|E
