2500|$|A man {{who flew}} with him {{claimed that he}} would often [...] "give" [...] a victory to a new, green pilot, just to bolster his confidence. The new pilot would be taken out by the renowned Collishaw to [...] "bag one". Anxiously {{following}} the leader, he would find himself diving on {{the tail of a}} German reconnaissance plane. Trying to control the machine, so that the nose would stay still, he would find his gun-sight wobbling all over the sky. He would press the firing button, spraying bullets like a <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinkler.</b> Then suddenly Collishaw would appear alongside; there would be a short, deadly burst, and the new pilot would turn sick as he saw the enemy plane catch fire and plunge to earth. He would fly back to the aerodrome, where the flight commander would clap him heartily on the shoulder and insist [...] "You got one! Grand show, old boy!" [...] The new pilot, unable to speak, would nod timidly, and thereafter he would fly into battle with Collishaw anywhere. That was – according to the story – part of Collishaw's great quality of leadership.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} renovations and repairs {{were made to}} the {{memorial}} in 1999 and 2000 as well. [...] The Tall Cedars of Lebanon paid for the cleaning and restoration of its room on the ninth floor about this time. The ninth floor chapel suffered water damage in the early and mid-1990s, but the Knights Templar organization repaired and repainted this space in 1999. At the same time, the Grotto began a project to refurbish the murals and decorations in its room, while also researching and preparing for a later installation of new exhibits and displays. In the fall of 1999, the York Rite organization installed an exhibit in the south hall on the memorial's first floor which explained the rite's charities, degrees, and goals. Scheduled for completion in 2000 were a <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system {{on the east side of}} the hill, refurbishment of the boilers and the kitchen, installation of air conditioning in the Memorial Theater and library, upgrades to the elevators, repairs and upgrades to the electrical system, upgrades to make the memorial more ADA-compliant, removal hazardous materials (such as asbestos), repaving of driveways and parking lots, waterproofing of the portico and the tower, and a general refurbishment of the interior. The cost of these upgrades was in excess of $500,000. The same year, the memorial hired staff to begin a major renovation of the George Washington Museum and its exhibits, and began a major landscaping effort to restore the grounds to their original condition.|$|E

50|$|Process control {{may either}} use {{feedback}} {{or it may}} be open loop. Control may also be continuous (automobile cruise control) or cause a sequence of discrete events, such as a timer on a <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinkler</b> (on/off) or controls on an elevator (logical sequence).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinkler</b> {{system is}} {{permanently}} installed, {{as opposed to}} a hose-end sprinkler, which is portable. Sprinkler systems are installed in residential lawns, in commercial landscapes, for churches and schools, in public parks and cemeteries, and on golf courses. Most of the components of these irrigation systems are hidden under ground, since aesthetics are important in a landscape. A typical <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinkler</b> system will consist of one or more zones, limited in size by the capacity of the water source. Each zone will cover a designated portion of the landscape. Sections of the landscape will usually be divided by microclimate, type of plant material, and type of irrigation equipment. A landscape irrigation system may also include zones containing drip irrigation, bubblers, or other types of equipment besides sprinklers.|$|E

50|$|An {{irrigation}} controller is {{a device}} to operate automatic irrigation systems such as <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinklers</b> and drip irrigation systems. Most controllers have a means of setting the frequency of irrigation, the start time, and the duration of watering. Some controllers have additional features such as multiple programs to allow different watering frequencies for different types of plants, rain delay settings, input terminals for sensors such as rain and freeze sensors, soil moisture sensors, weather data, remote operation, etc.|$|R
50|$|Home <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinklers</b> {{vary widely}} in their size, cost, and complexity. They include impact sprinklers, {{oscillating}} sprinklers, drip sprinklers, and underground sprinkler systems. Small sprinklers {{are available at}} home and garden stores or hardware stores for small costs. These are often attached to an outdoor water faucet and are placed only temporarily. Other systems may be professionally installed permanently {{in the ground and}} are attached permanently to a home's plumbing system. An ingenious domestic sprinkler made by Nomad called a 'set-and-forget tractor sprinkler' was used in Australia in the 1950s. Water pressure ensured that the sprinkler slowly moved across a lawn.|$|R
50|$|For example, an {{irrigation}} sprinkler system, programmed {{to turn on}} at set times could {{be an example of}} an open-loop system if it does not measure soil moisture as a form of feedback.

Most automatic systems employ electric solenoid valves. Each zone has {{one or more}} of these valves that are wired to the controller. When the controller sends power to the valve, the valve opens, allowing water to flow to the sprinklers in that zone.|$|E
50|$|Water {{restrictions}} {{are in place}} in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from drought. Depending upon the location, these can include restrictions on watering <b>lawns,</b> using <b>sprinkler</b> systems, washing vehicles, hosing in paved areas and refilling swimming pools, among others. Water restrictions in Australia are enforced by fines and for repeat offenders by reducing water supply.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sprinkler}} system timer is an electrical device {{that is used}} to set an irrigation {{sprinkler system}} to come on automatically at a certain time. Irrigation timers first appeared in the early 1960s to control large-radius <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> which at the time usually contained their own electrically operated valve (most golf-course sprinklers still use this type of actuation). These timers were large and cumbersome with numerous mechanical parts and were usually relegated to agricultural and commercial applications. Compact irrigation timers did not become commonplace until the 1970s when Lawn Genie introduced a mechanical timer which measured only ten by six inches and was four inches deep. This controller proved popular for many years, but was hard to reprogram and it did not operate valves in immediate succession unless each valve was set to run for an hour. Rain Bird later introduced the RC-7A to their Rain Clox line, which featured an [...] "at a glance" [...] electromechanical programming interface that proved very easy to operate, and offered the ability to omit stations from the program sequence without creating time gaps. This timer which became standard issue in many tract homes during the 1980s and proved to be remarkably durable in its construction, with many still operating today.|$|R
5000|$|Water {{restrictions}} {{have been}} enacted {{in many cities}} and regions in Australia, which is the Earth's driest inhabited continent, in response to chronic water shortages resulting from the widespread drought. Depending upon the location, these can include restrictions on watering <b>lawns,</b> using <b>sprinkler</b> systems, washing vehicles, hosing pavement, refilling swimming pools, etc. Over population, evidence of drying climates, coupled with corresponding reductions in the supply of drinking water have led various state governments to consider alternative water sources to supplement existing sources, and to implement [...] "water inspectors" [...] who can issue penalties to those who waste water.|$|R

The next morning, Chet uncovers the disarray in which the house is — the missile protruding through the kitchen and floor joists and carpet of the bedroom, the kitchen being turned entirely blue, and his catatonic grandparents in the cupboard — before confronting Wyatt and Gary. Lisa tells the boys to escort the girls home while she talks to Chet alone. Gary narrowly escapes being pulled over by the police in a conjured Ferrari, while Wyatt proclaims his love for Hilly before being sprayed by her parent's <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinklers,</b> and both girls reciprocate their feelings to the boys.

5000|$|Mandy: Derrick's love {{interest}} and former WB giftshop employee, Mandy {{was fired after}} she insisted that men would not buy underwear that said Smallville across the front (though Will immediately insists that he would buy ones that said Everwood). Mandy moved to Hollywood {{to live with her}} previous boyfriend, {{who turned out to be}} an abusive carjacker, and had been living there a month when she was hired by Will and Derrick. Will met her while she was soaking wet after being caught in the <b>lawn</b> <b>sprinklers</b> and sobbing; he dubs her 'wet girl' and immediately hires her out pity. She then goes to the WB wardrobe department to get dry clothes, where Jeff Tucker has the wardrobe director dress her in revealing clothing. This revealing clothing attracts Derrick's attention, and instead of being mad at Will for hiring her, he lets her stay and begins to harbor a crush on her. Jill dislikes Mandy because Mandy claims that she has had to work hard at life and Jill makes it clear later that Mandy's stunning face and body has made life a lot easier for her. It is revealed in the third act of the pilot episode that Mandy is actually an actress planted within the reality show to create more sex appeal, though her story about the abusive boyfriend is true. It is also implied that, over the last year, Mandy has had extensive makeovers and plastic surgery to improve her previous look (which was so ugly, it provoked a [...] "yikes!" [...] out of Ingold). Despite this, Mandy finds she really does have feelings for Derrick, but the network execs push her to kiss Will because he is better looking. It is revealed in the pilot's epilogue, that Mandy and Derrick kiss in the studio bathroom in what would have been the second episode.|$|R

40|$|Trees {{and shrubs}} bring beauty to home landscapes but {{sometimes}} common cultural practices can have {{adverse effects on}} the health of the plants. Use of <b>lawn</b> mowers, <b>sprinkler</b> systems, fertilizers and mulch, practices that are supposed to keep one’s garden and lawn green, can cause great problems for the home garden if not used properly. This fact sheet is designed to help the average home gardener understand how to identify the symptoms of improper garden care and take the necessary measures to maintain trees and shrubs that are healthy and green. Mechanical Damage Lawn mowers and edge-trimmers are supposed to help keep a lawn and garden looking crisp and clean; however the trunks of trees and shrubs are easy targets of careless use of these machines. Chipped bark exposes vascular tissue to the elements, providing an easy entry for bacteria, fungi, and pest to enter and infest a plant. Trees and shrubs are most susceptible to serious injury and disease during the spring when leaves are emerging and the bark is not fully developed after winter dormancy, as well as during fall leaf drop. Bark splitting is caused by the wounds from pruning, insects, mechanical damage from lawn mowers and weed-whackers or planting too deep. Decline or dieback may also occur from trunk damage; fungi, bacteria, and insects can cause the breakdown of tissue around and inside the wound, causing structural problems for the root buttresses and lower trunk area...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The major {{pathways}} {{for transport}} of pyrethroids were determined in runoff studies conducted at a full-scale test facility in central California, USA. The 6 replicate house lots were typical of front lawns and house fronts of California residential developments {{and consisted of}} stucco walls, garage doors, driveways, and residential <b>lawn</b> irrigation <b>sprinkler</b> systems. Each of the 6 lots also included a rainfall simulator to generate artificial rainfall events. Different pyrethroids were applied to 5 surfaces—driveway, garage door and adjacent walls, lawn, lawn perimeter (grass near the house walls), and house walls above grass. The volume of runoff water from each house lot wasmeasured, sampled, and analyzed to {{determine the amount of}} pyrethroid mass lost from each surface. Applications to 3 of the house lots were made using the application practices typically used prior to recent label changes, and applications were made to the other 3 house lots according to the revised application procedures. Results from the house lots using the historic application procedures showed that losses of the compounds applied to the driveway and garage door (including the adjacent walls) were 99. 75 % of total measured runoff losses. The greatest losses were associated with significant rainfall events rather than lawn irrigation events. However, runoff losses were 40 times less using the revised application procedures recently specified on pyrethroid labels. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014; 33 : 52 – 60. # 2013 TheAuthors.
