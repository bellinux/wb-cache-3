5000|$|The {{relative}} position of two bodies {{connected by a}} prismatic joint {{is defined by the}} amount of <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> of one relative to the other one. This one parameter movement identifies this joint as a one degree of freedom kinematic pair.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{analyze the}} {{reasonable}} cohesion range of slope stability factor calculated using <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> method, different internal friction angles (20 °, 30 °, 40 °) and cohesion (≤ 10 kPa) of 36 slopes were calculated using <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> method, simplified Bishop method and strength reduction finite element method. The results show that, simplified Bishop method {{and the strength}} reduction finite element method {{are close to the}} stability factors; <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> method when cohesion is not considered is conservative, <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> method when cohesion is considered is partial to risk; calculating stability factor using <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> method is not suitable for all sandy soil slopes, only when the cohesion values not more than 1. 5 kPa, the calculation results of <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> method are in accordance with engineering practice...|$|R
50|$|Motorized <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> such as machine slides, XY tables, roller {{tables and}} some {{dovetail}} slides are bearings moved by drive mechanisms. Not all <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> are motorized, and non-motorized dovetail slides, ball bearing slides and roller <b>slides</b> provide low-friction <b>linear</b> movement for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. All <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> provide <b>linear</b> motion based on bearings, {{whether they are}} ball bearings, dovetail bearings, linear roller bearings, magnetic or fluid bearings. XY Tables, <b>linear</b> stages, machine <b>slides</b> and other advanced <b>slides</b> use <b>linear</b> motion bearings to provide movement along both X and Y multiple axis.|$|R
30|$|In recent, {{precision}} <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> {{are playing}} {{important roles in}} various ultra-precision machines, such as ultra-precision machine tools or coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) [1 – 3], in which both a long stroke {{on the order of}} several meters and high positioning accuracy on the order of sub-micron to several-tens nanometer are required. For the achievement of such a high positioning accuracy, a closed-loop control with a sufficient position sensor is required. Therefore, most of the precision <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> are equipped with position sensors such as linear encoders or laser interferometers [4]. Especially, linear encoders are preferred to be employed in <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> in terms of their low cost, robustness and a high measurement resolution [5].|$|R
50|$|When fitting a {{standard}} door chain featuring a <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> {{it is imperative}} that it not allow the door to open sufficiently for a person's hand to reach through the gap between the door and the doorframe, as otherwise the door chain could be quickly opened from the outside by an intruder.|$|E
50|$|GuitarBot uses a belt-drive {{mechanism}} to change pitch. An encoder-equipped DC motor drives a belt with an attached movable fret. As the belt moves the movable fret, the string's pitch is changed. The movable fret {{is mounted on}} a ball bearing <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> and can traverse its full displacement of 54.4 centimeters in 250 ms.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of circular slide rules are {{the difficulty in}} locating figures along a dish, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> rules, and did not find reason to switch.|$|E
30|$|Rotational error {{motions of}} the slide table are induced by the surface form errors of the linear {{guideway}}s. Therefore, the guideway surfaces are required to be compensated by repeating measurement of the rotational error motions and the form error correction of the guideways in the manufacturing process of <b>linear</b> <b>slides.</b> Although the hand scraping-based error correction is very time-consuming, it is an essential in the production process of the precision <b>linear</b> <b>slides</b> [16].|$|R
40|$|Over the year, many {{researchers}} {{have considered the}} problem of stabilizing the uncertain systems. In variable structure control (VSC) system, the controller structure around the plant is intentionally changed by using a viable high-speed switching feedback control to obtain a desired plant behavior or response. In this project, the problem of designing a variable structure control (VSC) law for uncertain system is considered. Using LMI approach, a design method of a <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> surface which is linear to the state is developed. A sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> surface is given in term of LMIs and an explicit formula of <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> surfaces guaranteeing the quadratic stability of the reducedorder equivalent system dynamics restricted to the sliding surfaces is derived. The sliding mode controller is then applied to an Electrohydraulic servo system. The simulation works were performed using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. A comparison with Pole Placement method shows that the sliding mode controller designed using LMI method produce a better performance responses...|$|R

5000|$|Corliss valves open {{directly}} into the cylinder. The valves connect the cylinder to separate steam and exhaust plenums. Initially, Corliss used slide valves with linear actuators, but by 1851, Corliss had shifted to semi-rotary valve actuators, as documented in U.S. Patent 8253. [...] In this engine, the wrist plate {{was moved to the}} center of the cylinder side, as on later Corliss engines. This was still a beam engine, however, and the semi-rotary valve actuators operated <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> valves inside the four valve chests of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|Also called [...] "ball slides," [...] {{ball bearing}} slides {{are the most}} common type of <b>linear</b> <b>slide.</b> Ball bearing slides offer smooth {{precision}} motion along a single-axis linear design, aided by ball bearings housed in the linear base, with self-lubrication properties that increase reliability. Ball bearing slide applications include delicate instrumentation, robotic assembly, cabinetry, high-end appliances and clean room environments, which primarily serve the manufacturing industry but also the furniture, electronics and construction industries. For example, a widely used ball bearing slide in the furniture industry is a ball bearing drawer slide.|$|E
50|$|The Coggeshall rule {{consisted}} of two rulers, each a foot (30 cm) long, which were put together in various ways. The most common and convenient arrangement was {{to have one of}} the rulers slide within a groove made along the middle of the other, like an ordinary <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> rule, as shown in the figure below. Another form had one ruler sliding alongside the other, and a third form had a common two-foot folding ruler with a groove along one side in which a thin sliding piece was inserted that carried Coggeshall's lines.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} second-order {{terminal}} {{sliding mode control}} for a class of uncertain input-delay systems. The input-delay systems are firstly converted into the input-delay free systems and further converted into the regular forms. A <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> mode manifold is predesigned to represent the ideal dynamics of the system. Another terminal sliding mode manifold surface is presented to drive the <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> mode to reach zeros in finite time. In order to eliminate the chattering phenomena, a second-order sliding mode method is utilized to filter the high frequency switching control signal. The uncertainties of the systems are analysed in detail to show the effect to the systems. The simulation results validate the method presented in the paper...|$|R
5000|$|A {{prismatic}} joint provides a <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> movement between two bodies, {{and is often}} called a slider, as in the slider-crank linkage.

50|$|In the mid-1700s {{the steam}} engine was of growing importance, and James Watt {{realized}} that efficiency could be increased by using different cylinders for expansion and condensation of the steam. This drove {{his search for}} a linkage that could transform rotation of a crank into a <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> and resulted in his discovery {{of what is called}} Watt's linkage. This led to the study of linkages that could generate straight lines, even if only approximately; and inspired the mathematician J. J. Sylvester, who lectured on the Peaucellier linkage, which generates an exact straight line from a rotating crank.|$|E
50|$|A spatial {{displacement}} of a rigid body {{can be defined}} by a rotation about a line and a translation along the same line, called a screw displacement. This is known as Chasles' theorem. The six parameters that define a screw displacement are the four independent components of the Plücker vector that defines the screw axis, together with the rotation angle about and <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> along this line, and form a pair of vectors called a screw. For comparison, the six parameters that define a spatial displacement can also be given by three Euler Angles that define the rotation and the three components of the translation vector.|$|E
50|$|The {{slide rule}} was invented around 1620-1630, {{shortly after the}} {{publication}} of the concept of the logarithm. It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division. As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions. Aviation {{is one of the few}} fields where slide rules are still in widespread use, particularly for solving time-distance problems in light aircraft. To save space and for ease of reading, these are typically circular devices rather than the classic <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> rule shape. A popular example is the E6B.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a {{systematic}} {{design of a}} new robust nonlinear variable structure controller based on state dependent nonlinear form is presented for the control of uncertain affine nonlinear systems with mismatched uncertainties and matched disturbance. After an affine uncertain nonlinear system is represented {{in the form of}} state dependent nonlinear system, {{a systematic}} design of a new robust nonlinear variable structure controller is presented. To be linear in the closed loop resultant dynamics, the <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> surface is applied. A corresponding control input is proposed to satisfy the closed loop exponential stability and the existence condition of the sliding mode on the <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> surface, which will be investigated in Theorem 1. Through a design example and simulation study, the usefulness of the proposed controller is verified...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{area where}} {{backlash}} matters is in leadscrews. Again, {{as with the}} gear train example, the culprit is lost motion when reversing a mechanism {{that is supposed to}} transmit motion accurately. Instead of gear teeth, the context is screw threads. The <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> axes (machine slides) of machine tools are an example application.|$|R
5000|$|A {{linear stage}} or {{translation}} stage is {{a component of}} a precise motion system used to restrict an object to a single axis of motion. The term <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> is often used interchangeably with [...] "linear stage", though technically [...] "linear slide" [...] refers to a linear motion bearing, which is only a component of a linear stage. All linear stages consist of a platform and a base, joined by some form of guide or linear bearing {{in such a way}} that the platform is restricted to linear motion with respect to the base. In common usage, the term linear stage may or may not also include the mechanism by which the position of the platform is controlled relative to the base.|$|E
50|$|Haile's {{arms are}} driven by two {{separate}} means. The left arm uses a linear motor {{which is responsible for}} larger movements that correspond to louder sounds. The linear motor, along with a linear encoder is used to control the robot's arm height. The larger motions are louder and more visible, but limit the arm to swinging at a top speed of 11Hz. The right arm, which plays softer and faster notes, is driven by a solenoid, which uses an aluminum stick and return spring capable of hitting the drum at up to 15Hz. Both arms are capable of hitting anywhere (from the rim to the center) on the drum {{through the use of a}} <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> which allows each of them completely independent movement in a single direction.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method for {{measurement}} of the roll error motion of a slide table in a precision <b>linear</b> <b>slide.</b> The proposed method utilizes a pair of clinometers in the production process of a precision <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> where the roll error motion measurement {{will be carried out}} repeatedly to confirm whether the surface form errors of slide guideways in the <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> are sufficiently corrected by hand scraping process. In the proposed method, one of the clinometers is mounted on the slide table, while the other is placed on a vibration isolation table, on which the precision <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> is mounted, so that influences of external disturbances can be cancelled. An experimental setup is built on a vibration isolation table, and some experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This article {{deals with}} a way of {{interpretation}} the results of numerical simulations solved for the mechanism of lifting platform. Subject of analysis is the atypical design solution of lifting mechanism with one degree of freedom, which members are connected by revolute joints and <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> guidance. The mechanism movement is provided by linear hydromotors. Computational simulations are carried out by FEM, where linear coupling equations are used for modeling of revolute joints and <b>linear</b> <b>sliding</b> guidance is modeled by structural contact of rail and slider. The way of modeling and parameters setting of structural contact significantly affects the stability of numerical solutions and the obtained results.

50|$|Although roller slides are not self-cleaning, {{they are}} {{suitable}} for environments {{with low levels of}} airborne contaminants such as dirt and dust. As one of the more expensive types of <b>linear</b> <b>slides,</b> roller slides are capable of providing linear motion on more than one axis through stackable slides and double carriages. Roller slides offers line contact versus point contact as with ball bearings, creating a broader contact surface due to the consistency of contact between the carriage and the base and resulting in less erosion.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the challenge of}} achieving sub-micrometer precision in all {{six degrees of freedom}} of a <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> in the presence of dynamic disturbance forces. Non-contacting guiding solutions reduce friction, and so allow the highest linear positioning resolution.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel method for {{identifying}} the motion errors (mainly straightness error and angular error) of a <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> {{which is based}} on the laser interferometry technique integrated with the shifting method. First, the straightness error of a <b>linear</b> <b>slide</b> incorporated with angular error (pitch error in the vertical direction and yaw error in the horizontal direction) is schematically explained. Then, a laser interferometry–based system is constructed to measure the motion errors of a <b>linear</b> <b>slide,</b> and an algorithm of error separation technique for extracting the straightness error, angular error, and tilt angle error caused by the motion of the reflector is developed. In the proposed method, the reflector is mounted on the slide moving along the guideway. The light-phase variation of two interfering laser beams can identify the lateral translation error of the slide. The differential outputs sampled with shifting initial point at the same datum line are applied to evaluate the angular error of the slide. Furthermore, the yaw error of the slide is measured by a laser interferometer in laboratory environment and compared with the evaluated values. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses the advantages of reducing the effects caused by the assembly error and the tilt angle errors caused by movement of the reflector, adapting to long- or short-range measurement, and operating the measurement experiment conveniently and easily...|$|E
