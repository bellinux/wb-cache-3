We study this trade-o_ {{in the market for}} digital music where consumers can sample the quality of songs by watching free music videos online. Identification comes from a natural experiment in Germany, where virtually all videos that contain music are blocked on a popular video platform due to a legal dispute with representatives of the rights-holders.

30|$|At {{presentation}} to the gynaecological emergency unit, she was pale with stable vital signs. Abdominal examination revealed a non-distended, tender abdomen with guarding. She was stabilized and investigations were carried out to rule out bowel perforation. Abdominal and chest X-rays were normal. It was thus initially decided to manage her conservatively, as she was stable with no active vaginal bleeding. However, she developed increasing abdominal and shoulder tip pain and an ultrasound scan <b>revealed</b> <b>products</b> of conception and an increasing haemoperitoneum. She was stabilised, transfused and consented to laparoscopy with possible repair of a uterine perforation and completion of the evacuation of retained products of conception under direct vision. At operation, {{there was a large}} 5  cm perforation through the old uterine scar with 1  l haemoperitoneum. Peritoneal toileting was carried out; the defect was packed with Surgicel and held in place with two intracorporeal Vicryl sutures. Her postoperative care was uneventful.|$|R
30|$|Six days later, {{the patient}} {{reported}} worsening pain and her ßhCG level {{had risen to}} 25, 300  mIU/mL, with persistent foetal cardiac activity. Secondary to increasing pain, despite her stable status and appropriate counselling, the patient declined further medical treatment and strongly desired surgical intervention. A well-informed management approach amongst the patient, her husband and the departmental team took place. The plan was to pursue an ultrasound-guided dilatation and curettage, backed up by possible intra-amniotic Methotrexate injection or transabdominal embryo aspiration. After cervical dilatation, suction evacuation was performed under transabdominal ultrasound guidance, followed by sharp curettage. The patient’s vital signs were closely watched and ultrasound was continued after the procedure to monitor intra-abdominal bleeding. Uterotonic agents were not required. The patient’s post-operative course was uneventful and her ßhCG level declined by > 15 % post-D&C (17, 400  mIU/mL). The final pathology <b>revealed</b> <b>products</b> of conception, including numerous immature villi, gestational endometrium and decidual reaction with focal necrosis.|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has <b>revealed</b> <b>products</b> with structures not {{predicted by the}} double-strand break repair model of meiotic recombination. A particular type of recombinant containing trans heteroduplex DNA has been observed at two loci. Trans events were originally identified only in tetrads in which the non-Mendelian segregations were not associated with a crossover. Because of this, these events were proposed to have arisen from the unwinding of double Holliday junctions. Previous studies used palindromes, refractory to mismatch repair, as genetic markers whereas {{we have used a}} complementary approach of deleting mismatch repair proteins to identify heteroduplex DNA. We found that the markers occurred in trans and were associated with crossovers. In both mlh 1 Delta and msh 2 Delta strains, the frequency of trans events associated with a crossover exceeded that predicted from the random association of crossovers with noncrossover trans events. We propose two different models to account for trans events associated with crossovers and discuss the relevance to wild-type DSB repair...|$|R

40|$|Ecotourism {{certification}} has {{had limited}} acceptance and uptake in Australia and overseas, {{yet it has}} been widely argued {{that it is a}} means to enhancing tourism product standards and contributing to environmental sustainability. Assessments of ecotourism certification in Australia and overseas are far from conclusive about its impacts on operators, and operators’ attitudes and perceptions of such schemes. The purpose of this exploratory, small-scale study was to investigate compliance with ecocertification criteria by eco-certified operators in Australia. The study was based on complete participant observations conducted on six Australian certified eco-tours. The findings indicate that certification of ecotourism product provides no guarantee of operator compliance. Auditing principles and processes underpinning Ecotourism Australia’s (EA) Eco Certification Program are flawed, most products observed in the study did not meet certification standards, and nor did these products adequately reflect the key elements in widely accepted definitions of ecotourism. A recent review of EA websites <b>revealed</b> <b>products</b> advertising their eco-certification are not listed on designated EA websites, leading to scepticism about whether there is congruence between operator marketing and promotion and operator certification...|$|R
40|$|In this work, kinetic {{properties}} evaluation {{was made}} for bioethanol production from sugar hydrolysate of vegetable waste. The saccharified sugars were fermented by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The effect of various saccharification factors on sugars release were studied and observed that the optimized conditions contributed to 14. 4 gL- 1 of fermentable sugars production. The produced sugars were subjected to batch fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae at pH 4. 5 and the kinetic parameters of fermentation were estimated by fitting the experimental data in modified logistic equations. The data <b>revealed</b> <b>product</b> (ethanol) yield (YP/S) of 0. 39 g/g of reducing sugars.

40|$|Objective: Because {{pregnancy}} suppresses {{the immune}} system, women at any stage of pregnancy {{are more susceptible}} to bacterial and viral infection. Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H 1 N 1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly. Case Report: A 23 -year-old primigravida at 9 weeks’ gestation was presented to our institution because of the sudden onset of sore throat, fever, chills, and vomiting for 5 days. She was diagnosed with early pregnancy H 1 N 1 infection, vulvar herpes infection, and impending intravascular disseminated coagulopathy. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 75 mg and valacyclovir 500  mg were then administered orally twice daily for 5 days. The patient’s fever, chills, and vomiting subsided 2 days later. The real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of nasal discharge for influenza virus types A and B showed positive results for the A/H 1 N 1 influenza virus. The early pregnancy was terminated by therapeutic curettage at the patient’s request. The surgical specimen <b>revealed</b> <b>products</b> of conception with the presence of necrotic chorionic villi, and focal lymphocytes in decidual tissue.

40|$|Cell wall {{turnover}} {{was examined}} in parent and mutant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Peptidoglycan and teichoic acid were observed to undergo turnover in the wild-type strain during exponential growth; however, {{the rate of}} turnover did not decrease when the growth rate slowed, as the culture entered stationary phase. Isolated native cell walls and crude soluble autolytic enzyme were prepared from cells harvested during exponential and postexponential phases of growth. Native cell walls from both phases of growth autolyzed in buffer at identical rates; similarily, crude soluble enzyme from both preparations degraded radioactive cell walls at the same rate. Therefore, {{the activity of the}} autolysin in both exponential and postexponential cells was similar. The autolysis of whole cells of a mutant tar- 1 was enhanced by 1. 0 M NaCl. When 1. 0 M NaCl was present under growing conditions, the rate of cell wall turnover was greatly increased. The presence of chloramphenicol, which inhibits whole-cell autolysis, also inhibited turnover. Analysis of the cell wall material recovered from spent medium <b>revealed</b> <b>products</b> consistent with the known mode of action of the endogenous autolysin. It is concluded that cell wall turnover in S. aureus is independent of the stage of culture growth but is dependent instead on the activity of the autolysin...|$|R
