5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral <b>lunch.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the Italian Communist Party – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E

Missing was Grand Admiral Erich Raeder. Hitler was {{taken on a}} tour of the ship by Admiral Lütjens and inspected the various battle stations. Hitler and Lütjens also met in private and discussed the risks of a mission in the North Atlantic. After this meeting, Hitler and the officers of Bismarck had <b>lunch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> officers' mess, where Hitler spoke about America's unwillingness to enter the war. Lindemann openly disagreed with Hitler, expressing his opinion that the possibility of the United States entering the war could not be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jan starts {{playing one}} of Frankie's CDs, but Graham {{turns it off}} to talk about money with Si and Sally. Jan takes Tamsin outside. Tamsin worries that Frankie's death is her fault because {{she asked him to}} blow up the balloon. She asks if Frankie's soul will go to Heaven, and Jan says that it will. Inside, Si, Sally and Graham argue about how to split the money they will make from the balloon. The {{argument}} gets heated after Sally argues that the fact Tamsin will soon die should preclude her from getting a share. As Graham threatens to pop the balloon, Jan reappears and chastises him. Tamsin, who is now considered neutral, takes the balloon. Graham says they should all settle down and have <b>lunch.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> kitchen, Sally and Jan talk about Sally's work, and, in Tamsin's bedroom, Graham and Si talk about Parsons, with Si revealing that Parsons was actually unpleasant to work for. There is a loud bang from outside, and everyone goes back into the lounge, erroneously thinking that the balloon has burst. Graham and Si take the balloon to an upstairs bedroom and tuck it into a bed, while Jan turns the music back on.|$|E

25|$|England's total {{could have}} been {{significantly}} higher with a bit more top-order application, especially given the high scoring rate. However, England's bowlers started well when Steve Harmison bowled a maiden over first up to Justin Langer, and Matthew Hayden holed out to Harmison's new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard for a golden duck – the first of Hayden's Test career. Then, Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, before the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch; Ricky Ponting swept a shot off Ashley Giles to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a single for 20. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after <b>lunch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same vein, hitting 76 runs {{in an hour and}} a half, but a couple of wickets within five overs took Australia to 208 for 5, needing 199 for the last five wickets for parity.

25|$|However, {{the quick}} scoring {{and the first}} Test result led many {{people to believe that}} Australia would come back with a vengeance {{on the second day of}} the matcht.

Although Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer hit runs just as quickly as England had done, the umpire's finger went up twice more before lunch – Ponting swept to the opposing captain Vaughan for 61, and Damien Martyn was run out taking a risky single for 20. Once again, Vaughan was in the action, hitting the stumps with a throw from mid off. Langer and Michael Clarke continued after <b>lunch</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same vein, but again, a couple of quick wickets – Clarke edging a quicker ball from Ashley Giles behind and Simon Katich falling in the same way to Andrew Flintoff swung it England's way.
