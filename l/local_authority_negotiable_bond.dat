40|$|Local {{government}} finance poses {{problems to}} many {{governments in the}} developing world. This is notwithstanding the fact that <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> are {{at the forefront of}} local development efforts. In Ghana, the central government is enjoined by the country’s constitution to devolve at least five percent of the national revenue to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> annually. For many <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> this has become the main source of finance. Though there are other sources of finance available to the <b>local</b> <b>authorities,</b> these have been de-emphasised by most <b>local</b> <b>authorities.</b> The paper postulates that the land resources of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> provide a veritable source of local revenue which has not been fully tapped by the authorities. Apart from the property rate which all <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> in the country levy, little attention is paid to the potential of the land resources of the <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> as sources of revenue.

Further, as <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> funding is related to the number of children in school <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> have a perverse incentive to force home educated children into schools. That <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> often act outside the law when dealing with home educators and given that the [...] "large majority" [...] of <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> (all except 30) provide misleading information on their websites in relation to home education (page 23 of The Education Committee's report to Parliament), home educators remain wary of and opposed to any additional powers being awarded to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> who many see as anti-home education.|$|R
