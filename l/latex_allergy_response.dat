The Dr George Mukhari Hospital (DGM) in Pretoria has a staff complement of 1500 doctors and nurses who use latex gloves occasionally or regularly.

40|$|Background: <b>Latex</b> <b>allergy</b> {{has emerged}} as an impor-tant cause of {{allergic}} reactions particularly in health workers.

We suspect an increase in <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> incidence in association with increased atopy and sensitivity to environmental allergens in the industrial population. It is often postulated in literature that the groups of workers at risk for this allergy are essentially workers in the latex industry and healthcare professionals.

40|$|Two {{clinical}} reports {{dealing with}} subcutaneous desensitization to latex are available, but these treatments {{were reported to}} have significant side effects. To investigate an alternative method for latex desensitization, we present five cases of immunoglobulin E-mediated <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> in which a specific desensitization was successfully performed by means of an original exposure protocol. Five female patients with proven <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> underwent an original contact desensitization by wearing latex gloves daily, progressively increasing exposure to latex.

Twelve months after the beginning of the desensitization program, all the treated subjects were able to wear latex gloves daily without any clinical manifestations. This study provides evidence that a successful contact desensitization to latex is possible with no side effects. The adopted exposure protocol seems to be completely safe and effective.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> has increased {{because of the}} increased regular use of natural rubber latex gloves.

Certain individuals such as health care workers and children with spina bifida are at increased risk of sensitisation and development of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy.</b> There are various ways in which sensitisation to latex occurs, including inhalation of airborne latex particles, and mucosal and skin contact. Household gloves have been found to cause less <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> because of their special production techniques, the fact that there is loose contact with hands, and the short period of use. Diagnosis of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> depends on a good history, clinical symptoms and signs such as irritant dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and type I hypersensitivity reaction.

40|$|<b>Latex</b> <b>allergy</b> {{continues}} to be an important occupational health problem as latex products are used increasingly worldwide, particularly in healthcare. Although there are few epidemiological studies on the incidence of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> there has been {{an increase in the number}} of case reports over the last 10 years and, based on skin-prick tests, estimates of prevalence of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> in healthcare workers range from 2 % to 17 %. The allergic health effects arise either from the latex proteins, generally causing a type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction, or from the chemicals added to latex during processing, causing a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Clinical manifestations of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> depend on the route of exposure and occur by direct contact either with skin or mucosa, or by inhalation. The diagnosis of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> is based on the history, skin tests, serological tests and challenge tests. Thirteen latex allergens have been identified and isolated so far from natural rubber latex. They differ in their potential to elicit immunological responses in individuals allergic to latex and thus have been designated as major or minor allergens. In latex gloves, cornstarch powder used as a donning agent carries latex proteins, thereby increasing inhalational and mucosal exposure to latex proteins. There also appears to be a positive correlation between protein content and allergenicity of gloves. The use of powder-free, low-protein gloves is effective in reducing symptoms and markers of sensitisation. Alternatives to latex gloves, such as nitrile or vinyl gloves are available but may be inferior in respect to manual dexterity and biological impermeability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, allergy {{to natural}} rubber latex {{has emerged as}} a major allergy among certain {{occupational}} groups and patients with underlying diseases. The sensitization and development of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> has been attributed to exposure to products containing residual latex proteins. Although improved manufacturing procedures resulted in a considerable reduction of new cases, the potential risk for some patient groups is still great. In addition the prevalent cross-reactivity of latex proteins with other food allergens poses a major concern. A number of purified allergens and a few commercial kits are currently available, but no concerted effort was undertaken to evaluate them. Methods We studied 11 purified latex allergens, Hev b 1 to Hev b 10, and Hev b 13 along with several crude allergen extracts and two commercial ImmunoCAP assays to evaluate specific IgE antibody in the sera from latex allergic patients and controls. Health care workers and spina bifida patients with clinical symptoms of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> spina bifida patients without <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> and non-atopic health care workers have been studied. Results The results suggest that Hev b 2, 5, 6, and 13 together identified over 80 percent health care workers with <b>latex</b> <b>allergy,</b> while Hev b 6 along with Hev b 1 or 3 detected specific IgE antibody in all sera studied from patients with spina bifida and <b>latex</b> <b>allergy.</b> The ImmunoCAP results using both Hev b 5 amplified and non-amplified closely agreed with the clinical diagnosis of <b>latex</b> <b>allergy</b> in health care workers and in spina bifida. Conclusion Although the purified allergens and crude extracts reacted diversely with IgE from different patient groups, the results indicated that use of certain combinations of purified recombinant antigens will be useful in commercial kits or in in-house assays for detecting specific IgE antibody in the sera. The results suggest that a combination of Hev b 2, 3, 5, 6, and 13 together detected specific IgE in 80 % of the sera from latex allergic patients.
