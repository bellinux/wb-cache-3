5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no <b>lag</b> at all. Other reviewers' experiences with <b>lag</b> were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said <b>lag</b> became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} <b>lag</b> was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E

40|$|We present {{evidence}} on {{the differences in the}} intensity with which ten major technologies are used in 185 countries across the world. We do so by calculating how many years ago these technologies were used in the U. S. at the same intensity as they are used in the countries in our sample. We denote these time <b>lags</b> as technology usage <b>lags</b> and compare them with <b>lags</b> in real GDP per capita. We find that (i) technology usage <b>lags</b> are large, often comparable to <b>lags</b> in real GDP per capita, (ii) usage <b>lags</b> are highly correlated with <b>lags</b> in per-capita income, and (iii) usage <b>lags</b> are highly correlated across technologies. The productivity differentials between {{the state of the art}} technologies that we consider and the ones they replace combined with the usage <b>lags</b> that we document, lead us to infer that technology usage disparities might account for a large part of cross-country TFP differentials. ...|$|R
50|$|Consider the following: the helicase {{continuously}} unwinds {{the parental}} duplex, but the <b>lagging</b> strand must be polymerised {{in the opposite}} direction. This means that, while polymerisation of the leading strand proceeds, polymerisation of the <b>lagging</b> strand only occurs after enough of the <b>lagging</b> strand has been unwound by the helicase. At this point, the <b>lagging</b> strand replicative polymerase associates with the clamp and primer in order to start polymerisation. During <b>lagging</b> strand synthesis, the replicative polymerase sends the <b>lagging</b> strand back toward the replication fork. The replicative polymerase disassociates when it reaches an RNA primer. Helicase continues to unwind the parental duplex, the priming enzyme affixes another primer, and the replicative polymerase reassociates with the clamp and primer when a sufficient quantity of the <b>lagging</b> strand has unwound.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, glowplugs for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine <b>lag</b> and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine <b>lag,</b> and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} time <b>lags</b> effects of {{innovation}} input on output {{in the national}} innovation systems (NIS). Firstly, we analyze the intrinsic properties of China’s NIS based on the conceptual framework and the causal loop diagram. Secondly, we construct a time <b>lags</b> distribution calculation model and employ the main innovation input indicators to measure the specific characteristics of time <b>lags</b> effects of innovation input on output for China in the period 2000 – 2012. The results indicate that there are considerable time <b>lags</b> in the four major feedback loops, {{and the distribution of}} time <b>lags</b> is various according to the characteristics of innovation input and influencing factors in the internal transformation. The trends of time <b>lags</b> from R&D personnel and industry-academia-research collaboration show steady growth, and the trends of time <b>lags</b> from R&D expenditure and government’s macro-control take inverted U-shaped pattern. Finally, we combine the estimation results of <b>lags</b> distribution calculation model with the analysis results of the causal loop diagram (including positive loops and negative loops) to provide some innovation policy suggestions. This study provides important implications for our understanding of the long-term complex <b>lags</b> effects of innovation input on output as well as for policy-makers designing and implementing the innovation strategies...|$|R

40|$|A <b>lagged</b> {{dependent}} variable in an OLS regression {{is often used}} {{as a means of}} capturing dynamic effects in political processes and as a method for ridding the model of autocorrelation. But recent work contends that the <b>lagged</b> {{dependent variable}} specification is too problematic for use in most situations. More specifically, if residual autocorrelation is present, the <b>lagged</b> dependent variable causes the coefficients for explanatory variables to be biased downward. We use a Monte Carlo analysis to assess empirically how much bias is present when a <b>lagged</b> dependent variable is used under a wide variety of circumstances. In our analysis, we compare the performance of the <b>lagged</b> dependent variable model to several other time series models. We show that while the <b>lagged</b> dependent variable is inappropriate in some circumstances, it remains an appropriate model for the dynamic theories often tested by applied analysts. From the analysis, we develop several practical suggestions on when and how to use <b>lagged</b> dependent variables on the right-hand side of a model. ...|$|R
