40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{relation}} between occupational exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> during manufacture and respiratory health. METHODS [...] The respiratory health of 628 current employees {{in the manufacture of}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> in seven European plants in three countries was studied with a respiratory questionnaire, lung function tests, and chest radiography. Simultaneous plant hygiene surveys measured subjects' current exposure to airborne <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> from personal samples with optical microscopy fibre counts. The measured exposures were combined with occupational histories to derive estimates of each subject's cumulative exposure to respirable fibres. Symptoms were related to current and cumulative exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> and lung function and findings from chest radiographs were related to cumulative exposure. RESULTS [...] The mean duration of employment was 10. 2 years and mean (range) cumulative exposure was 3. 84 (0 - 22. 94) (f. ml- 1. y). Eye and skin symptoms were frequent in all plants and increased significantly, as did breathlessness and wheeze, with increasing current exposure. Dry cough and stuffy nose were less common in the least exposed group but did not increase with increasing exposure. After adjustment for the effects of age, sex, height, smoking, and past occupational exposures to respiratory hazards, there was a significant decrease in both forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced midexpiratory flow related to cumulative exposure in current smokers (P < 0. 05) and in FEV 1 in ex-smokers (P < 0. 05). Small opacities were found in 13 % of the chest radiographs; their prevalence was not related to cumulative exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] It is concluded that exposure to <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> is associated with irritant symptoms similar to those seen in other exposures to man made mineral fibres (MMMFs) and that cumulative exposure to respirable <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> may cause airways obstruction by promoting the effects of cigarette smoke...|$|R

These properties are suitable not only for replacing the conventional materials but also embark new fields which can satisfy the technical demands especially in aerospace applications. However, this work is primarily focusing on the fabrication of glass ceramic matrix composites. Since these glass ceramics are reported to have good thermo-mechanical properties, the study embarked upon the fundamentals of processing of MAS and LAS glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> in order to open a new avenue for advanced glass fibre composites in high temperature applications. The present work aims to develop fundamental information for fabrication of MAS and LAS glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> and development of the glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer (GCFRP) composite. The thesis gradually evolves in the direction of this goal by developing suitable bulk glass ceramics, glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> and glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer composites. In the first part, the bulk MAS and LAS glass ceramics were prepared using melting and casting process. This was followed by controlled heat treatments at different temperatures. The crystallisation behavior of both glass ceramics showed that the temperature increase enhanced the rigidity of the glass structure, thereby superior and reliable properties such as density, nanohardness and reduced Young's modulus were successfully derived in the MAS and LAS system prepared at different annealing and subsequent heat-treatment regimes. The thermo-mechanical properties were correlated to the crystalline phases present in the system. SEM analysis showed that there was a significant variation in morphology of the crystalline phases with the changes in the heat treatment temperatures. In the second part, the mechanical properties of magnesium aluminium silicate (MAS) and lithium aluminium silicate (LAS) single fibres were investigated. The fibres were prepared using different methods namely melt drawing (MAS) and continuous drawing (LAS) respectively. The glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> were subjected to the optimised thermal treatments and the physical appearance observed indicated an absence of distortion before being tested using single fibre test (SFT). Relations between the properties of glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> and heat treatment conditions were clearly demonstrated by changes in density and Young's modulus. The latter was obtained with an acoustic approach which was successfully used in both systems. The glass and glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibre</b> selected were tested using the SFT and showed that different methods in fibre manufacturing process and different gauge lengths in the single fibre tests generate significantly different values in the mechanical properties of glass and glass <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres.</b> The fibre strength distributions were strongly correlated with the diameter values of the tested fibres, and variation of the Weibull parameters depended on the gauge lengths. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of the fracture surfaces revealed the presence of fracture-inducing flaws located at the surface or in the interior of the fibre.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{review the}} {{scientific}} literature on {{the health effects of}} refractory <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> (RCFs). The adverse effects of exposure to asbestos has led to concern about the potential for other fibrous materials to cause diseases. For this reason the human populations most heavily exposed to synthetic mineral fibres have been examined for any adverse effects and many types of fibre have been studied in animal experiments. One type of man made vitreous <b>fibres</b> (MMVFs), refractory <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> (RCFs), are principally used in thermal insulation at high temperatures [...] up to 1400 degrees C. As manufactured RCFs exist in a glassy, non-crystalline (sometimes called amorphous) state, they have various compositions, physical properties, and sized fibres. METHODS [...] All reports on the health effects of RCFs available up to the end of 1994 have been examined and {{the scientific literature}} reviewed although all publications have not necessarily been referenced. CONCLUSIONS [...] In recent inhalation experiments conducted with both rats and hamsters at the Research and Consulting Company, Geneva, at the highest dose tested (30 mg/m 3) there was an increased incidence of tumours in both species. Lower doses were only examined in the rat and at these doses there was no significant excess of lung tumours.

40|$|Here the sol-gel {{technique}} was {{employed in the}} production of ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> utilising forcespinning as the major fibre forming technique. The ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> produced in this work were titanium carbide, zirconium carbide, titanium diboride and zirconium diboride. These were achieved after a series of heat treatment steps from the fibres produced via forcespinning. Upon the production of ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> these were densified via various means such as elevated heat treatments or infiltration. Finally the production of ceramic matrix composites with fibres originating from sol-gel was attempted. Sol-gel was chosen as the means to produced ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> due to its characteristics of nano-scale mixing and it being a liquid based processing technique. The nano-scale mixing allowed the chemicals employed here, namely metal alkoxides (metal oxide source) and furfuryl alcohol (carbon source), to mix homogenously and subsequently produce metal oxide and carbon fibres with good microstructures upon heat treatments. The formation and variation of these sol-gel solutions to produce titanium carbide and zirconium carbide precursor fibres was a strong focus of the work undertaken here, with influence of acids and acetylacetone examined. With acid being shown to accelerate the hydrolysis and condensation reactions in the sol-gel system and acetylacetone being a suitable means to control this acceleration. In conjunction with this the effects of varying sol-gel variables such as furfuryl alcohol were discussed, with furfuryl alcohol content being a suitable means to control the final carbon content in the fibres produced. With the production of a sol-gel solution capable of being formed into fibres, the examination of techniques to do as such was examined. Techniques examined here were electrospinning and forcespinning, with the forcespinning technique being chosen due to its greater production rate. Therefore the variation of forcespinning variables was examined, with it being found that variables that aided {{in the production of}} drier fibres upon collection resulted in superior fibre morphologies. These variables included the choice of spinneret, revolutions per minute of the spinneret and collector distance. Upon forcespinning, the resultant fibres are polymeric in nature, therefore for the production of ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> heat treatments are required. Here the role heat treatments play in the pyrolysis of fibres, carbothermal reduction of the fibres, densification of the fibres and phase changes of the fibres is discussed. This is in conjunction with other variables, such as the carbon content of the fibres undergoing heat treatment and the sintering temperature used. It was discovered that with the correct starting fibres (ones with suitable carbon content) the formation of titanium carbide and zirconium carbide fibres was possible. Furthermore, with elevated sintering temperatures up to 2000 °C, dense titanium carbide fibres are able to be produced. However zirconium carbide fibres still contain some porosity even up to 2300 °C. Here the use of sintering additives (boron nitride) is also discussed, with it being shown that the use of sintering additives allows the production of titanium diboride and zirconium diboride fibres. The formation of these fibres is investigated with the aid of thermodynamics and the investigation of numerous variables such as sintering temperature and time. Through this investigation it was found that to produce fibres that contain predominately titanium diboride or zirconium diboride phase, reduced sintering temperature and hold times were beneficial. With the production of dense ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> the final topic investigated was the possibility of using these ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres,</b> originating from sol-gel, in ceramic matrix composites. As such ultra-high temperature <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> were added into matrix materials of either zirconium diboride or silicon carbide. The ability to add a carbon layer onto fibres was also investigate as a means to improve the efficiency of the fibres, by means of coating with furfuryl alcohol. This method proved problematic due to the general loss of fibre morphology upon the coating process. The ceramic matrix composites were sintered via spark plasma sintering and underwent Vickers hardness testing.

Lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibre</b> with a nominal composition of 0. 65 Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 - 0. 35 PbTiO 3 was fabricated by an extrusion method. PMN-PT single crystals were ground to a powder form and then mixed with poly(acrylic) acid to form a homogenous slurry. The fibre was extruded by pressing the slurry through a spinneret and then sintering at 1250 °C for crystallization. The electrical characteristics of the PMN-PT fibre were evaluated by measuring the relative permittivity and the impedance spectrum. A piezoelectric PMN-PT fibre hydrophone was fabricated and its sensitivity, angular response, and spatial resolution were evaluated. The fibre hydrophone provides good spatial resolution, angular response and receiving sensitivity. Department of Applied Physic...|$|R

The experimental results are compared with those obtained using the mathematical models develop by the same authors. The results indicate that the model is capable of predicting the fire...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} and thermal stability of high strength <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> are reviewed. Alumina and silicon carbide fibres show loss of strength at temperatures above 1000 -degrees-C due to grain growth phenomena combined with internal degradative reactions in some cases. Routes to silicon-based fibres involving powder sintering and pyrolytic conversion of polymeric precursors are discussed and illustrated, where appropriate, with examples...|$|R
40|$|A {{zirconium}} sol {{was produced}} from the hydrolysis and immediate peptization of a zirconium alkoxide, which {{was found to}} be stable {{with the addition of a}} large proportion of a strontium salt, even up to equimolar a mounts. Gel fibres were successfully blow spun from this doped sol, which on subsequent heating produced <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> of orthorhombic strontium zirconate. The fibres were characterized by various techniques. The fibres were found to begin forming SrZrO 3 at 400 degrees C and were present as single phase orthorhombic strontium zirconate at 800 degrees C and above. The <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibres</b> had no discernible grain structure a nd the average crystallite size was calculated to be on ly 20 nm at th is temperature, but the fibres contained small surface pores (< 0. 2 mu m) which continued to increase in size on subsequent heating, resulting in a weak and brittle fibre. Therefore, more investigation is required into sintering and the development of high temperature properties. (C) 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
