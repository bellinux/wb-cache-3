500|$|As {{the end of}} term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, {{and begins}} seeing shinigami figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks {{to speak to him}} {{concerning}} misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students have no idea of online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even [...] "private" [...] messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.|$|E

500|$|As {{the film}} crew {{continues}} to document Kenny, House becomes increasingly annoyed {{and tries to}} avoid them by briefing his team by the MRI machine and in surgery. However, ultimately he cannot escape the cameras and the candidates find themselves acting self-consciously {{in front of the}} lens. Meanwhile, House begins to regret recruiting former CIA doctor Samira Terzi (Michael Michele) when she fails to demonstrate the intelligence he witnessed at Langley. Wilson, who believes that House is being distracted by Terzi's looks, offers up the solution to quickly fire her and then ask her out on a date. He also notes House's propensity to hire attractive women, which led him to this situation. House argues that he's [...] "not that guy"; Wilson retorts [...] "every guy is that guy". During the episode the film crew also interviews Cameron, asking why she resigned and making it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was romantically attracted to House.|$|E
500|$|Various other titles were {{suggested}} {{for the series}} such as Cardcaster Sakura and Card Character Sakura before Nekoi suggested Cardcaptor Sakura. While Ohkawa planned out Cardcaptor Sakura from beginning to end, she never consulted the plot with the other members, instead giving them the script one chapter at a time. Mokona initially drew Tomoyo so it would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> {{was in love with}} Toya, which led to her surprise when she received the script for the chapter which reveals Tomoyo loves Sakura. The story was planned to have the theme of [...] "if you try your best, it'll work out", but Ohkawa did not start out with Sakura's [...] "It'll definitely be okay" [...] mindset. Ohkawa wanted to write a story that [...] "minorities would feel comfortable with," [...] referring to the same-sex and taboo relationships featured in the manga. The series' main theme is expressed through Sakura, a main character designed to be open-minded about different family structures and kinds of love. Ohkawa addressed the relationships featured in the series by using Tomoyo and Sakura as an example. She explained that the reason Tomoyo and Sakura did not end up together was not because Tomoyo is a girl, but rather because Sakura did not love Tomoyo in a romantic way.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Maisie Williams {{described}} the thought process behind Arya's scenes, {{as well as}} the process of filming saying [...] "We wanted people to think this could be the end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound." [...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why would she run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Swanson {{recalled}} in her biography that the costumes were only [...] "a trifle outdated, a trifle exotic." [...] Head later described her assignment as [...] "the most challenging of my career," [...] and explained her approach with the comment, [...] "Because Norma Desmond was an actress {{who had become}} lost in her own imagination, I tried to make her <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> was always impersonating someone." [...] Head later said she relied on Swanson's expertise because [...] "she was creating a past that she knew and I didn't." [...] Head also designed the costumes for William Holden and the minor characters; but for authenticity, Wilder instructed Von Stroheim and Nancy Olson to wear their own clothing.|$|E
2500|$|Rose's thoughts, {{ideas and}} {{concerns}} {{were taken into}} consideration {{when it came to}} finalizing Tiana's design. [...] "I … said I wanted it to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> ate and wasn’t skinny, and she has a full mouth and a little round nose and curly hair and these are all things that made her look distinctly herself," [...] she said. Rose didn't want Tiana to resemble [...] "a cookie-cutter princess who had been coloured in brown. When I saw {{her for the first time}} and realized how much she looked like me I was really blown away." [...] Rose also served as a form of visual, live-action reference for supervising animator Mark Henn as he worked on Tiana, videotaping her as she recorded her lines and incorporating some of her distinct characteristics, such as her dimples and left-handedness, into Tiana's design.|$|E
2500|$|Teenaged Laura begins dating Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner) (known as [...] "Scotty" [...] at {{this point}} of the storyline).

2500|$|Of {{filming the}} moment in which Rebecca pushes Paul, Hall said [...] "The way Stefan Dennis (who plays Paul) and I {{interpreted}} it and acted it was we had to satisfy ourselves {{that it was one}} of those random and instantaneous mistakes people make. When we worked on the scene we had to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> had a moment of fury that caused her to do that." [...] Hall knew that viewers would be surprised at Rebecca being the culprit and she herself was surprised by the fan's reactions. Some women questioned how Rebecca could do such a thing to Paul, even though he cheated on her and lied to her. Hall thought that someone could get [...] "so fed up" [...] that they made a rash decision that is not something they thought they could ever do. In September 2010, Rebecca's confession and explanation for the night she pushed Paul was broadcast. The episode initially saw Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) admit to Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) that he was responsible to protect his mother. Hall added that [...] "the ramifications of Rebecca pushing Paul over the mezzanine are far-reaching".|$|E

Prue heads home to her parents and manages to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> still has Mac. Next morning she heads for the I.W. but discovers Curtis has once more followed her. Prue does not want Curtis along, but before she can send him back, they are separated while fleeing from Coyote Soldiers. Curtis is captured and taken to Alexandra, while Prue rides a mail truck to South Wood. There, Prue finds a Kafkaesque bureaucracy and dysfunctional government. Police state tactics and paranoia over foreign threats are used to keep the regime in power. Prue eventually meets the Crown Prince Owl Rex (who is later arrested), of the Avian Principality, who tells her how Alexandra came to be exiled. Alexandra's son Alexei died in a horse-riding accident, then her husband Grigor died of heartbreak; to remedy his death, Alexandra hired the two greatest toymakers in all of Wildwood to fashion her son a new body that was later brought to life via Black Magic by recalling his soul, but later Alexei learned the truth of his death and rebirth and so he destroyed a crucial part of his inner workings resulting in his death. Alexandra was exiled for the use of Black Magic and plotted her revenge, but many believed she would have never survived. Owl Rex proposes to Prue to cross Wildwood and find help from the Mystics of North Wood. Meanwhile, Alexandra is flattering Curtis with a fancy uniform and commissions him into the coyote army as an officer. In a battle against bandits Curtis breaks a howitzer by dumb luck, becoming a coyote war hero in the operation. He then finds [...] Mac in Alexandra's headquarters and she shows him her plan to sacrifice the baby to the ivy. Alexandra offers to share the power with Curtis, but he says no and is locked away with some other captured bandits and unfaithful coyotes.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan takes Anne to a recital by a {{choir of}} monks, one of whom, Paul, is an Immortal. Neither man realises that the song being sung is [...] "The Song Of The Executioner", as the unseen {{impresario}} who organised the concert is Kalas, an Immortal with scores to settle with both Duncan and Paul. Kalas kills Paul and then sets about destroying MacLeod, first by framing Joe for dealing drugs then by killing two of Anne's patients and fabricating hospital records {{to make it}} <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>she</b> is responsible. Duncan realises that Kalas is behind this and, having cleared Joe and Anne, confronts his enemy. As they fight, Anne sees Duncan fall to his death, but Richie gets her away before Duncan revives. In the midst of this, Richie embarks on a new career in motorcycle racing. Rather than tell Anne the truth, especially with Kalas at large, Duncan leaves Seacouver, arranging for Maurice to buy back the barge in Paris. Arriving in Paris, Duncan is greeted by Hugh Fitzcairn, who is teaching cookery at the Cordon Bleu, ("Star Crossed"). The normally philandering Fitz is in love but has a rival, who tries |to kill him by running the two Immortals off the road. At the same time, Richie arrives in France, looking to build on his American successes in motorcycling. Whilst Fitz tells Duncan he should trust Anne, Kalas frames Fitz {{for the murder of}} his rival. On the run, Fitz is confronted by Kalas, who beheads him as MacLeod helplessly watches.When Duncan comes for Kalas, his nemesis escapes into a cloud of steam.Determined to finish Kalas, Duncan seeks Joe's help. Kalas owns a nightclub and Duncan [...] "persuades" [...] the bartender to tell him where Kalas has gone. Kalas has captured his own Watcher and is looking for information on"Methos", the legendary oldest Immortal. After Kalas kills one of the Watchers' historians, Donald Salzer, Dawson sends Duncan to a researcher on the Methos Chronicle, Adam Pierson. Duncan is stunned to find that Pierson is Methos. Kalas confronts Methos, who escapes and sets up Duncan to take his head, realising that he cannot handle Kalas, but Duncan could. Duncan refuses, but when he confronts Kalas at Methos' apartment, their fight is interrupted by the police, who arrest Kalas for Salzer's murder after Adam Pierson identifies Kalas. Before he vanishes from Paris, Methos tells Duncan that he couldn't take the chance on Kalas winning. In the two part season Finale, Amanda arrives at the barge, being very, very nice to Duncan, which always arouses his suspicions, ("Finale"). Eventually, she tells him that she broke Kalas out of jail, to kill him, but that Kalas got away. Kalas, using the thugs employed by his cellmate, wastes no time in coming for MacLeod and, as Duncan and Amanda try to find him, finds Maurice, who Duncan rescues {{in the nick of time}} and sends out of Paris. Kalas captures Amanda, intending to use her as bait, but she escapes. A new problem arises, when Joe Dawson and Methos arrive at the barge. Christine Salzer, the widow of Donald Salzer, the historian Kalas murdered, has found a database created for the Watchers and intends to give it to the newspapers. Dawson tries to stop her, even trying to shoot her, but MacLeod prevents him from becoming a murderer, taking the bullet himself. As the Immortals think that their secret will be on CNN, Kalas intercepts Christine and kills her, taking the vital disk. He uses the information to find the European head of the Watchers and kills him. He gives Duncan a choice - surrender to him or Kalas will broadcast the information on the disk. Watchers and Immortals combine to hunt Kalas down. Methos tells Duncan to fight Kalas and Amanda and Duncan, faced with the destruction of their world, finally admit their feelings for each other openly. Duncan faces Kalas on the top of the Eiffel Tower and takes his enemy's head. The Quickening of such a powerful Immortal surges through the steelwork of the tower and overloads the Paris power grid, plunging the city into darkness and, in the process, blowing up Kalas' computer and destroying the disk. After celebrating Duncan's victory over Kalas and remembering Paul and Fitzcairn, Joe and Methos leave Duncan and Amanda alone to work out how much of what they said to each other they really want to take back.|$|E
