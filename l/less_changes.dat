This may result in loss of support on {{the software}} {{and the need to}} acquire consultancy when issues arise in the usage of the software.

50|$|A {{foreland}} basin existed just to {{the east}} of the Sevier orogenic belt, which was inundated by the Western Interior Seaway. A forearc on the western side of the basin made this deeper than the eastern side, encouraging the build-up of sediment and, in time, sedimentary rock. Erosion of the Western Cordillera also contributed to the build-up of sedimentary rock on {{the western edge of the}} basin, while the more low-lying area to the east provided much <b>less.</b> <b>Changes</b> in the amount, type, rate, and other aspects of the sedimentation were caused by uplift, subsidence, sea level changes, and other factors. The water in the basin made at least two major advances and one major retreat during the Cretaceous, adding complexity to the rock and permitting the creation of riverine, marsh, and estuarine rock in addition to the principal shallow and deep marine rock.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effect of {{repeated}} muscle-damaging exercise on the time-course changes in several indices of muscle damage, and to compare them with changes in blood oxidative stress indices. Methods: Twelve females underwent an isokinetic exercise session consisting of 75 lengthening knee flexions, which was repeated after 3 wk. Isometric torque, range of movement (ROM), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), creatine kinase (CK), reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls, catalase, uric acid, bilirubin, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in blood were measured before, immediately after, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 d after lengthening contractions. Results: All muscle damage indices (torque, ROM, DOMS, and CK) changed significantly after exercise. The concentration of all oxidative stress indices changed significantly in a way indicating increased oxidative stress in the blood (GSH and GSH/GSSG decreased, whereas GSSG, TBARS, protein carbonyls, catalase, uric acid, bilirubin, and TAC increased), peaking in all but bilirubin at 3 d and returning to baseline values by 7 d after exercise. The repeated bout of lengthening contractions induced significantly <b>less</b> <b>changes</b> in indices of muscle damage and blood oxidative stress than the first bout. In general, from the increasing or decreasing area under the curve calculated for each oxidative stress index, the second bout produced 1. 8 - to 6. 1 -fold <b>less</b> <b>changes</b> in oxidative stress than after the first bout. Conclusion: A repeated bout of lengthening contractions attenuated muscle damage and blood oxidative stress compared with the first bout...|$|E

30|$|When the {{salinity}} reduces, {{two opposing}} phenomena take place, salting-in and interface polarization. The competition {{between these two}} phenomena dictates the interaction response at the interface. At 2 -TDSW, the ionic strength of the brine affects the adsorption of asphaltene molecules at the interface due to the polarization of the interface. Moreover, other surface active materials diffuse toward the interface to occupy the surface sites. The accumulation of all surface active agents at the interface leads to lower IFT values compared to the cases of brines with other salinities. On the other hand, for 2 -TDSW <b>less</b> <b>changes</b> are observed in brine pH, crude oil viscosity and density which confirms this hypothesis. Therefore, the low IFT values remain unchanged for all three cases observed in Fig.  15 c for 2 SW.|$|E

Design: Measurement of cognition both before and following 12 weeks of treatment with sertraline. Setting: University medical centers (Washington University and Duke University). Participants: One hundred sixty-six individuals with late-life depression. Intervention: Sertraline treatment.

30|$|Double {{throughput}} in ASIC {{environment is}} achieved effectively by implementing TP technique in RCMB, and a suitable algorithm is proposed. Our implementation requires <b>less</b> <b>changes</b> in the partial product array to acquire TP. Depending upon the multiplication either N or N/ 2 bit, selection of appropriate partial products in TP multiplier is done using multiplexers. Since our implementation utilised less multiplexers of about (N/ 2)[*]+[*] 3, the overall delay, area and power are reduced compared to prior implementation of TP technique in MB algorithm. Our proposed TP implementations consume 40 % to 50 % (for N[*]=[*] 8 to 128 %) of less multiplexers. And our implementation gives better performance (area, delay and power) compared to prior implementation of TP in MB algorithm. To test {{the efficiency of}} the system, our proposed TP multiplier is implemented in FFT complex multiplication and its results gives better performance for our approach.|$|E
