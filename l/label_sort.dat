40|$|The {{purpose of}} this data {{collection}} is to gather student information used to pre-print bar code labels to affix to the ISTEP+ GQE assessment during the 2010 - 2011 testing cycle. The bar code labels will help reduce the time requirements of the exam and will also ensure more accurate student information by helping to eliminate common bubbling errors related to the Student Information Questionnaire. Audience Public schools, accredited Nonpublic schools and Charter schools should report data for students that are retaking the ISTEP+GQE assessment. The ISTEP+ Coordinator for your district should assist with {{the collection of the}} data and the sort selection of the labels. Instructions Complete a data file using the file layout given below. Include all students in your school(s) that you expect to be taking the ISTEP+ GQE assessment during the testing cycle. The required data should be collected, combined into a file, and submitted to the Department of Education through the STN Application Center. The file may be any of the formats contained in this document and must contain all the fields in the order described. Students reported in this file must already have an existing STN number reported in the STN Lookup. During this period you and your ISTEP+ Coordinator are responsible to determine the sort order for the ISTEP+ labels to complete the collection period. The labels will be printed and returned to the ISTEP+ Coordinator in the order selected.

Tools are needed to assess visual characteristics and to find links with architectural plant parameters. Sensory analyses were developed using real plants and photographs as stimuli. With technology and modeling improvements, using virtual plants could presents numerous advantages. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using rotating virtual rose bush videos as stimuli for a <b>labeled</b> <b>sorting</b> task. The virtual rose bush reflected a natural within-crop variability of one cultivar based on bud breaks location and axes length. Two panels of subjects closely linked to the horticulture sector sorted and described 40 rotating virtual rose bush videos. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) results for both panels were similar and allowed us to highlight five groups of virtual rose bushes with their specific sensory characteristics and their own most representative products using a combination of the paragons and the most typical products. This approach revealed that subjects detected high visual differences between products, and that by using rotation, they were able to integrate 3 D properties about variations around plant facets. Finally, a <b>labeled</b> <b>sorting</b> task is a powerful method for preliminary exploration of the visual aspect of virtual plants. </p...|$|R

In the field of tissue engineering, magnetic nanoparticles have been previously reported for many applications including cellular <b>labelling,</b> <b>sorting</b> and monitoring, targeted in-vivo therapeutic delivery, stem cell replacement therapy and welding tissue surfaces [2, 3]. In 2007, Syková and Jenelová incorporated superparamagnetic nanoparticles into mesenchymal stem cells for the regeneration of tissue damage in {{the central nervous system}} [4]. They reported that the superparamagnetic nanoparticles enabled imaging and control of cellular migration by external magnetic fields to the wound site, optimised the number of cells needed and also helped monitor any possible side effects [4]. Some superparamagnetic nanoparticles were previously approved for imaging and therapeutic applications in humans, e.g. Feridex IV® and Combidex® (Advanced Magnetics Inc., Lexington, MA, USA) [5 – 7] and several other superparamagnetic nanoparticles are also undergoing phases I and II clinical trials [1, 5, 8, 9].|$|R

30|$|Figure  5 {{shows that}} some methods are created as God Method (19 of 25) and others become God Method with the {{evolution}} of the system (6 of 25). In the first case, the methods are introduced in the system already with much functionality. In the second case, methods are created with a single purpose, and as the system evolves, more functionality is added until the method becomes smelly. For instance, the method BaseController.handleCommand is introduced in the first version as a smelly method, centralizing multiple functionalities, such as adding, saving and deleting photos and albums. By version 4, the method was refactored, and some of the previously mentioned functionalities alongside others were removed from the method, removing the smell. On the other hand, the PhotoController.handleCommand method is created in version 2 with a single functionality, saving photo labels. By version 4, multiple features were added, such as editing photo <b>labels,</b> <b>sorting</b> photos, and adding photos as favorite, introducing a smell. One interesting observation is that when a smell is introduced in a method and then removed in a later version, the method remains non-smelly in the subsequent versions.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This {{observational}} study {{set out to}} investigate the effect of sensory description labels on consumer choice of apples in a grocery retail store. Design/methodology/approach - An independent observation {{study was conducted in}} a retail grocery store setting. A total of 1623 consumers were observed over a four day period in four different sessions, each using three apple varieties (JONAGOLD, INGRID MARIE, and ELISE). Marketing strategies differed between the sessions as follows: (1) <b>sort</b> name <b>labelling</b> only, (2) <b>sort</b> name and sensory description <b>labelling,</b> (3) <b>sort</b> name and sensory semantic description <b>labelling,</b> and (4) <b>sort</b> name <b>labelling</b> and allowing consumers to taste the apples before choosing. Findings - Consumer product choice was affected by the sensory description labels. When only the sort name was given on the label, the consumers tended to choose INGRID MARIE, which has a strong sort name. With the addition of sensory description labels, the consumer choice shifted to ELISE, which had been chosen with a low frequency when only sort name was given, but was chosen with a high frequency when sensory description labelling was used. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to red apples and one national market. Practical implications - Practitioners, managers, and marketers may benefit from using proper sensory labelling as a marketing tool for various food products, such as a apples, in a grocery retail store. Originality/value - This study shows the importance and value of sensory description label marketing for food products in grocery retail stores. Little attention has previously been paid to the research area within sensory marketing communication concerning the interplay of sensory perception of food and the formulation of marketing labels, or taste marketing.

40|$|We {{present a}} new formal {{system for the}} {{specification}} and verification of abstract data types, one which allows subtypes and polymorphism. The new system {{is based on a}} modified notion of algebra, namely that of classified algebra. A classified algebra (our terminology) is essentially a single sorted algebra together with a classification (family of subsets) of its universe. The classification, which is not necessarily a partition, is <b>labelled</b> by <b>sort</b> (type) symbols; the subset of the universe <b>labelled</b> by a <b>sort</b> symbol s are the objects of ‘type’ s. An assertion in the new system is either an equation, which asserts that two expressions always have the same value, or a declaration, which asserts that the value of a particular expression is always of a particular type. Equations and declarations have equal status and the rules of inference (substitution and replacement) can be applied to both. We show that any specification (set of assertions) has an initial model, unique up to isomorphism, which we can take to be the family of data types and operations specified. The declarations in a specification act as the ‘generators’ of the types, and this principle forms the basis for an inductlon rule of inference for proving assertions about initial models. ...|$|R
40|$|Background/Objectives: Nutrition {{labels are}} {{potentially}} a major instrument for enabling consumers to make healthier food choices, but current insights into how nutrition labels {{are used by}} consumers in real-world shopping situations are limited, making the science-based formulation of new labelling policies and the evaluation of existing ones difficult. The objective of the European Union-funded project Food Labelling to Advance Better Education for Life (FLABEL) is to determine how nutrition labelling can affect dietary choices, consumer habits and food-related health issues. Subjects/Methods: A wide range of qualitative and quantitative consumer research methods is being used, including physical auditing, <b>label</b> <b>sorting</b> tasks, eye tracking and electrodermal response, structured interviews and analysis of retail scanner data. Results: First results from the project show that, {{on the basis of}} consumer responses, nutrition labels available in Europe can be categorised as non-directive, semidirective or directive. Penetration of nutrition labelling on food and drink packages in five product categories seems widespread, with the nutrition table on the back of packs being the most prominent format (found on 84 % of over 37 000 products audited in 28 countries). The higher penetration observed in Northern Europe is paralleled by more public health campaigns in this region alerting consumers to nutrition labelling systems and elements covered therein (for example, calories, salt and fat). Conclusions: The findings to date indicate that nutrition labelling is widespread in Europe but formats and level of detail may differ between countries and products. Upcoming studies within FLABEL will decipher whether and how the various elements of nutrition labels affect attention, liking, understanding, use and dietary choices, and what the implications are for stakeholders such as policy makers...|$|R
