25|$|Rice, {{like other}} cereal grains, can be puffed (or popped). This process takes {{advantage}} of the grains' water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber. Further puffing is sometimes accomplished by processing puffed pellets in a <b>low-pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> The ideal gas law means either lowering the local pressure or raising the water temperature results in an increase in volume prior to water evaporation, resulting in a puffy texture. Bulk raw rice density is about 0.9 g/cm³. It decreases to less than one-tenth that when puffed.|$|E
25|$|In early 1942, {{prisoners at}} Dachau {{concentration}} camp {{were used by}} Sigmund Rascher in experiments to aid German pilots who had to eject at high altitudes. A <b>low-pressure</b> <b>chamber</b> containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to 20,000m (66,000ft). It was rumored that Rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment. Of the 200 subjects, 80 died outright, {{and the others were}} executed. In a letter from April 5, 1942 between Dr. Sigmund Rascher and Heinrich Himmler, Rascher explains the results of a low-pressure experiment that was performed on people at Dachau Concentration camp in which the victims were suffocated while Rascher and another unnamed doctor took note of his reactions. The person was described as 37 years old and in good health before being murdered. Rascher described the victim’s actions as he began to lose oxygen and times the changes in behavior. The 37 year old began to wiggle his head at 4 minutes, a minute later Rascher observed that he was suffering from cramps before falling unconscious. He describes how the victim then laid unconscious breathing only 3 times per minute until he stopped breathing 30 minutes after being deprived of oxygen. The victim then turned blue and began foaming at the mouth. An autopsy followed an hour later.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Vietnam War ended, the Soviet Union {{introduced}} a 40-mm grenade launcher that used the High-Low Principle, {{but with a}} twist on the original design. [...] The GP-25 40-mm grenade launcher fits under the assault rifle and fires a caseless projectile that is muzzle-loaded. [...] Instead of having a case, the high-pressure chamber {{is located on the}} rear of the projectile with ten vent holes, in which the launcher barrel acts as the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] The ignition of the propellant gases also causes the drive band to engage the launcher grooves, similar to the American Civil War Parrott muzzle loading rifled cannon.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{the valve}} must {{be set to}} release enough air to fire the paintball. If the valve is not tuned properly, {{insufficient}} air to fire the paintball may reach the bolt. This phenomenon, known as [...] "shoot-down," [...] causes fired paintballs to gradually lose range, and can also occur at high rates of fire. Some markers have integral or external <b>chambers,</b> called <b>low-pressure</b> <b>chambers,</b> which hold a large volume of gas behind the valve to prevent shoot-down.|$|R

A one-dimensional unsteady approximation of mechanics of heterogeneous media with identical pressures of the phases and with allowance for a finite volume concentration of particles in the layer is used as a mathematical model. The wave pattern of the flow and the mechanism of wave interaction with the layer, including the dynamics of the layer boundary depending on the layer thickness and rarefaction-wave width, are determined.

2500|$|Besides the {{previously}} mentioned family of popular 40-mm grenades, {{the only other}} major use of a High-Low System was by the Swedish firm FFV in their development of the 1960s-era Miniman one man infantry antitank weapon. [...] The Miniman was simpler and cheaper than anything imagined by designers in World War II. [...] Inside {{what looked like a}} rocket launcher tube, is a HEAT projectile attached by a break away bolt to an alloy aluminum tube with ports drilled in it and which acts like a kind of high-pressure chamber. [...] The launch tube in which it is mounted acts as the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>chamber.</b> [...] When the propellant is ignited in the aluminum tube, gases escape through the ports and are allowed to build up in the launch tube to the point of almost causing a recoil. [...] The break-away bolt then snaps, allowing the projectile to move forward. [...] Unlike other High-Low Systems, gases are allowed to escape {{to the rear of the}} launch tube, achieving a totally recoilless effect.|$|E

30|$|Fistulas most {{commonly}} {{arise from the}} RCA (50 to 60 % of cases), the left anterior descending coronary artery (25 to 42 %), the circumflex (18 %), or both coronary arteries (5 %) [33, 45]. Single fistulas are more common (74 to 90 %) than multiple (10 to 16 %) [43]. The most common (60 to 90 %) site of drainage is {{the right side of}} the heart [44 – 46]. The remaining 10 % may be connected to the pulmonary artery, coronary sinus, superior vena cava (SVC), pulmonary vein, left atrium (LA), left ventricle (LV), or have multiple connections [47]. Termination into a cardiac chamber or vascular structure with lower pressure may lead to enlargement and tortuosity of the artery [46]. The clinical presentation of CAFs depends on the severity of the left-to-right shunt, with the majority detected in adult patients being usually asymptomatic. Coronary angiography can reliably demonstrate the proximal part of the CAF and allow evaluation of the size and number of fistulas present. However, coronary fistulas draining into <b>low-pressure</b> <b>chambers</b> of the heart may not be well-visualized by conventional angiography because of significant dilution of the contrast medium. Electrocardiographically gated MDCT is useful to image CAF and provide a road map for treatment planning [39].|$|R
