50|$|Rawls {{arranged}} the fundamental {{principles of the}} Original Position in lexical priority: the liberty principle, fair equality of opportunity and lastly the difference principle. This prioritisation encounters criticism, as {{the importance of the}} first principle is awarded greater weighting and must be satisfied prior to subsequent principles. So whilst liberty {{is said to be the}} dominant principle, the difference principle that results from the acceptance of inequalities (the second principle) operates in violation of the first principle. This is exemplified by redistributive taxes as discussed by Robert Nozick in Anarchy, State and Utopia which criticises the use of this tax as a <b>levelling</b> <b>mechanism,</b> impinging upon an individual’s basic liberties, the mainstay of the original position's principles.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Southern Gothic of American {{writers such}} as William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor and Eudora Welty, Southern Ontario Gothic {{analyzes}} and critiques social conditions such as race, gender, religion and politics, but in a Southern Ontario context. Southern Ontario Gothic is generally characterized by a stern realism set against the dour small-town Protestant morality stereotypical of the region, and often has underlying themes of moral hypocrisy. Actions and people that act against humanity, logic, and morality all are portrayed unfavourably, and one or more characters may be suffering from some form of mental illness. In a review of Alice Munro's Dear Life for Quill & Quire, literary critic James Grainger writes that [...] "Violence, illness, and reputations ruined by a single indiscretion are accepted in Munro’s secretive, repressed communities {{as a kind of}} <b>levelling</b> <b>mechanism,</b> rough justice for those who dare to strive for something finer." ...|$|E

It was built by Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, and again the movement of the gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E

Its structure and kinematics were analyzed and the first-order influence coefficient matrix {{was obtained by}} using the influence coefficient method. Then the complete and concise dynamic equations without too many unknowns were established based on Lagrange method. In addition, the dynamics simulation was carried out and the result shows that drive forces of the legs have no strong coupling, which is important to control system design...|$|E

40|$|Managing an {{aftermarket}} {{supply chain}} {{is associated with}} high levels of complexity. This comes in form of the need to handle extensive number of SKUs over long product lifecycles in relation to highly volatile and uncertain demand. Being cost-efficient in such an environment is challenging since the characteristics of an aftermarket requires high responsiveness to meet customer demand. Wireless Solutions is a world-leading provider of telecommunications equipment and related services to mobile and fixed network operators. Within Wireless Solutions there are three Global Services Logistics Centres (GSLC) where GSLC EMEA works as a support function managing the logistical part in the service contracts of replacing faulty parts with functioning parts towards End Customer. The efficiency of this flow is heavily dependent on the collaboration between the GSLC EMEA and the different Repair Centres that performs the repair service. To generate cost-efficiency there is a need of taking a holistic perspective of the intra-company supply chain in order to not sub-optimise the different actors. This thesis takes a balanced approach departure to investigate the purpose how supply chain costs associated with the WHS Repair Logistics Flow can be reduced by proposing actions to improve the forecasting performance and reducing the intra-monthly variance in the inbound deliveries of faulty parts to Repair Centres. From an initial mapping of the current state there are several problems identified creating a difficult planning environment for all entities. As a starting point it is hard to predict when products need to be replaced due to failure. Additional level of complexity is also generated by the customers’ behaviour. This generates a complex forecast environment creating rippling effect throughout the value chain and affecting the Repair Centres in forms of high deviations between forecast and actual demand. The analysis was conducted on the forecasting management and the possibilities of using a buffer for evening out the variation at the Repair Centres. The analysis profess that the uncertainty within the system drives unnecessary cost in terms of excess capacity for all actors involved. It also concludes that there are measures to be taken to reduce these costs. Regarding forecasting {{there is a need for}} increased functional integration as well as an alignment between actors within the system, concerning performance measurements. In addition, increased use of data other than historical demand is recommended, such as installed base data. To reduce the effects of uncertainty for the Repair Centres two distinguished strategies were proposed, both using buffering of faulty units as a <b>levelling</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In the end, a variant of Orders Outside Lead-time was considered the most feasible. By doing so the need for overcapacity to handle variation is reduced. This implies that the costly impact which emerges when less demand than anticipated are received can be diminished. In summary the combination of these measures of improvement creates possibilities for an increased efficiency throughout the supply chain, which would strengthen the value proposition and thereby increasing the competitiveness on the unpredictable aftermarket...|$|E
