5|$|The next {{match on}} the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa {{interfered}} by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring. At one point, Tatanka <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow {{kicked him in the}} back of the head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.|$|E
25|$|This time, Earnhardt {{was back}} for good, winning six championships {{over the next}} two decades, with crew chiefs Kirk Shelmerdine and Andy Petree, and Goodwrench {{replacing}} Wrangler as the primary sponsor after 1987. In the late 1990s Earnhardt's performance began to slow down, and went through 1997 without a victory. The next year, he won the Daytona 500 after 20 starts, all ending in losses. The year after that one, he was able to score wins at Talladega, as well as cause more controversy, after he spun Terry Labonte out to win a race at Bristol. In 2000, he <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> finally regaining his old form, winning twice and finishing runner-up to Bobby Labonte in points, and his many fans hoped he was gearing up for his record-breaking 8th championship. However, this was not to be.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match of}} Triplemanía XX {{was also a}} Hair vs. Hair match, contested for the hairs of Joaquín and Dorian Roldán. Joaquin led his team of Electroshock and L.A. Park into the arena, {{followed}} by Dorian {{and his team of}} Jeff Jarrett and Kurt Angle. The rudo team was also accompanied by Karen Jarrett, Jeff's wife and the former wife of Angle. Towards the end of the match, as referee Piero was busy keeping Karen out of the ring, Dorian entered and attacked Electroshock, which led to also his father entering the ring and telling him to get out. Dorian <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to leave the ringside area, only to return with La Sociedad member and half of the AAA World Tag Team Champions, Abyss, by his side. After a hot tag, L.A. Park was in control of his opponents, which led to Abyss entering the ring, only for Park to dropkick him out and hit him with a suicide dive. At this point, Dorian again entered the ring, but was followed by Joaquín, who dropped his son with a clothesline. As Jarrett went for diving crossbody, Park moved, which resulted in him taking out referee Piero instead. Park rolled Jarrett in an inside cradle, but Piero was unable to make the count. Abyss then once again entered the ring and hit Park with a chokeslam. He went to perform the same move on Electroshock, but got hit with a cutter instead. Electroshock then countered Angle's finishing maneuver, the Angle Slam, into an arm drag, before hitting him also with the cutter. Electroshock pinned Angle, as Park jumped on top of him, and scored the three count for the win, forcing Dorian Roldán to have his head shaved bald. However, before the shaving took place, Joaquín asked his son to disband La Sociedad and return to AAA, which led to Dorian apologizing for his actions and agreeing to disband the rudo stable. Jarrett tried to protest, but was shut down by Electroshock. Joaquín then announced {{that he did not want}} his son to be shaved, drawing the ire of L.A. Park. Suddenly, Dorian attacked his father, while Jarrett and Angle did the same to Electroshock and Park. Dorian then shaved his father's head, before leading La Sociedad out of the ring. Park, infuriated by what had happened, went to AAA president Marisela Peña Roldán, the wife of Joaquín and the mother of Dorian, and told her that she should have never let Joaquín get his hands on Antonio Peña's company.|$|E

Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all.

His [...] started off with a victory in the first stage, a team time trial, of the Vuelta. Valverde would take the lead of the general classification, points classification, and combination classification after winning Stage 3, in which he chased down repeated attacks from Alberto Contador and outsprinted Joaquim Rodríguez at the finishing line. He would subsequently lose the lead to Rodriguez, but won the eighth stage atop the Collada de la Gallina in Andorra. Alberto Contador broke away from the small lead group and <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> heading for the win, but Rodriguez and Valverde passed him with less than [...] to go, with Valverde taking the win. Valverde ultimately finished the Vuelta in second position overall after being a constant threat for the leader, which was Rodriguez until stage 17 where Contador soloed to victory and grabbed the lead, which he would not relinquish. Valverde also snatched both the Points classification and the Combination classification jerseys from Rodriguez {{as a result of a}} sixth-place finish on the very last stage in Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{drafts of}} the {{screenplay}} were set on Hollywood Boulevard, not Portland, with working titles such as Blue Funk and Minions of the Moon. Reading Rechy's novel had convinced Van Sant {{to change the}} setting to Portland. The script originally consisted of two separate scenarios: the first was called Modern Days and it recounted Mike's story; a second one updated the Henry IV plays with Scott's story. Van Sant realized that he could blend the two stories together {{in the manner of}} the [...] "cut up" [...] technique used by writer William S. Burroughs. In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios formed in Van Sant's mind after watching Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight. The director remembers, [...] "I thought that the Henry IV plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of Falstaff and who was crazy about hustler boys". Van Sant realized that Prince Hal in the plays resembled the character of Scott and the sidekick was Mike. His script ended up becoming a literal restructuring of the Henry IV plays. Van Sant got the idea for Mike's narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film. According to the director, he always <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to fall asleep. The film's title is derived from the song [...] "Private Idaho" [...] by the B-52's that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.|$|E

But as someone who did spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (blah, blah, blah), why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ...
