50|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>drop</b> {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in total pressure between two points of a fluid carrying network. <b>Pressure</b> <b>drop</b> occurs when frictional forces, caused by the resistance to flow, act on a fluid as it flows through the tube.

A piping network containing a high relative roughness rating as well as many pipe fittings and joints, tube convergence, divergence, turns, surface roughness and other physical properties will affect the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> High flow velocities and / or high fluid viscosities result in a <b>larger</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> across a section of pipe or a valve or elbow.

Since it is not feasible to obtain a unique friction factor for the hose, we aim to calculate the highest possible value. In order to calculate this value, most of the hose was gathered in a coil of approximately 0.15  m of diameter. We consider that this condition generates one of the highest friction factors that the system could present due to the continuous changes of direction of the flow of water. These changes generate secondary flows along the hose and these augment the friction. The only moment this condition is presented is when the device is collected before being deployed. During the deployment, it is unlikely that this situation happen. Therefore, it is unlikely to generate <b>larger</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> values than those calculated on this condition.|$|R
40|$|The flow {{distribution}} {{obtained with}} three different bipolar plate geometries has been studied, analyzing their fluid dynamic performance. Three plate topologies have been selected in some way representative of different design models commonly used. The configurations tested are a set of parallel diagonal channels, a branching cascade type, and a serpentine distribution of parallel channel blocks. The flow distribution across the plates has been first simulated numerically. To visualize the flow pattern at the plate channels plane, a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) trace tracking technique has been applied. From experimental and numerical simulations it is concluded that the diagonal topology distributes the flow in a non-uniform way. On the other hand, an inadequately <b>large</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is established along the serpentine-parallel plate.
