A nondeterministic finite automaton is constructed for {{string matching}} with k mismatches.

The corresponding deterministic finite au-tomaton have O(m TM) states, where m is the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the pattern and k is the number of mismatches. The time complexity of algorithms based on such deterministic finite automaton is O(n), where n is the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> ...|$|R

For the first parameter, {{a total of}} 52 verbs were identified to describe cognitive abilities and comprehensive strategies employed in reading, followed by a massive number of goal expressions that varied from detailed information to writer’s attitudes and opinions, {{in order to accommodate}} to the particular predicate before them. For the parameter of modifier, the more complicated situation emerged because 265 phrases were used in defining the text that readers were able to comprehend. The phrases could be further classified into four sub-categories—language (difficulty, complexity, style, etc.), content and theme (complexity, abstractness, etc.), <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>text</b> (short, medium, long), and method of reading (fast reading, careful reading, etc.). The same case occurred on the topic and text type, for a multitude of topics scattered in six types <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> and <b>ranged</b> from the abstract (i.e., argumentation, exposition) to the concrete (i.e., manual, comment on current affairs, business letter).|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne novel {{technique}} for identifying {{the writer of}} an online handwritten document is proposed. This technique makes use of a character prototype distribution to model the specific allographs 1 used by a given writer. In this paper, we propose to extend and improve upon this newly established methodology [1] by making use of a stochastic nearest neighbor algorithm to estimate the character prototype distribution. The proposed method is text independent and relies on the automatic segmentation <b>of</b> the handwritten <b>text</b> at the character level. Our results show that this approach attained a writer identification rate of 99. 2 % when a reference database of 120 writers is used.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to present an {{inventory}} of different types of syntactic constructions found in written discourse of ten-year-old fourth graders, that is, to examine the existing variations in text syntactic structures which were produced by fourth graders. Written text corpus was collected from 88 fourth graders from Belgrade. In three different sessions, students composed three texts in three different genres: narrative, expository, and argumentative. Thematic and genre versatility enriched the corpus and created favourable conditions for elicitation of different types of syntactic constructions. Different quantitative and qualitative characteristics <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> from the database were taken into account and analysed: the mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> measured by the number of words, the number of utterances, and the mean <b>length</b> <b>of</b> utterance measured by the number of words and clauses, as well as the presence of various types of syntactic constructions (kernel, simple, compound, complex and complex-compound sentences). The frequency of appearance of each of these was then established. The results provide an insight into the average <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>texts</b> and sentences produced by the fourth-grade primary school pupils, as well as into the means used to produce them (the kind of sentences they form). The results are much more valuable because they are concerned with examining the syntax in children who are native speakers of Serbian. They also show that in ten-year-olds’ texts all the analysed types of sentence structure may appear, but the use frequency varies. Besides providing an inventory of syntactic attainments in written production of ten-year-old children, the research presented a new insight into their syntactic competence.
