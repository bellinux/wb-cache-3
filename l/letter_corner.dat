5000|$|Postage stamps at {{the time}} {{included}} <b>letters</b> in the <b>corners</b> which indicated their positions on the sheet. Some of the forgeries used ‘impossible’ lettering that did not correspond with the possible sheet positions. The letters were also slightly larger than on the genuine stamps and the corners were blunter. A second batch of forgeries, for plate 6, improved the sharpness of the corners and other details, but whoever was behind the fraud either failed {{to work out the}} combinations for the <b>corner</b> <b>letters</b> or did not think it necessary to do so.|$|R

Bertie saw and understood, and with the quiet motion of a cat he {{abstracted}} the letter and made himself acquainted with its contents. The doctor, however, had seen him, deep as he appeared to be mersed in his egg-shell, and said in his harshest voice, [...] "Well, sir, do you know that gentleman?" ...|$|R

It features eight karaoke instrumental versions of tracks from the original soundtrack.|$|R
60|$|The {{promptness}} {{and decision}} with which Lincoln despatched the multitudinous affairs {{of his office}} during the most turbulent scenes of the Civil War are exemplified in his unequivocal order to the Attorney-General, indorsed {{on the back of}} the letter of Hon. Austin A. King, requesting a pardon for John B. Corner. The indorsement bears even date with the <b>letter</b> itself, and <b>Corner</b> was pardoned on the following day.|$|R

5000|$|The {{variety of}} colours and designs was partly in {{response}} to the much-disliked [...] "Lilac and Green" [...] issues of 1883-1884. The 1884 Stamp Committee was formed to make decisions about improved replacements. After several meetings, and considering a number of essays by De La Rue (many of which survive in the marketplace), they produced a report recommending the use of surface printing, two colours in fugitive inks, coloured paper, and the dropping of the <b>corner</b> <b>letters</b> that had distinguished stamps on the sheet.|$|R
5000|$|Her column's {{popularity}} led to {{coordination of}} the Women's League for the Spread of Co-operation, soon after renamed the Co-operative Women's Guild. Formation {{of a central}} board and meeting space for women was proposed in a <b>letter</b> to Women's <b>Corner</b> from [...] "M.L. Woolwich", a pseudonym of Mary Lawrenson who became a co-founder of the Guild. The Guild was formally inaugurated in June 1883. Acland served as General Secretary of the guild in 1883, but resigned from the position due to ill-health. She served as President from 1884-1886, again resigning due to further health problems.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dance of}} the geisha has evolved from the dance {{performed}} on the noh and kabuki stages. The [...] "wild and outrageous" [...] dances transformed into a more subtle, stylized, and controlled form of dance. It is extremely disciplined, similar to t'ai chi. Every dance uses gestures {{to tell a story}} and only a connoisseur can understand the subdued symbolism. For example, a tiny hand gesture represents reading a love <b>letter,</b> holding the <b>corner</b> of a handkerchief in the mouth represents coquetry and the long sleeves of the elaborate kimono are often used to symbolize dabbing tears.|$|R

[...] The sheets, printed by Perkins Bacon, consisted of 240 stamps in 20 rows of 12 columns. One full sheet cost 240 pence or one pound; one row of 12 stamps cost a shilling. As the name suggests, the stamp was printed in black ink. A two penny stamp printed in blue and covering the double-letter rate (up to [...] ) was issued on 8 May 1840.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} practical digraphic cipher (pairwise substitution), was {{the so-called}} Playfair cipher, invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1854. In this cipher, a 5 x 5 grid {{is filled with}} the letters of a mixed alphabet (two letters, usually I and J, are combined). A digraphic substitution is then simulated by taking pairs of <b>letters</b> as two <b>corners</b> of a rectangle, and using the other two corners as the ciphertext (see the Playfair cipher main article for a diagram). Special rules handle double letters and pairs falling in the same row or column. Playfair was in military use from the Boer War through World War II.|$|R
5000|$|The rider {{goes from}} one of the <b>letters</b> near the <b>corner</b> (K,H,M, or F), to the letter on the long side near the {{opposite}} corner(for example, K to M, or H to F). The rider does not go from corner to corner. There should be a stride or two of straightness between riding in the corner and beginning to go across the diagonal, and reaching the other side and going into its corner. When the rider is going across the diagonal, his horse should stay perfectly straight through his body and on his line, meeting [...] "x" [...] as he crosses the centerline. The rider should also be sure not to overshoot the letter he is riding to, a common fault, and instead aim to hit the wall of the arena a couple of feet before the letter.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, some of {{the same}} plates that were used to print the Penny Black were used to print the Penny Red and about 21 billion Penny Reds were printed by Messrs. Perkins, Bacon & Co. Initially, the stamp had no perforations, and had to be cut from the sheet using {{scissors}} {{in the same manner as}} for the Penny Black and the early printings of the Two pence blue. Perforations, (experimental gauge 16), first came into use in 1850 and were officially adopted in 1854 (in the same size as the experimental issue). The experimental issue can be distinguished from the general issue as the later was applied to stamp which used a different alphabet type for the letters in the lower corners. Each stamp has unique <b>corner</b> <b>letters</b> AA, AB, AC ... AL etc., so its position on the plate can be identified.|$|R
5000|$|The Venetian Red {{had a short}} run, and was {{replaced}} by the Penny Lilac in July 1881. Its displacement is attributed to a change in government postal policy: the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 necessitated {{the creation of a new}} provision of revenue stamps. A new inscription was therefore needed, and the new Penny Lilacs featured the words [...] "POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE" [...] and [...] "ONE PENNY", instead of [...] "POSTAGE" [...] and [...] "ONE PENNY" [...] that its predecessors bore. It was decided that a new colour would also be desirable to defend against improper re-use; a fugitive lilac ink was used that would run and spoil the stamp if one attempted to wash off the cancellation. The Lilacs broke the tradition of using <b>corner</b> <b>letters</b> and instead had either fourteen or sixteen dots in each corner.|$|R

You are all fast becoming faithless. I suppose it is because our holiday is drawing to a close, and we shall soon forget we ever had any, or be ashamed we ever played so long. Everybody {{seems to be getting}} nervous and fidgety and preparing for civilization again. Mr. Banks, for the last few days, has dressed himself regularly as if he were going down town to his office, and writes <b>letters</b> in the <b>corner</b> of the saloon {{as if it were a}} counting-house. Mr. Crosby and Mr. Winslow do nothing but talk of their prospects, and I believe they are drawing up articles of partnership together. Here is Mr. Brace frightening me by telling me that my brother will lock me up, to keep the rich miners from laying their bags of gold dust at my feet; and Mrs. Brimmer and Miss Chubb assure me that I haven't a decent gown to go ashore in." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{travelled}} by the Underground {{as far as}} Aldersgate; and a {{short walk}} took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, {{the scene of the}} singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with [...] "JABEZ WILSON" [...] in white <b>letters,</b> upon a <b>corner</b> house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, Hill {{specified}} that the stamps should be 3/4 inch square, but altered the dimensions to 3/4 inch wide by 7/8 inch tall (approx 19 x 22 mm) {{to accommodate the}} writing at the bottom. The word [...] "POSTAGE" [...] {{at the top of}} the design distinguishes it from a revenue stamp, which had long been used in the UK; [...] "ONE PENNY." [...] at the bottom shows the amount pre-paid for postage of the stamped letter. The background to the portrait consists of finely engraved engine turnings. The two upper corners hold Maltese crosses with radiant solar discs at their centres; the lower <b>corner</b> <b>letters</b> show the position of the stamp in the printed sheet, from [...] "A A" [...] at top left to [...] "T L" [...] at bottom right. The sheets, printed by Perkins Bacon, consisted of 240 stamps in 20 rows of 12 columns. One full sheet cost 240 pence or one pound; one row of 12 stamps cost a shilling. As the name suggests, the stamp was printed in black ink. A two penny stamp printed in blue and covering the double-letter rate (up to 1 oz) was issued on 8 May 1840.|$|R
5000|$|For plating to be possible, {{there must}} be {{constant}} variants in details of the stamps printed from a single plate or lithographic stone so that one can identify the exact original position of each stamp. Evidence {{that may be used}} in plating includes defects or [...] "flaws" [...] occurring in the transfer of images, individual touch-ups by the engraver, recuttings of the plates, repairs, and accidental injuries to the plates. In addition, stamps may have be laid out in an irregular fashion on the plate with the result that differences in spacing and orientation of the stamps may be used to determine their plate positions. From their inception in 1840 until 1884, postage stamps from Great Britain incorporated control <b>letters</b> in the <b>corners</b> indicating the stamps's exact position on the sheet, e.g., A...C is first row, third stamp, and for a period also incorporated the number of the plate from which the stamps were printed. Other evidence such as color of the ink used or watermarks in the paper may be of use in reconstructing plates. In the absence of such evidence, plating is not possible. Because of the highly accurate methods of modern stamp production, most modern issues cannot be plated.|$|R
60|$|He {{was the man}} at a pound a week {{who made}} the inquiries. It was no virtue or merit in Nadgett that he transacted all his Anglo-Bengalee {{business}} secretly and in the closest confidence; for he was born to be a secret. He was a short, dried-up, withered old man, {{who seemed to have}} secreted his very blood; for nobody would have given him credit for the possession of six ounces of it in his whole body. How he lived was a secret; where he lived was a secret; and even what he was, was a secret. In his musty old pocket-book he carried contradictory cards, in some of which he called himself a coal-merchant, in others a wine-merchant, in others a commission-agent, in others a collector, in others an accountant; as if he really didn't know the secret himself. He was always keeping appointments in the City, and the other man never seemed to come. He would sit on 'Change for hours, looking at everybody who walked in and out, and would do the like at Garraway's, and in other business coffee-rooms, in some of which he would be occasionally seen drying a very damp pocket-handkerchief before the fire, and still looking over his shoulder for the man who never appeared. He was mildewed, threadbare, shabby; always had flue upon his legs and back; and kept his linen so secretly buttoning up and wrapping over, that he might have had none--perhaps he hadn't. He carried one stained beaver glove, which he dangled before him by the forefinger as he walked or sat; but even its fellow was a secret. Some people said he had been a bankrupt, others that he had gone an infant into an ancient Chancery suit which was still depending, but it was all a secret. He carried bits of sealing-wax and a hieroglyphical old copper seal in his pocket, and often secretly indited <b>letters</b> in <b>corner</b> boxes of the trysting-places before mentioned; but they never appeared to go to anybody, for he would put them into a secret place in his coat, and deliver them to himself weeks afterwards, very much to his own surprise, quite yellow. He was that sort of man that if he had died worth a million of money, or had died worth twopence halfpenny, everybody would have been perfectly satisfied, and would have said it was just as they expected. And yet he belonged to a class; a race peculiar to the City; who are secrets as profound to one another, as they are to the rest of mankind.|$|R
50|$|As Liutprand of Cremona mentions, {{hearing about}} the {{apparition}} of the Hungarians in his kingdom, Berengar I. was very surprised how this army from a nation, about which he never heard of, appeared so suddenly. Than he sent envoys and <b>letters</b> in every <b>corners</b> of his country demanding to everybody to send their troops to him to fight the Hungarians. After all his troops gathered his army became three times bigger than the Magyar army. According to Chronicon Sagornini of John the Deacon, the Italian army was 15 000, so we can conclude, that the Hungarians were 5000. This number could be exaggerated, like the medieval chroniclers often did with the numbers of the armies, but the affirmation that the Italians were three {{times more than the}} Hungarians, has no reason not to be accepted, because usually the chroniclers exaggerate the number of the enemy armies and diminish the number of the troops of their own, so we can accept that the Italians heavily outnumbered the Hungarians. Noticing his superiority, Berengar started to think too much of himself, and instead of attacking the Hungarian army immediately, he spent his time in a town carousing with his men. This gave time to the Hungarian troops, scattered to plunder in every corner of the Italian kingdom, to retreat towards the gathering place, one precisely not specified place {{on the bank of the}} river Brenta, which, as shown before, probably was chosen from the beginning to be the place of the battle. Seeing this, king Berengar thought that they were frightened from the number of his troops, and started to chase them, thinking that he already won. His mounted troops even managed to surprise a Hungarian troop and force it to cross in haste the river Adda causing the drowning of many of them. But generally the retreat was a success, because the Hungarians light armors and weapons (the commoners, who usually made the pillaging raids, wear no or just leather armours, only the leaders had lamellar armours, their weapons were always composite bows, the hand-to-hand weapons were sabres, and rarely battle axes or maces) enabled their horses to be more rapid than the heavy armored and weaponed Carolingian type Italian cavalry. The Hungarians retreated on the old Roman road Via Postumia towards the future battlefield.|$|R
