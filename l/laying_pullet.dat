This kind of husbandry seemed to be much preferred by farmers as {{they thought it was}} a simple and did not need high skill and high capital "IP padi 300 " was a term of rice planting system tree times instead of twice in a year. This kind of changing might have significantly affected duck faming. The objective {{of the study was to}} observe the interactively effect of "IP padi 300 " to duck husbandry at the same area. Two locations were choosen (Subang, West Jawa and Pemalang, Central Java) with 5 farmers at each location to be involved in the study. As many as 1200 <b>laying</b> <b>pullet</b> ducks were distributed to 10 farmers at two locations. The farmers were suggested to raise laying ducks with their own systems (fully intensive, semi intensive and fully herded) and were observed for 6 months. Biota was observed on both field and in the crop of the laying ducks. There was an interactive effect of "IP padi 300 " and the duck farming on the same area. The availability of feed was increased on the "IP padi 300 ", which gave benefit to duck farming especially fue herded system, not to go far from owner's home base. Whilst the benefit to "IP padi 300 " was assumed to the reduction of pest and desease, which was frequently attacked the rice field. The production of egg from herded duck was very fluctuative due to the movement and feed availability in the rice field. Field biota in Subang and Pemalang was very much the same in profile, although "golden snail" was only found in Subang. Ducks' crop content seemed to be very much similar with the profile of field biota, although rice grain was the most in the crop. Thus, it was found that field biota was not reduced by "IP padi 300 ", in fact it was rather increased...|$|E

Nineteen Rhode Island Red <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> of 170 -days-old {{were used to determine}} the effects of graded amounts of dietary selenium on tissues, eggs, urine and faeces (not separated) selenium contents. As basal diet, commercial feed for laying hen containing 0. 23 mg selenium per kg. Was provided to <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> for 2 weeks. Following basal diet period, pullets were fed on diet containing, respectively, 0. 44 and 0. 53 mg selenium per kg. For 3 weeks. Blood was obtained to determine selenium levels and GSHpx activities. Concentration of selenium in egg yolk, egg white, urine and faeces was also determind. At the end of each period, six <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> were sacrificed to collect the liver and the kidney samples. When a sufficient amount of selenium for physiological requirement was provided to <b>laying</b> <b>pullets,</b> body weight, egg production and others in <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> were not improved by the additional supplement of selenium in diets. Blood selenium levels and plasma GSHpx activities were not affected by graded amounts of dietary selenium. It can be seen that selenium over the physiological requirement reduced its utilization. Selenium content in egg white, urine and faeces increased with increasing amount of dietary selenium, but, that in egg yolk was not exactly in propotion to selenium levels of diet. Excretion ratios of selenium in egg yolk, egg white, urine and faeces changed depending on the amount of selenium intake.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Five {{separate}} {{trials were}} conducted to test the feeding value of Pacific Northwest grown soybeans for chickens and turkeys. Soybeans were obtained from farms near Walla Walla, Washington and incorporated into rations which were fed to replacement <b>pullets,</b> <b>laying</b> <b>pullets,</b> broiler chickens, turkey poults and market turkeys. These rations were either solvent soybean meal, extruded or raw soybean based and balanced isocalorically and isonitrogenously. Extruded and raw soybean rations fed <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> were supplemented with and without added methionine. Similarly, rations fed turkey poults were supplemented with and without added zinc bacitracin and procaine penicillin, and broiler rations with and without zinc bacitracin. In the first experiment, extruded soybeans {{were found to have}} essentially the same feeding value as solvent soybean meal for replacement pullets. The observed effects of feeding raw soybeans were delayed sexual maturity, reduced body weight, poor feed conversion, pancreatic hypertrophy and liver atrophy. In the second experiment, <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> which were fed either of three soybean rations in the grower phase, were again either fed or switched to solvent soybean meal, extruded or raw soybeans in the layer phase. Again, extruded soybeans were found to be equal in feeding value to solvent soybean meal in terms of supporting good egg production. The observed effects of feeding raw soybeans to <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> were poor egg production, poor feed conversion, decreased feed consumption, pancreatic hypertrophy, and liver atrophy. Pullets fed raw soybean in the grower phase produced significantly fewer (P <. 05) eggs in the layer phase even when they were fed solvent soybean meal. Birds fed raw soybean supplemented with methionine produced significantly more (P <. 05) eggs than birds fed raw soybean without supplemental methionine. In the remaining three experiments, the three soybean rations were fed to broiler chickens and growing turkeys. Extruded soybeans were found to be similar in feeding value to solvent soybean meal. Those birds fed extruded soybean and solvent soybean meal rations gained significantly more (P <. 05) and converted feed to body weight significantly better (P <. 05) than those fed raw soybean rations. With turkey poults, the supplementation of zinc bacitracin was found to significantly increase (P <. 05) body weights of birds fed extruded soybeans over those fed solvent soybean meal. With broilers, added zinc bacitracin and procaine penicillin did not prove to be beneficial. The observed effects of feeding raw soybeans were reduced body weight, poor feed conversion, wet litter and pancreatic hypertrophy in both species. Additionally, kidney hypertrophy was noted in broilers. Using up to 25 and 33 percent raw soybeans in broiler and market turkey rations, respectively, did not cause any significant growth depression. Under the conditions of this experiment, Pacific Northwest grown soybeans treated by an extrusion process were equal in feeding value, for all ages of poultry, to solvent extracted soybeans.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of the main cereal and feed form of the diet on performance and digestive tract traits was studied in 576 brown-egg <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> from 1 to 120 d of age. From 1 to 45 d of age, 4 diets ar-ranged factorially with 2 cereals (corn vs. wheat) and 2 feed forms (mash vs. pellets) were used. Each treat-ment was replicated 6 times (24 pullets per replicate). From 46 to 120 d of age, all diets were offered in mash form and the only difference among diets was the cereal used. Cumulatively, pullets fed the corn diets had high-er BW gain (P < 0. 05) but similar feed conversion ratio as pullets fed the wheat diets. From 1 to 45 d of age, pullets fed pellets consumed more feed (P < 0. 001) and had higher BW gain (P < 0. 001) than those fed mash. Most of the beneficial effects of pelleting on productive performance were still evident at 120 d of age. At 45 d of age, gizzard weight (g/kg of BW) was higher (P < 0. 01) in pullets fed corn than in pullets fed wheat diets. Feeding pellets reduced the relative weight of the diges-tive tract and the gizzard (P < 0. 001) {{as well as the}} length (cm/kg of BW) of the small intestine (P < 0. 01) at both ages. The pH of gizzard contents at 120 d of age was not affected by cereal but was lower in pullets that were fed mash from 1 to 45 d of age (P < 0. 01). We conclude that wheat can be used in substitution of corn in pullet diets with only a slight reduction in BW gain and that feeding pellets from 1 to 45 d of age increased BW gain and pH of the gizzard and reduced the relative weight of the gizzard and the length of the gastrointestinal tract at 120 d of age.

40|$|Abstract: An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the growth performance, nutrient utilization, egg quality characteristics and cost-benefit values of feeding different levels activated sheabutter tree charcoal to <b>laying</b> <b>pullets.</b> Five experimental diets supplemented with activated sheabutter charcoal were formulated to contain 0. 0 (control), 10. 0, 20. 0, 30. 0 and 40. 0 % levels of the charcoal. A total of 150 day-old pullets {{were used for the}} study and were fed the diets till they were 22 weeks of age. The results showed no beneficial effect of feeding activated sheabutter charcoal to pullets up to 15 weeks of age as there were no significant (p> 0. 05) differences in the performance parameters measured up to this stage. At the laying stage, activated sheabutter charcoal significantly (p 0. 05) effect of activated sheabutter charcoal was observed on the internal egg quality parameters measured. The pullets fed activated charcoal had higher economic returns than the control. The results were attributed to increased mineral intake and utilization enhanced by charcoal supplementation and also improved absorption capacity of charcoal for dietary fat.

40|$|Genetically Modified (GM) {{crops are}} widely used. Research {{has focused on}} {{examining}} differences between GM and conventional corn feeding on broiler performance and carcass composition. However, relatively {{little attention has been}} focused on reproductive effects on the recipient animals. To address this, the present study employed laying hens as a model due to their rapid reproductive development and rate of egg production. This study investigated the putative effects of a diet consisting of Starlink corn (expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis gene Cry 9 C) on the fecundity of the laying hen. Twenty-week-old point of <b>lay</b> <b>pullets</b> were fed a diet containing corn positive for the Cry 9 C (Starlink) gene (not a current variety) for 3 weeks, paired with a corn-based diet known not to contain the gene. During the study, the number of eggs collected, egg shell thickness, number of yolks and egg weight and, upon necropsy, body, ovary and ovary weight, together with the number of yolky (yellow) follicles were recorded.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} study the mode of {{inheritance}} of traits associated {{with the onset of}} sexual maturity, data from stocks differing greatly in genetic background were analyzed when populations achieved 50 % lay. Chickens used in this experiment consisted of three parental lines and five crosses. Parental lines were White Plymouth Rocks bidirectionally selected for high (HH) and low (LL) 56 -day body weight, and a closed population of Jersey Black Giants (JJ). Crosses were produced from reciprocal matings of the White Rock lines (HL and LH), their F 2 (HL X HL), and Jersey males mated to weight-line females (JH, JL). When 50 % of the pullets within a popula-tion had laid, various traits were measured for each individual in that population. Retrospective analyses showed that sexually mature pullets were heavier at 91 and 126 days of age than those which had not commenced lay. Body weight dimorphism between layers and nonlayers was dis-proportionately greater in LL and F 2 pullets than in those of other populations, resulting in a population by physiological stage interaction. Fat depots were heavier and percentages of fat were higher in <b>laying</b> than nonlaying <b>pullets.</b> Evidence was obtained suggesting that an absolute quantity of breast tissue was necessary before lean tissue percentage became meaningful as a threshold trait for the onset of egg production. Modes of inheritance for body weight and compositional charac-teristics were different in sexually immature and mature pullets, suggesting that muscle func-tioned as a nutrient reserve in <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> and a nutrient store in those that had not reached this physiological stage.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study an {{experimental}} design was followed whereby 600 DeKalb Amber-link® commercial <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> were subjected to three levels of EM bokashi (0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %) and a standard level of a coccidiostat in the starter (17 % CP, 0. 9 % Ca and 0. 4 % available phosphate) and grower (15 % CP, 0. 8 % Ca and 0. 35 % available phosphate) diets from day-old to 16 weeks of age. EM treatments did not significantly affect the average weekly body mass, average daily gain, average weekly feed intake, cumulative weekly feed intake, cumulative feed conversion ratio and the average bi-weekly shank length over the control. The coccidiostat treatment maintained significant lower body weights, average daily gains and worse feed conversion ratios than all the EM treatments and the control throughout the trial period of 16 weeks. Although not significant the EM 1. 5 % level had the best feed conversion ratio, the highest body mass and the longest shank length at the end of the trial period at week 16.

40|$|Like in {{the other}} animal sectors, the purpose of chicken {{production}} is to obtain the yield of a desir-able level at the lowest cost. As the chickens spend their life in poultry houses, {{in order to be}} able to perform their production capacities entirely, they should be kept in good environmental conditions with a good care as well as genetic characteristics. Depending upon economic conditions and clima-tologic constraints, egg production normally takes place in either fully confined or semi-confined housing. Uniformity of body weight in <b>pullets</b> and <b>laying</b> hens is an important management concern. To achieve early maturity and egg production it is very important to have correct body weight and uniformity in the growing period. Sexual maturity in the growth period of pullets varies in relation to breed and hybrid. Average body weights of white <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> at the 6 th, 12 th and 16 th week were 430, 890 and 1 130 g, respectively (Anonymous, 2003).

40|$|ABSTRACT With an {{increasing}} concern on laying hen welfare, barn system has appeared {{as one of}} the alternatives to replace the conventional cage. This study was conducted to compare the early laying performance and egg quality at the barn system with those at the conventional cage. A total of 288 shaver- 579 brown layers were used for 9 weeks (21 st to 30 th weeks of age) feeding study. Feed consumption and egg weight were significantly (P< 0. 01) higher at barn than at cage. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between two housing systems on hen day egg production (HDEP), egg mass, body weight, feed efficiency and livability. In case of egg quality parameters, shell thickness, albumen height and Haugh unit were significantly (P< 0. 05) different between two systems. Haugh unit and albumen height were significantly higher in eggs produced at cage (88. 97 and 8. 16 mm) compared than those produced at barn (83. 11 and 6. 87 mm), whereas shell thickness was thicker in eggs produced at barn than those produced at cage. Shape index, breaking strength, blood spots and yolk index data were not influenced significantly by the types of housing system. To implement welfare bestowing production, this study showed that the barn system can replace the conventional cage without serious sacrifices on starting phase egg production. In addition, this study suggested that the barn system need to be optimized in view of daily feed consumption.

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding {{three types of}} cereal grain (wheat, {{triticale}} or rye) and soyabean oil (0 or 20 g/kg) over a 12 -week period on the production, yolk cholesterol and yolk fatty acid concentrations of three strains of <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> were studied. 2. Pullets fed on wheat- or triticale-based diets had higher body weight gains, egg productions, egg weights, egg mass and lower yolk cholesterol concentrations than pullets fed on rye-based diets. However, {{there were no significant}} differences between the cereals in yolk cholesterol content. 3. There were no significant differences between the three cereals in total food consumption of pullets nor of yolk weight nor yolk concentration of palmitic, stearic and oleic acids. 4. Pullets fed on triticale-based diets had higher yolk linoleic acid concentrations and lower yolk oleic acid: linoleic acid ratios than pullets fed on rye- or wheat-based diets. 5. Soyabean oil supplementation increased egg production, egg mass, yolk linoleic concentration and yolk unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio, but reduced yolk oleic acid: linoleic acid ratio. 6. There were differences between strains of pullets in weight gain, food consumption, rate of lay, egg weight and yolk cholesterol, but not in yolk fatty acid concentrations. 7. It was concluded that wheat- or triticale-based diets gave good production of eggs of lower cholesterol content, that soyabean oil supplementation gave eggs with a high unsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratio and that two strains of layers produced eggs with lower yolk cholesterol concentrations than a third strai...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of feed form and energy {{concentration of the}} diet on growth performance {{and the development of}} the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was studied in brown-egg <b>laying</b> <b>pullets.</b> Diets formed a 2 x 5 factorial with 2 feed forms (mash vs. crumbles) and 5 levels of energy differing in 50 kcal AMEn/kg. For the entire study (0 to 17 [*]wk of age) feeding crumbles increased ADFI (52. 9 vs. 49. 7 g; P[*] [*] 0. 05) by energy content of the diet. At 5, 10, and 17 [*]wk of age, the relative weight (RW, % BW) of the GIT and the gizzard, and gizzard digesta content were lower (P[*]<[*] 0. 05 to P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and gizzard pH was higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 05 to P[*]<[*] 0. 001) in pullets fed crumbles than in pullets fed mash. Energy concentration of the diet did not affect any of the GIT variables studied. In summary, feeding crumbles improved pullet performance and reduced the RW of the GIT and gizzard, and increased gizzard pH at all ages. An increase in the energy content of the diet improved FCR from 0 to 17 [*]wk of age. The use of crumbles and the increase in the AMEn content of the diet might be used adventageously when the objetive is to increase the BW of the pullets. However, crumbles affected the development and weight of the organs of the GIT, which might have negative effects on feed intake and egg production {{at the beginning of the}} egg laying cycle...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work was}} aimed to {{investigate}} the effect of leafy materials and vegetable residues on performance and egg quality of commercial layers. Six dietary additives were prepared from leafy materials and vegetable residues namely:- carrot (fresh, dried and leaves), onion, alfalfa and jew’s mallow. Each of the prepared six dietary additives were added at 5 % level to a basil diet {{to come up with}} six dietary treatments plus a control diet. The nutrient content of the formulated dietary treatments and the control diet were based on the NRC (1984) recommendations. With respect of the experimental birds, 84 of 32 weeks old <b>laying</b> <b>pullets</b> of white Hi-sex breed were purchased and evenly distributed (3 pullets/cage) into 28 layer cages. A replicate group of 4 cages that accommodated the birds were randomly assigned to each of the 7 experimental diets and hence the experiment commence. The experiment lasted for 12 weeks during which water and feed were provided adlib and the following measured parameters were determined: body weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, egg production, egg weight, shell thickness, Haugh units and mortality rate. Regarding the obtained results, no significant differences were encountered among the seven dietary treatments for egg production, feed intake, feed conversion ratio, average egg weight and the final live body weight changes throughout the experimental period. Nevertheless, the overall obtained data revealed that leafy materials improved the quality of the produced egg. Fresh carrot and jew’s mallow meal were outweighing in coloring the yolk and significant in shell thickness (P< 0. 001) as compared with the other experimental diets. On the basis of the demonstrated results, one may conclude that incorporation of the leafy materials and vegetable residues as dietary supplements can improve the performance and egg quality of the commercial layer...|$|R
