40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new model}} for estimating optical flow based on the motion of planar regions plus <b>local</b> <b>deformations.</b> The approach exploits brightness information to organize and constrain {{the interpretation of the}} motion by using segmented regions of piecewise smooth brightness to hypothesize planar regions in the scene. Parametric flow models are estimated in these regions in a two step process which first computes a coarse fit and estimates the appropriate parameterization of the motion of the region (two, six, or eight parameters). The initial fit is refined using a generalization of the standard area-based regression approaches. Since the assumption of planarity is likely to be violated, we allow <b>local</b> <b>deformations</b> from the planar assumption in the same spirit as physically-based approaches which model shape using coarse parametric models plus <b>local</b> <b>deformations.</b> This parametric+deformation model exploits the strong constraints of parametric approaches while retaining the ada [...] ...|$|R

50|$|As {{is true of}} all materials, {{regions of}} {{graphene}} are subject to thermal and quantum fluctuations in relative displacement. Although the amplitude of these fluctuations is bounded in 3D structures (even {{in the limit of}} infinite size), the Mermin-Wagner theorem shows that the amplitude of long-wavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size. <b>Local</b> <b>deformation</b> and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this long-range divergence in relative displacement. It is believed that a sufficiently large 2D structure, in the absence of applied lateral tension, will bend and crumple to form a fluctuating 3D structure. Researchers have observed ripples in suspended layers of graphene. It has been proposed that the ripples are caused by thermal fluctuations in the material. As a consequence of these dynamical deformations, it is debatable whether graphene is truly a 2D structure. It has recently been shown that these ripples, if amplified through the introduction of vacancy defects, can impart a negative Poisson's ratio into graphene, resulting in the thinnest auxetic material known.|$|E
