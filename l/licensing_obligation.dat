Ofcom’s proposal reflects some tensions in the electronic communications sector which are in part the consequence of the choice made in 2002 to exclude television content from {{the scope of the}} Regulatory Framework adopted at the Community level. The British regulator proposes a solution based on the imposition of a compulsory <b>licensing</b> <b>obligation</b> on BSkyB—the leading supplier of pay television services in the UK. In essence, this approach amounts to extending to premium television content the mandated access regime that currently applies to the telecommunications infrastructure under the Regulatory Framework. The present piece provides a critical account of the regulatory proposal and details some reasons why this move may not be justified.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is limited to {{defining}} the differences of the functions and of the operation of compulsory licences, which typically are available under patent law, on one hand, or, on the other, are imposed {{as a matter of}} enforcing the antitrust laws. The thesis of this contribution is that each of patent law’s compulsory licensing rules does (and ought to) follow its own distinct rationale. Their common denominator is that they are specific to the systematic operation of patent protection as an incentive mechanism for innovation. By contrast, competition law constitutes part of the framework regulation of the market. Where its application results in imposing <b>licensing</b> <b>obligations</b> on patentees, it does so in order to correct an unjustified restriction of competition. This remedial function of antitrust-related <b>licensing</b> <b>obligations</b> is complementary to but different from patent law’s rules on compulsory licensing. The different functions of system-supportive or system-intrinsic mandatory licensing rules and competition-related obligations also mean that before introducing new or broadening existing provisions on compulsory licences a proper diagnosis has to be made of the ill that they are supposed to cure...|$|R

40|$|Patent trolls are categorically demonized as {{threatening}} American innovation and industry. But {{whether they are}} a threat that antitrust law is {{equipped to deal with}} is a complex question that depends on the particular type of patent troll and activities they engage in. This Article looks specifically at privateer patent trolls: entities that acquire their patents from operating entities and assert them against other industry members. In the particular context of privateering, antitrust law is almost certainly not the proper legal solution. Privateering does raise significant issues: circumventing litigation constraints, evading <b>licensing</b> <b>obligations,</b> and raising the cost and frequency of patent assertions. Nevertheless, there are clear doctrinal and practical roadblocks to leveraging antitrust law to police privateering activity generally, and there exist readily available alternative regimes that are more naturally suited to the task. Antitrust law’s role in governing privateering activity should instead be more narrowly guided by its unique strengths, such as limiting collusive behavior...|$|R

40|$|Prospects {{for rural}} {{telecommunications}} development Most of {{the populations of}} developing countries live in rural and often isolated areas. Access to information and telecommunications is essential for development of such areas but is still inadequate or non-existing in many developing countries. Two major reasons for the this are the perceived lack of profitability of rural telecommunications {{and the lack of}} appropriate policies and strategies to provide Universal Access. People in rural areas are generally poor and few people can afford telecommunication services. This is a vicious circle- few potential customers means high price (if cost based), which further reduces the number of potential customers, and so on. New wireless technologies offer more cost-effective solutions. However, often, the incumbent telecom operator hardly has the capital required for investment in infrastructure to meet needs in more profitable urban areas and there are policy and regulatory barriers for new entrants, who might be willing to invest in rural telecommunications. Many developing countries are {{now in the process of}} developing policies to improve telecom penetration in rural areas.

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{approach to}} free/open source software and licenses {{has been that}} each system is developed, distributed, and used {{under the terms of}} a single license. But it is increasingly common for information systems and other software to be composed with components from a variety of sources, and with a diversity of licenses. This may result in possible license conflicts and organizational liability for failure to fulfill <b>license</b> <b>obligations.</b> Research and practice to date have not kept up with this sea-change in software licensing arising from free/open source software development. System consumers and users consequently rely on ad hoc heuristics (or costly legal advice) to determine which <b>license</b> rights and <b>obligations</b> are in effect, often with less than optimal results; consulting services are offered to identify unknowing unauthorized use of licensed software in information systems; and researchers have shown how the choice of a (single) specific license for a product affects project success and system adoption. Legal scholars have examined how pairs of software licenses conflict but only in simple contexts. We present an approach for understanding and modeling software licenses, as well as for analyzing conflicts among groups of licenses in realistic system contexts, and for guiding the acquisition, integration, or development of systems with free/open source components in such an environment. This work is based on an empirical analysis of representative software licenses and of heterogeneously-licensed systems.

40|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the Swedish Telecom {{regulator}} “Post&Telestyrelsen” (PTS) granted in a “beauty contest” four licenses for operation of 3 G mobile networks.

40|$|It is the {{standard}} view in the United States that U. S. antitrust law does not reach acts of exploitation by a monopolist, particularly monopoly pricing (“rent extraction”). Even more so for intellectual property, where U. S. courts have emphasized the right of an intellectual property right holder to raise prices and exploit its rights to the fullest, constrained only by market demand. Competition law {{in the rest of}} the world appears to be otherwise, however, with many countries generally condemning excessive high prices by dominant firms, even if often reluctant to invoke such provisions in practice. Despite apparent differences in legal approaches, current enforcement practice worldwide with regard to price-raising exploitation of intellectual property rights by monopolists shows a uniform willingness to condemn such conduct as anticompetitive. This paper describes this concern for exploitation, focusing on competition law enforcement in the United States, China, Europe, Japan, and Korea in three substantive areas: patents subject to FRAND <b>licensing</b> <b>obligations,</b> disclosure requirements imposed on patent holders with monopoly power to prevent them from exploiting licensees or potential licensees, and post-expiration royalties. This paper argues that this concern for exploitative behavior is consistent with sound competition policy. Preventing the undue exploitation of intellectual property rights is an important aspect of economizing on the reward we give to incentivize innovation. Antitrust has traditionally favored placing some limits on intellectual property rights and placing greater reliance on the incentives for innovation that competitive markets can provide...|$|R

The majority of embedded generation {{are expected to be}} renewables that have intermittent nature with poor persistence. This would pose serious problem to the security and quality of supply that distribution network operators (DNOs) have <b>license</b> <b>obligation</b> to comply, (distribution network operators do not generally hold reserve, but take load shedding as the consequential action of not sufficient reserve). Existing solutions include: 1) Backing up intermittent generation by partially loaded plant or storage devices, they tend to be expensive and well research; 2) better managing demand so that they can follow changing patterns of generation. Demand side management is an old topic, traditionally they are used to smooth demand curve to maximise the efficiency of conventional generation where they can be controllable and predictable. As the characteristic of future generation changes, new demand side mechanism needs to be sought, allowing the demand to follow the intermittent generation and {{is the subject of this}} research. The paper firstly looks into the potential demand manipulation that can be achieved from existing control mechanism and its associated value to the security of supply The paper then investigates the potential contribution to network security from greater demand side management and the requirement for additional control mechanism to achieve the full potential d benefit. Finally, the benefits to the system security will be quantified to a system with varying degree of intermittent generation...|$|R
40|$|Litigation {{concerning}} standards-essential patents (SEPs) {{has become}} increasingly global, with parallel litigation occurring over the same issues in multiple jurisdictions throughout North America, Europe and Asia. As a result, litigants have sought mechanisms to coordinate these actions both to manage costs and to avoid inconsistent and incompatible results. One little-known procedural mechanism {{that has long been}} available to manage multi-jurisdictional litigation, and which is growing in popularity in SEP disputes, is the anti-suit injunction. An anti-suit injunction is an interlocutory remedy issued by a court in one jurisdiction which prohibits a litigant from initiating or continuing parallel litigation in another jurisdiction or jurisdictions. Anti-suit injunctions thus contain litigation costs and reduce the likelihood of inconsistent results by ensuring that issues are resolved in one jurisdiction before they are litigated elsewhere. In the standards context, anti-suit injunctions can be particularly powerful tools for prospective licensees alleging that SEP holders have failed to comply with their FRAND <b>licensing</b> <b>obligations.</b> Specifically, a court reviewing a SEP holder’s compliance with a FRAND licensing commitment may issue an anti-suit injunction to prevent the SEP holder from bringing foreign patent infringement claims (including injunctions against the sale of infringing products) until the FRAND licensing dispute has been resolved in the issuing jurisdiction. This chapter discusses the historical development and procedural requirements for anti-suit injunctions in both the United States and Europe. It also reviews recent SEP cases in which anti-suit injunctions have been granted, including Microsoft v. Motorola, Vringo v. ZTE and TCL v. Ericsson...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a dearth}} of {{decision-support}} models or frameworks to aid managers in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry in uniformly assessing the key factors {{in the decision to}} standardize innovative technologies. Making the proper decision is consequential and potentially fraught with risks for the firm such as competitive exposure, high expenditures with inadequate returns, restrictive inbound or outbound patent <b>licensing</b> <b>obligations,</b> and related complications. This study presents a framework to guide managers in the ICT industry in assessing the factors that inform the decision to participate in the development of technology standards. Using multi-criteria decision analysis and judgment data from panels of experts, a robust model is developed that comprehends the essential criteria and outcomes within the context of computer interconnect technologies. The resultant, generalizable model is validated against the case of the extant Universal Serial Bus (USB) interconnect standard and found to be congruent with the assessment of the experts. Scholarship on technology standards development is rich and multifaceted [...] spanning numerous streams of inquiry. This research contextualizes technology standardization within the economic, strategic, organizational, and legal perspectives. The resultant model demonstrates that strategic planning is regarded by the experts as the principal driver in the decision to participate in a technology standardization effort. Furthermore, the primacy of commitment and leadership within the standards-setting organization is unambiguously established through rigorous quantitative analysis. The proposed model verifies that the firm 2 ̆ 7 s desire to align its product roadmap to the emerging standard is the chief criterion in the decision to contribute to the standards development effort. Other criteria of high interest include the leveraging of network externalities to glean disruptive trends within the ecosystem, the exploration of opportunities to expand the total available market for the firm, and the availability and terms of IP licenses. Sensitivity analysis affirms the overall predictive strength and robustness of the model and its widespread applicability. Future research on model expansion and application to other technologies, as well as the development of uniform patent valuation methods will further enrich the knowledge base...|$|R
