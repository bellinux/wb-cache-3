50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> in the <b>fuel</b> tank. Moving the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> to {{the interior of the}} tank helps prevent vapor lock, since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapor lock is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carbureted engines are retrofitted with an electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> near the <b>fuel</b> tank.|$|R

50|$|In the APU, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{boosted the}} {{hydrazine}} pressure and fed it to a gas generator.

The gearbox drove the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump.

Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R

For this purpose, we have designed and manufactured a 5 -layer heat exchanger from aluminum sheet. Electrical energy generated by the TEG was then used to produce hydrogen in a PEM water electrolyzer. The experiment was conducted at a stoichiometric mixture ratio, 1 / 2 throttle position and six different engine speeds at 1800 - 4000 rpm. The {{results of this study}} show that the configuration of 5 -layer counterflow produce a higher TEG output power than 5 -layer parallel flow and 3 -layer counterflow.
