5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife they seem relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation <b>looks</b> <b>about</b> as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
500|$|Another {{orthopteran}} {{is found}} in Rachel Ruysch's still life Flowers in a Vase, c. 1685. The seemingly static scene is animated by a [...] "grasshopper on the table that <b>looks</b> <b>about</b> ready to spring", according to the gallery curator Betsy Wieseman, with other invertebrates including a spider, an ant, and two caterpillars.|$|E

Parsifal baptizes the weeping Kundry. Tolling bells are heard in the distance. Gurnemanz says [...] "Midday: the hour has come. My lord, permit your servant to guide you!"

500|$|Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities: Nicolay {{tending to}} assist Lincoln {{in his office}} and in meetings, while Hay dealt with the correspondence, which was very large. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with his charm, escaped much of the hard {{feelings}} from those denied Lincoln's presence. Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as [...] "a nice young fellow, who unfortunately <b>looks</b> <b>about</b> seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy". Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union. Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a [...] "White House propagandist", in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Manassas in July 1861.|$|E
500|$|Although by {{the early}} 1960s Levin was {{becoming}} a well-known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: [...] "He <b>looks</b> <b>about</b> sixteen, and at first I thought he was someone’s little boy brought along to see the fun – very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to". In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues to camera about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as [...] "a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water.|$|E

2500|$|The {{whole problem}} of {{knowledge}} has constantly been that {{of bringing the}} one and the many together. When man <b>looks</b> <b>about</b> him and within him, he sees {{that there is a}} great variety of facts. The question that comes up at once is whether there is any unity in this variety, whether there is one principle in accordance with which all these many things appear and occur. All non-Christian thought, if it has utilized the idea of a supra-mundane existence at all, has used this supra-mundane existence as furnishing only the unity or the a priori aspect of knowledge, while it has maintained that the a posteriori aspect of knowledge is something that is furnished by the universe.|$|E
2500|$|... is an {{artificial}} intelligence owned by Hitoshi Sora as the automatic pilot of his spaceship. Her first appearance has her in disembodied form as the navigator of Hitoshi's ship {{and she is}} responsible for the crash landing on Earth and for killing Hazumu. When Hitoshi comes to Earth to live in Hazumu's house, he constructs a gynoid modeled after Hazumu's own new female body, so Jan Pu <b>looks</b> <b>about</b> the same age as Hazumu, and their faces bear a striking resemblance. Jan Pu has the unique ability of levitation, and is able to bend light around her so others cannot see her. Other than technically being {{an artificial}} being, she generally acts like a human child due to being enthusiastic about meeting new people and possessing little to no social skills for a girl who looks to be the age of seventeen. At home, Hazumu and Jan Pu have been known to take baths together and they sleep together in the same bed every night. Additionally, Jan Pu can eat and finds curry to be delicious. Hazumu's parents take an instant liking to Jan Pu since now they have two girls to dress up and take pictures of. When Jan Pu meets Hazumu's friends for the first time, she is introduced as Hazumu's cousin. Jan Pu loves Hazumu very much, and Hitoshi even had to give her a definition for [...] "love" [...] once she came to Earth in order to describe the emotion she was feeling for Hazumu. She addresses Hazumu as , and often says the nonsensical word [...] "pū" [...] during exclamations of emotion.|$|E
