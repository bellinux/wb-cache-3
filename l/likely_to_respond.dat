5|$|Munir Sheikh, Canada's Chief Statistician {{appointed}} on Harper's advice, resigned on July 21, 2010, {{in protest}} of the government's change in policy. Ivan Fellegi, the former Chief Statistician of Canada, criticized the government's decision, saying {{that those who are}} most vulnerable (such as the poor, new immigrants, and aboriginals) are least <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to a voluntary form, which weakens information about their demographic.|$|E
5|$|The use of interferon, which {{requires}} injections daily or thrice weekly, has been supplanted by long-acting PEGylated interferon, which is injected only once weekly. However, some individuals {{are much more}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> than others, and this might be because of the genotype of the infecting virus or the person's heredity. The treatment reduces viral replication in the liver, thereby reducing the viral load (the amount of virus particles as measured in the blood). Response to treatment differs between the genotypes. Interferon treatment may produce an e antigen seroconversion rate of 37% in genotype A but only a 6% seroconversion in type D. Genotype B has similar seroconversion rates to type A while type C seroconverts only in 15% of cases. Sustained e antigen loss after treatment is ~45% in types A and B but only 25–30% in types C and D.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{problems}} with joint attention are associated with developmental processes. Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. Autism spectrum disorders). A core deficit noted in autism is eye gaze. Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object. This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention. Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents. Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts. Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention. Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital. Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of social competence. Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age. In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion ΔveEtCO 2 {{outperformed}} ΔvePP, ΔveSBP, ΔveMBP, ΔveFemFlow and ΔveHR, and, in case {{of protective}} ventilation and/or arrhythmia, also outperformed ΔvePPV. ΔVEEtCO 2  >  1  mmHg indicates that the patient is very <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>responded</b> <b>to</b> VE.|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{spread of}} HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa {{is both a}} cause and a {{consequence}} of poverty. But {{while there is a}} clear link between AIDS and economic insecurity, {{there is no evidence of}} a connection between AIDS and security understood in the policing/state security sense of the term. Orphans are a human tragedy but not a direct security threat. AIDS does not appear to be high on the list of political priorities for most Southern Africans. Governments are thus <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> the epidemic unevenly and with limited resources...|$|R
25|$|In many cultures, {{inability}} to conceive bears a stigma. In closed social groups, {{a degree of}} rejection (or {{a sense of being}} rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment. Some respond by actively avoiding the issue altogether; middle-class men are the most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> in this way.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{expression}} of QSER1 {{is seen in}} multiple cancer conditions. Over{{expression of}} QSER1 was noted in Burkitt’s Lymphoma. QSER1 expression also increases with increasing Gleason score (more advanced stages) of prostate cancer. In a study on breast cancer response to paclitaxel and fluorouracil‐doxorubicin‐cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, {{it was noted that}} breast cancer lines with higher levels of QSER1 were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to treatment than those with underexpression of QSER1.|$|E
25|$|SSRIs are a second-line {{treatment}} of adult obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first-line treatment {{for those with}} moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs {{can be considered as}} a second-line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects. SSRIs are efficacious in the {{treatment of}} OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to treatment as those treated with placebo. Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term treatment trials of 6 to 24 weeks and in discontinuation trials of 28 to 52 weeks duration.|$|E

25|$|According to Strauss and Howe, {{there are}} many {{potential}} threats that could feed {{a growing sense of}} public urgency as the Fourth Turning progresses, including a terrorist attack, a financial collapse, a major war, a crisis of nuclear proliferation, an environmental crisis, an energy shortage, or new civil wars. The generational cycle cannot explain the role or timing of these individual threats. Nor can it account for the great events of history, like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Kennedy’s assassination, or 9/11. What the generational cycle can do, according to Strauss and Howe, is explain how society is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to these events in different eras. It is the response, not the initial event, which defines an era according to the theory. According to Strauss and Howe, the crisis period lasts for approximately 20 years.|$|E
25|$|While the genders {{engage in}} IPV at about equal rates, females {{are more likely}} to use less {{dangerous}} forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males {{are more likely to}} punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males {{are also more likely to}} use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV. Along with form, motivations for violence also vary by gender: females are likely to perpetrate violence in self-defense, while males are likely to perpetrate violence to exert power or control. The self-defense aspect is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.|$|E
500|$|Music critic Dave Marsh {{described}} Disco Demolition Night as [...] "your most paranoid fantasy {{about where}} the ethnic cleansing of the rock radio could ultimately lead." [...] Marsh, who wrote for Rolling Stone, was one who, at the time, deemed the event an expression of bigotry, writing in a year-end 1979 feature that [...] "white males, eighteen to thirty-four {{are the most likely}} to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks, and Latins, and therefore they're the most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security. It goes almost without saying that such appeals are racist and sexist, but broadcasting has never been an especially civil-libertarian medium." ...|$|E
50|$|Julia Serano {{notes that}} {{masculine}} {{girls and women}} face much less social disapproval than feminine boys and men, which she attributes to sexism. Serano argues that women wanting to be like men {{is consistent with the}} idea that maleness is more valued in contemporary culture than femaleness, whereas men being willing to give up masculinity in favour of femininity directly threatens the notion of male superiority as well as the idea that men and women should be opposites. To support her thesis, Serano cites the far greater public scrutiny and disdain experienced by male-to-female cross-dressers compared with that faced by women who dress in masculine clothes, as well as research showing that parents are <b>likelier</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> negatively <b>to</b> sons who like Barbie dolls and ballet or wear nail polish than they are to daughters exhibiting comparably masculine behaviours.|$|R
50|$|Another use of {{biomarkers}} {{in cancer}} medicine is for disease prognosis, which take place after {{an individual has}} been diagnosed with cancer. Here biomarkers {{can be useful in}} determining the aggressiveness of an identified cancer as well as its likelihood of <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> a given treatment. In part, this is because tumors exhibiting particular biomarkers may be responsive to treatments tied to that biomarker's expression or presence. Examples of such prognostic biomarkers include elevated levels of metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), a marker associated with more aggressive forms of multiple myeloma, elevated estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) expression, markers associated with better overall survival in patients with breast cancer; HER2/neu gene amplification, a marker indicating a breast cancer will <b>likely</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> trastuzumab treatment; a mutation in exon 11 of the proto-oncogene c-KIT, a marker indicating a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) will <b>likely</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> imatinib treatment; and mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR1, a marker indicating a patient's non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) will <b>likely</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> gefitinib or erlotinib treatment.|$|R
50|$|The younger the child, {{the more}} exaggerated the adult's CDS is.

500|$|Because {{laboratory}} mice (house mice) {{and rats}} (brown rats) {{are widely used}} as scientific models to further our understanding of biology, a great deal {{has come to be}} known about their cognitive capacities. Brown rats exhibit cognitive bias, where information processing is biased by whether they are in a positive or negative affective state. For example, laboratory rats trained to respond to a specific tone by pressing a lever to receive a reward, and to press another lever in response to a different tone so as to avoid receiving an electric shock, are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to an intermediate tone by choosing the reward lever if they have just been tickled (something they enjoy), indicating [...] "a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model." ...|$|E
500|$|Accounting ethics {{has been}} deemed {{difficult}} to control as accountants and auditors must consider {{the interest of the}} public (which relies on the information gathered in audits) while ensuring that they remained employed by the company they are auditing. They must consider how to best apply accounting standards even when faced with issues that could cause a company to face a significant loss or even be discontinued. Due to several accounting scandals within the profession, critics of accountants have stated that when asked by a client [...] "what does two plus two equal?" [...] the accountant would be <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> [...] "what would you like it to be?". This thought process along with other criticisms of the profession's issues with conflict of interest, have led to various increased standards of professionalism while stressing ethics in the work environment.|$|E
2500|$|In cancer treatment, {{pharmacogenomics}} {{tests are}} used to identify which patients are most <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to certain cancer drugs. In behavioral health, pharmacogenomic tests provide tools for physicians and care givers to better manage medication selection and side effect amelioration. Pharmacogenomics {{is also known as}} companion diagnostics, meaning tests being bundled with drugs. Examples include KRAS test with cetuximab and EGFR test with gefitinib. Beside efficacy, germline pharmacogenetics can help to identify patients likely to undergo severe toxicities when given cytotoxics [...] showing impaired detoxification in relation with genetic polymorphism, such as canonical 5-FU.|$|E
40|$|Adult {{members who}} {{declined}} participation in cardiovascular disease risk factor screenings offered at religious organizations {{were randomly selected}} and asked to participate in screenings at their homes. Relationships between screening participation and sociodemographic, behavioral, and physiological measures were examined. Age, knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk factors, body mass index, current smoking status, previous report of elevated blood pressure, current diastolic blood pressure measurement, frequency of worship service attendance, and residential distance from the religious organization screening site were important predictors of screening response. Those with conspicuous risk factors appeared less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> initially <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> religious organization site screening invitations...|$|R
50|$|Women {{are more}} <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> {{music in a}} more {{emotional}} way. Furthermore, females prefer popular music more than males. In a study of personality and gender in preference for exaggerated bass in music, researchers found that males demonstrated more of a preference for bass music than females. This preference for bass music is also correlated with antisocial and borderline personalities.|$|R
30|$|Ewing et al. (2015) {{showed that}} the overall pattern of the dunes’ {{morphology}} indicates that the dunes are in long-term equilibrium [14]. As large, longitudinal dunes, they <b>likely</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> long-timescale forcing [14]. At the same time, the persistence of sand-free interdunes indicates that the dunes are presently active [9].|$|R
2500|$|Interferon-alpha {{works by}} {{sensitizing}} the hairy cells {{to the killing}} effect {{of the immune system}} hormone TNF-alpha, whose production it promotes. [...] IFN-alpha works best on classic hairy cells that are not protectively adhered to vitronectin or fibronectin, which suggests that patients who encounter less fibrous tissue in their bone marrow biopsies may be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to Interferon-alpha therapy. [...] It also explains why non-adhered hairy cells, such as those in the bloodstream, disappear during IFN-alpha treatment well before reductions are seen in adhered hairy cells, such as those in the bone marrow and spleen.|$|E
2500|$|EGFR-TKI's {{have been}} found to be active against {{variants}} exhibiting certain mutations in the EGFR gene. While EGFR mutations are very rare (<5%) in [...] "pure" [...] SCLC, they are considerably more common (about 15–20%) in c-SCLC, particularly in non-smoking females whose c-SCLC tumors contain an adenocarcinoma component. These patients are much more likely to have classical EGFR mutations in the small cell component of their tumors as well, and their tumors seem to be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to treatment with EGFR-TKI's. EGFR-targeted agents appear particularly effective in papillary adenocarcinoma, non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{treatment}} involves addressing any existing {{infections that}} may have occurred due to the broken state of the skin. Existing wounds are treated with warm compresses, non-adherent (non-stick) dressing, and topical antibiotic ointment. Immunosuppressive agents are administered in attempt to decrease blistering; this is not often effective. The first medication given aiming to heal the wounds are high dose corticosteroids. This is followed by steroid sparing agents [...] which may reduce steroid intake and therefore lessen the side effects. Skin lesions are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to this line of treatment than mucosal lesions. However, {{a high level of}} caution is advised in patients with a confirmed malignancy, where immunosuppression is vital and dictates treatment options. If the initial therapy fails to control the symptoms of PNP, and the condition of the patient deteriorates, a more aggressive approach may be necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Alcohol myopia causes {{individuals}} to become increasingly aware of sexual arousal and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> rashly to the arousal stimulus. The decision {{about how to}} respond to sexual arousal involves cognitive function that synthesizes both impelling cues (those that draw attention to the benefits of an action) and inhibiting cues (those that focus on the consequences of an action). The alcohol myopia theory suggests that intoxicated individuals {{will be more likely to}} engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males subject to high levels of sexual arousal were more likely to engage in unprotected sex [...] than sober males subject to the same levels of arousal. [...] This is because the impelling cues (sexual arousal) are often more imminent than inhibitory cues (safety precautions), and those affected by alcohol myopia are limited to cognitive processing of the more immediate cues and often ignore the inhibitory cues.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to test the effects of alcohol on the intensity of males’ aggressive response to external stimuli, demonstrating the role of inhibition conflict on alcohol myopia. Male subjects {{under the influence of}} alcohol often ignored external cues, both in laboratory settings and in real life situations. In the lab patients who were given alcohol were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to unpleasant tones (external stimuli) violently, despite internal cues advising them against aggression. Surveys conducted also demonstrated that while intoxicated men are more likely to address the salient cue of anger with aggressive behavior towards their partners. [...] The results of these studies demonstrate men experiencing the effects of alcohol myopia were unable to process the consequences of their actions, and continued to act aggressively despite consequences. Alcohol had effectively limited their interpretation of salient cues and prevented them from interpreting cues that would inhibit aggressive action.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 study, {{variations}} on the COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) gene related to dopamine release {{are found to be}} critical in the placebo effect among the patients with irritable bowel syndrome participating in the trial, a research group in Harvard Medical School reported. [...] Patients with a variation of met/met, for having two copies of the methionine allele were shown to be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to the placebo treatment, while the variation of val/val, for their two copies of valine allele responded the least. [...] The response of patients with one copy each of methionine and valine fell in the middle. [...] Release of dopamine in patients with the met/met variations is thought to link to reward and 'confirmation bias' which enhance the sense that the treatment is working. [...] The role of the COMT gene variations are expected to be more prominent in studies where patients report more subjective conditions such as pain and fatigue rather than objective physiological measurements.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} {{to one of}} the disadvantages of Motivator-Hygiene Theory, Job Characteristics Theory added an individual difference factor into the model. While Herzberg et al. took into account the importance of intrinsically and extrinsically motivating job characteristics there was no consideration of individual differences. The importance of individual differences had been demonstrated by previous work showing that some individuals are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> positively <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> an enriched job environment than others. Thus, the original version of the theory posits an individual difference characteristic, Growth Need Strength (GNS), that moderates the effect of the core job characteristics on outcomes. Jobholders with high Growth Need Strength should <b>respond</b> more positively <b>to</b> the opportunities provided by jobs with high levels of the five core characteristics compared to low GNS jobholders.|$|R

In an interview with The Lighthouse Electronic Magazine in April 1996, he said:You know, the thing I like about Awesome God is that it's one of the worst-written songs that I ever wrote; it's just poorly crafted. But the thing is that sometimes, I think, that when you become too conscientious about being a songwriter, the message becomes a vehicle for the medium. This is a temptation that I think all songwriters have.
