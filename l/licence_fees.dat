5|$|A further {{example of}} an {{executive}} decision invalidated by improper purpose {{can be seen from}} Congreve v. Home Office (1976). In that case, the Home Secretary, who had the power to revoke television licences, purported to revoke the licences of people who had pre-empted a rise in <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> by buying a licence at the old rate before the date when the fees were due to go up, even though their old licences had not yet expired. The court held that this was an improper exercise of the Home Secretary's discretionary powers. His power to revoke could not be used to raise revenue, and therefore this power had been used for the wrong purpose.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, the {{licensing}} system was changed. The Postmaster-General's Department collected all <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> and broadcasters were funded as either A-Class or B-Class stations. A-Class stations received government funding {{and were able}} to take limited advertising, while B-Class stations received no government funding but could carry more advertising. By 1925 many of the A-Class stations were in financial difficulty.|$|E

25|$|Until 1948, the ABC {{was funded}} {{directly}} by radio licence fees; amendments were also {{made to the}} Australian Broadcasting Act that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. <b>Licence</b> <b>fees</b> remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the Whitlam Labor government, {{on the basis that}} the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|A 1927 Royal Commission into {{wireless}} broadcasting {{recommended that}} radio <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> be pooled to fund larger A-Class stations. The government established the National Broadcasting Service {{to take over}} the 12 A-Class licences as they came up for renewal from 1928. The original legislation permitted advertising, but this was removed from the Act before it came into effect. At the same time, the government created the Australian Broadcasting Company to supply programs to the new national broadcaster.|$|E
25|$|The Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960–2002 {{established}} {{the public sector}} broadcaster, Raidió Teilifís Éireann. RTÉ is financed by a mixture of <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> paid by owners of television receivers, and advertising revenues. It is governed by a statutory authority appointed by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

50|$|The {{level of}} the fee is decided {{following}} periodic negotiations between the UK Government and the BBC Trust. From 1988 to 2010, the <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> was increased annually each April Before 1988, increases in the <b>licence</b> <b>fee</b> happened at irregular intervals, sometimes a few years passing between changes.

25|$|The radio {{regulation}} functions {{were transferred}} to the Independent Broadcasting Authority and later Ofcom. Due to its regulatory role, {{as well as its}} expertise in developing long-distance communication networks, the GPO was contracted by the BBC, and the ITA in the 1950s and 60s, to develop and extend their television networks. A network of transmitters was built, connected at first by cable, and later by microwave radio links. The Post Office also took responsibility for the issuing of television <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> (and radio, until 1971), and the prosecution of evaders until 1991.|$|E
25|$|Putting on {{shows is}} costly to venues as well, due to theatre <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> which by 2009 had risen 800% in the {{preceding}} three years, and were eight times as high as fees in English cities, starting at £824 for a venue of up to 200 people and rising to £2,472 for a venue of up to 5,000 people. These fees have been cited as punitive to smaller venues and site-specific performances by such figures as Julian Caddy, which in 2009 featured site-specific shows in such venues as Inchcolm island and a swimming pool at the Apex International Hotel.|$|E

He recalled generally positive but occasionally conflicting relationships with Indigenous Australians, {{and was the first}} trepanger to pay the South Australian government trepanging licence in 1883, an impost that made the trade less viable. The trade continued to dwindle {{toward the end of the}} 19th century due to the imposition of customs duties and <b>licence</b> <b>fees.</b> This decline was probably compounded by overfishing.

25|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is Australia's {{national}} broadcaster, {{funded by}} Australian taxpayers but specifically independent of Government {{and politics in}} the Commonwealth. The ABC plays {{a leading role in}} journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in Australia, its model based on – but not restricted to – the BBC in the United Kingdom. Originally financed in a similar method to the British model using consumer <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> on broadcasting receivers, its funding evolved to a projected model approved by the Australian Parliament. In recent times, the Corporation provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, as well as overseas through Australia Plus and Radio Australia.|$|E
25|$|This was {{a gateway}} to many foreign investors to get entry into the Indian Telecom Markets. After March 2000, the {{government}} became more liberal in making policies and issuing licences to private operators. The government further reduced <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> for cellular service providers and increased the allowable stake to 74% for foreign companies. Because of all these factors, the service fees finally reduced and the call costs were cut greatly enabling every common middle-class family in India to afford a cell phone. Nearly 32 million handsets were sold in India. The data reveals the real potential for growth of the Indian mobile market. Many private operators, such as Reliance Communications, Jio, Tata Indicom, Vodafone, Loop Mobile, Airtel, Idea etc., successfully entered the high potential Indian telecom market.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the fee was {{increased}} to S$5, but in 1989 it was reduced back to S$3, {{due to the}} fact that now more vehicles were paying. In 1994, two levels of <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> were established, to differentiate between daily permits and inter-peak licences. The paper licences vary in shape depending on the class of vehicle, and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours. For reason of traffic management, violating vehicles were not stopped at the gantries, but their number plates were taken down and their owner would receive an order to appear in court to pay the fine. The control was made only at the gantries, therefore, vehicles were free to move around or leave the RZ without having to pay the fee.|$|E

25|$|Edward imposed his {{authority}} on the Church with the Statutes of Mortmain that prohibited the donation of land to the Church, asserted {{the rights of the}} Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified the legal system. He also emphasised the role of Parliament and the common law through significant legislation, a survey of local government and the codification of laws originating from Magna Carta with the Statute of Westminster 1275. Edward also enacted economic reforms on wool exports to take customs, which amounted to nearly £10,000 a year, and imposed <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> on gifts of land to the Church. Feudal jurisdiction was regulated by the Statute of Gloucester and Quo Warranto. The Statute of Winchester enforced Plantagenet policing authority. The Statute of Westminster 1285 kept estates within families: tenants only held property for life and were unable to sell the property. Quia Emptores stopped sub-infeudation where tenants subcontracted their properties and related feudal services.|$|E

John Robinson was no longer available to play Quatermass, so the role was offered instead to Alec Clunes. Clunes turned down the part, and it was offered once more to André Morell, who this time accepted. Morell has been praised by several reviewers as having given the definitive portrayal of Quatermass. The serial itself has been praised by the BBC's own website as [...] "simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made. It justifies <b>licence</b> <b>fees</b> to this day."
