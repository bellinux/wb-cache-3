40|$|After {{two decades}} of "war on {{organized}} crime", the number of lifers in Italy has notably increased. More than 1. 200 convicts are potentially lifers without parole (ergastolo ostativo). Moreover, {{most of them have}} spent several years in isolation known as " 41 bis regime". Inspired by the New School of Convict Criminology, this thesis seeks to explore the many elements of sufferance that <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>confinement</b> produces on those confined to long term isolation, especially regarding parental relationships. Using an ethnographic approach, and the personal prison experience, the author has interviewed twenty lifers. Focusing on their daily deprivation this article shows some restrictive practices aiming the ban of the communications between convicts and their families. These deprivations has negative consequences on parental relationships that become almost formal as visits become more sporadic. <b>Long</b> <b>time</b> <b>confinement</b> is a prison system that punishes primarily the family members of convicts which turns a life sentence into a real torture...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We have {{designed}} a diffusion-engineered, singlephoton spectrometer in the optical-UV range using a superconducting tunnel junction. The optical photon is absorbed in a Ta film and creates excess quasiparticles. These trap into an Al tunnel junction. Internal charge multiplication is achieved with backtunneling, which {{occurs when the}} residence time of the quasiparticles near the junction is longer than the tunneling time. The collected charge is a multiple of the initially created charge. We implement backtunneling by geometrically constricting the outflow of quasiparticles, with a narrow lead. The outdiffusion time is set by the geometry of the narrow lead. Our geometry optimizes the energy resolution and count rate, while reducing the heating and noise seen with much longer <b>confinement</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Long</b> <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> produce excess heating and noise, as we observed previously with quasiparticle confinement achieved via bandgap engineering.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to propose a {{mathematical}} framework giving access to a better understanding of whistler-mode chorus emissions in space plasmas. There is presently a general agreement that the emissions of whistler waves involve a mechanism of wave-particle interaction which can be described in the framework of the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations. In dimensionless variables, these equationsinvolve a penalized skew-symmetric term where the inhomogeneity of the strong exterior magnetic field plays an essential part. The description of the related phenomena is achieved in two stages. The first is based on a new approach allowing to extend in longer times the classical insights on fast rotating fluids; it justifies the existence and the validity of <b>long</b> <b>time</b> gyro-kinetic equations; it furnishes criterions to impose on a magnetic field in order to obtain the <b>long</b> <b>time</b> dynamical <b>confinement</b> of plasmas.

Maximum magnetic field strength requirements are 30 to 65 percent less than for 5000 MW (th) reactors and may be as much as 40 percent less than for circular cross section reactors of comparable size. Very large n tau values are found (10 $sup 15 $ to 10 $sup 17 $ sec/cm$sup 3 $), which produce large burn-up fractions (15 to 60 percent).

Early work recognized these attributes through Raman excitation in microdroplets—but microdroplets have not been used in practical applications. Here we demonstrate a micrometre-scale, nonlinear Raman source that has a highly efficient pump–signal conversion (higher than 35 %) and pump thresholds nearly 1, 000 times lower than shown before. This represents a route to compact, ultralow-threshold sources for numerous wavelength bands that are usually difficult to access.

40|$|Abstract. Experiments with {{high-power}} electron cyclotron heating (ECH) {{and current}} drive (ECCD) in the TCV tokamak are discussed. Power up to 2. 7 MW from six gyrotrons is {{delivered to the}} tokamak at the second-harmonic frequency (82. 7 GHz) in X-mode. The power is transmitted to the plasma by six independent launchers, each equipped with steerable mirrors that allow {{a wide variety of}} injection angles in both the poloidal and toroidal directions. Fully non-inductive operation of the tokamak has been achieved in steady state, for the full 2 s gyrotron pulse duration, by co-ECCD with a highest current to date of 210 kA at full power. The experimentally measured ECCD efficiency agrees well with predictions obtained from linear modelling. We have observed that the highest global efficiency attainable at a given power is limited by stability constraints. While the efficiency is maximum on the magnetic axis, a disruptive MHD instability occurs when the width of the deposition profile is lower than a minimum value, which increases with total power. Many ECCD discharges display a high level of electron energy confinement, enhanced by up to a factor of two over the Rebut–Lallia–Watkins (RLW) scaling law, which by contrast is well satisfied in ohmic conditions.

Through many reflection {{at both ends}} of plasma, solitons and electron holes do not change their propagation speed and propagate as if in a infinitely long column. Solitons behave as KdV solitons with Landau damping. Electron holes go and back in the plasma more than several hundred times but damp away in short time compared with the Coulomn collision time. Keywords: pure electron plasma, soliton, electron hole 1. lntroduction A pure electron plasma confined in the Penning-Malmberg type trap has a very <b>long</b> <b>confinement</b> <b>time</b> and reachs the thermal equilibrium state. It provides an ideal isolated system and is suited for experimental study on basic plasma physics [l]. In a neutral plasma, many experimental results on large amplitude electron plasma waves, such as solitons, electron holes and shock waves, have been reported by using Q-machines [2 - 5]. Recently, electron plasma solitons, electron holes and rarefaction waves have been observed in a cylindrical pure electron plasma [6]. For the axisymmetric perturbations in a cylindrical pure electron plasma, it is possible to use the theoretical treatments same as those in a neutral plasma and to compare the experimental results with theoretical ones reported so far in detail [7]. The most significant difference is reflection of solitons and electron holes {{at both ends of}} the plasma, which can not be observed in a neutral plasma produced in a Q-machine.

40|$|Significant high {{temperature}} plasma research in both the magnetic and inertial confinement regimes led to the official launching of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project which is aimed at challenging controlled fusion power for human kind. In particular, such an endeavor originated from the fruitful research outcomes from the world wide magnetic confinement devices (primarily based on the Tokamak approach) mainly in advanced countries (US, EU, and Japan). In recent years, all new steady state capable Tokamak devices are operated and/or constructed in Asian countries and incidentally, {{the majority of the}} ITER consortium consists of Asian countries. This provides an opportunity to revisit the unresolved essential physics issues and/or extend the understanding of the transient physics to the required steady state operation so that ITER can benefit from these efforts. The core physics of a magnetically confined hot plasma has two essential components; plasma stability and cross-field energy transport physics. Complete understanding of these two areas is critical for the successful operation of ITER and perhaps, Demo reactor construction. In order to have stable high beta plasmas with a sufficiently <b>long</b> <b>confinement</b> <b>time,</b> the physics of an abrupt disruption and sudden deterioration of the energy transport must be understood and conquered.

40|$|Most cool core {{clusters}} of galaxies possess active galactic nuclei (AGN) in their centers. These AGN inflate buoyant bubbles containing non-thermal radio emitting particles. If such bubbles efficiently confine cosmic rays (CR) then this could explain "radio ghosts" seen far from cluster centers. We simulate {{the diffusion of}} cosmic rays from buoyant bubbles inflated by AGN. Our simulations include {{the effects of the}} anisotropic particle diffusion introduced by magnetic fields. Our models are consistent with the X-ray morphology of AGN bubbles, with disruption being suppressed by the magnetic draping effect. We conclude that for such magnetic field topologies, a substantial fraction of cosmic rays can be confined inside the bubbles on buoyant rise timescales even when the parallel diffusivity coefficient is very large. For isotropic diffusion at a comparable level, cosmic rays would leak out of the bubbles too rapidly to be consistent with radio observations. Thus, the <b>long</b> <b>confinement</b> <b>times</b> associated with the magnetic suppression of CR diffusion can explain the presence of radio ghosts. We show that the partial escape of cosmic rays is mostly confined to the wake of the rising bubbles, and speculate that this effect could: (1) account for the excitation of the Hα filaments trailing behind the bubbles in the Perseus cluster, (2) inject entropy into the metal enriched material being lifted by the bubbles and, thus, help to displace it permanently from the cluster center and (3) produce observable γ-rays via the interaction of the diffusing cosmic rays with the thermal intracluster medium (ICM).
