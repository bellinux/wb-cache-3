30|$|The new GDPR aims at {{protecting}} {{the rights of}} the data subject and confidentiality of personal health data as an important civil right, whilst preserving the benefits of digital image processing for research and public health purposes. Hospitals and other healthcare organisations should be prepared to comply with the requirements of the new GDPR. Besides the protection of confidentiality, {{the rights of the}} data subject include obtaining access to his/her personal data stored in the EPR and PACS, obtaining a copy for transferring them to another healthcare provider, and to have inaccuracies in his/her data rectified. There is also a requirement for healthcare providers to demonstrate that their procedures fulfil the conditions of <b>lawful</b> <b>data</b> processing required by the GDPR, e.g. on the basis of explicit consent of the data subject, or the use of safeguards when processing data for research or public health purposes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} an overview of the legal risks that arise from the use of private clouds arising from <b>lawful</b> interception, <b>data</b> protection obligations and legal professional privilege. The paper uses an Australian perspective to provide examples, but concludes that there are significant legal risks in all jurisdictions. Key words: cloud computing, private cloud, <b>lawful</b> interception, <b>data</b> protection, professional privilege. loud computing, sometimes referred to as utility computing, is a broadly used term that has spawned a myriad of competing industry definitions. There is an extensive literature on the subject including a substantial body of recent work (AL-QIRIM, 2011; ARMBRUST e...|$|R

40|$|If {{a company}} uses cloud {{computing}} services to process their employees or their customers personal data, {{they need to}} ensure that the cloud provider complies with the relevant privacy statues. One of the {{things that need to be}} ensured is that all personal data are processed only in <b>lawful</b> locations. <b>Data</b> sources that can be used to automatically determine the current location of data processing could help cloud users to ful fill their duty and to strengthen the confidence in a privacy friendly processing of their personal data. For that, data location metrics need to be defined, appropriate data sources need to be determined and the measured data need to be combined reasonable. This paper describes the procedure and system architecture of such data location metrics...|$|R
40|$|The {{disclosure}} of confidential patient data without an individual’s explicit consent {{should be for}} purposes that persons have reason to both expect and accept. We do not currently have the required level of clarity or consistency in understanding regarding the {{disclosure of}} confidential patient information for public health purposes to support effective public dialogue. The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 establish a legal basis in England and Wales for data to be disclosed for public health purposes without patient consent. Under the Regulations, {{there is more than}} one potential route towards <b>lawful</b> processing: <b>Data</b> may be processed for public health purposes under both Regulations 3 and 5. The alternatives have different safeguards and conditions attached, and their respective applicability to processing for purposes of public health improvement is currently unclear and subject to review. Beyond the need for clarity regarding the safeguards applicable to processing for particular public health purposes, there are reasons to prefer recognition that Regulation 5 is the most appropriate legal basis for disclosure when the purpose is public health improvement rather than public health protection. Where health improvement, rather than protection, is the aim, there is no justification for discarding the additional safeguards associated with processing under Regulation 5...|$|R
40|$|Transparency is an {{integral}} part of European data protection. In particular, the right of access allows the data subject to verify if his personal data is processed in a <b>lawful</b> manner. The <b>data</b> controller has the full obligation to provide all information on personal data processing in an easily accessible way. Privacy dashboards are promising tools for this purpose. However, there is not yet any privacy dashboard available which allows full access to all personal data. Particularly, information flows remain unclear. We present the next generation privacy dashboard PrivacyInsight. It provides full access to all personal data along information flows. Additionally, it allows exercising the data subject’s further rights. We evaluate PrivacyInsight in comparison with existing approaches by means of a user study. Our results show that PrivacyInsight is the most usable and most feature complete existing privacy dashboard...|$|R
