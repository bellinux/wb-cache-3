40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> in vehicles. The number of sudden death incidents due to excessive CO inhalation has recently increased. Many cases are due to driver habits and awareness, for instance, air conditioning switches remain on while they are sleeping in the car. This habit is not a good practice because if there were gas leakage into the cabin, especially CO, the situation could result in sudden death. Basically the driver feels sleepy when excessive CO concentrations occur in the cabin. Based on that, a vehicle gas <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> system has been developed using a gas sensor and logic detector circuit. Subsequently, the signal from the sensor is fed to an 8 -bit PIC 16 F 84 microcontroller on-board system via appropriate interfacing devices, which will run on pre-programmed instructions.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to gas leakage detection in high pressure distribution networks is proposed, where two leakage detectors are modelled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system whose scheduling signals are, respectively, intake and offtake pressures. Running the two detectors simultaneously allows for leakage location. First, the pipeline is identified from operational data, supplied by REN-Gasodutos and using an LPV systems identification algorithm proposed in [1]. Each <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> uses two Kalman filters where the fault is viewed as an augmented state. The first filter estimates the flow using a calculated scheduling signal, assuming {{that there is no}} leakage. Therefore it works as a reference. The second one uses a measured scheduling signal and the augmented state is compared with the reference value. Whenever there is a significant difference, a leakage is detected. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated with an example where a mixture of real and simulated data is used...|$|E

40|$|Robotic {{operation}} {{is one of}} the major challenges in the remote maintenance of ITER vacuum vessel (VV) and future fusion reactors as inner operations of Tokamak have to be done by robots due to the internal adverse conditions. This paper introduces a novel remote handling robot (RHR) for the maintenance of ITER-like D-shaped vessel. The modular designed RHR, which is an important part of the remote handling system for ITER, consists of three parts: an omnidirectional transfer vehicle (OTV), a planar articulated arm (PAA), and an articulated teleoperated manipulator (ATM). The task of RHR is to carry processing tools, such as the viewing system, <b>leakage</b> <b>detector,</b> and electric screwdriver, to inspect and maintain the components installed inside the D-shaped vessel. The kinematics of the OTV, as well as the kinematic analyses of the PAA and ATM, is studied in this paper. Because of its special length and heavy payload, the dynamics of the PAA is also investigated through a dynamic simulation system based on robot technology middleware (RTM). The results of the path planning, workspace simulations, and dynamic simulation indicate that the RHR has good mobility together with satisfying kinematic and dynamic performances and can well accomplish its maintenance tasks in the ITER-like D-shaped vessel...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwo main deep saline {{aquifers}} {{have been}} identified in the Paris basin for possible CO 2 injection: carbonate reservoirs from the Dogger and Triassic sandstones. These two targeted reservoirs are located at convenient depths for supercritical CO 2 storage between 1500 and 2500 m {{in the center of the}} Paris basin and show good sealing properties on the upper cap rock. To control long term storage efficiency of CCS projects it is essential to design and implement an appropriate monitoring program that proves that CO 2 can be stored safely for a long time. A future monitoring program will be focused on three main axes: a geophysical, geochemical and biological. This paper presents the global monitoring methodology developed to address geochemical aspects of future CO 2 storage sites. Three major compartments must be monitored for a well representative CO 2 flow baseline: the geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere compartments of the specific site. Viability of any CCS project is strongly dependent on the of our capacity to well establish a realistic quantitative baseline system integrating natural and anthropogenic contributions in each compartment. For these reasons, our technical strategy must a combination of in situ and continuous monitoring systems. On the basis of previous and present day research programs conducted on natural CO 2 storage sites, an in-situ monitoring combined methodology matrix adapted to CO 2 storage at Claye-Souilly site in Paris basin deep saline aquifer is argued. The presentation will also integrate the proposal of new development in optical sensors (Infrared, Raman and Laser) for gas quantification and traceability including the isotopic aspects. Geosphere monitoring strategy must be mainly conducted through an original multi packers system allowing simultaneously reservoir, rock formations and strategic aquifers observations. In the reservoir, continuous acquisition of geochemical and hydrodynamic parameters is of first importance for adjusting and limiting the divergence criteria of the models and to adapt the injection procedure. In upper rock formations, establishment and modeling of gas transfer curves, will constitute a sensitive and powerful in-situ <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> tool. Biosphere survey strategy can be based on conventional accumulation chambers and dynamic flow chambers systems. The surface sampling network must be adapted on the basis of geological and structural characteristics of overburden rock as revealed by previous geophysical investigations. A remote infrared scanning sensing system combined with a laser remote system must support the atmosphere compartment survey strategy. The use of such combined remote system yields a spatial and temporal imaging of the CO 2 and its dynamics in air. Sensitivity of leakage detection will depend on the chosen sensing system and the amount of CO 2 injected. While variability of CO 2 flux and concentration vary with time and with geographic location, they will both depend on the investigated compartment, the natural carbon cycle and the anthropogenic events. Both, sensitivity and variability should be considered in order to establish the alert levels. Given the complexity of data, the time needed to quantify sensitivity and, variability aspects and to establish a base line system, must be longer than one year (one seasonal cycle). This aspect is of first importance to define and provide the remediation operations that must be applied in the case of CO 2 leakage on the basis of combined deep, surface and sub-surface measured gas data. Compilation of previous experiments strongly argued that our capacity to quantify variability of CO 2 flux/concentration baseline must be one major key factor in the choice of a future monitoring program for CO 2 storage site...|$|E

Detectors with and without an additional layer of Si 3 N 4 insulator were made in one set, using the same thickness of SiO 2 insulator. Measurements were made on both types of detectors after irradiation with 20 MeV electrons, using doses up to 2 Mrad.

However, the <b>leakage</b> current for <b>detectors</b> with double layer insulator is about 20 nA per strip while the leakage current for the single layer SiO 2 insulated detectors is only 0. 5 nA.

EPICP is part of the EPIC (Electron Photon Interaction Code) system. EPICP is designed to perform both normal transport calculations and diagnostic calculations involving only photons, with the objective of developing optimum algorithms for later use in EPIC. The EPIC system includes other modules that are designed to develop optimum algorithms for later use in EPIC; this includes electron and positron transport (EPICE), neutron transport (EPICN), charged particle transport (EPICC), geometry (EPICG), source sampling (EPICS). This is a modular system that once optimized can be linked together to consider a wide variety of particles, geometries, sources, etc. By design EPICP only considers photon transport. In particular it does not consider electron transport so that later EPICP and EPICE can be used to quantitatively evaluate the importance of electron transport when starting from photon sources. In this report I will merely mention where we expect the results to significantly differ from those obtained considering only photon transport from that obtained using coupled electron-photon transport...|$|R
