6000|$|... 116. Thus far, we {{have got}} for representatives of our dabchick group, eight species of little birds--namely, two Torrent-ouzels, three Lily-ouzels, one Grebe, and two Titanias.

And having once fastened the characters of these well in his mind, he may with ease remember that the <b>little</b> <b>grebe</b> is the least of a family of chestnut-leaf-footed, and sharp-billed creatures, which yet in size, color, and diving power, go necessarily among Ducks, and cannot be classed with Dabblers; though it must be always as distinctly kept in mind that a duck proper has a flat beak, and a fully webbed foot.|$|E
