Subsequently, the daily traffic reached a minimum of 45,000 vehicles and a maximum of 61,000 vehicles by early 2008, against a maximum capacity of 85,000 vehicles per day. The original management of the toll revenue collection by HRBC was consequently criticized for corruption and significant <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Raptors were {{established}} on November 4, 1993, when the NBA, {{as part of}} its expansion into Canada, awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of $125 million USD. Bitove and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44%, with the Bank of Nova Scotia (10%), David Peterson (1%), and Phil Granovsky (1%) being minority partners. Wagering on NBA games in Ontario nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling. However, an agreement was reached whereby the provincial lottery corporation agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games in exchange for a donation by the Raptors of $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate the provincial lottery corporation for its <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue.</b> The Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, played their first game in 1995, and were the first NBA teams based in Canada since the 1946–47 Toronto Huskies, though the Buffalo Braves had played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto from 1971 to 1975.|$|E

When Kosygin visited Iraq in 1972, he and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, the President of Iraq signed and ratified the Iraqi–Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Co-operation. The alliance also forced the Iraqi Ba'athist government to temporarily stop their prosecution of the Iraqi Communist Party (ICP). The ICP was even given two ministerships following the establishment of an alliance between the Soviet Union and Iraq. The following year, in 1973, al-Bakr went on a state visit to the Soviet Union, and met Brezhnev personally. Relations between the two countries only soured in 1976 when the Iraq Ba'athist regime started a mass campaign against the ICP and other communists. Despite pleas from Brezhnev for clemency, several Iraqi communists were executed publicy.|$|E

The government almost immediately changed the rules to allow for licensed conveyancers, introducing the changes with a section in the Administration of Justice Act 1985.

40|$|Recovering {{revenue loss}} {{due to the}} {{reduction}} in import tariffs {{is a major concern}} of many developing economies. In an economy with free entry, which affects the product market competition, we show that, even if there is no other tax reform such as a profit tax reform, the market mechanism itself takes care <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> government <b>revenue</b> following a tariff reduction if entry is sufficiently costly. A compensatory profit tax to compensate the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> government <b>revenue</b> following a tariff reduction is required for an intermediate level of entry cost. If the entry cost is very small, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> government <b>revenue</b> following a tariff reduction cannot be compensated even with a profit tax reform. Hence, the net effect of a tariff reduction on government revenue therefore depends on how much tariff and tax revenues are created by entry, which is affected by changes in both the tariff rate and the profit tax rate.

Although this solution involved many more moving parts than the hydraulic system, these would be above ground and accessible thus making maintenance easier and cheaper and having a longer working life. Other advantages of the conversion listed by Saner included a {{reduction in the number of}} operating attendants by one and the avoidance of costly boiler repairs.

Although ABC intended to continue The Edge of Night, even by offering to move it to a mid-morning timeslot, Procter & Gamble could no longer afford to continue producing the show due to the constant <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> from frequent pre-emptions.

Former New Haven General Manager Clinton L. Bardo was appointed as Trustee to try to turn around the fortunes of the ailing Westchester. But the trustees of the NH bankruptcy and the trustees of the NYW bankruptcy were responsible to different groups of creditors. The liquidation brought them into conflict. The NYW was forced to cease operating on the Port Chester line to enhance the revenues of the NH from its parallel service.

25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{congestion}} charge zone on local businesses is a contested issue. The TfL estimates that the effect on business has been overall neutral.

In August 2003, the John Lewis Partnership, a large department store, announced that {{in the first six months}} of the charge's operation, sales at their Oxford Street store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%. To partly compensate for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> they extended opening hours and introduced regular Sunday opening for the first time.
