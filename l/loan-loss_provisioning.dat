40|$|Following the {{financial}} and banking crisis of the late 2000 s, accounting regulators sought to replace the incurred-loss method of <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> by a more forward-looking expected-loss method. Difficulties arose, including {{with respect to the}} weight that expected-loss provisioning should place on objective evidence of loss relative to evidence of a less specific and more judgemental nature. This paper provides evidence relevant to this issue by examining whether <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> by UK banks was less timely under the stricter evidence requirements of the IAS 39 incurred-loss regime implemented in 2005 than under the less strict evidence requirements of the previous UK incurred-loss regime. It does so by reference to the relationship in time between loan write offs and loan-loss expense. The results do not suggest that provisioning became less timely under the stricter evidence requirements of IAS 39. There is no evidence that provisioning became less timely immediately prior to the crisis of the late 2000 s. Also, {{there is no evidence that}} general provisioning, permitted under the pre-IAS 39 regime, enhanced the timeliness of <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> The results do not suggest that stricter requirements regarding the evidence necessary to support recognition of loan losses have resulted in less timely <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning...</b>|$|E

40|$|Reducing credit {{procyclicality}} {{represents one}} of the key challenges on the regulatory agenda to reform the financial system architecture following the banking crisis initiated in 2007. The Spanish counter-cyclical provisions scheme implemented in 2000 {{has been one of the}} main reference points in this context. The objective of the present paper is to analyze the effects of counter-cyclical provisions upon managerial discretion in <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> and upon loan growth. We empirically examine a sample of Spanish banks using quarterly information from 2000 Q 1 to 2010 Q 1. The results suggest that the counter-cyclical provisioning scheme has been effective in reducing the procyclicality of loan-loss provisions over time and restricting capital management. It also appears to have been effective in reducing the impact of discretional income smoothing over time. However, it did not prevent excessive lending growth in the pre-crisis period. Our findings also show that income smoothing, profit signaling and the procyclicality of <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> are significantly larger in banks showing higher loan growth rates before the crisis and, in particular, in those which eventually received government funding under the restructuring scheme implemented in Spain during the crisis...|$|E

This policy brief deals with advances in the Andean countries regarding the implementation of macro-prudential financial regulations; that is, regulations that take into account risks at the systemic level.

40|$|A fair {{level of}} {{provisions}} on bad and doubtful loans {{is an essential}} input in mark-to-market accounting, and in the calculation of bank profitability, capital and solvency. <b>Loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> {{is directly related to}} estimates of loan-loss given default (LGD). A literature on LGD on bank loans is developing but, surprisingly, it has not been exploited to address, at the micro level, the issue of provisioning at the time of default, and after the default date.

The dynamic schedule is 'ad hoc', not based on empirical studies. The purpose of the paper is to present an empirical methodology to calculate a fair level of loan-loss provisions, at the time of default and after the default date.

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} a comprehensive {{examination of the}} impact of the 1988 Basel Accord on the capital adequacy regulations of developed economies. The study seeks to understand if the Accord affected broad or isolated convergence of 18 developed states' bank credit risk regulations from 1988 to 2000, and understand what political economic variables influenced levels of regulatory isomorphism. The thesis argues that previous research has failed to effectively address whether the Accord accomplished its "level regulatory playing field" objective by employing small sample sizes. In order to address this lacuna, the thesis creates a quantitative database of developed states' interpretations of the Basel rules. The results indicate that the Accord may have successfully provided a regulatory floor as most states implemented the agreement in some form by 1991. Yet, some persistent distinction remained in the way states implemented the Accord. Second, the thesis aims to understand why convergence emerged among a subset of states, yet not others, by testing a battery of political economic explanations. Statistical tests reveal that initial interpretations of the Accord's provisions were conditioned by the severity of a state's capital adequacy regime prior to 1988. States with weak (severe) pre-Basel capital adequacy regimes tended to implement weak (severe) interpretations of the Accord. Departures from "path dependent" positions resulted mostly from the presence of acute banking crises and the impact of private financial market influences. The qualitative studies of implementation in the United States, France, Germany, and Japan tend to support the quantitative finds, yet also emphasize the importance of considering tax, accounting, and <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning</b> policies in assessments of capital adequacy regulation. These results should have implications for revised studies of the economic effects of the Accord and studies of possible impact of the Basel 2 Accord...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{widespread}} {{turmoil in}} the banking sector has renewed the notion that improper credit risk management {{continues to be the}} catalyst for serious banking problems. The Australian banking sector emerged relatively unscathed from recent global turmoil, providing an interesting setting for research. This thesis investigates the credit risk management practice of Australian banks’ loan portfolios from a regulatory perspective by examining regulatory <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisioning,</b> regulatory capital, and regulatory stress-testing in Australia. Findings suggest the potential for Australian banks to under-provision when faced with pressure to raise capital ratios. IRB banks, on the other hand, report regulatory provisions in line with expected loss estimates as intended under the Basel II capital framework. Australian bank supervisors are encouraged to remain vigilant when assessing bank capital adequacy by paying particular attention to the sufficiency of bank regulatory provisioning practices as a reserve against expected credit losses. This thesis finds Australian banks target a level of regulatory capital above the imposed regulatory minimum, with quarterly speed of adjustment coefficients of 19 and 15 per cent for total and tier 1 capital ratios, respectively. Bank risk, size and ROE are found to be significant determinants of Australian bank capital buffers and Basel II is found to have increased bank capital buffers. Findings suggest a positive relationship exists between the business cycle and Australian bank capital buffers, interpreted to be a countercyclical effect and results indicate bank-specific regulatory imposed PCRs are having their intended effect on capital ratios. An investigation into current regulatory stress-testing practice reveals that variation in the performance between banks is widely disregarded. A simulation experiment suggests that once key stress-testing variables are decomposed from mean values into their empirically fitted distributions, the increase in average banking system losses is substantial. Both the average and worst performing group of banks suffer a significantly greater magnitude of loss. Under a severe stress scenario of a 30 per cent decline in the property index and a 10 per cent default rate, failing to decompose the mean results in an underestimation of average bank losses of 1. 86 per cent of total assets. The worst performing group of banks have losses underestimated by a total of 2. 32 per cent of total assets, a substantial amount of loss with significant implications for current regulatory stress-testing practice. This thesis provides insights into the credit risk management practices of a banking sector which, in recent times, has outperformed global counterparts. The final implication of the findings of this thesis is relevant for all authorities with vested interest in the resilience of worldwide banking systems. For proper management of credit risk, regulatory provisioning, regulatory capital and regulatory stress-testing cannot be assessed in isolation, a simultaneous assessment is essential. This thesis provides an essential step in promoting a greater awareness of the interrelations between these three components in the Australian banking system...|$|E
40|$|The {{profitability}} of the U. S. commercial banking industry remained robust in 2000, but returns on equity and on commercial bank assets fell back somewhat from the peak reached in 1999. The falloff reflected {{a continuation of}} the decline in net interest margin that dates from the extraordinarily high levels of the early 1990 s, a significant increase in <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisions,</b> and a notable slowing in noninterest income growth. The expansion of bank balance sheets was much stronger in 2000 than in the preceding year, as growth of both loans and securities accelerated. The pickup in loan growth resulted mainly from a marked decline in securitizations, which boosted the growth of consumer loans in bank portfolios, and from business and real estate lending. The faster growth of securities was due to a surge in trading accounts, as runoffs of U. S. Treasury securities damped the growth of investment accounts.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisions</b> (LLPs) and earnings management {{in the context of}} the capital adequacy of Euro Area (EA) banks versus non-EA credit institutions. This paper also examines whether LLPs signal managements’expectations concerning future bank profits to investors. Additionally, this paper traces the role of bank regulations and creditor protection systems in explaining income smoothing. Evidence drawn from the 1996 to 2006 period indicates that LLPs do reflect changes in the expected quality of a bank’s loan portfolio for both groups of banks, and that earnings management is an important determinant of LLPs for EA intermediaries, whereas non-EA credit institutions use LLPs to signal private information to outsiders. The paper also finds that higher protection of creditors’ rights significantly reduces the incentives to smooth earnings for EA banks. During the recent financial crisis, EA bank managers are much more concerned with their credit portfolio quality and do not use LLPs for discretionary purposes, whereas LLPs at non-EA banks are used to smooth income more than for the purposes of managing capital ratios or conveying private information about future performance to the market...|$|R
40|$|Two {{problems}} are {{identified in the}} treatment of <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisions</b> under the Basle Accord as modified in 1991. It is suggested that a distinction should be made between expected and unexpected loan losses and that the former should be treated {{in the same way that}} identified losses are. That is, they should not be allowed to count as capital. However, capital should be maintained as a buffer stock available to absorb unexpected losses. The calculation of expected loan losses and the provisioning to cover these losses enables a clearer picture of the economic structure of bank balance sheets. This paper examines the implications for provisioning of (i) the implicit subsidy enjoyed by borrowers in the form of limited liability, and (ii) the expected costs of administering insolvency in the event of borrower default. Critics will argue that the calculation of expected losses is a highly subjective activity. However, the timing of a decision to 'identify' a loss for balance sheet purposes and the level of provisioning against non-performing loans also involve highly subjective judgements.

40|$|Amid a {{strengthening}} economic expansion, U. S. {{commercial banks}} remained highly profitable in 2003. Return on assets reached a record {{level for the}} second year in a row, and return on equity was near the top of its recent range. Banks' profits were bolstered by decreased <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisions</b> as a rising economy and considerable debt refinancing at very low interest rates led to lower delinquency rates on business and household loans. Fees associated with record mortgage refinancing activity and robust corporate bond issuance boosted non-interest income. Increases in non-interest expense were generally modest, although compensation-related costs rose more briskly. Lower long-term interest rates in the first part of the year allowed banks to realize gains on the sale of some of their securities, but they also contributed to a further shrinking of net interest margins. Banks' balance sheets expanded briskly, as the strong housing market and heavy refinancing activity boosted residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Business loans ran off for a third year, albeit at a slower pace than in 2002 and 2003. Banks' regulatory capital positions strengthened further, as the growth of assets with low regulatory risk weights outpaced that of assets with higher risk weights.

40|$|The {{philosophy}} underlying a bank's {{accounting for}} loan losses {{might have a}} material effect on the net income the firm reports to investors, which is a concern for securities regulators.

40|$|This thesis investigates whether {{corporate}} governance conformance by Malaysian banks improves their financial reporting quality. It {{is motivated by}} the controversies surrounding {{corporate governance}} reforms and the calls for systematic research on its efficacy in the post-reform period. Malaysian banks {{have been subject to}} international standards of corporate governance since before and after the 1997 – 1998 Asian Financial Crisis. Malaysia’s common-law tradition, greater level of financial and capital market development in the region, predominantly centralised and stable political power and robust regulatory framework are apparent strengths for corporate governance conformance. However, characteristics such as ownership concentration, political links and lack of regulatory enforcement question the ability of any governance reform to enhance the Malaysian banks’ financial reporting quality. This setting, coupled with Malaysian banks' differing business models compared to those of U. S. banks, provides an Asian focus to extant literature. The analyses focus on three specific reforms, namely: (i) the initiation of the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) in 2000; (ii) the circular issued by Bank Negara Malaysia in 2003 on Guidelines on the Establishment of Board Committees, Minimum Qualification and Training Requirement for Directors, and Definition and Responsibilities of Independent Directors (BNMCIR); and (iii) the revision to Guidelines on Directorship in Banking Institutions in 2005 (REVGP 1). The analyses utilise 64 listed bank-year observations from 1996 to 2004 for the MCCG reform; 80 licensed bank-year observations from 1999 to 2007 for the BNMCIR reform; and 56 unlisted bank-year observations from 2001 to 2009 for the REVGP 1 reform. The research questions addressed for each reform period are: Have banks’ corporate governance practices changed in response to the reforms? If so, have the changes in corporate governance improved financial reporting quality? This study first identifies governance attributes with significant statistical difference from the pre- to the post-reform period. These attributes are then used to gauge their effectiveness in improving banks’ financial reporting quality in the post-reform period using five proxies: (i) earnings persistence; (ii) earnings predictability; (iii) the relationship between <b>loan-loss</b> <b>provisions</b> and loan charge-offs; (iv) total accruals; and (v) discretionary accruals. From an initial concern of the low quality of financial reporting during the pre-reform period, the empirical results suggest that there was no improvement to the financial reporting quality of listed banks initiating a nominating or remuneration committee and/or complying with committee composition requirements in response to the MCCG reform. A similar situation prevails for licensed banks complying with initiating a nominating, remuneration and risk-management committee and/or complying with composition requirements. The results suggest that neither a voluntary reform approach following the U. K. standards of governance practices (pursuant to MCCG) nor a mandatory reform approach tailoring governance practices to suit local environment (pursuant to BNMCIR) were effective for improving Malaysian banks’ financial reporting quality. In contrast, the empirical results pursuant to REVGP 1, show improved earnings persistence and earnings predictability for unlisted banks complying with enhanced board independence, suggesting some benefits from the efforts to enhance financial reporting quality of Malaysian banks...|$|R

They always follow booms. Offering forbearance from mark-to-market accounting or other rules during a crisis, yet using these rules at other times, such as during the preceding boom, would promote excessive lending and leverage in the good times. This asymmetry would contribute to more frequent and severe crashes. Second, crises are a time where a rumour becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy, as panic and fear spread. It is, arguably, not the time to generate a rise in uncertainty by changing accounting standards. There is room for a revision to the application of mark-to-market rules, but not a revision based on relying on the messenger’s every last word in good times and shooting him in the bad times. But the mechanisms that lead market participants to greet price declines with sell orders have not all to do with value accounting. Current prices, including spot and forward prices, play an important role in the market risk and credit risk management systems approved by financial regulators. Risk limits and sell orders are triggered in response to a rise in price volatility and/or a fall in price. The very philosophy of current banking regulation –risk sensitivity– is about incorporating market prices into the assessment and response to risk. It should be no surprise that if prices, both prices for current and future delivery, are pro-cyclical, then placing an increasing emphasis on price in the management and regulation of risk, will lead us to systemic collapse. This article examines the role of valuation and systemic liquidity and argues that an approach to how we apply mark-to-market accounting and market prices or risk that is driven more by an economic view can improve the systemic resilience of the fi nancial system. ...|$|R
