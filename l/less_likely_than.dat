Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but they are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E
5|$|A North–South divide {{remains in}} {{education}} at all levels. There {{is a significant}} attainment gap between Northern and Southern schools, even after controlling for the economic difference across the country, and pupils in the three Northern regions are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> the national average to achieve five higher-tier GCSEs. Northern students are under-represented at Oxbridge, where {{three times as many}} places go to Southerners as to Northerners, and other Southern universities while Southerners are under-represented at leading Northern universities such as Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds.|$|E

5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Children are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> {{adults to}} clear the infection. More than 95% of people who become {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of an Anglo-Saxon king on {{the orders of}} another ruler was very rare, although public hanging and beheading did occur at this time, as has been discovered at the Sutton Hoo site. Æthelberht's death {{at the hands of}} the Mercians made the possibility of any peaceful union between the Anglian peoples (including Mercia) <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> before. It led to Mercia's domination of East Anglia, whose kings ruled over the kingdom for over three decades after Æthelberht's death.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{analyses}} {{using different}} sets of anatomical data have since cast doubt on a dromaeosaurid classification for Balaur. In 2013, a larger analysis containing {{a wide variety of}} coelurosaurs found that Balaur was not a dromaeosaurid at all, but a basal avialan, more closely related to modern birds than to Jeholornithiformes but more basal than Omnivoropterygiformes. A study published in 2014 found Balaur to be sister to Pygostylia. An independent analysis using an expanded version of the original data set (the one that found Balaur to be a dromaeosaurid) drew a similar conclusion in 2014. In 2015, researchers Andrea Cau, Tom Brougham, and Darren Naish published a study which specifically attempted to clarify which theropods were close relatives of Balaur. While their analysis could not completely {{rule out the possibility that}} B. bondoc was a dromaeosaurid, they concluded that this result was <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> the classification of Balaur as a non-pygostylian avialan based on several important bird-like features. Many of the presumed unique traits would in fact have been normal for a member of the Avialae. Typical bird features included the degree of fusion of the limb bones, the functional first toe, the first toe claw not being smaller than the second claw, a long penultimate phalanx of the third toe, a small fourth toe claw and a long fifth metatarsal.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Disclosure of HIV {{status is}} an {{important}} factor in negotiating safer sex among MSM. This continues to be a public health concern. In order to make a fully informed decision about using a condom when having sex, both partners should be aware of the others' HIV status. This study aims to determine the factors associated with disclosure, and to gain a better understanding of who discloses. To examine disclosure, I used data from a community-based HIV/STI clinic in Seattle, Washington. I found that African American and Hispanic MSM were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to disclose <b>than</b> whites, those who engaged in risky behaviors were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to disclose <b>than</b> those who do not, and that those with a high school education were <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to disclose <b>than</b> those with at least a college degree. Lastly, I found there is not a significant difference in disclosure between HIV positive and HIV negative MSM...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the hypotheses presented by Oswald (1999) for the Netherlands. These are: I) Home-owners are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to move <b>than</b> renters, II) Unemployed home-owners are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to move <b>than</b> unemployed renters, III) Owners of houses are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> {{to move to}} another job, because they are not willing to leave the� region and IV) Owners of houses are more likely to become unemployed. Using individual data of a panel of labour market and housing market histories for the period 1989 - 1998, we estimate a hazard rate model, that explain transitions on these markets. We find evidence for the Oswald theory in two cases: employed home-owners are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to move <b>than</b> renters are, and employed home-owners are <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to change jobs than renters are. However, from these results alone we cannot conclude that employed workers that own a house have worse labour market positions than renters. Instead, their commitment to jobs makes them less vulnerable for unemployment. Also, Oswald's theory does not seem to hold for unemployed workers or nonparticipants. Instead, unemployed home-owners are even more inclined to move than renters. ...|$|R
