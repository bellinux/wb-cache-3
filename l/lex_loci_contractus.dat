25|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the courts applied the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>{{contract}}us</b> or the law of the place where the contract was made to decide whether the given contract was valid. The apparent advantage of this approach was that the rule was easy to apply with certain and predictable outcomes. Unfortunately, it was also open to abuse, e.g. the place could be selected fraudulently to validate an otherwise invalid contract; it might lead to the application of laws with no real connection with the transaction itself, say, because the parties signed the agreement while on holiday; or it might have been difficult to decide where the contract was made, e.g. because it was negotiated and signed on a railway journey through several states.|$|E

While typically they both point to the same location, in the case of product liability, for example, the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus would be the place of manufacturing, while the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti commissi would be the place of injury.|$|R

50|$|The ruling {{concerning}} {{the choice of}} law (lex originis for determining copyright ownership and <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti for the infringement) was contrary to the previous presumption that only the law where the infringement occurred (i.e., <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti) would apply. It has been discussed controversially in several publications. Since the Berne Convention does not offer any guidance on which law shall be applied to determine copyright ownership, this ruling is still the relevant case law in this question and the principle is applied in the U.S. even in other recent cases. The decision is only effective within the U.S.; other countries may follow other rules, such as using the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> delicti exclusively.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus</b> {{is one of}} the {{possible}} choice of law rules applied to cases testing the validity of a contract.

Article 11 covers {{the situation where}} two persons physically present in the same state make a contract, and both parties have capacity under the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus.</b> One party cannot invoke incapacity under another law unless the other party was aware of this incapacity {{at the time the}} contract was made or was not aware of the incapacity as a result of negligence.|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} law rules for {{contracts}} are more complicated than the law affecting other obligations because they depend on the express or implied intentions of the parties and their personal circumstances. For example, questions as to whether a contract is valid may depend on {{the capacity of the}} parties to enter into a contract. This could be decided by reference to the lex domicilii, lex patriae or habitual residence of the parties, or for policy reasons, by reference to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus</b> (where the contract was made). But, if the contract was made electronically, where the contract was actually made must first be decided either by the lex fori or the putative proper law depending on the forum rules. There may also be problems if the parties selected the place where the contract was made in the hope of evading the operation of some mandatory provisions in another relevant law.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of any such choice by the parties, express or implied, the court simply assign a {{governing}} law to the contract. Traditionally this is done {{on the basis of a}} presumed intention fictitiously imputed to the parties, but the more modern approach is for the proper law to be determined objectively, with reference to the factual links between the agreement and the various relevant legal systems. In other words, the court selects the legal system “with which the transaction has its closest and most real connection.” Usually this is the law of the country where the contract was made or signed (the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus),</b> or, when performance is to be tendered in another country, the law of that country (the lex loci solutionis). It has been argued that, in view of modern methods of communication and international trade, the weight of the locus celebrate contractus in assigning the governing law is diminishing. It is important to note, however, that the court is not restricted in its choice of proper law by any rigid rules, and may in appropriate cases assign to the contract some other governing law.|$|E
50|$|But {{the problem}} with {{accepting}} the claim of any one state to have its law apply is that the result may be somewhat arbitrary. So, in the example given, if neither driver had a residence in the state, and the cars were both maintained outside the state, the laws of other states may have an equal or better claim to apply. The advantage of the proper law approach is that it builds in flexibility rather than offering a mechanical rule. Suppose {{that there is a}} contract between an Italian company and an English partnership for the sale of goods made in Greece to be shipped from Belgium on a ship flying the flag of Panama to a Swedish port. Adopting a rule such as the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus,</b> i.e. apply the law of the place where the contract was made, might actually select a law having no other connection with the substance of the bargain made by the parties. Similarly, picking the lex loci solutionis, i.e. the law of the place where the contract is to be performed, may prove to be equally irrelevant, assuming {{that there is only one}} place where performance is to occur: in the example, there is manufacture in Greece, delivery to Belgium, loading in Belgium, carriage on the high seas, and unloading in Sweden. So, if the contract does not make an express selection of the law to apply (see choice of law clause), the parties are deemed to have chosen to be bound by the law with which the contract has the closest and most real connection.|$|E

5000|$|The {{presumptive}} {{choice of}} law rule for tort is that the proper law applies. This refers to the law that has the greatest relevance to the issues involved. In public policy terms, this is usually {{the law of the}} place where the key elements of the [...] "wrong" [...] were performed or occurred (the lex loci delicti). So if A is a pedestrian injured by B's negligent driving, the law of the state in which the injury occurs would logically be applied because, in public policy terms, the citizens of that state have a clear interest in regulating the standard of driving on their roads. That either or both the parties might have domiciles outside that state would be irrelevant. But, if A buys a car from B in State X and drives it into State Y where A is injured by a defect in the car, the {{choice of law}} is not as evident: there is potential liability both for breach of contract and for negligent misstatement, deceit and failure to adequately maintain the vehicle prior to sale. There is no genuine connection either in fact or law with the law of State Y. It was pure chance that the injury occurred there. In fact, the law of State X is the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus</b> and the most appropriate law since everything relevant to the potential tortious liability occurred in that state which has the greatest interest in maintaining consumer confidence in the motor trade. Thus, no matter where A sues B, the forum court should apply the law of State X to resolve the various causes of action. For these purposes, the forum conveniens would be the State in which B has residence and/or holds assets. One of the key considerations in any conflict dispute is the enforceability of the resulting judgment. Courts are more willing to accept cases with a foreign law element when one of the parties is domiciled or has residence within their territorial jurisdiction, or has assets against which judgment can be levied.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "traditional approach" [...] {{looks to}} {{territorial}} factors, e.g. the domicile or nationality of the parties, where the components comprising each {{cause of action}} occurred, where any relevant assets, whether movable or immovable, are located, etc., and chooses the law or laws that have the greatest connection to the cause(s) of action. Even though {{this is a very}} flexible system, there has been some reluctance to apply it and various [...] "escape devices" [...] have developed, which allow courts to apply their local laws (the lex fori) even though the disputed events took place in a different jurisdiction. The parties themselves may plead the case either to avoid invoking a foreign law or agree to the choice of law, assuming that the judge will not {{of his or her own}} motion go behind the pleadings. Their motive will be pragmatic. Full-scale conflict cases take longer and cost more to litigate. However, the courts in some states are predisposed to prefer the lex fori wherever possible. This may reflect the belief that the interests of justice will be better served if the judges apply the law with which they are most familiar, or it may reflect a more general parochialism in systems not accustomed to considering extraterritorial principles of law. One of the most common judicial strategies is to skew the characterization process. By determining that a claim is one involving a contract instead of tort, or a question of family law instead of a testamentary issue, the Court can change the choice of law rules. For example, if an employee is hired by an employer in State A, is injured due to the employer's negligence in State B, and files a lawsuit to recover for the injury in State A, the court in State A might look to the employment contract to see if it contained a clause that governed the employer's duty of care with respect to the employee. If so, the court may be able characterize the claim as a breach of the contract, instead of a tort, and apply the law of the State A either because it was the place where the contract was made (the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus)</b> or, if it were the place where the wage or salary was to be paid, where the contract was intended to be performed (the lex loci solutionis).|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} law dilemma for {{international}} contracts {{is the subject of}} this thesis. In Part A the concept of party autonomy is discussed and the traditional English approach considered. This involves a critical examination of the proper law doctrine. Part B considers the 'American Solution' with particular reference to the State of New York. Interest Analysis, New York legislation and common law are discussed. A criticism of the New York approach concludes this section. In Part C the limitations on party autonomy are considered in both the English and New York setting. In Part D four alternative proposals are canvassed. The <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> <b>contractus</b> and the lex loci solutionis (the law of the place of contracting and the law of the place of performance) are briefly considered in an historical setting. These two theories contrast with the lex validatis (the law which validates) which an academic suggestion. Finally the European Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations (1980) is chosen as a legislative proposal to resolve the {{choice of law}} dilemma for international contracts. Its provisions are stated and discussed. Parts A to D demonstrate that law to govern international contracts on both sides of the Atlantic is unsatisfactory. To date New Zealand has followed the English proper law doctrine. However it is submitted that the time for change has arrived. It is argued that New Zealand needs a law which advances conflict of laws goals, avoids present difficulties and which is in harmony with domestic contract law. Thus Part E considers such goals and the domestic and conflict of laws provisions of recent national contractual legislation. A legislative solution is then proposed and it is argued that if the proposals were adopted New Zealand would have gone a long way towards resolving choice of law issues for international contracts...|$|E
40|$|Art. 7 of Regulation No. 864 / 07 (so called Rome II Regulation) {{provides}} for a specific conflict of laws rule concerning liability for environmental damage, which empowers the person sustaining the damage {{to choose between the}} application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> damni and the application of the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus. The present article analyses the rationale underpinning the attribution to only one of the parties concerned (the person sustaining the damage) of the unilateral right to choose the law applicable to their relationship and it concludes that the provision at issue does not purport to alter the equal balance between such parties, as it rather aims at ensuring a high level of environmental protection, both by preventing a race {{to the bottom of the}} relevant national legal standards and by discouraging the phenomenon known as environmental dumping. Furthermore, the article compares the specific provision laid down by art. 7 of Rome II Regulation with the general conflict of laws rule provided by art. 4 and art. 14 of the same instrument, with particular reference to the role played – in the peculiar context of environmental liability – by party autonomy and to the different relevance attributed by the said rules to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> damni and to the <b>lex</b> <b>loci</b> actus...|$|R
