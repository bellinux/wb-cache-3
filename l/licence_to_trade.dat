60|$|Of Knox's near kin no more {{is known}} than of his ancestors. He had a brother, William, for whom, in 1552, he {{procured}} a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> in England as {{owner of a}} ship of 100 tons. Even as late as 1656, there were not a dozen ships of this burden in Scotland, so William Knox must have been relatively a prosperous man. In 1544-45, there was a William Knox, a fowler or gamekeeper to the Earl of Westmoreland, who acted as a secret agent between the Scots in English pay and their paymasters. We much later (1559) find the Reformer's brother, William, engaged {{with him in a}} secret political mission to the Governor of Berwick; probably this William knew shy Border paths, and he may have learned them as the Lord Westmoreland's fowler in earlier years.|$|E
60|$|As it chanced, a large Spanish carak named 'Las Cinque Llagas,' or 'The Five Wounds,' {{was about}} to sail for Hispaniola, and having {{obtained}} a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade,</b> I took passage in her under my assumed name of d'Aila, passing myself off as a merchant. To further this deception I purchased goods the value of one hundred and five pesos, and of such nature as I was informed were most readily saleable in the Indies, which merchandise I shipped with me. The vessel was full of Spanish adventurers, mostly ruffians of varied career and strange history, but none the less good companions enough when not in drink. By this time I could speak Castilian so perfectly, and was so Spanish in appearance, {{that it was not}} difficult for me to pass myself off as one of their nation and this I did, inventing a feigned tale of my parentage, and of the reasons that led me to tempt the seas. For the rest, now as ever I kept my own counsel, and notwithstanding my reserve, for I would not mingle in their orgies, I soon became well liked by my comrades, chiefly because of my skill in ministering to their sicknesses.|$|E

25|$|The Patent Rolls which {{inter alia}} record the King and his council {{governing}} Cornwall after {{the creation of}} the Dukedom in 1337. Examples are the inquiries into the use of the English-controlled port of Calais in 1474 (when officials of all counties, including Cornwall, were required to submit returns), the King granting <b>licences</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> <b>to</b> people in Cornwall in 1364, the Duke of Cornwall complaining in 1371 to the King's Council about offences by some local men in Cornwall, and in 1380 the King's Council ordering the Sheriff of Cornwall to arrest and imprison an offender.|$|R
50|$|The book {{describes}} conditions among London horse-drawn taxicab drivers, {{including the}} financial hardship caused {{to them by}} high licence fees and low, legally fixed fares. A page footnote in some editions says that soon after the book was published, the difference between 6-day taxicab <b>licences</b> (not allowed <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> on Sundays) and 7-day taxicab <b>licences</b> (allowed <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> on Sundays) was abolished and the taxicab licence fee was much reduced.|$|R
50|$|In Europe {{printing}} {{was invented}} and widely {{established in the}} 15th and 16th centuries. While governments and church encouraged printing in many ways, which allowed the dissemination of Bibles and government information, works of dissent and criticism could also circulate rapidly. As a consequence, governments established controls over printers across Europe, requiring them <b>to</b> have official <b>licences</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> and produce books. The licenses typically gave printers the exclusive right to print particular works for a fixed period of years, and enabled the printer to prevent others from printing the same work during that period. The licenses could only grant rights to print in {{the territory of the}} state that had granted them, but they did usually prohibit the import of foreign printing.|$|R

25|$|In {{the next}} two years, the company {{established}} its first factory in south India {{in the town of}} Machilipatnam on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted King James I <b>to</b> grant subsidiary <b>licences</b> <b>to</b> other <b>trading</b> companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.|$|R
50|$|The years {{following}} {{the formation of the}} United States, the US government began <b>to</b> regulate the <b>trade</b> industry with the Indian Intercourse Act, which was passed on July 22, 1790. For the first time, The United States regulated trade with the Native Americans. The government established an agency called The Bureau of Indian Affairs which was responsible for issuing <b>licences</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> in the Indian Territory. Because of the increasing movement west in the United States, more and more Native Americans were being pushed off of their native lands and deeper into the Western United States. Wars continued to break out such as Tecumseh's War that was a conflict between the United States Army and a Native American confederacy and that ultimately developed into the War of 1812. These wars with the native population damaged relations between the Indians and the United States. During this time period large and small fur companies began to spring up across America. The American Fur Company, which was established in 1808, was one of the largest trading companies in the United States. As the 1800s continued on fur became less popular as the fashion trends began to shift. The Native American economy relied heavily on goods received from the fur trade and when it slowed they had to turn to other sources to continue receiving goods that they needed. The Native Americans began to sell off their land to settlers in oftentimes forced situations. These tense deals lead to future armed conflicts.|$|R
50|$|After {{completing}} her apprenticeship in 1876, Frederikke Federspiel {{returned to}} Denmark {{where she was}} the first women to apply for a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> in photography. She settled in Aalborg with her sister Sophie. While her sister exercised her trade in lingerie and embroidery in the living room, Frederikke set up a photographic studio on the top floor. There were already two photographers in Aalborg, one of whom was the well-established Heinrich Tønnies. She was aware of the competition but astutely publicized her business, always ensuring she kept up with evolving technology.|$|E

He attempted to improve the educational level in his country by establishing a court school in Herzberg. In 1593 he dissolved the county of Lauterberg-Scharzfeld as a fief, to counter the demands of the Counts of Stolberg. In the same year, he confirmed the Harz mining regulations of 1554 and gave Herzberg citizens the right to brew beer and a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> wine.|$|E
50|$|Ninian was amongst those {{accused of}} the murder of Cardinal David Beaton in 1546, and he joined the Protestant {{garrison}} during the subsequent siege of St Andrews Castle. Ninian was summoned for treason on 10 June 1546. Ninian's older brother, John Cockburn of Ormiston was also accused of involvement in the murder. John was a prominent Protestant and also on good terms with England, having a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> their during the war of the Rough Wooing. According to the Earl of Glencairn, Ninian was a spy during the siege for the Governor, Regent Arran.|$|E
5000|$|The {{blockade}} of American ports later tightened {{to the extent}} that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port. The American frigates [...] and Macedonian ended the war blockaded and hulked in New London, Connecticut. The USS United States and USS Macedonian attempted to set sail to raid British shipping in the Caribbean, but were forced to turn back when confronted with a British squadron, {{and by the end of}} the war, the United States had six frigates and four ships-of-the-line sitting in port. Some merchant ships were based in Europe or Asia and continued operations. Others, mainly from New England, were issued <b>licences</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> by Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren, commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington's army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders' opposition to the war. The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from $130 million in 1807 to $7 million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that ironically went to supply their enemies in Britain or British colonies. The blockade had a devastating effect on the American economy with the value of American exports and imports falling from $114 million in 1811 down to $20 million by 1814 while the US Customs took in $13 million in 1811 and $6 million in 1814, despite the fact that Congress had voted to double the rates. The British blockade further damaged the American economy by forcing merchants to abandon the cheap and fast coastal <b>trade</b> <b>to</b> the slow and more expensive inland roads. In 1814, only 1 out of 14 American merchantmen risked leaving port as a high probability that any ship leaving port would be seized.|$|R
5000|$|Exchequer of the Jews [...] Until their {{expulsion}} in the 13th century, the Jews were {{a highly}} profitable source of royal revenue. Being under the absolute {{control of the}} crown, due to their obligation <b>to</b> obtain royal <b>licence</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> as money-lenders in the kingdom, they could be taxed at will either by taking percentages of their property (e.g. in one instance, one-fourth), or by exacting levies for offences, actual or alleged. The establishment of a dedicated Exchequer of the Jews {{is an indication of}} their fiscal value.|$|R
25|$|Competition {{arose in}} 1635 when Charles I granted a <b>trading</b> <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> Sir William Courteen, which {{permitted}} the rival Courteen association <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> with the east at any location {{in which the}} EIC had no presence.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the removal}} of the East India Company's {{monopoly}} on British trade with India and the Far East in 1834, the Scots-born seaman John Reid, a partner in Cox & Beale, the precursor to Jardine Matheson and Company, discovered a way to circumvent the East India Company's jurisdiction. He took out Austrian citizenship and gained an appointment as Chinese Consul from the Emperor of Austria. As he now had diplomatic residence rights he no longer needed a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> in Canton from the East India Company. Other partners in the firm quickly followed this example. In Hollingworth's case, he became Prussian Vice-Consul under his brother Charles, who was senior to him in the partnership. Charles was killed in Paris in 1824 during a trip to Europe.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{precarious}} position {{between two}} often hostile powers, the lords of Ulster {{in the north}} and the English of the Pale in the south, East Breifne emerged as a very affluent kingdom in the 15th century. In fact, its location was a major contributing factor to its prosperity. The O'Reillys had already been granted a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> in the Pale in 1390, but the establishment of Cavan and its expansion as a market town under Eoghan na Feosaige greatly increased the kingdom's wealth and importance. Due to hostility between the English government and the Irish lordships, Cavan acted as an intermediary. Anglo-Irish merchants could travel safely to Cavan to trade beyond the Pale, and the Irish merchants could sell their wares such as hides, livestock, wool and timber at market, free of any English government trade restrictions.|$|E
50|$|John Cockburn was a {{prominent}} Protestant and also on good terms with England, having a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> there during the war of the Rough Wooing. He was pardoned for communing with the English during Lord Hertford's expedition in 1544. John Knox was tutor {{to one of his}} sons, and the Protestant preacher and martyr George Wishart was arrested by James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, the Sherriff of Haddingtonshire, at his House of Ormiston on 16 January 1546. After negotiation Bothwell took Wishart away to nearby Elphinstone Castle. Soon after on the same night, soldiers of the Governor of Scotland, Regent Arran, arrived to arrest John, his nephew Sandilands of Calder, and Alexander Crichton of Brunstane. Brunstane escaped but his two companions were imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle. John escaped from the castle one morning by going over the wall.|$|E

40|$|Franchising is the {{practice}} where a company (franchisor) gives a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> use its <b>trade</b> name (brand) and its business model (know-how) {{to a particular}} person or group (franchisee) who agrees to act {{in accordance with the}} terms and conditions of a franchise agreement. Many different types of franchise can be found in research and practice. There are two theories explaining the reasons for using franchising: agency theory and resource scarcity theory. Franchising has a major impact on the world economy. In Croatia, franchising is in the early stage of development and {{there is a need to}} encourage businesses to expand this business model as a way of developing and expanding business (franchisor) or starting a new business (franchisee). This paper is divided in two parts. The first part deals with the franchising (definition, theoretical framework and franchising in Croatia), while the second part gives an example of a franchising business in Croatia...|$|R

40|$|The {{company is}} a legal {{structure}} designed to bring together the different parties of a firm—its employees, investors, customers, and suppliers—in the delivery of its corporate purpose. Corporations were established as institutions with autonomous lives—self-standing, legal entities independent of those who worked, financed, and managed them. They were devices to ensure long-term commitment to shared goals and risks, with reciprocal obligations on those engaged in them. A company had to declare its purpose before earning a <b>licence</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade.</b> For example, the East India Company, England’s earliest public company, to issue shares {{to the public as}} permanent capital, was given the monopoly for English trade in Asia with reciprocal obligations to protect trade along its routes. There was a mutual relationship between the company and society and a mutual benefit to both. This was carried through to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with canal and railway companies operating under charter to deliver on a public purpose. It was with freedom of incorporation {{in the middle of the}} nineteenth century that the focus on public purpose gave way to private interest. Nevertheless, public benefit remained at the heart of many private companies, with the families who owned them, such as Cadbury and Rowntree’s, having an interest in wider social purpose beyond pure financial gain. However, to meet the needs for growth in industrial firms in the twentieth century, equity was issued for internal investment and acquisition that diluted these families to the point that they lost control of their companies. Public markets provided capital that promoted economic development and brought transparency to what were previously opaque private firms. However, this came at a price in the separation of ownership from the control of firms. With the separation of ownership and control came a concern, expressed most forcefully by Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means in The Modern Corporation and Private Property, about the need for shareholders to reassert their authority over corporations to ensure that they were run in the interest of their owners, not the self-interest of their managers. The truth, largely forgotten, is that this argument was embedded in a larger vision that wanted economic and political power, in all its guises, to be exercised to benefit the community at large. This pluralist frame of reference subsequently fell out of view, with consequences that reverberate today. So was born what has become a preoccupation ever since with the “agency problem” in the modern corporation of aligning the interests of managers with those of their shareholders to avoid unprofitable growth or undue complacency...|$|E
