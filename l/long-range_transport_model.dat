Wet deposition maps of acidifying components and base cations based on measurements are needed for determining the actual input to ecosystems. Measurement based maps {{can also be used to}} validate the long-range transport models. In this report concentration and wet deposition maps of non-marine sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, hydrogen, sodium, chloride, magnesium, potassium and calcium are presented. These components are mapped on a 50 x 50 km scale over Europe for 1989, based on field measurements made at approximately 750 locations. Point observations are interpolated over Europe using 'kriging'. The patterns observed in the maps agree well with what would be expected from prior knowledge of European emission and climate patterns. High sulphate deposition is observed in the border area between Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, and Ukraine and former Yugoslavia, while nitrate deposition is highest in a zone ranging from southern Scandinavia to northern Italy. Ammonium fluxes are largest in Central Europe. The influence of salt water bodies is evident for sodium, chloride and magnesium. Large calcium fluxes are found in southeast Europe. From an extensive uncertainty analysis to assess the quality of the maps uncertainty was estimated to amount approximately 60 % for an average 50 x 50 km grid cell in Europe. Comparison of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium wet deposition with fluxes calculated by the EMEP <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>model</b> revealed fluxes obtained in this study to be larger, i. e. on average 75 % for sulphate, 20 % for nitrate and 55 % for ammonium...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{scientific}} {{examination of}} the intercontinental dust transport has a long history, a vigorous present, and a promising future. Unlike the study of man-made pollution and bio-mass smoke, the fundamental causes of dust production, the <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> {{as well as the}} factors governing the removal processes of windblown dust were well established by about 1900. Much of the past century was devoted to the quantification of these processes using surface concentration monitors, aircraft sampling, and <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>modeling</b> tools. By the 1990 s, several new satellite sensors allowed a global-scale observation of the dynamic dust pattern. The aerosol climatologies derived from satellite data now highlight, in a semi-quantitative manner, the global distribution of dust sources. The dynamic daily aerosol data from several satellites, along with routine surface monitors now facilitates the quantitative documentation of individual intercontinental dust transport events from Sahara to Europe and the Americas, {{as well as from the}} Gobi desert to North America. In fact, the spectacular dust transport events visualized through the new satellite sensors along with the good performance of dust transport simulation and prediction models provide the most compelling evidence of intercontinental aerosol transport.

40|$|The {{response}} of a selected number of chemical species is inspected {{with respect to}} climate change. The coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model ECHAM 4 -OPYC 3 is providing meteorological fields for the Chemical <b>long-range</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Model</b> DEHM. Three selected decades (1990 s, 2040 s and 2090 s) are inspected. The 1990 s are used as a reference and validation period. In this decade {{an evaluation of the}} output from the DEHM model with ECHAM 4 -OPYC 3 meteorology input data is carried out. The model results are tested against similar model simulations with MM 5 meteorology and against observations from the EMEP monitoring sites in Europe. The test results from the validation period show that the overall statistics (e. g. mean values and standard deviations) are similar for the two simulations. However, as one would expect the model setup with climate input data fails to predict correctly the timing of the variability in the observations. The overall performance of the ECHAM 4 -OPYC 3 setup as meteorological input to the DEHM model is shown to be acceptable according to the applied ranking method. It is concluded that running a chemical <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>model</b> on data from a "free run" climate model is scientifically sound. From the model runs of the three decades, it is found that the overall trend detected {{in the evolution of the}} chemical species, is the same between the 1990 decade and the 2040 decade and between the 2040 decade and the 2090 decade, respectively. The dominating impacts from climate change on a large number of the chemical species are related to the predicted temperature increase. Throughout the 21 th century the ECHAM 4 -OPYC 3 projects a global mean temperature increase of 3 K with local maxima up to 11 K in the Arctic winter based on the IPCC A 2 emission scenario. As a consequence of this temperature increase, the temperature dependent biogenic emission of isoprene is predicted to increase significantly over land by the DEHM model. This leads to an increase in the O 3 production and together with an increase in water vapor to an increase in the number of free OH radicals. Furthermore this increase in the number of OH radicals contributes to a significant change in the typical life time of many species, since OH are participating in a large number of chemical reactions. It is e. g. found that more SO 4 2 &minus; will be present in the future over the already polluted areas and this increase can be explained by an enhanced conversion of SO 2 to SO 4 2 &minus;...|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of atmospheric sulfur deposition to forest {{is difficult because}} of its complex aerodynamic structure. Therefore, atmospheric deposition of sulfur to forest is often estimated by means of measuring throughfall fluxes onto the forest floor. In this paper, reported measurements of throughfall fluxes in European forests are analyzed. These fluxes are compared to deposition to bulk collectors located in nearby open land, {{to get an idea}} of the filtering efficiency of forests. In addition, fluxes are compared with deposition estimates from a <b>long‐range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>model</b> of air pollutants, linked to an emission generation model. According to reported measurements from 52 European conifer stands, we found that the sulfur flux was 3. 8  ±  2. 3 times greater onto the forest floor than onto precipitation collectors. In a similar data set of 13 deciduous stands this ratio was 2. 3  ±  0. 9. The ratio of throughfall flux to model estimate was 1. 8  ±  0. 9 in coniferous stands and 0. 9  ±  0. 3 in deciduous stands. For sites that are located in moderately to highly sulfur polluted areas, it is assumed that throughfall fluxes give a good estimation of the atmospheric sulfur deposition. We conclude that (1) sulfur deposition to forests is 1. 5 to 6 times higher than deposition to smooth receptor surfaces due to an efficient filtering by the forest canopy, (2) average annual sulfur deposition at a given location is 50 – 100 % greater on conifers than on deciduous trees, (3) the existing European scale model that links sulfur deposition to the pollution generation processes is quite accurate as far as deciduous forests are concerned, and (4) the model underestimates deposition to coniferous forest...|$|E

The pattern in mean acidity and wet deposition results partly from depletion of the pollutants with distance from the major source areas of Europe, but also from meteorological and orographic effects. Analysis of rainfall data shows {{that about half of}} the north-west-south-east gradient in mean acidity results from orographic effects. These enhance the impacts of relatively unpolluted rain in the west and shelter east coast regions from the same, while relatively polluted rain from easterly trajectories is enhanced on high ground in the east and west coast districts are sheltered.

Sourcereceptor relationships estimated by the models are also compared. The models show a high degree of consistency in identifying the main sourcereceptor relationships, as well as in the relative contributions of wet/dry pathways for removal. But at some locations estimated deposition amounts can vary by a factor or 5. The influence of model structure and parameters on model performance is discussed. The main factors determining the deposition fields are the emissions and underlying meteorological fields.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the worst-case case dose commitments and potential consequences of accidental releases at nuclear risk sites in the Russian Far East. The nuclear risk sites of concern are near Petropavlovsk (52055 'N & 158030 'E) and Vladivostok (42055 'N & 132025 'E). The region of interest includes the territories of the Russian Far East, China, Japan, North and South Korea, State of Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Mongolia, Burma, Hong Kong, Laos, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. The transboundary region (i. e., that outside of Russia) is of primary interest because the largest doses resulting from hypothetical releases from these sites would reside in Russia and would be examined using site specific information and detailed models that were unavailable for this study. However, the transboundary region can be examined, in general, using existing information and models. The The methodology from the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) 1993 Report was used in this study to estimate effective dose commitments. It is recognized that this methodology is not the only acceptable manner to estimate such doses; the methodology was selected because it is independent, defensible, and, because it is based upon a multiplicative model, lends itself to a facile examination of parameter variation.

The main questions addressed were the following: Which geographical territories are at the highest risk from hypothetical releases at these sites? What are the probabilities for radionuclide atmospheric transport and deposition on different neighboring countries in case of accidents at the sites? For analysis, several research tools developed within the Arctic Risk Project were applied: 1. isentropic trajectory model to calculate a multiyear dataset of 5 -day forward trajectories that originated over the site locations at various altitudes; 2. DERMA <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>model</b> to simulate 5 -day atmospheric transport, dispersion, and deposition of ^ 137 Cs for 1 -day release (at the rate of 10 ^ 10 Bq/s); and 3. a set of statistical methods (including exploratory, cluster, and probability fields analyses) for evaluation of trajectory and dispersion modeling results. The possible impact (on annual, seasonal, and monthly basis) of selected risk sites on neighboring geographical regions is evaluated using a set of various indicators. For trajectory modeling, the indicators examined are: 1. atmospheric transport pathways, 2. airflow probability fields, 3. fast transport probability fields, 4. maximum possible impact zone, 5. maximum reaching distance, and 6. typical transport time fields. For dispersion modeling, the indicators examined are: 1. time integrated air concentration, 2. dry deposition, and 3. wet deposition. It was found for both sites that within the boundary layer the westerly flows are dominant throughout the year (more than 60 % of the time), increasing with altitude of free troposphere up to 85 % of the time.

Use of these four descriptions in a box model resulted in very different global fates, particularly for PAHs such as chrysene and benzo[a]pyrene. By reviewing published gas-particle distributions of PAHs, we found evidence for both absorptive and adsorptive contributions. Based on results from laboratory and controlled field studies we suggest that on average, octanol-air partitioning (K-oa) is a good approximation for the OM absorption of PAHs. However, higher concentrations in particles than {{could be explained by}} OM absorption were found in selected gas-particle partitioning field studies, which were corrected for gaseous adsorption to the filter.

Apparent adsorption coefficients to BC, KBC-air, were derived from field studies and showed good agreement with those predicted by adsorption onto diesel soot. For atmospheric <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> we suggest the use of a dual OM absorption and BC adsorption model, with BC properties being approximated by diesel soot: K-p = 10 (- 12) (f(om) 1 /rho(oct) K-oa + f(BC) 1 /rho(BC) Ksoot-air a(atm-BC) /a(soot)).

40|$|Abstract Emissions of sulphur and {{oxidized}} {{nitrogen compounds}} in Europe {{have been reduced}} following a series of control measures {{during the last two}} decades. These changes have taken place during a period in which the primary gases and the wet deposition throughout Europe were extensively monitored. Since the end of the 1970 s, for example land based sulphur emissions declined by between 90 and 70 % depend-ing on the region. Over the same period the total deposition of sulphur and its partitioning into wet and dry deposition have declined, but the spatial pattern in the reduction in deposition differs from that of emission and has changed with time. Such non-linearities in the emission-deposition relationship are important to understand as they complicate the process of assessing the effects of emission reduction strategies. Observed non-linearities in terrestrial sul-phur emission-deposition patterns have been identi-fied in north west Europe due to increases in marine emissions, and are currently slowing the recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Changes in the relative amounts of SO 2 and NH 3 in air {{over the last two decades}} have also changed the affinity of terrestrial surfaces for SO 2 and have therefore changed the deposition velocity of SO 2 over substantial areas. The consequence of this effect has been the very rapid reduction in ambient SO 2 concentration in some of the major source areas of Europe, where NH 3 did not change much. Interactions between the different pollutants, generating non-line-arities are now being incorporated in <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> to simulate the effects of historical emission trends and to provide projections into the future.

These approaches are used to analyze the data obtained during the ETEX- 1 exercise, and we show how to exploit these approaches to select subsets of independent models whose performance is comparable to those from the whole ensemble...|$|R
40|$|The Acid Deposition and Oxidant Model (ADOM) is an Eulerian <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> and {{deposition}} <b>model.</b> One of {{the most}} highly parametrized and least well established parts of the model is the cloud module that describes cloud formation, pollutant scavenging, aqueous-phase chemistry and wet deposition. As a means of gaining insight into the cloud module, results from simulations with the module are compared with the results of simulations for equivalent conditions with a three-dimensional dynamic cloud chemistry model. Comparisons of results for a variety of initial conditions show that wet-deposition of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium ions tend to be underpredicted by the cloud module and that the pH of the rain is overpredicted. However, the differences are for the most part not large. Concentrations of hydrogen peroxide deposited at the surface are significantly smaller in the ADOM module than in the cloud chemistry model.

The acidification model MAGIC {{was applied to}} the Vikedal and Tovdal rivers in southern Norway. Water response is delayed by about 10 years at both rivers delay is due to release of old sulphate at Vikedal, and cation exchange at Tovdal. Assuming that the Oslo protocol is fully implemented by the year 2010, about 60 % of the increase of ANC will occur in the next 13 years (1997 - 2010) with a new steady-state reached by about 2046. Liming requirement for both rivers will be reduced to about 90 % of present-day levels by the year 2010 and to about 70 % by the year 2046.

40|$|A simple data {{assimilation}} algorithm {{based on}} statistical interpolation {{has been developed}} and coupled to a <b>long-range</b> chemistry <b>transport</b> <b>model,</b> the Danish Eulerian Operational Model (DEOM), applied for air pollution forecasting at the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI), Denmark. In this paper, the algorithm and the results from experiments designed to find the optimal setup of the algorithm are described. The algorithm has been developed and optimized via eight different experiments where the results from different model setups have been tested against measurements from the EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) network covering a half-year period, April–September 1999. The best performing setup of the data assimilation algorithm for surface ozone concentrations has been found, including the combination of determining the covariances using the Hollingsworth method, varying the correlation length according {{to the number of}} adjacent observation stations and applying the assimilation routine at three successive hours during the morning. Improvements in the correlation coefficient in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 21 between the results from the reference and the optimal configuration of the data assimilation algorithm, were found. The data assimilation algorithm will in the future be used in the operational THOR integrated air pollution forecast system, which includes the DEOM...|$|R
40|$|For {{every two}} pounds of cocaine smuggled into the US, drug traffikers {{are being forced}} to clandestinely ship three pounds of money back out for {{subsequent}} laundering. Based on tracer technology developed for validation of <b>long-range</b> atmospheric <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> and other commercial applications, it is shown that US currency can be tagged with a minute amount (about 1 ppm by weight of a bill) of perfluorocharbon tracer (PFT) material that is sufficient to last for about 30 years and yet provide a vapor emission rate suitable for detectability of modest caches of contraband money in vehicles at border crossings, on aircraft at international terminals, and in buildings. The cost of tagging is less than $ 5 per million bills; the taggant quantity should have no impact on the feel of a bill. The low emission rate would not allow detectability of usual amounts of money in typical scenarios, providing an essential degree of privacy, but extraordinary amounts would be detectable using specialized instrumentation and know-how not easily attainable but commercially in production; an example of sub-part-per-quadrillion detection of a proposed PFT taggant is demonstrated using a prototype commercial unit. An outline of a research and demonstration program to achieve this capability and details of the proposed tagging and detection procedures already indicate that the concept is technically feasible...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrographic {{enhancement}} of wet deposition {{arising from the}} 'seeder-feeder' effect is, by necessity, highly parametrised in <b>long-range</b> <b>transport</b> <b>models</b> of acid deposition that are long-term (i. e. annual average) and spatially resolved at tens of kilometres. Here, we describe a mechanistic approach to the incorporation of these mechanisms into such a model. The model formulation required the following: precipitation rate by direction and quantification of the fractions that are orographic and non-orographic; treatment of the fast oxidation of sulfur dioxide in clouds; the directionality of the seeder-feeder process; and a quantitative basis for increasing wet deposition factors {{to account for the}} seeder-feeder process. The directionality of non-orographic precipitation was determined from meteorological data at 47 sites across the UK. Orographic precipitation varies on a much finer scale than can be interpolated from measurements, and thus a modelling approach was adopted. The directionality of the seeder-feeder effect was taken from measurements. The enhancement factor of the orographic component of precipitation, assumed to represent feeder-rain, was determined from a review of measurements. Fast oxidation of sulfur dioxide is an observed phenomenon in cap-cloud, but limited in duration. An adjustment was made to the sulfur dioxide oxidation rate in the model in locations where cap-cloud was assumed to be present. The results from the model were compared with UK deposition budgets and enhanced wet deposition maps. The revised parametrisation underestimated the UK wet deposition budgets of oxidised N and S, but spatial patterns of deposition were improved for much of the UK. It was concluded that this was a satisfactory outcome given the constraints of the statistical approach of weighting of deposition at receptors utilising straight line trajectories. The sensitivity of the model to directional constraints of seeder-feeder enhancement was tested and it was concluded that a fairly narrow constraint resulted in similar estimations to a broader one, and the broader constraint was thus adopted as frontal conditions which result in the process arrive from a fairly broad band of directions. When enhancement was allowed to occur from all directions, UK wet deposition of oxidised N and S was increased by 10 %. The sensitivity to the enhancement factor on wet deposition was tested and found to be relatively robust. An increase in the enhancement factor from 2 to 6 resulted in increases in UK wet deposition of oxidised N and S of 9 and 6 %, respectively.
