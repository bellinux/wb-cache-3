5000|$|The {{base for}} the Hưng Hóa {{campaign}} was Sơn Tây. General Louis Brière de l'Isle's 1st Brigade set out from Hanoi on 5 April, after parading through the town in an imposing display of strength. General François de Négrier's 2nd Brigade, which was deployed around Bắc Ninh and Phu Liang Giang, set off for Hanoi on 4 April. On 5 April the 2nd Brigade spent the entire day crossing the Red River, and on the next day, it paraded through Hanoi on its way west to Sơn Tây. Marching overland from Hanoi past the battlefields of 1883, the two brigades reached Sơn Tây on 6-7 April, respectively. On 8 April both brigades <b>left</b> <b>Sơn</b> Tây, marching toward the Black River, so as to approach Hưng Hóa {{from the south and}} the southeast, respectively. Millot sent Colonel Belin's marine infantry marching regiment on ahead to seize the village of Tai Bắc on the Black River and fortify it as a {{base for the}} river crossing and subsequent march on Hưng Hóa. On 10 April, after a day spent scouting ahead, Brière de l'Isle's 1st Brigade reached the Black River. On 11 April, the brigade set off southwards at dawn on a wide outflanking march to threaten Liu Yongfu's line of retreat. The brigade crossed the Black River and marched northwest along the mountain path, approaching Hưng Hóa from the south.|$|E

40|$|Abstract During the {{development}} of the female rat, a maturing process of the factors that regulate the functioning of the ovaries takes place, resulting in different responses according to the age of the animal. Studies show that peripheral innervation is one relevant factor involved. In the present study we analyzed the anatomical relationship between the neurons in the celiac-superior mesenteric ganglia (CSMG), and the right or left ovary in 24 or 28 days old female pre-pubertal rats. The participation of the superior ovarian nerve (SON) in the communication between the CSMG and the ovaries was analyzed in animals with unilateral section of the SON, previous to injecting true blue (TB) into the ovarian bursa. The animals were killed seven days after treatment. TB stained neurons were quantified at the superior mesenteric-celiac ganglia. The number of labeled neurons in the CSMG of rats treated at 28 days of age was significantly higher than those treated on day 24. At age 24 days, injecting TB into the right ovary resulted in neuron stains {{on both sides of the}} celiac ganglia; whereas, injecting the left side the stains were exclusively ipsilateral. Such asymmetry was not observed when the rats were treated at age of 28 days. In younger rats, sectioning the <b>left</b> <b>SON</b> resulted in significantly lower number of stained neurons in the left ganglia while sectioning the right SON did not modify the number of stained neurons. When sectioning of the SON was performed to 28 days old rats, no staining was observed. Present results show that the number and connectivity of post-ganglionic neurons of the CSMG connected to the ovary of juvenile female rats change as the animal mature; that the SON plays a role in this communication process as puberty approaches; and that this maturing process is different for the right or the left ovary. </p...|$|E
40|$|Assume {{nothing is}} known about the probabilities of taxons except that the Grst taxon is more {{probable}} than the second one, the second is more probable than the third, and so on. Then to construct the optimal key, one can regard the ith taxon as having probability proportional to (i- I) ‘-l/ii_ 1. xntroduction Dichotomous keys are widely used in biology, mineralogy, pattern recognition, and other areas. Such a key is labelled c 7 Tnplete binary tree. The label of a leaf is the name of a taxon and the label of any ther node is an attribute. One goes to the right son of a node if the taxon has the corresponding attribute, otherwise one goes to the <b>left</b> <b>son.</b> Fig. 1 shows a key of dragonties of the sub-family Libellulinae [l]. The key is based on analysis of the wings of a dragonfly. The first attribute (Y ~ is equal to 0 if the last antenodal vein of the wing is complete, 1 if it is incomplete. The attribute cy 2 is equal to 0 if the sectors of the arculus (an element of the wing) are divided from the very base, and equal to 1 if there is a stem {{at the top of the}} sectors. etc. There are many ways to construct a key, and we want an efficient one. If one wants to reduce the volume of a key to the minimum, one can use the results in [2]. Our goal here is to construct keys with the minimum expected time of identification. Suppose that we are given it taxons, it>O, and let Pi be the probability of occurrence of the ith taxon, such that P 1 + P 2 + l l l + P,, = 1. If the length of a path from the root of a determining tree 7 ’ up to a leaf corresponding to the ith taxon: is 4 (T), then the expected nu 4 *aber of attributes needed for identification (ex-pected time) is i =...|$|E
