5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Medinet Madi, show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{is known}} for its {{dramatically}} placed castles, many of which date from the late medieval era. In contrast to England, where the wealthy began to move towards more comfortable grand houses, these continued to be built into the modern period, developing into the style of Scottish Baronial architecture in the 19th century, popular amongst the minor aristocracy and merchant class. This building type, often built with defence in mind {{in the form of the}} tower house, was characterised by corbelled turrets and crow-stepped gables marked the first uniquely Scottish mode of building. Ceilings of these houses were decorated with vividly coloured painting on boards and beams, using emblematic motifs from European pattern books or the artist's interpretation of trailing grotesque patterns. The grandest buildings of this type were the royal palaces in this style at Linlithgow, Holyrood, Falkland and the remodelled Stirling Castle, all of which have elements of continental European architecture, particularly from France and the Low Countries, adapted to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl). More modest buildings with continental influences can be seen in the late 15th century western tower of St Mary's parish church, Dundee, and tollbooths <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Dunbar.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} station {{building and}} ticket office were demolished during {{the mid to}} late 1980s. By that time, the station building had been heavily vandalised. Station shelters <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Dry Creek were installed, and these remained until a new station shelter was erected in 2001. At the same time, the western platform was upgraded.|$|R
5000|$|Before winning Wimbledon he {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "Grass is just for cows." [...] He thought that tennis should be played on {{artificial}} surfaces as opposed to lawn tennis courts <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Wimbledon. This statement has been echoed throughout the years by numerous players including Ivan Lendl, Marat Safin, Marcelo Ríos, and, despite his 1973 victory at Wimbledon, Jan Kodeš.|$|R
5|$|After invading Britain in 43AD the Romans {{crossed the}} Humber Estuary in 71AD {{to invade the}} Northumbrian {{territory}} of the Parisi tribe. From their bridgehead at Petuaria they travelled northwards and built roads along the Wolds to Derventio, present day Malton, and then westwards to the River Ouse where they built the fort of Eboracum. There is evidence of extensive use of the light soils of the Wolds for grain farming in the Roman era. Several Roman villas which were the centres of large agricultural estates have been identified around Langton and Rudston. In the low-lying lands {{on either side of}} the Wolds there was an increase in the number of settlements between 500BC and 500AD as the land became drier and more accessible due to a fall in sea level. The lower-lying land was used for stock breeding. During the last years of Roman occupation Anglo-Saxon raiders were troubling the area and, by the second half of the 5thcentury, settlement by Anglian invaders was taking place in east Yorkshire. Village names containing the elements -ing, -ingham or -ham are Anglian settlement names. As Christianity became established in the area from the 7thcentury onwards, several cemeteries <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Garton on the Wolds show evidence of the abandonment of pagan burial practices. In 867AD the Great Danish Army captured the Anglian town of York, and the remnants of the army settled in Yorkshire from 876AD when their leader Halfdan shared out the land among them. Scandinavian settlements have names including the elements -by and -thorpe. Scandinavian rule in the area came to an end in 954AD with the death of their ruler Eric Bloodaxe.|$|E

50|$|Large {{numbers of}} Japanese troops drowned while {{attempting}} to swim away from the Rock. Many of them, estimated in the thousands, sealed themselves in the numerous subterranean passages of the island. In compliance with the philosophy of Bushidō, the defenders, hiding in caves and tunnels <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Malinta Hill, preferred to commit suicide rather than surrender. Corregidor reverberated with many underground explosions for days afterward.|$|R

5000|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature in}} the fort is that its buildings are mostly underground, the escarpment being honeycombed with caves, some of them plain and shapeless, but others regular buildings with pillar-supported roofs. These caves are locally known as Gavali Rajas houses. Some of these seem to be of great age while yet others apparently much modern. All the important caves face south-west, and are nearly on <b>one</b> level <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Ellora (Verul) in Aurangabad district.|$|R
500|$|Ionian lava lakes are {{depressions}} partially {{filled with}} molten lava {{covered by a}} thin solidified crust. These lava lakes are directly connected to a magma reservoir lying below. Observations of thermal emission at several Ionian lava lakes reveal glowing molten rock along the patera margin, caused by the lake's crust breaking up {{along the edge of}} the patera. [...] Over time, because the solidified lava is denser than the still-molten magma below, this crust can founder, triggering an increase in thermal emission at the volcano. For some lava lakes, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Pele, this occurs continuously, making Pele one of the brightest emitters of heat in the near-infrared spectrum on Io. At other sites, such as at Loki Patera, this can occur episodically. During an overturning episode at these more quiescent lava lakes, a wave of foundering crust spreads out across the patera at the rate of about [...] per day, with new crust forming behind it until the entire lake has been resurfaced. Another eruption would only begin once the new crust has cooled and thickened enough for it to no longer be buoyant over the molten lava. During an overturning episode, Loki can emit up to ten times more heat than when its crust is stable.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time, Dome {{developed}} a solution gas gathering business based on oilfields around Steelman, Saskatchewan. And in Alberta, plants <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Whitecourt began processing liquids-rich gas in 1961. Amoco began planning this gas plant in 1957, as local gas discoveries made it clear a major new plant was necessary. When it went into production, West Whitecourt quickly began to boast the biggest volumes of condensate production in Canada: [...] And from there, volumes went up. Since that time, bigger plants have made the records of 1962 seem small. However, this plant was nonetheless an industry pioneer.|$|E

The result was that Melton Constable, a small village that began as a parish with 19 houses, became a junction of four new railways lines connecting Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. The facilities grew to cover [...] that were once farmland. The site included an erecting shop along with this two long 'workshops'. There was an iron foundry, gasworks for the village, drawing offices and accommodation. The site was also served by a small miniature railway <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> Horwich and Crewe.|$|E
2500|$|In its decision, the Court {{flipped the}} Second Circuit’s {{reasoning}} by rejecting the Gardner-Denver line of precedent and embracing {{that of its}} 1991 decision in Gilmer. [...] In doing so, the Court eliminated the widely held legal distinction between mandatory arbitration agreements, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that had been upheld in Gilmer, and collective bargaining agreements, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> issue in both Gardner-Denver and 14 Penn Plaza.

2500|$|A second memorial, {{specific}} to the Rough Riders, was erected at Las Guasimas. The provenance of this memorial is not clear. It was shaped much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>at</b> San Juan Hill although the building materials were much different. This monument was set on a flagstone base. Rough-hewn pieces of dark grey granite were cemented {{together to form a}} rectangular plinth (square in cross-section) atop the flagstones. A tapered square column, made of the same rough-hewn, cemented granite, rose to a flat top. An artillery shell was placed atop the column, and a bronze plaque affixed to its face.

Theodore Dreiser closed his tragedy Sister Carrie, set in the 1890s, with the suicide of one of the main characters in a Bowery flophouse. The Bowery, which marked the eastern border of the slum of [...] "Five Points", had also become the turf of one of America's earliest street gangs, the nativist Bowery Boys. In the spirit of social reform, the first YMCA opened on the Bowery in 1873; another notable religious and social welfare institution established during this period was the Bowery Mission, which was founded in 1880 at 36 Bowery by Reverend Albert Gleason Ruliffson. The mission has relocated along the Bowery throughout its lifetime. From 1909 to the present, the mission has remained at 227–229 Bowery.|$|E
