40|$|There is a {{developed}} {{design of}} the external cylindrical nozzle with a vacuum camera. The paper studies the nozzle controllability of flow rate via regulated connection of the evacuated chamber to the atmosphere through an air throttle. Working capacity of the nozzle with inlet round or triangular orifice are researched. The gap is provided in the nozzle design between the external wall of the <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice</b> and the end face of the straight case in the nozzle case. The presented mathematical model of the nozzle with the evacuated chamber allows us to estimate the expected vacuum amount in the compressed section of a stream and maximum permissible absolute pressure at the <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice.</b> The paper gives experimental characteristics of the fluid flow process through the nozzle for different values of internal diameter of a straight case and an extent of its end face remoteness from an external wall of the <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice.</b> It estimates how geometry of nozzle constructive elements influences on the volume flow rate. It is established that the nozzle capacity significantly depends on the shape of <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice.</b> Triangular orifice nozzles steadily work {{in the mode of}} completely filled flow area of the straight case at much more amounts of the limit pressure of the flow. Vacuum depth in the evacuated chamber also depends on the shape of inlet orifice: the greatest vacuum is reached in a nozzle with the triangular orifice which 1. 5 times exceeds the greatest vacuum with the round orifice. Possibility to control nozzle capacity through the regulated connection of the evacuated chamber to the atmosphere was experimentally estimated, thus depth of flow rate regulation of the nozzle with a triangular orifice was 45 % in comparison with 10 % regulation depth of the nozzle with a round orifice. Depth of regulation calculated by a mathematical model appeared to be much more. The paper presents experimental dependences of the flow coefficients of nozzle input orifice on the vacuum depth in the chamber. Research findings allowed us to express opinion that accepted in the works on "Fluid Mechanics " equality of pressure values in the center of cross-stream gravity and in its surrounding steam-gas medium is incorrect.

40|$|Flow boiling in a {{microchannel}} {{heat sink}} is {{considered as a}} suitable and an efficient method to dissipate high heat flux from a small surface. Especially, this technique can achieve uniform axial temperature distribution and low noise with a little coolant and low pumping power consumption.

In this thesis, the fundamental investigations on the flow instability in a single vertical microtube are conducted.

30|$|The {{streamlines}} {{inside the}} air and water phases for a superficial liquid velocity of 0.10  m/s and superficial gas velocities of 31.77  m/s 18.03  m/s downstream of the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> section are presented in Fig.  3 a, b, respectively, to show {{the characteristics of the}} flow field. It can be seen that when the amplitude of the forming wave at the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> section reaches its maximum value, it starts to move upwards. In Fig.  3 a, the liquid phase travels as thin film and it is carried out of the pipe due to the higher gas velocity (31.77  m/s) resulting in an annular flow pattern. The waves in this flow pattern tend to be flatter. All simulated cases that fall within the annular flow regime show that all the liquid film moves upward out of the pipe. As the superficial gas velocity reduces to 18.03  m/s, the drag force imparted on the liquid film becomes insufficient to carry the liquid phase to the pipe exit section while keeping the typical annular flow pattern. As a result, the liquid film thickens, thus producing a circulatory flow region in the liquid phase causing part of the liquid film to move downward near the pipe wall. This is accompanied by the formation of flooding waves that have higher frequencies and tends to cause the continuous throwing of the liquid phase (water) in the region located above the <b>liquid</b> <b>inlet</b> section. In all the simulated cases that fall under the churn flow regime, part of the liquid film flows downwards periodically. This is considered to be the on-set of film reversal and the accompanied gas velocity is called the critical gas velocity.|$|R

One dimensional homogeneous equilibrium {{model has been}} used to simulate the two-phase flow. The nonlinear mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are solved along the characteristic directions by using implicit finite difference scheme. The virtue of this scheme is that it handles the boundary conditions naturally. This scheme is fast because the time steps can be greater than that given by Courant-Friedrichs-Levvy condition. The numerical scheme is sufficiently general and can handle axially varying heat flux and different combinations of inlet and exit boundary conditions of enthalpy, mass flux and pressure and multiple channels. No assumptions regarding constant properties and incompressibility have been taken.

40|$|At rated conditions, {{a natural}} {{circulation}} {{boiling water reactor}} (NCBWR) depends completely on buoyancy to remove heat from the reactor core. This raises the issue of potential unstable flow oscillations. The objective of this work is to assess the characteristics of stability in a NCBWR at rated conditions, and the sensitivity to design and operating conditions in comparison to previous BWRs. Two kinds of instabilities, namely Ledinegg flow excursion and Density Wave Oscillations (DWO), have been studied. The DWO analyses were conducted for three oscillation modes: Single Channel thermal-hydraulic stability, coupled neutronics regionwide out-of-phase stability and core-wide in-phase stability. Using frequency domain methods, {{the three types of}} DWO stability characteristics of the NCBWR and their sensitivity to the operating parameters and design features have been determined. The characteristic equations are constructed from linearized equations, which are derived for small deviations around steady operating conditions. The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is used in our analysis as a reference NCBWR design. It is found that the ESBWR can be stable with a large margin around the operating conditions by proper choice of the core <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice</b> scheme, and for appropriate power to flow ratios. In single channel stability analysis, neutronic feedback is neglected. Design features of the ESBWR, including shorter fuel bundle and use of part-length rods in the assemblies, tend to improve the thermal-hydraulic stability performance. However, the thermalhydraulic stability margin is still lower than that of a typical BWR at rated conditions. In neutronic-coupled out-of-phase as well as in-phase stability analysis, the perturbation decay ratios for ESBWR at our assumed conditions are higher than that of a typical BWR (Peach Bottom 2) at rated conditions, due to its lower thermal-hydraulic stability margin and higher neutronic feedback. Nevertheless, the stability criteria are satisfied. To evaluate the NCBWR stability performance, comparison with BWR/Peach Bottom 2 at both the rated condition and maximum natural circulation condition has been conducted. Sensitivity studies are performed on the effects of design features and operating parameters, including chimney length, <b>inlet</b> <b>orifice</b> coefficient, power, flow rate, and axial power distribution, reactivity coefficients, fuel pellet-clad gap conductance. It can be concluded that the NCBWR and BWR stabilities are similarly sensitive to operating parameters. Tokyo Electric Power CompanyU. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissio...|$|R
