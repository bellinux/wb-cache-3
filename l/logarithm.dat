40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} analyzing students' understanding {{of the concept of}} <b>logarithms.</b> Traditionally students are introduced to logarithmic functions as the inverse of exponential functions, even though <b>logarithms</b> were invented independently of exponents. In this study, a review of the historical genesis of <b>logarithms,</b> the literature review on the understanding of exponential and logarithmic functions, and a review of several textbooks from different times and geographical places are presented. These reviews allow the identification of two notions of logarithms: arithmetic and functional. Even though current curriculum introduces the functional notion of <b>logarithms,</b> attained curriculum focuses on the arithmetic notion of <b>logarithms.</b> In addition, the importance of <b>logarithms,</b> that is, their use in converting multiplication of numbers into addition of <b>logarithms</b> of numbers, has not been highlighted. I conducted six clinical interviews with students from prerequisite mathematics courses and a core mathematics course. This data is analyzed within the context of APOS theory to identify students' difficulties in understanding the concept of <b>logarithms.</b> The results reveal that most students' understanding of the arithmetic notion of <b>logarithms</b> does not go beyond the "process" level, since understanding the arithmetic notion of <b>logarithms</b> as undoing what exponentiation does require an understanding of exponentiation with real exponents...|$|R

5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the <b>logarithm</b> of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the <b>logarithm</b> of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun.
