In this paper, two simple <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> approaches, which are known as 'quantity-based consolidation' and 'time and quantity-based consolidation' are evaluated. These approaches are 'non-recurrent', in which the logistics system has a 'target time' or 'target weight' before the accumulation of the orders. Some performance measures for these methods are investigated through a case study. The study is performed in a 3 P-logistics company operating from Gaziantep. Due {{to the complexity of}} the logistics processes, effects of the <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> methods are evaluated via process modelling and simulation.

40|$|In recent years, the {{reduction}} of freight truck trips has been a common policy goal. To this end, policies aimed at influencing <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> have been suggested and implemented, resulting in higher gross vehicle weights. The purpose of such policies has generally been to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. However, trucks cause most of the damage incurred by pavements. The supply chain associated with pavement maintenance and construction releases significant air emissions, raising {{the question of whether}} increased vehicle weights may cause unintended environmental consequences. This paper presents scenarios with estimated emissions resulting from <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> and changes in load factors.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} of computer systems has increased at a steep rate in recent years. Following extensive energyrelated {{research and practice}} in the hardware and OS communities, much {{attention has been paid}} to developing energy-efficient applications. With database systems being a heavy energy consumer in modern data centers, we face the challenge of designing DBMSs with energy as a first-class performance goal. This paper presents our on-going work in designing and implementing a DB-MS that enables significant energy conservations while maintaining other performance targets. We follow two new strategies in DBMS implementation to achieve our system design goal. The first one is to change the resource consumption patterns via energy-aware query optimization and reorganizing data records to enable <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> in disks. The second strategy is active control of power modes of hardware (i. e., CPU and hard disks) toward energy reduction.

40|$|Abstract — Technology mapping aims at searching an opti-mal {{implementation}} for a Boolean netlist using gates from {{a technology}} library. Compared with its NP-complete area minimization counterpart, DAG mapping for delay minimiza-tion is considered much sophisticated because matching choices {{must be made}} without knowing actual arrival times and output loads. Traditional approaches to this problem involve too many approximate simplifications, and are far from accurate. In contrast, this paper tackles this problem directly under load-dependent DAG mapping. The enabling techniques for accu-rate optimization include on-the-fly load-estimation refinement, breadth-first backward covering for <b>load</b> <b>consolidation,</b> and use of a piecewise linear model for accurate timing calculation.

40|$|Abstract — On a {{multi-socket}} architecture {{with load}} below peak, {{as is often}} the case in a server installation, it is common to consolidate load onto fewer sockets to save processor power. However, this can increase main memory power consumption due to the decreased total cache space. This paper describes inter-socket victim cacheing, a technique that enables such a system to do both <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> and cache aggregation at the same time. It uses the last level cache of an idle processor in a connected socket as a victim cache, holding evicted data from the active processor. This enables expensive main memory accesses to be replaced by cheaper cache hits. This work examines both static and dynamic victim cache management policies.

40|$|Abstract In seepage problems, the {{coefficients}} of permeability in Laplace equation are usually {{assumed to be}} constant vs. both space and time; but in reality these coefficients are variable. In this study, the effect of material deformation due to external <b>loads</b> (<b>consolidation)</b> and variation of head in the consolidation process are considered. For the first case, formulation of kx and ky can be defined by a second order binominal equation {{in order to take}} into account the material changes due to volume changes. For the second case, kx and ky can be defined as a function of unknown total head. The solution of the resulting non-linear differential equation is found using the Least Square Finite Element formulation. In order to increase the accuracy of the solution, eight nodal (isoperimetric) elements were obtained. This method was used satisfactorily to solve several seepage problems and to examine the accuracy and convergence of the results. The effect of a variable coefficient of permeability may not be significant on small dams, but as the height of the dam increases, the effect becomes more considerable.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this dissertation is concerned with coupled <b>loading</b> and <b>consolidation</b> in triaxial tests and with selection of rates of loading in routine tests to avoid errors due to incomplete drainage or non-uniform pore pressures in fine grained soils.

The work demonstrates the applicability of CRISP to coupled <b>loading</b> and <b>consolidation</b> analyses and its limitations are discussed. The influence of loading rates on pore pressures in triaxial tests and upon the soil parameters obtained from them is investigated and deficiencies in the current procedure for choosing rates of loading are revealed. A new method is proposed which permits a rational choice of loading rate based on the drainage characteristics of the sample and on the magnitude of the errors which can be accepted.

The effect and problem of the clay soil characteristic creates a problem for construction especially excessive settlement and this can leads to unstable and potential cracks. At presents, there are few improvement types can be carry out to overcome this problems, and electro osmotic consolidation {{is one of the}} options. This method has been applied many years ago especially European country. The study encompasses the determination of water content, Atterberg’s limits and undrained shear strength after electro osmotic consolidation treatment of soft clay soils taken from 0. 5 m and 1. 5 m at south west part of Johor. All the samples were tested accordance to BS 1377 : 1990. An experimental study was implemented in a PVC cylinder tube having dimensions of 300 mm height and 100 mm diameter. In the results of electro osmotic consolidation in copper spring electrodes, the measured undrained shear strength was increased considerably at the anodes especially compared to the initial undrained shear strength due to electro osmosis process and consolidation. As laboratory studies of its measurement have shown, the application of electro osmotic consolidation after the application of a direct current applied voltages of 10 Volts, at the anodes especially: (i) a decrease by approximately 35 % in water content; (ii) an increase around 29 % in undrained shear strength; and (iii) a decrease about 21 % in index plasticity.

Relationships among void ratio, effective stress, and hydraulic conductivity are presented for sampled lithologic units {{and used to}} reconstruct effective stress, permeability, and in situ void ratio profiles for a transect of three sites across Demerara Rise. Results confirm that a significant erosional event occurred on the northeastern flank of the rise during the late Miocene, resulting in the removal of ~ 220 m of upper Oligocene-Miocene deposits. Although Neogene and Paleogene sediments tend to be overconsolidated, Cretaceous sediments are normally consolidated to underconsolidated, suggesting the presence of overpressure. A pronounced drop in permeability occurs at {{the transition from the}} Cretaceous black shales into the overlying Maastrichtian-upper Paleocene chalks and clays. The development of a hydraulic seal at this boundary may be responsible for overpressure in the Cretaceous deposits, leading to the lower overconsolidation ratios of these sediments.

40|$|Abstract — Demand Response (DR) {{programs}} encourage {{consumers to}} adjust their power consumption in response to DR events such as changes in electricity prices or sudden peaks in demand. While significant savings can be thus achieved, the real success of DR programs depends on the incentive compatible participation of consumers and their timely response to DR signals. In this work, we consider households that operate different types of appliances consuming electricity loads characterized by preferences on the time and quantity of the consumption. We develop a distributed optimization algorithm of practical interest, which offers both to the providers and the consumers of electrical power the opportunity to jointly interact and converge to the optimal scheduling of their appliances: this optimizes the trade-off between user-savings with the inconvenience caused by shifting consumption in time and shading load, while leading {{the cost of the}} utility company to the socially optimal level. Our approach is based on related work, and solves two key practical issues: i) we convert the consumer reaction problem to the solution of an LP using standard LP solvers, and ii) we propose a heuristic for <b>load</b> <b>consolidation,</b> i. e., regroup appliance operation on adjacent timeslots, using a randomized algorithm. We also present a substantial amount of simulation data that suggests that our heuristics are sound and reach quickly a state relatively close to the actual system optimum.

40|$|Assessments {{were made}} of the impacts on freight traffic and {{operations}} of two sustainability policies currently in effect in London, a congestion charge zone (CCZ) and a low emissions zone (LEZ). Responses by freight operators, including retiming, rerouting, {{reducing the number of}} trips and kilometers traveled, and replacing vehicles, was investigated. Trends from 1994 to 2012 were identified with the use of road traffic estimates, cordon counts, and vehicle speed data, supplemented by interviews with freight industry experts and operators. In this time frame, goods traffic increased throughout London but declined in the central CCZ. Findings indicate that freight traffic was largely insensitive to the congestion charge. Price elasticity of demand was estimated as −. 04 to −. 06 for light goods vehicles and as perfectly inelastic for medium and heavy goods vehicles in the long run. The congestion charge may have time-shifted some light goods vehicle trips. No evidence was found of rerouting of freight traffic or avoidance traffic around the CCZ. Freight operators likely benefited from travel time reductions and journey reliability improvements throughout Inner London, a wider area than the CCZ. Operational efficiencies may have been achieved through greater vehicle <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> but offset by the relocation of logistics depots and warehouses priced out of central London. The LEZ was effective at spurring vehicle replacement, including some substitution to smaller vehicles.

40|$|Abstract. Based on dynamic {{triaxial}} test results of saturated soft clay, influence factors and variations on accumulated deformation were analyzed. The Parr’s equation on accumulated deformation was modified {{to create an}} attenuation-type curve model on accumulated deformation of saturated normal consolidation clay. In this model, dynamic strength was introduced and a new parameter called equivalent dynamic stress level was added. Besides, based on comparative analysis on variations between failure-type and attenuation-type curves, a failure-type curve model was created on accumulated deformation of saturated normal consolidation clay. The two models can take cycle number, coupling of static and dynamic deviator stress, consolidation way into consideration. The models were verified by test results. The correlation coefficients are more than 0. 96 for optimization of test results based on the two models, and there is good agreement between optimized and test curves, which show that the two models are suitable to predict variations of accumulated deformation under different <b>loading</b> cases and <b>consolidation</b> ways.

40|$|A {{numerical}} formulation for two-dimensional electro-osmotic consolidation in soft clays {{was derived}} from the basic equations of fluid flow, current flow and virtual work law. And, a well known elasto-plastic soil model, Modified Cam Clay was embedded into the formulation and implemented into the finite element program AFENA. The formulation was evaluated by comparing the predicted settlement and pore water pressure response with the values obtained from laboratory tests. The tests were conducted in an electro-osmotic triaxial apparatus, which was modified from a standard triaxial apparatus to facilitate electro-osmotic consolidation and required measurements. A series of electro-osmotic consolidation tests under different initial stress conditions were conducted to evaluate the finite element model and very good agreements between the observed and predicted results were observed. Another set of electro-osmotic tests were conducted with the similar initial stress, but different boundary conditions {{to examine the effects of}} electrochemical changes during the electro-osmosis. The study showed an apparent increase in the preconsolidation pressure and alteration in the coefficient of consolidation as a result of the electrochemical changes. A one-dimensional electro-osmotic consolidation problem was simulated and analysed, and the settlement and pore water pressure responses were compared with the solutions obtained from Esrig's (1968) one-dimensional theory. Another problem involving combined electro-osmotic and direct <b>loading</b> <b>consolidation</b> was also analysed and the results were compared with the solutions obtained from Wan and Mitchell's (1976) theory. Excellent matches were observed in both cases mentioned above for constant values of electro-osmotic and hydraulic permeabilities.

40|$|AbstractUsing {{information}} gathered from some 30 UK surveys undertaken {{over the last}} 15 years, this paper provides planners {{with an understanding of}} road-based urban retail freight transport activity. The findings suggest that the average High Street business could expect up to 10 core goods and 7. 6 service visits per week, in non-peak trading periods with 25 % additional activity during the build up to Christmas. Vans (‘light goods vehicles’) were the dominant mode, responsible for 42 % of delivery activity with a mean dwell time of 10 min. Where possible, <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> should be encouraged by methods such as Delivery and Servicing Plans and using out-of-town freight consolidation centres to bring in goods over the last mile in shared vehicles. Where this is not possible, loading bay monitoring and control, and preferred lorry routes can help manage the movement of vehicles in and out of dense urban areas. Service vehicle activity is a significant contributor to urban freight movements and often requires vehicles to be parked close to the premises being served. Centrally coordinating elements of service provision (e. g. for cleaning, equipment maintenance, recyclate collection), or providing improved, more flexible parking provision for service vehicles could be as or more beneficial in reducing overall freight impacts than focusing on core goods deliveries.

This work is focused on designing flexible and robust strategies to manage the resources {{in such a way that}} the system is able to meet the service agreements even when the load conditions change. As a first step, we study the control of a Markovian queueing system with controllable number of servers and service rates (M=Mt=kt) to minimize effort and holding costs.

40|$|Amazon {{is one of}} the world's leading retailers. At {{the core}} of Amazon's {{business}} model is providing consumers with endless selection, and as a result, the large number of vendors used to provide that selection greatly increases the complexity and cost of operating the inbound supply chain. This growth has also created many opportunities for the company to leverage its size and scale to lower transportation costs and improve supply chain flexibility. This project explores implementing <b>load</b> <b>consolidation</b> strategies within the "Hub and Spoke" distribution framework to provide these benefits. As - 65 % of total unit volume from the inbound transportation program managed by Amazon is shipped as costly less-than-truckload (LTL) or small-parcel (SP) freight, there are significant opportunities to use consolidation hubs throughout the inbound network to reduce spend on LTL and SP in favor of more cost effective full truckload (TL) shipments. To evaluate the opportunity and provide the inbound team with a useful strategic planning tool, a comprehensive network optimization model was targeted as a project deliverable. After researching {{the current state of the}} inbound transportation network through departmental interviews and visits to carrier hubs and fulfillment centers, key inputs were identified to feed the model. The mixed integer program solution uses these inputs to minimize total inbound transportation cost for the network subject to expected transit time performance targets by choosing what consolidation hubs and destination lanes freight should be routed to. Using a data-set of shipments originating in the Southwestern geography, an average saving of 13. 7 % on annual LTL and SP spend was projected by routing 37 % of freight volume through consolidation hubs. Results showed freight density as an important driver in savings. In areas with more originating freight, outbound full truckloads can be filled more readily and hence consolidation opportunities can be taken advantage of more often. This tool and the supporting analyses will help the inbound transportation organization uncover more cost saving opportunities in routing freight through its growing network. In addition to financial cost savings, the strategy will increase supply chain flexibility, reduce environmental impact, and can help increase Amazon's control over the end-to-end inbound transportation network. by Olufemi Oti.

The soils were sampled at three different locations at depths of 2 to 3 m such that the in-situ overburden pressures were about 30 - 40 kPa. The normal pressures used in the test are: 6, 12. 5, 25, 50, 100 kPa; while the shearing rates are: 0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 mm/minutes. The samples were consolidated prior to shearing in the di- :ect shear apparatus. Preliminary test indicated that the average time required for consolidating the sample before shearing is less than l 0 minutes. Test results show that normal load variations as well as shearing rate introduce variations in the shear strength obtained by direct shear test. Therefore, {{it is important that}} the normal load used for this type of test be comparable with the in-situ overburden pressure and the shearing rate should be calculated based on the time ofconsolidation prior to shearing. Keywords: direct shear test, <b>consolidation</b> time, normal <b>load,</b> shearing rate, shear strength...|$|R
40|$|AbstractStructures {{constructed}} on soft soil {{are considered to}} be at risk due to its low shear strength and high compressibility. Thus constructed structures on soft soil are designed according to its undrained shear strength, representing the bearing capacity of the shallow foundation in the short term conditions, which varies with time under the applied load. The bearing capacity in short term conditions is limited because of the generation of excess pore water pressure as soon as the initial loads are applied. Hence in this paper, the bearing capacity of shallow foundations on soft soil is studied by varying the time and the applied loads. The shallow foundation is subjected to a series of applied <b>loads</b> and <b>consolidation</b> phases to study the effect of aging. The study is investigated by means of finite element analyses taking account of consolidation processes in the ground, in which the soft soil is modeled using the Soft Soil model. The analysis is performed by finite element package of Plaxis program. The numerical analysis clears that the bearing capacity in the long term conditions is enhanced and has a significant enhancement following each consolidation phase when compared with the short term conditions...|$|R
40|$|As cloud {{computing}} {{and the use}} of virtual machines (VMs) have become a widespread phenomenon, a wide variety of optimization techniques have been invented for this field. One of them is live migration, which enables relocation of VMs between physical hosts without shutting them down. Since this feature has been implemented and simplified in the majority of popular virtualization platforms, IT administrators have begun migrating VMs regularly. There are many reasons for this, including <b>load</b> balancing, server <b>consolidation</b> and disaster recovery. This thesis have used a machine learning based algorithm to partition mi- gration marked VMs into migration groups, with the goals of minimizing network load and lower the time consumption. A new algorithm, proposed by this thesis, is used to provide additional cost-optimization...|$|R

For short construction period and low cost, a new drained consolidation method-drainage consolidation due to excessive pore water pressure for silt is tested: fist, the sand is replaced in the surface of silt for horizontal drain; and then, the plastic drain boards is applied for vertical drain; finally, the excess pore water pressure is generated by surcharge <b>loads</b> and dynamic <b>consolidation</b> and the drainage consolidation is fast under the excess pore water pressure. The result of the settlement observation and acceptance test shows that the result of drainage consolidation due to excessive pore water pressure for silt soft soil is remarkable...|$|R
