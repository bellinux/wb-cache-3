40|$|Abstract- Lifting {{operations}} and associated equipment have become commonplace within the all over world of various industries. On the other hand, recent high shape accidents involving lifting equipment {{have shown that}} the effect of its mishandling can have serious cost and health implications. The main aim of this research was to study <b>lifting</b> <b>plan</b> with the help of lifting operation process (LOP) via preliminary hazard analysis (PHA). People perform PHA and LOP studies and, therefore, such studies themselves are subject to various possible human failures. Much less {{attention has been paid to}} the human factors that influence the performance of PHA and LOP studies than human factors that influence hazard scenarios. Human failures in the performance of PHA and LOPA studies should be of significant concern to practitioners as such studies are difficult and time-consuming activities that place significant demands on participants, which increases the chance that errors will be made. Human factors such as eagerness to rely on the unsubstantiated opinions of others, groupthink, underestimation of the frequencies of low-probability, high-consequence events, and allowing a false sense of accomplishment to distract from implementing study results must be recognized and addressed. This paper identifies a proper preliminary steps that can influence the quality of PHA of tools and tackles for lifting equipments with toppling process and LOP studies covering preparing for, conducting, recording, documenting, and following-up on studies. Lifting operation plan; its design and analysis has been done with PHA process and its result shows that it may resolve the study of quality related to <b>lifting</b> <b>plan.</b> The findings revealed six main points to improve safety in lifting operations.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{optimized}} aviation <b>lift</b> <b>planning</b> {{is becoming increasingly}} important as the United States and her allies participate in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). As {{part of a comprehensive}} effort, our nation's fighting forces find themselves conducting operations around the globe, with this trend likely to increase, even as budget constraints limit the number of personnel and amount of equipment that is deployed. While much attention has been given to airline schedule optimization and fleet planning. the challenge of Army Aviation <b>lift</b> <b>planning</b> is unique in that it must be able to adapt to changing requirements and missions on a daily basis. In this thesis, we model Army Aviation <b>lift</b> <b>planning</b> as a service network design problem, and propose two heuristic algorithms, which compare favorably to current human planning systems. Furthermore, we apply these heuristic algorithms to long term asset planning and capacity requirement estimation for future military scenarios, and analyze how passenger flexibility affects the need for capacity. by Matthew D.

30|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>plans</b> and crane {{selection}} have complex, dynamic correlations, so the {{influencing factors}} {{include not only}} the duration and cost in terms of construction management, but also the working radius, work efficiency, interference with nearby buildings and other works, quantity, location selection, site installation, and disconnection, all of which {{should be taken into}} consideration (Lin and Haas [1996]). The optimal mobile crane is selected considering these factors, and a respective plan should be set by step in order.|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the {{dissertation}} is on the method of integration of causal and resource reasoning that can expedite problem solving by graphbased planners.   We present {{a representation of the}} <b>lifted</b> <b>planned</b> graph constructed by the MADPlan planner, which is populated with exclusivity relations and binary constraints.   Moreover, the lifted nodes that appear within the graph maintain references to classes of resources which constitute the domain of the uninstantiated variables appearing in the lifted nodes.   The exclusivity relations, binary constraints, and resource references are used to guide the search towards the extraction of executable plans. We discuss the search method used in MADPlan that achieves the extraction of grounded <b>plans</b> directly from <b>lifted</b> <b>planning</b> graphs.   The main characteristic of the search is that it can switch between two different backtracking methods.   During chronological backtracking the algorithm tries a new resource allocation for a given node only when the node appears in the conflict set.   Otherwise the algorithm immediately backtracks further (backjumps) ignoring the remaining resource allocations for the last visited node.   The contributions discussed above allow our planner to scale very well with the increasing number of resources that appear in planning. The above contributions are direct extensions to the graphbased planning paradigm and they can be utilised by all graphbased planners. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Cranes and hoists {{are widely}} used in many areas. Crane {{accidents}} and handling mishaps are responsible for injuries, costly equipment damage, and program delays. Most crane accidents are caused by preventable factors. Understanding these factors is critical when designing cranes and preparing <b>lift</b> <b>plans.</b> Analysis of previous accidents provides insight into current recommendations for crane safety. Cranes and hoists are used throughout Kennedy Space Center to lift everything from machine components to critical flight hardware. Unless they are trained crane operators, most NASA employees and contractors {{do not need to}} undergo specialized crane training and may not understand the safety issues surrounding the use of cranes and hoists. A single accident with a crane or hoist can injure or kill people, cause severe equipment damage, and delay or terminate a program. Handling mishaps can also {{have a significant impact on}} the program. Simple mistakes like bouncing or jarring a load, or moving the crane down when it should go up, can damage fragile flight hardware and cause major delays in processing. Hazardous commodities (high pressure gas, hypergolic propellants, and solid rocket motors) can cause life safety concerns for the workers performing the lifting operations. Most crane accidents are preventable with the correct training and understanding of potential hazards. Designing the crane with human factors taken into account can prevent many accidents. Engineers are also responsible for preparing <b>lift</b> <b>plans</b> where understanding the safety issues can prevent or mitigate potential accidents. Cranes {{are widely used}} across many areas of KSC. Failure of these cranes often leads to injury, high damage costs, and significant delays in program objectives. Following a basic set of principles and procedures during design, fabrication, testing, regular use, and maintenance can significantly minimize many of these failures. As the accident analysis shows, load drops are often caused or influenced by human factors. Therefore, proper training and understanding of crane safety throughout the workforce is critical. It is important that the engineers designing the cranes, lift planners preparing the <b>lift</b> <b>plans,</b> operators performing the lifts, and training officers conducting the operator training all understand the problems that can happen with cranes and how to ensure the safety of the workforce and equipment being lifted...|$|R
30|$|Stability {{should be}} pre-reviewed, {{and it is}} {{reasonable}} to select mobile cranes among the candidate cranes that have completed reviews in consideration of cost or other factors. However, engineers or technicians do not set <b>lifting</b> <b>plans</b> that suit the construction conditions for stability analyses when implementing construction projects; instead, equipment is operated based on the information provided by an equipment supplier. Operation relying on such limited information and experience is the fundamental cause of crane disasters ([Ho, Han and Kim 2007]). In addition, since such an approach makes precise reviews of mobile cranes and working conditions impossible, it is difficult to select the optimal mobile crane.|$|R

40|$|An {{enveloping}} grasp is one {{for which}} the fingers surround the object and hold it securely against the palm. It {{is the kind of}} grasp that we use to hold the steering wheel of our car or to hold a wet ice cube. In the case of the ice cube and other slippery objects, we must use an enveloping grasp, because friction forces are small. ^ In this dissertation we are particularly interested in achieving an enveloping grasp of an object by manipulating it away from its supporting surface with an articulated hand. To solve the problem, we make several extensions to the firmly established kinematic equations of grasping and develop a linear program to predict the instantaneous motion of a slippery object during its manipulation. ^ We define the liftability regions for any two-dimensional object and develop a graphical method to determine them. The liftability regions are used to select the initial grasp of the object. Then <b>lift</b> <b>planning</b> strategies determine how to manipulate the object from its initial position into an enveloping grasp in the hand. After achieving envelopment, the grasp is adjusted, maintaining its enveloping character while optimizing an appropriate objective function. These three planning steps, initial grasp selection, <b>lift</b> <b>planning,</b> and grip adjustment are used to determine a grasping plan. ^ The motion linear program is used as the basis of a simulator which solves the equations of motion of the manipulated object. Given a grasp plan, the simulator is used to verify its validity. ...|$|R

40|$|Lifted {{probabilistic}} inference (Poole, 2003) and symbolic dynamic programming for <b>lifted</b> stochastic <b>planning</b> (Boutilier et al, 2001) were introduced {{around the same}} time as algorithmic efforts to use abstraction in stochastic systems. Over the years, these ideas evolved into two distinct lines of research, each supported by a rich literature. Lifted {{probabilistic inference}} focused on efficient arithmetic operations on template-based graphical models under a finite domain assumption while symbolic dynamic programming focused on supporting sequential decision-making in rich quantified logical action models and on open domain reasoning. Given their common motivation but different focal points, both lines of research have yielded highly complementary innovations. In this chapter, we aim to help close the gap between these two research areas by providing an overview of <b>lifted</b> stochastic <b>planning</b> from the perspective of probabilistic inference, showing strong connections to other chapters in this book. This also allows us to define Generalized Lifted Inference as a paradigm that unifies these areas and elucidates open problems for future research that can benefit both lifted inference and stochastic planning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes new {{algorithms}} for the computeraided {{design and}} manufacture (CAD/CAM) of 3 D woven multi-layer textile structures. Existing commercial CAD/CAM systems are often {{restricted to the}} design and manufacture of 2 D weaves. Those CAD/CAM systems that do support the design and manufacture of 3 D multi-layer weaves are often limited to manual editing of design paper grids on the computer display and weave retrieval from stored archives. This complex design activity is time-consuming, tedious and error-prone and requires considerable experience and skill of a technical weaver. Recent research {{reported in the literature}} has addressed some of the shortcomings of commercial 3 D multi-layer weave CAD/CAM systems. However, earlier research results have shown the need for further work on weave specification, weave generation, yarn path editing and layer binding. Analysis of 3 D multi-layer weaves in this research has led to the design and development of efficient and robust algorithms for the CAD/CAM of 3 D woven multi-layer textile structures. The resulting algorithmically generated weave designs {{can be used as a}} basis for <b>lifting</b> <b>plans</b> that can be loaded onto looms equipped with electronic shedding mechanisms for the CAM of 3 D woven multi-layer textile structures.

40|$|Cranes are the {{fundamental}} machinery used during lifting operations, and {{are crucial to}} the construction industry. Several key construction processes would be impossible without cranes and the benefits they provide. Cranes are often massive pieces of equipment capable of causing significant damage to both property and human life. Because of their importance to the construction industry, and their potential to cause harm, the safe and correct use of these machines is imperative. This study documents 75 recent accidents involving cranes in North America, systematically cataloguing them into detailed categories. Comprehensive data sets have been compiled {{for each of the}} 75 incidents. Each data set includes: the date and location of the incident, crane type and capacity, a review of the responsible parties, conditions during the accident, causative factors, and the outcome of the accident. Cataloguing of these incidents is based off of forensic engineering reports from licensed engineers who are well established in the field, input from industry experts, photos, research of consensus industry safety standards and regulations, and any other available documents. Upon being catalogued into a database, these accidents have been statistically analyzed for patterns. Patterns in these crane accidents are then used to identify areas where increased safety standards and regulations are needed. The study reviews the importance of careful <b>lift</b> <b>planning</b> and offers data to be used to improve crane design, industry safety standards, and lift coordination. by Ray Addison King.
