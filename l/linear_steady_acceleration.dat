40|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of accelerations to be encountered on orbiting spacecraft: (1) quasi-steady accelerations, caused by atmospheric drag or by gravity gradients, 10 (exp - 6) to 10 (exp - 7) g sub o; (2) transient accelerations, caused by movements of the astronauts, mass translocations, landing and departure of other spacecraft, etc.; and (3) oscillary accelerations, caused by running machinery (fans, pumps, generators). <b>Steady</b> <b>accelerations</b> cause continuing displacements; transients cause time-limited displacements. The important aspect is the area under the acceleration curve, measured over a certain time interval. Note that this quantity is not equivalent to a velocity because of friction effects. Transient motions are probably less important than <b>steady</b> <b>accelerations</b> because they only produce constant displacements. If the accelerative forces were not equal and opposite, the displacement would increase with time. A <b>steady</b> <b>acceleration</b> will produce an increasing velocity of a particle, but eventually an equilibrium value will be reached where drag and acceleration forces are equal. From then on, the velocity will remain constant, and the displacement will increase linearly with time...|$|R

30|$|The {{upper limit}} of the {{responsive}} acceleration ratio is naturally about 1.0 when the input acceleration is 495 gal, which {{is equivalent to the}} control static maximum load and the equivalent resonant frequency is 3.6  Hz. The responsive acceleration ratio for this input acceleration, defined as the ratio of the measured maximum responsive acceleration to the measured maximum input acceleration, however, is greater than 1.0 for a frequency of 2  Hz as shown in Fig.  9. In shaking table tests, it takes a number of cycles to reach <b>steady</b> <b>accelerations</b> as shown in Figs.  5 and 7. Under a frequency of 2  Hz, the joints failed at average actual input accelerations of 305 and 321 gal before they reached the assumed steady values of 330 and 495 gal, respectively. A responsive acceleration ratio greater than 1.0 for the <b>steady</b> input <b>acceleration</b> of 495 gal is the result of this failure behavior. The measured maximum responsive acceleration for this input acceleration was 485 gal on average, which did not exceed the assumed upper limit value of 495 gal. Under frequencies from 3 to 7  Hz, the input <b>acceleration</b> reached the <b>steady</b> value before the joints failed. For an input acceleration of 495 gal, as a result, the responsive acceleration ratios dropped to less than 1.0, and they decreased gradually as the frequency increased from 3 to 7  Hz. For this input acceleration, the joints initially responded sensitively below the <b>steady</b> <b>acceleration</b> state, and then the resultant cyclic stiffness degradation dulled their response and lasted them for a number of cycles under the <b>steady</b> <b>acceleration</b> for these frequencies. This responsive behavior resulted in responsive acceleration ratios of not exceeding 1.0.|$|R

This environment is hypothesized to contribute to the protein's long-term structural stability and thereby favor crystallization.

40|$|A key {{parameter}} of the polar-cap accelerator is a = j/cρGJ, where j is {{the electric}} current and ρGJ is the corotation charge density. The customary model assumed a = 1 ± ǫ and found ǫ ≪ 1, <b>steady</b> <b>acceleration</b> of particles, and e ± creation.

For 0 1 + ǫ, the accelerator is unstable and a high voltage is generated by electrostatic and induction effects. We argue that the pulsar activity is generated by an unsteady gap near the surface that forms if a> 1 or a < 0. The unsteady voltage implies unsteady rotation of the open magnetic tube and generation of Alfven waves, which are ducted along the tube. Their energy flux can directly feed radio emission as Alfven waves convert to electromagnetic waves. Subject headings: plasmas — stars: magnetic fields, neutron 1...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{have been developed}} describing the drop break-up in a high-pressure homogenizer (HPH), but they are generally based on quite rudimentary descriptions of the flow fields. As the flow in a real HPH is very extreme, with gaps of 10 – 100 μm and velocities of hundreds of m/s, it is practically impossible to measure the velocity fields. In this study, a scale model of an HPH made of acrylic plastic has been developed making measurements possible. Great care was taken to keep the relevant dimensionless numbers constant during the scale-up. The flow field at the gap entrance shows a <b>steady</b> <b>acceleration</b> and total turbulence suppression, in the gap the flow field is flat with thin boundary layers, and at the exit a turbulent jet is formed.

40|$|Two viscous {{miscible}} liquids with an initially sharp interface oriented vertically {{inside a}} cavity become unstable against oscillatory external forcing due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The instability causes growth of quasi-stationary (q-s) waves at {{the interface between}} the two liquids. We examine computationally the dynamics of a four-mode q-s wave, for a fixed energy input, {{when one of the}} components of the external forcing is suddenly ceased. The external forcing consists of a steady and oscillatory component as realizable in a microgravity environment. Results show that when there is a jump discontinuity in the oscillatory excitation that produced the four-mode q-s wave, the interface does not return to its equilibrium position, the structure of the q-s wave remains imbedded between the two fluids over a long time scale. The damping characteristics of the q-s wave from the time history of the velocity field show overdamped and critically damped response; there is no underdamped oscillation as the flow field approaches steady state. Viscous effects serve as a dissipative mechanism to effectively damp the system.
