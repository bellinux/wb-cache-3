50|$|The {{technology}} {{works by}} probing an optical stationary wave, or {{the sum of}} the standing waves in the case of polychromatic light, created by a light to be analyzed. In a SWIFTS <b>linear</b> <b>configuration</b> (true Lippman configuration), the stationary wave is created by a single-mode waveguide ended by a fixed mirror. The stationary wave is regularly sampled on one side of a waveguide using nano-scattering dots. These dots are located in the evanescent field. These nanodots are characterized by an optical index difference with the medium in which the evanescent field is located. The light is then scattered around an axis perpendicular to the waveguide. For each dot, this scattered light is detected by a pixel aligned with this axis. The intensity detected is therefore proportional to the intensity inside the waveguide at the exact location of the dot. This results in a linear image of the interferogram. No moving parts are used. A mathematical function known as a Lippmann transform, similar to a Fourier transform, is then applied to this linear image and gives the spectrum of the light.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Stuart’s {{experiments}} with alternative mediums {{led to her}} earth rubbings (often called “scrolls”), which were created {{through a process of}} smashing, pulverizing, rubbing and imprinting soil and rock into sheets of scroll-like paper. In this early phase of her career, Stuart drew significant inspiration from recently released photographs of the surface of the moon, and saw parallels between her early rubbings and these lunar landscapes. This important body of luminous monochromatic drawings offered the revolutionary gestures of both bringing land art into the gallery and expanding the Minimalist vocabulary to include nontraditional materials. Grounded in the particular place from whence she gathered her materials (like Sayreville, NJ, the Mesa Verde, CO, or the Honduran Mayan archaeological site of Copán), Stuart’s works explore the elements inherent to that locale and displace them in a translated artistic form within the gallery or museum context. During this time, Stuart investigated other means of addressing specific sites through her ambitious landworks or, as she terms them, “drawings in the landscape”. In Niagara Gorge Path Relocated (1975), the artist situated a 460-foot scroll of paper cascading down a large bank of the Niagara River Gorge at Art Park. For Stone Alignments/Solstice Cairns (1979), she positioned 3,400 boulders in a <b>linear</b> <b>configuration</b> which indicated {{the rise and fall of}} the sun at its summer solstice.|$|E
50|$|In 1891, at the Academie des Sciences in Paris, Gabriel Lippmann {{presented}} a colour {{photograph of the}} Sun’s spectrum obtained with his new photographic plate. Later, in 1894, he published an article on how his plate was able to record colour information in the depth of photographic grainless gelatin and how the same plate after processing could restore the original colour image merely through light reflection. He was thus the inventor of true interferential colour photography. He received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for this breakthrough.Unfortunately, this principle was too complex to use. The method was abandoned {{a few years after}} its discovery. One aspect of the Lippmann concept that was ignored at that time relates to spectroscopic applications. Early in 1933, Ives proposed to use a photoelectric device to probe stationary waves to make spectrometric measurements. In 1995, P. Connes proposed to use the emerging new technology of detectors for three-dimensional Lippmann-based spectrometry. Following this, a first realization of a very compact spectrometer based on a micro-opto-electromechanical system (MOEMS) was reported by Knipp et al. in 2005, but it had a very limited spectral resolution.In 2004, two French researchers, Etienne Le Coarer from Joseph Fourier University and Pierre Benech from INP Grenoble, coupled sensing elements to the evanescent part of stationary waves within a single-mode waveguide. In 2007, those two researchers reported a near-field method to probe the interferogram within a waveguide. The first SWIFTS-based spectrometers appeared in 2011 based on a SWIFTS <b>linear</b> <b>configuration.</b>|$|E
5000|$|PJTE versus Renner-Teller {{effect in}} bending distortions. Linear {{molecules}} are exceptions from the JTE, {{and for a}} long time it was assumed that their bending distortions in degenerate states (observed in many molecules) is produced by the Renner-Teller effect (RTE) (the splitting of the generate state by the quadratic terms of the vibronic coupling). However, recently it was proved (see in the review [...] ) that the RTE, by splitting the degenerate electronic state, just softens the lower branch of the APES, but this lowering of the energy is not enough to overcome the rigidity of the <b>linear</b> <b>configuration</b> and to produce bending distortions. It follows that the bending distortion of linear molecular systems is due to, and only to the PJTE that mixes the electronic state under consideration with higher in energy (excited) states. This statement is enhanced by the fact that many linear molecules in nondegenerate states (and hence with no RTE) are, too, bent in the equilibrium configuration. The physical reason for the difference between the PJTE and the RTE in influencing the degenerate term is that while in the former case the vibronic coupling with the excited state produces additional covalent bonding that makes the distorted configuration preferable (see above, section 2.3), the RTE has no such influence; the splitting of the degenerate term in the RTE takes place just because the charge distribution in the two states becomes nonequivalent under the bending distortion.|$|E
40|$|A general, six-dimensional {{computational}} method for the accurate calculation of rotationally and vibrationally excited states of tetra-atomic molecules is developed. The resulting program is particularly appropriate for molecules executing wide-amplitude motions and isomerizations. An {{application to the}} Ar 2 HF van der Waals trimer is presented in which the HF intramolecular stretching coordinate is separated out adiabatically and is not treated explicitly. Vibrational term values up to about 100 cm− 1 with absolute convergence to better than 0. 1 cm− 1 are reported. These calculations employ more extensive vibrational basis sets and hence consider a much higher density of states than hitherto. States that sample Ar–Ar–HF <b>linear</b> <b>configurations</b> and approach Ar–HF–Ar <b>linear</b> <b>configurations</b> are characterized for the first time. Results for total angular momentumJ= 0 and 1 provide the first accurate calculations of rotational constants for this system.
