2500|$|After {{about two}} kilometres, the track finally reaches the {{northern}} border of Zermatt. [...] Here {{there is a}} <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> for concrete and other building materials, devoted to the supply of Zermatt's builders. [...] The nearby short Spissfluhtunnel passes below the Air Zermatt heliport, and shortly after, the line reaches Zermatt station.|$|E
2500|$|At Randa, {{the railway}} line {{runs along the}} western edge of the town. The station has two {{platform}} tracks and a goods track. [...] The station building dates from the line's opening in 1891, and to this day has been rebuilt only slightly. [...] South of Randa, the line passes the hamlet Wildi, where from 1960 to 1966 there was a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> for the construction of the Grande Dixence power station. [...] The line then meets up with the Mattervispa once again, and runs further on the route to Täsch directly parallel with the river along the valley floor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station at}} Stalden, at around 799 metres above sea level, extends in an s-shape along the southwestern {{edge of the}} village. For a long time, the station itself was of great importance, as the {{departure}} point of the Postbus line into the Saastal. [...] It was therefore equipped with a generously sized station building, the second largest on the line after the one in Zermatt. At {{the start of the}} 20th century, there were plans to build another railway line to Saas-Fee that would branch off here from the existing line; World War I, however, thwarted these plans. The importance of the station (which, since 1931, has had the official name Stalden-Saas) has decreased since the 1950s, as the departure point since then for the Postbus line has been Brig, not Stalden. Nevertheless, the buses still stop also at Stalden station, and form a connection there with the trains to Zermatt. Immediately adjacent to the railway tracks there is also the base station of the cable car to Staldenried. Since 1986, the two tracks at Stalden have been equipped with continuous rack rails, as there are inclines immediately before and after the station. In addition to the two platform tracks there is also a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> for goods traffic.|$|E
50|$|The Neuwied freight yard, {{which is}} operationally {{integrated}} into Neuwied station, has two <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> {{with a total}} of 1,827 square metres of roadway for loading. The loading of freight wagons can only be carried out on the loading road, using only one of the two electrified <b>loading</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vreoci - 7 {{rail tracks}} of which 4 are <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> with two <b>loading</b> places.|$|R

5000|$|Oberneuschönberg (...) The current Oberneuschönberg halt was {{originally}} planned as an access {{point for the}} localities of the Schweinitz valley, which were still not served by rail. The station originally had a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> for the carriage of goods, which had already been partly dismantled in 1940. It was used mainly by the forestry industry for the loading of logs. In March 1966, the remaining set of points and the <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> were removed and the former station was redesignated from a stop (Haltestelle) to a halt (Haltepunkt).|$|E
50|$|The side {{platforms}} {{were replaced}} by a central platform at its current location in 1909/10. A <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> and a siding to a malt house were built on the east side.|$|E
50|$|All {{passenger}} trains between Kemi and Rovaniemi stop at Tervola. The station does not serve cargo traffic. The traffic control is handled remotely from the Oulu railway station. The trackyard has one drive-through side track and one <b>loading</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|The station {{then had}} a {{platform}} with two platform edges for passenger trains. The freight operations area, which had two <b>loading</b> <b>tracks,</b> was located to the east.|$|R
30|$|In Fig.  8, as the {{equivalent}} energy storage model is not considered, and the <b>load</b> <b>tracking</b> control cannot always accurately track Pc,agg obtained in Fig.  5 b. During 7 – 10 h and 15 – 24 h, the <b>load</b> <b>tracking</b> control fails and SOC is either close to {{or even more}} than 1, or infinitely close to 0, which indicates again that the potential of TCLs has been exhausted, {{and it is not}} possible to participate fully in scheduling. Once again, the necessity of considering {{the equivalent}} energy storage model is explained.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, a workers colony was {{established}} at a quarry at Schneeweiderhof in the municipality of Eßweiler, {{which had been}} connected by a ropeway conveyor to Altenglan station in 1919. Therefore, several <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> were established north of Altenglan station. In 1976, the ropeway conveyor was dismantled and the <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> were dismantled. There was a loading facility located north-west of the station near the former Rammelsbach tunnel, which was connected by a ropeway conveyor, built around 1900, to the quarry of Hugo Bell {{on the slopes of}} the Remigiusberg.|$|R
50|$|In various renovations {{carried out}} by Deutsche Bahn, most {{recently}} in the 1990s, the <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> was removed, waiting rooms built of bricks were erected on both platforms and a station subway with stairs was built under the tracks.|$|E
50|$|Between 1963 and 1966, Deutsche Reichsbahn {{removed the}} <b>loading</b> <b>track.</b> The {{connecting}} line was served until 1990. It was finally abandoned with {{the termination of}} the subscriber contract on 31 December 1993. Since then, Heidersdorf (Erzgeb) has only been a halt.|$|E
50|$|Ulstrup got {{a station}} on the Himmerlands runways, opened in 1893. But when there was an Ulstrup station on Langå-Struer, the station was named Hornum. The station had two {{crossings}} and a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> with a blind track at each end.|$|E
50|$|East of the {{passenger}} station is the disused freight yard, which consisted of a small marshalling yard (with a hump and four short sidings), and north of it are disused <b>loading</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Because {{the high}} {{pressure}} turbopumps {{used on the}} space shuttle main engine (SSME) are high speed machines and rotor dynamics analysis of these units is very complicated, it was considered necessary to verify calculated turbomachinery shaft bearing loads by analysis of ball bearing <b>load</b> <b>tracks.</b> This report presents the methods used {{and the results of}} <b>load</b> <b>track</b> analysis on one set of bearings removed from a high pressure liquid oxygen turbopump which had been subjected to SSME static firing tests. This type of analysis was found useful in determining bearing operating conditions and for verifying rotor dynamics computer models...|$|R
40|$|The Aircraft Landing Dynamics Facility (ALDF), {{formerly}} {{called the}} Landing <b>Loads</b> <b>Track,</b> is described. The paper gives a historical {{overview of the}} original NASA Langley Research Center Landing <b>Loads</b> <b>Track</b> and discusses the unique features of this national test facility. Comparisons are made between the original track characteristics and the new capabilities of the Aircraft Landing Dynamics Facility following the recently completed facility update. Details of the new propulsion and arresting gear systems are presented along with the novel features of the new high-speed carriage. The data acquisition system is described and the paper concludes with a review of future test programs...|$|R

50|$|Dachau {{station was}} opened on 14 November 1867, {{together}} with the Munich-Ingolstadt railway. Facilities available by then included a turntable, a level junction, a goods shed (equipped with a <b>loading</b> <b>track),</b> an entrance building and a watering point. In the following years, the railway received continuous upgrades. Additional tracks were built around Dachau station in 1884, and the station building was upgraded twice, in 1887 and 1895.|$|E
50|$|Until 1965, {{the station}} had a {{single-track}} passing line. There {{has been no}} alternative tracks since the duplication of the Murr Valley Railway. The two main lines have platforms on the outsides of the line since the duplication of the Murr Valley Railway. Until the 1990s, {{there was still a}} freight <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> to the east of the station building, which has also been reduced in size.|$|E

50|$|Fürstenwalde (Spree) {{station has}} very {{extensive}} freight facilities. In addition to shunting sidings, {{there are also}} five <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> {{just north of the}} passenger station. These were renewed in 2010 and are used for road-rail loading operations.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, freight trains operated over the Kaiserslautern-Homburg-Landau-Germersheim and Saarbrücken-Landau-Germersheim lines. Their customers at the station included Stabila, a local manufacturer of measuring instruments. After the Second World War freight traffic also lost importance. From the 1980s onwards, a Übergabegüterzug (goods exchange train) served the station. Its operation were based in Neustadt Hauptbahnhof. The trains ran from Landau to Wilgartswiesen. Operation of freight traffic at the station ended in 1994. Subsequently, the <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> at the station were disconnected and partially dismantled in 2001. Subsequently, the <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> in the station were disconnected and partially dismantled in 2001. It had already lost all freight traffic traffic a few years earlier.|$|R
50|$|The {{route from}} Hungen {{ran along the}} eastern side of the {{entrance}} building (now used as a commuter parking area) and joined the Vogelsberg Railway at the 29.1 km mark (approximately at the location of the existing signal). Part of the remaining track is still present, but completely overgrown. This track was still used as a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> until the beginning of the 2000s.|$|E
50|$|Its {{entrance}} building, {{which was}} built in a traditional style with a hip roof and an open waiting area, dates back to around 1910 and is heritage listed. In the building itself is a mechanical signal box - officially abbreviated Sf - that was built to a unified design and was put into operation on 1 January 1954, replacing an external signal box. The former <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> in the station has been dismantled in the meantime.|$|E
50|$|The track layouts {{of the two}} private {{railways}} {{were relatively}} less extensive, since the cantres of operations of both companies was not in Uckro but in Dahme and Luckau. The DUE had only two tracks at the station building, while the NLE had five tracks with a <b>loading</b> <b>track.</b> South of the tracks of the passenger operations are the connecting tracks from the main line to the branch lines and the former freight sidings of the main line.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{effects of}} housing {{electricity and heat}} source equipments. We studied about energy saving effects of 4 equipments, CO 2 Heat Pump water heater(CO 2 -HP), Micro Gas Engine Co-Generation System(GE-μCGS), Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Co-Generation System(PEFC-CGS), and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Co-Generation System(SOFC-CGS). As the result, {{we have found that}} energy consumption and CO 2 emission reduction rate is the highest in the case of SOFC-CGS. Energy consumption is reduced by 17 - 20 % using SOFC-CGS on Electric Power <b>Load</b> <b>Tracking</b> Operation, and 44 - 47 % on Rated Operation.

50|$|The former freight {{unloading}} tracks at {{the first}} station (now used by the railway museum) have not been used since 1997, but the <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> are still available. The former truck parking area for freight clearance is now used as a car park.|$|R
50|$|South of the S-Bahn tracks between Beussel {{bridge and}} Putlitz bridge is the Berlin-Moabit freight yard. It {{extends to the}} east past Putlitz bridge. Its sidings and <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> {{formerly}} extended south {{to the streets of}} Siemensstraße and Quitzowstraße and are now largely dismantled.|$|R
50|$|Seiffen (Erzgeb) halt {{was opened}} on 1 October 1895 in Dittersbacher Flur as Seiffen-Dittersbach stop (Haltestelle), but since 1951 {{it has had}} the current name after the nearby {{locality}} of Seiffen, which is known {{in the region as}} Kurort Seiffen/Erzgeb (Kurort means spa town). In Seiffen, too, there was originally a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> connected at both ends, which was mainly used by the forestry industry. In contrast to the other intermediate stations, the station has a massive, now unused entrance building.|$|E
50|$|The layout {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a continuous railway track with a platform and a <b>loading</b> <b>track,</b> which was connected at both ends, which {{was not included in}} the standardisation. The originally wooden waiting room was replaced in 1938 by a more formal, significantly enlarged building in the Heimatstil (“homeland style”, a German revivalist style), which is now used for residential purposes. During 1998/99, the separate passenger tracks were moved a few metres towards Heidenau and are no longer connected to the line.|$|E
5000|$|Heidersdorf (Erzgeb) (...) Heidersdorf (Erzgeb) halt {{was opened}} on 1 October 1895 as Niederseiffenbach stop (Haltestelle). Like Oberneuschönberg, the station had a <b>loading</b> <b>track</b> that was {{connected}} at both ends. The connecting {{track of the}} Gebr. Einhorn woodworking company has also branched off the line since 1912. The buildings originally consisted of the entrance building with a service and waiting room, a freight shed and a free access. The station received the present name of Heidersdorf (Erzgeb) on 15 May 1939.|$|E
50|$|Between 1860 and 1870 {{a station}} {{building}} was built. At {{the same time}} an extensive area was developed for rail freight, including a marshalling yard, <b>loading</b> <b>tracks</b> and a locomotive depot with a turntable and a roundhouse because Elberfeld station had no room for such facilities.|$|R
