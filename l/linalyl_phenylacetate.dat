40|$|The {{use of this}} {{material}} under current conditions is supported by existing information. This material was evaluated for genotoxicity, repeated dose toxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicity, local respiratory toxicity, phototoxicity/photoallergenicity, skin sensitization, as well as environmental safety. Data show that {{this material}} is not genotoxic. Data from the suitable read across analog <b>linalyl</b> <b>phenylacetate</b> (CAS # 7143 - 69 - 3) show that this material does not have skin sensitization potential. The repeated dose toxicity endpoint was completed using linalyl cinnamate (CAS # 78 - 37 - 5) as a suitable read across analog, which provided a MOE > 100. The developmental and reproductive toxicity endpoint was completed using linalool (CAS # 78 - 70 - 6), dehydrolinalool (CAS # 29171 - 20 - 8), benzoic acid (CAS # 65 - 85 - 0) and sodium benzoate (CAS # 532 - 32 - 1) as suitable read across analogs, which provided a MOE > 100. The local respiratory toxicity endpoint was completed using linalool (CAS # 78 - 70 - 6) and benzoic acid (CAS # 65 - 85 - 0) as suitable read across analogs, which provided a MOE > 100. The phototoxicity/photoallergenicity endpoint was completed based on suitable UV spectra. The environmental endpoint was completed {{as described in the}} RIFM Framework along with data from the suitable read across analog linalyl cinnamate (CAS # 78 - 375) ...|$|E
