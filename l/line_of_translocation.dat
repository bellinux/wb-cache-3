40|$|AbstractGenome {{rearrangement}} is {{an important}} area in computational biology. There are three basic operations, reversal, translocation and transposition. Here we study the translocation operations. Multi-chromosomal genomes frequently evolve by translocation events that exchange genetic material between two chromosomes. We focus on the signed case, where the direction of each gene is known. The signed translocation problem asks to find the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> operations {{as well as the}} sequence <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> operations to transform one genome into the other. A linear-time algorithm that computes the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> operations was given in a linear-time algorithm for computing translocation distance between signed genomes [16].

40|$|The {{transport}} of a presecretory protein into the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum {{can be divided}} into early translocation events which include specific targeting of the presecretory protein to and insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and late translocation events, comprising signal sequence cleavage, completion <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> and folding <b>of</b> the secretory protein into a functional conformation. The microsomal membrane proteins Sec 61 alpha p and translocating-chain-associating membrane protein were previously identified as being in close contact with a nascent presecretory protein at an early step <b>of</b> <b>translocation.</b> Here, we investigated whether additional microsomal proteins are in contact with translocating chains during or immediately after transit.

Escherichia coli (10 (8) to 10 (10) bacteria) and E. coli endotoxin (100 micrograms per animal) were gavaged into the stomach immediately before a 30 % burn injury was inflicted in mice. Animals were killed 1, 4 and 24 hours after burn injury. Translocation occurred extensively within 1 hour after burn injury. Expressed as amount of radioactivity per gram <b>of</b> tissue, <b>translocation</b> was greatest in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) followed by spleen, lung, and liver. <b>Translocation</b> <b>of</b> endotoxin was similar to <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> intact bacteria, with the exception that less radioactivity could be found in the peritoneal cavity and more in the liver.

40|$|Abstract. Restorations are complex, often {{involving}} restoring ecological processes, vegetation structure, and species’ populations. One component <b>of</b> restorations is <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> key species. <b>Translocations</b> (introductions, reintroductions, augmentations) {{are often}} necessary to recover species diversity and install key species. In this review, I consider the ways translocations havebeen evaluated {{at various stages}} {{during the process of}} restoration. Vital rates (survival, growth, fecundity) of propagules (seeds, transplants) are commonly used to evaluate initial success. Transplants usually provide greater initial success than do sown seeds. Beyond initial rates, completion of the life cycle through flowering, fruiting, dispersal and subsequent seedling recruitment is a key benchmark. Modelling population viability of translocated populations is a logical next step and canbring inmanypowerful inferential tools. Of factors affecting the success <b>of</b> <b>translocations,</b> genetic issues are paramount, as restorationists need to consider inbreeding depression, reproductive viability, local adaptation, and evolutionary potential of translocated populations. The success <b>of</b> <b>translocations</b> is also clearly context-dependent, with herbivory, disturbance, competition and other ecological factors important. Future translocations need to make better use of comparisonswith reference populations, a long-termperspective on success and an experimental framework that can provide both practical and basic knowledge.

Non-conservation translocations for commercial, amenity and aesthetic reasons are carried out using native and non-native species, and genetically modified organisms. Precise definitions of the different types <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> are given, {{as well as other}} important terms used in the review. Four subject areas are covered in separate chapters: species native to the UK, species not native to the UK, genetically modified organisms, and species assemblages. The types <b>of</b> <b>translocations</b> carried out within the subject area are reviewed and representative case studies are presented. A set of definitions of genetic, species and ecosystem biodiversity are determined, and are used as a framework with which to assess the environmental effects of each type <b>of</b> <b>translocation.</b> For all types <b>of</b> <b>translocation,</b> the adverse effects on biodiversity are assessed using the case studies. For conservation translocations, the factors affecting the success and benefits <b>of</b> the <b>translocation</b> are determined as well. Existing policies and guidelines of UK and international organisations relating to each type <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> are summarised and assessed {{in the light of the}} reviews of case studies. UK and European legislation and international conventions relevant to translocations in the UK are also summarised and possible improvements are suggested which would allow better regulation and the amelioration of adverse effects on biodiversity. While certain types <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> are well regulated in the UK (e. g. GMO release, release of non-resident alien animals), others poorly covered by legislative controls are <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> most native species, release of most alien plants or animals resident in the UK and control of problem alien species.

Areas requiring further research are highlighted, and these illustrate a need for more coordinated and structured monitoring and databasing of current and future translocations. A major aspect <b>of</b> any <b>translocation</b> must be consideration of the maximum benefit to biodiversity and/or the minimum risk of adverse impacts.

Here we summarize and critically evaluate current speculations regarding the roles of these proteins. Our understanding suffers from the suggestive power of images; what looks like a sieve tube plug on micrographs may not actually impede translocation very much. Recent reports of an involvement of SEOR (sieve element occlusion-related) proteins, a class of P-proteins, in the sealing of injured sieve tubes are inconclusive; various <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> evidence suggest that, in neither intact nor injured plants, are SEORs determinative <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> stoppage.

Even in forisomes, P-protein assemblages restricted to one single plant family and the only Ca 2 +-responsive P-proteins known, the available evidence does not unequivocally suggest that plug formation is the cause rather than a consequence <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> stoppage.

Four proficient translocating E. coli strains isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and/or the blood of rats (strains KIC- 1 and KIC- 2), from a fatal case of pancreatitis (HMLN- 1) and from pigs (PC- 1 isolated in this study) were tested for their ability to translocate across two host species and the Caco- 2 cell line as a model of the human gut epithelium. HMLN- 1 was found in the MLNs of all 15 pigs tested. This strain, however, did not translocate in any rats and only colonised the caecum of four rats in small numbers. HMLN- 1 and PC- 1 were the dominant translocating strains in Caco- 2 cells compared to KIC- 1 and KIC- 2, which were found to translocate at a lower rate in pigs and in Caco- 2 cells. The rate <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> PC- 1 in rats was also very low compared to KIC- 1 and KIC- 2. We suggest that, in studies aiming to investigate the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>translocation</b> <b>of</b> E. coli strains isolated from humans, rats may not be an appropriate animal model and that the Caco- 2 cells or pigs are more suitable in vitro and in vivo models, respectively...|$|R
