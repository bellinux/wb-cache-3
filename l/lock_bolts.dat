5000|$|The {{standard}} unit is a single-shaft, double-bearing unit constructed with a sieving box, mesh, vibration exciter and damper spring. The screen framing is steel side plates and cross-members that brace static and dynamic forces. At {{the center of}} the side plates, two roller bearings with counterweights are connected to run the drive. Four sets of springs are fixed on the base of the unit to overcome the lengthwise or crosswise tension from sieves and panels and to dampen movement. [...] An external vibration exciter (motor) is mounted on the lateral (side) plate of the screen box with a cylindrical eccentric shaft and stroke adjustment unit. At the screen outlet, the flows are changed in direction, usually to 90 degrees or alternate directions, which reduces the exiting stream speed. Strong, ring-grooved <b>lock</b> <b>bolts</b> connect components.|$|E
30|$|Nail failure {{has been}} {{reported}} by Gonschorek et al. and Wolinsky et al.

This led to discontinuation of the use of cannulated <b>locking</b> <b>bolts</b> and a policy to insert both bolts in all static nailing procedures. In addition, in severely comminuted fractures and overweight patients, the weight bearing protocol was altered.|$|R

In the industrial environment of an ongoing endeavour to lightweight and the resulting efforts to utilize fiber plastic composites, {{the use of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>bolts</b> is facing different challenges. As part of research project, a vacuum-injection-method is established, which allows a flexible and cost-effective production of test laminates. The quality of the product laminates is evaluated using statistical procedures. Based on the knowledge about design stndards and guideline for screw connections nad for lock bolt systems, this research, report takes {{on the question of the}} transferability of these design rules onto fiber art material. The basic interest in this context is the carrying capacity of shear force loaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolts</b> connections and the determination of yielding in the laminate thickness direction. For shear force loaded lock bolt connections the possible failures will be listed and the accompannying arithmetical verification presented. Due to the variety of fiber plastic composites, whose selection mainly depends on the type and amount of the load, in this project trial-based assessments are determined and the capacities to withstand certain stresses are investigated. The investigation is focused on the determination of the compliances and the ultimate interface pressure, the shear and bearing stress experiments for the experimental determination of the bearing stress coeddicient as well as the use of the statistic test planning and evaluation in respect to the use of slip-restiant preloaded lock bolt connections. Finally, the experimental determined stress restiance (ultimate surface pressure, ultimate bearing resistance, slip resistance) are compared with the calculated stress resistance and literature values...|$|E

According to the above reason, the super <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> with double screw mechanism, which is non-loosening, has been developed for preventing such kind of bolt failure. The objects of the present study are as follows: (1) To clarify the fatigue strength characteristics. (2) To investigate the initiation and propagation behaviour of fatigue crack regarding to the thread root of first pitch. In addition, the mechanism of “fatigue strength of super <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> ” is also discussed in this paper and it is confirmed that this bolt shows excellent fatigue strength and non-loosening properties...|$|R

25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|R
