This research seeks to investigate the liquid moisture management proper-ties of knitted fabrics of different fibre blends of different ratios suitable for the base layer of underwear. Two groups of fabrics were knitted in combined and plain and plated single jersey with <b>laid-in</b> <b>yarn</b> patterns, and their moisture management properties were assessed using a moisture management tester. The usage of fleecy yarn in knitted fabric structure has improved the moisture management properties of fabrics in comparison to combined pattern fabrics. Out of ten fabrics studied, three were classified as moisture management fabrics that are suitable for the base layer of underwear.
