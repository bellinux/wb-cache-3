Cysteine proteases from these <b>plants</b> <b>latex</b> exhibited both thrombin and plasmin like activities. Latex enzyme fraction in a concentration dependent manner induced the formation of clot in citrated blood plasma. Direct incubation of fibrinogen with latex enzyme fraction resulted {{in the formation of}} fibrin clot similar to thrombin enzyme. However prolonged incubation resulted in degradation of the formed fibrin clot suggesting plasmin like activity. Latex enzyme fraction preferentially hydrolyzed A alpha and B beta chains of fibrinogen to form fibrin clot.

40|$|ABSTRACT The mangabeira <b>latex,</b> <b>plant</b> native from Cerrado, shows biotechnological {{potential}} {{for the development of}} new drugs. Little is known about the latex productivity and bleeding methods in mangabeira, which is usually utilized in extractive way for fruit production. Aiming to broaden the knowledge about mangabeira latex production it was evaluated the productivity associated with bleeding methods; environmental conditions; anatomical aspects from the bark and seasonal properties. As results it was observed that the bleeding method commonly used in rubber tree is not appropriated to mangabeira; the most productive bleeding method was using a knife in stalk region. The bark thickness and lactiferous vessels number are associated with latex production. Anatomical analysis showed that the bark in mangabeira is thick and the lactiferous vessels are deeply localized, in this way some superficial bleeding methods are not able to reach the vessels. It was also observed that the increase in environmental temperature has a positive influence on the productivity of latex and that during the fruiting time the latex production is significantly lower. This probably occurs because the plant uses part of the secondary metabolites for fruit formation, which reduced the availability of these metabolites to latex production...|$|E
40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>latex</b> is {{a complex}} environment. Occurring in {{hundreds}} of plant species and contained in a tube system called laticifers, latex is a milky sap with a diverse composition that includes alkaloids, terpenoid compounds, other secondary metabolites {{and a number of}} enzymes. These substances are collectively believed to provide an important contribution to plant defence mechanisms by repelling and killing phytopathogens, and sealing wounded areas. This review provides insights of what is currently known about the biochemistry and molecular biology of <b>plant</b> <b>latex,</b> as studied in various model systems, above all the economically important rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. Selecting the Mediterranean shrub Euphorbia characias as a complementary experimental model, we have recently begun to disclose the properties of several components of the enzymatic machinery present in its latex.

40|$|Ammonia {{removal from}} skim latex is an {{essential}} step in skim block production process. In general, skim latex contains about 0. 4 % ammonia by weight of skim latex {{and needs to be}} reduced in order to minimize acid usage during rubber coagulation step. The method used to remove ammonia from skim latex in many concentrated rubber <b>latex</b> <b>plants</b> is ammonia volatilization by agitating skim latex using a large agitator in a mixing pool. In this research, a new method to remove ammonia from water by blowing wind over the water surface was investigated. The effects of agitation speed and wind speed on overall mass transfer coefficient and removal rate of ammonia were investigated in a pilot scale experiment. The result has shown that the overall mass transfer coefficient and the ammonia removal rate increase linearly with increasing Reynolds number of air and liquid. However, the ammonia removal rate by using wind speed was much higher than that given by agitation method. The wind speed method proposed in this study is then recommended for ammonia removal from skim latex. Possible ways for applying the wind speed method for skim <b>latex</b> production <b>plant</b> are also suggested. The relationship between the wind speed or Reynolds number and the mass transfer coefficient {{can also be used to}} design the system for ammonia removal from water byusing wind speed...|$|R

With increase of <b>plant</b> <b>latex,</b> the particle size was reduced and porous structure was converted to spherical shaped particles. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra indicated that the peaks situated at similar to 590, 615, 648 and 702 nm were attributed to the D- 5 (0) -> F- 7 (j(j= 1, 2, 3, 4)) transitions of Eu 3 + ions.

Twenty-one chromosomal linkage groups constituting heterologous chromosomes and sizing between 0. 3 and 3 Mb could be physically defined by the use of 75 DNA markers (sequence-tagged sites and genes). From these data, the genome size can be estimated at 25. 5 (± 2)  Mb. The physical linkage groups were consistently conserved in all strains examined. Moreover, the finding of several pairs of different-sized homologous chromosomes strongly suggest diploidy for this organism.

40|$|Bioactive {{compounds}} from <b>plant</b> <b>latex</b> {{are potential}} source of antifungic against post harvest pathogens. Latex from a total of seven plant species was investigated for its phytochemical and antifungal properties. Six fungi namely Aspergillus fumigatus, A. niger, A. terreus, F. solani, P. digitatum and R. arrhizus were isolated from infected {{fruits and vegetables and}} tested against various solvent extracts of latex. Analysis of latex extracts with phytochemical tests showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins and terpenoids. Antifungal assay revealed the potential inhibitory activity of petroleum ether extracts against the postharvest fungal isolates. Various degree of sensitivity was observed irrespective of plant species studied with A. terreus and P. digitatum as the most susceptible ones.

40|$|Plant {{secondary}} metabolites glucosinolates (GSL) {{have important}} functions in plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens. We identified all major GSL that are accumulated in S-cells in Arabidopsis by MALDI-TOF MS, and estimated by LC-MS {{that the total}} GSL concentration in these cells is above 130 mM. The precise locations of the S-cells outside phloem bundles in rosette and cauline leaves and in flower stalks were visualised using sulphur mapping by cryo-SEM/EDX. S-cells contain up to 40 % of total sulphur in flower stalk tissues. S-cells in emerging flower stalks and developing leaf tissues show typical signs of Programmed Cell Death (PCD) or apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation in the nucleus and blebbing of the membranes. TUNEL staining for DNA double strand breaks confirmed PCD in S-cells in postmeristematic tissues in the flower stalk {{as well as in}} the leaf. Our results show that S-cells in postmeristematic tissues proceed to an extreme degree of metabolic specialisation besides PCD. Accumulation and maintenance of a high concentration of GSL in these cells are accompanied by degradation of a number of cell organelles. The substantial changes in the cell composition during S-cell differentiation indicate the importance of this particular GSL-based phloem defence system. The specific anatomy of the S-cells and ability to accumulate specialised secondary metabolites is similar to that of the non-articulated laticifer cells in <b>latex</b> <b>plants</b> and thus indicates a common evolutionary origin...|$|R

40|$|Aim of the study: To {{validate}} the scientific basis of <b>plant</b> <b>latex</b> {{to stop bleeding}} on fresh cuts. Cysteine protease(s) from Asclepias curassavica (Asclepiadaceae) <b>plant</b> <b>latex</b> was assessed for pro-coagulant and thrombin like activities. Materials and methods: A waxy material from the latex of Asclepias curassavica latex was removed by freezing and thawing. The resulted latex enzyme fraction was assayed for proteolytic activity using denatured casein as substrate. Its coagulant activity and thrombin like activity were determined using citrated plasma and pure fibrinogen. respectively. Inhibition studies were performed using specific protease inhibitors to know the type of protease. Results: The latex enzyme fraction exhibited strong proteolytic activity when compared to trypsin and exerted pro-coagulant action by reducing plasma clotting time from 195 to 58 s whereas trypsin reduced clotting time marginally from 195 to 155 s. The pro-coagulant activity of this enzyme fraction was exerted by selectively hydrolyzing A alpha and B beta subunits of fibrinogen to form fibrin clot when pure fibrinogen was used as substrate as assessed by fibrinogen-agarose plate method and fibrinogen polymerization assay. Trypsin failed to induce any fibrin clot under similar conditions. The electrophoretic pattern of latex enzyme fraction-induced fibrin clot was very much {{similar to that of}} thrombin-induced fibrin clot and mimic thrombin like action. The proteolytic activity including thrombin like activity of Asclepias curassavica latex enzyme fraction was completely inhibited by iodoaceticacid (IAA). Conclusion: Cysteine proteases from Asclepias curassavica latex exhibited strong pro-coagulant action and were found to be specific in its action (Thrombin like).
