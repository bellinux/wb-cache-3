5|$|By the 1890s, the {{observatory}} had become crowded by {{the rapidly growing}} university. Electrification of the tramways along College Street just to the south, and the <b>large</b> <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> metal used in the modern buildings surrounding the site threw off the instruments. A new magnetic observatory opened in 1898 in Agincourt, at that time largely empty fields, leaving the downtown campus location with its meteorological and solar observation duties.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Vera Rubin {{uncovered}} a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that {{predicted by the}} visible mass of stars and gas.
