The tunnel has clear pāhoehoe lava in some reaches while in some other reaches the roof has collapsed with large lava blocking the tunnel route making access hazardous and narrow. Lava gutters are also seen. A number of secondary tunnels also have impressive geological formations. The lava tubes have picturesque formations of stalactites (lavacicles), stalagmites, lava, lava benches and side balls or balls of lava.

50|$|The {{eruption}} which formed this Lava River Cave occurred about 80,000 years ago. The {{source is}} believed to be near Mokst Butte southeast of the entrance. The same volcanic flow that formed the cave underlies much of the Bend area and almost reaches Redmond, Oregon. However, the specific vent that created the cave has been buried by several younger flows. The Lava River Cave was created by lava flowing downhill from a volcanic vent. The lava flowed northwest from the vent toward the Deschutes River. The flow began as a river of lava flowing in an open channel. Eventually, a lava crust solidified {{over the top of the}} flowing lava. This formed a roof over the river, enclosing it in a <b>lava</b> <b>tunnel</b> or tube.

To the southeast the land is low-lying and largely used for agriculture, with many small beach resorts along the coast. The northeast of {{the municipality}} is largely uninhabited, having been buried approximately 3000 years ago by the eruption of the Montaña Corona which formed the inhospitable Malpais de la Corona. This eruption also produced extensive hollow <b>lava</b> <b>tunnels</b> called jameos, some of which have been developed into two of the island's most-visited geological attractions: the Cueva de los Verdes and the Jameos del Agua.|$|R
50|$|Lava {{sometimes}} forms a tube as {{it moves}} away from the vent (opening from which lava flows from a volcano). The top of a stream of lava cools down, thereby forming a solid roof. Meanwhile, the lava continues moving in the tube. Often, when all the lava leaves the tube, the roof collapses, making a channel. These features are found on Mars. Some can be seen around Pavonis Mons, in the picture below. Some people have suggested that future colonists on Mars could use <b>lava</b> <b>tunnels</b> as shelters. They would offer great protection from radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation. Lava Channels on the flank of the volcano Pavonis Mons are pictured below in a picture from Mars Odyssey THEMIS. Sometimes the lava tube remains intact for a time. Lava will break out along the tube to accumulate or flow away. Lava flows often have a lobate appearance at the edges. A good view of such a lava tube is shown below.|$|R

The 690 °C volcanic gas is most likely a mix of magmatic gas and local snow buried under the lava flows as indicated by oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of the condensate. The lower-temperature gas enrichment in gold, copper and chlorine is resulted from evaporation of the 690 °C condensate during forced gas pumping at sampling.

The strain {{response}} of the Earth to tidal forces is observed in the Geodynamics Laboratory of Lanzarote Island. The instruments, installed in a gallery inside the <b>lava</b> <b>tunnel</b> of Cueva de los Verdes, are kind of horizontal ceramic-tube extensometers. Their base fines comprise from 8 to 38 m length and are orientated in two orthogonal directions (45 º. 2 N Y 135 °. 2 N), which depend {{on the situation in}} the gallery. The reliability of this instruments, which measure the variation of distance between two fixed points with a resolution of 10 - 10, allow us to dispose long term series of tidal strains since 1992.

Also, with these data we can determine the tidal strain models, as well as the tidal deformation and the long-term variations of strains in this island. Due to the dependence of the local conditions of the station, which is located in an island, the oceanic influence will be investigated together with local atmospheric disturbing effects.

This concept is known as in-situ resource utilization and it is critical to long term missions such as those to Mars. During my time here I worked on the Asteroid and Lava Tube Free Flyer project (ALTFF). A lava tube, such as the one shown in figure 1, is a long tear drop shaped cavern that is produced when molten <b>lava</b> <b>tunnels</b> through the surrounding rock creating large unground pathways. Before mining for resources on Mars or on asteroids, a sampling mission must be done to scout out useful resource deposits.

40|$|In {{the global}} strive for {{improved}} quality of life, sustainable and clean agricultural production is among {{one of the}} priorities. Mauritius, being a small island country, where sugarcane production predominates in the agricultural landscape, {{is aware of the}} delicate balance of preserving its fresh water supply, lagoon ecology, and the economic progress. Every year 11, 000 tonnes of N is being applied to the sugarcane fields, which occupy 43 % of total land area. The perception that sugarcane production is a potential pollutant to the rivers and the lagoon is felt strongly. Though the findings from samples collected in River La Chaux showed that the N detected was not of agronomical significance, and was just within the threshold value for environmental concerns, refinement to these initial findings was necessary to verify possible undetected peak values, which were not revealed by the simplicity of a lumped model. The objectives of this study are: 1. To define a conceptual model for River La Chaux catchment hydrology, taking into account the water balance, and hence the transport of different forms of N within the catchments sources and sinks. 2. To identify the sources and sinks of N, the key parameters which influence their transport in the catchment, through the integration of surface and subsurface hydrology model, where a conventional hydrology model would be limiting because of the complex volcanic geology of the island. The project study focus is to understand the processes of catchment hydrology and nutrient transport in River La Chaux catchment through a conceptual model, and to translate it to a catchment model that corresponds most to the conceptual model. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was chosen and tested for this simulation exercise. It is a physically distributed catchment model that caters for surface and subsurface hydrology interaction, including simulation of crop growth, the transformation processes of N nutrient, and its transport within the catchment. GIS processing facilities were used to define the sub-basins of the catchment into hydrologic response units (HRU), based on topography, land use, and soil type characteristics. The defined HRUs were coupled with the daily time series meteorological data to establish the hydrology components of the flow. This rainfall-runoff model enables simultaneous calculation of lateral and vertical flow through soil profile, in addition to the surface runoff. A commercial crop calendar was also linked to the model to represent the standard cropping practice of cane growers in terms of planting and harvest dates, land preparation, N input and expected crop yield. Since the sugarcane crop occupies 87 % of the catchment, the hydrology model hinges on realistic crop growth simulation in terms of water and nutrient uptake by the crop, and its subsequent influence to other hydrology components like run-off, lateral flow and percolation. Modifications to parameters in SWAT crop database with local values and recent findings in the sugarcane crop modeling improved the simulated biomass and evaporation values considerably. With the problem of incomplete climate datasets, two methods for potential evapotranspiration calculation were tested. The Hargreave method was found to give better potential evapotranspiration (PET) but lower biomass estimate than that of Penman- Monteith method, as it uses only the two predominant parameters: solar radiation and temperature, reducing parameters errors. However, for longer time series simulation Penman-Monteith method performed slightly better, giving satisfactory evapotranspiration and biomass simulation. Calibration of the catchment hydrology was done, using historical data of rainfall-runoff records, and the hydrology components were evaluated for the catchment. The results compared well with those obtained from the lumped model, Hydrology Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF). It was found that rainfall in the catchment contributed to 14 % runoff, 16 % lateral flow, and 37 % percolation, 31 % of evapotranspiration, and 2 % as deep drainage loss. The surface run-off however was much more important in SWAT, and insignificant the deep aquifer loss, as opposed to the findings of HSPF. Comparison of simulated flow with measured flow, using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency evaluation method, gave values between - 0. 39 to 0. 14, and the R 2 value 0. 7 - 0. 8, with a systematic overestimation of 30 to 40 % of measured flow. Dilution of the models efficiency was exhibited with long term historical data, indicating inherent measurement errors in these data. The model also showed that the upstream catchment boundary does not reflect the groundwater boundary. However despite the unaccounted transmission loss in geological faults and collapsed <b>lava</b> <b>tunnel</b> in the catchment, the majority of the fast moving base flow exits at River La Chaux estuary. The study highlighted the preponderant role of sugarcane crop in the hydrology of the catchment in attenuating run-off, and in ensuring the replenishment of the aquifer. Nutrient transport is mainly by base and lateral flows, which prevail even in dry period. Detailed water balance for each sub-basin revealed the difference in N transport pathways in the sub-basins: Percolation predominates in young lava soils, whereas lateral flow in intermediate lava soils. Erosion is not a problem in the catchment. Simulation results ranked the agronomic importance of N loss as follow: Leached...|$|E
5000|$|The Pali-Aike {{volcanic}} field {{covers a}} {{surface area of}} 4500 km2, and extends over 150 km from northwest to southeast. It is formed by a plateau of lava flows that is up to 120 m thick in its northwestern reach and includes remnants of individual volcanic centres. This plateau is formed by tables containing depressions and lakes, and whose margins are steep-dipping slopes that accumulate blocks at their feet. The volcanic rocks are emplaced atop Tertiary sediments, which are smoothened by glacial action. Some volcanic necks situated in the west-central part of the field may be the underground components of now-eroded volcanic edifices.Over 450 different monogenetic volcanoes are emplaced on the lava plateau at elevations of 110 - 180 m above sea level and include maars, tuff rings and scoria cones. Some of these are heavily eroded while the southeastern part of the field features fresh-looking centres, where they form the [...] "Basaltos del Diablo". These various centres rise between 20 - 160 m above the surrounding terrain. Nested craters, breached craters and fissure vents are common among the various vents, as well as lava flows {{but there has been}} little research on the scoria cones. Pyroclastic cones in Pali-Aike include Aymond, Colorado, Dinero, Fell and Negro. The vent Cerro del Diablo, a pyroclastic cone is the youngest volcano in the field and emitted both aa lava and pahoehoe lava, which have a fresh appearance and no soil cover. [...] The vents are origins of lava flows, some of which are older and covered with soil while younger ones are not. Such young lava flows also have surface features including <b>lava</b> <b>tunnels,</b> hornitos, tumuli and a rugose surface. The individual volcanoes are subdivided into three groups which are referred to as [...] "U2" [...] (the older centres) and [...] "U3" [...] (for the more recent vents); the plateau lavas are hence called [...] "U1".Maars are depressions in the ground which are encircled by a ring of sediment that rises above the surrounding terrain and typically form where frozen or liquid water interacted with rising magma; in Pali-Aike there are about 100 of them and their diameters range from 500 m to about 4000 m. The periglacial ground is rich in ice and water and this might explain why there are so many maars in Pali-Aike. Notable among these lakes is Laguna Azul, a crater lake which is located within a pyroclastic ring at the side of a scoria cone. This maar formed during three stages in three separate craters and is also the source of a lava flow. Laguna Potrok Aike in comparison is much larger (crater diameter of 5 km), its rim is barely recognizable and appears to be more akin to a maar. Additional maars in the southwestern part of the field are the so-called [...] "West Maar" [...] and [...] "East Maar", which contain the lakes Laguna Salsa and Laguna del Ruido respectively, Carlota, Los Flamencos, Laguna Salida/Laguna Ana and Timone Lake.|$|R
60|$|Hookena is its name. It {{stands on}} the same coast which I had {{wondered}} at before from the tossing Casco; the same coast on which the far voyager Cook ended a noble career not very nobly. That district of Kona where he fell is one illustrious {{in the history of}} Hawaii. It was at first the centre of the dominion of the great Kamehameha. There, in an unknown sepulchre, his bones are still hidden; there, too, his reputed treasures, spoils of a buccaneer, lie, and are still vainly sought for, in one of the thousand caverns of the lava. There the tabus were first broken, there the missionaries first received; and but for the new use of ships and the new need of harbours, here might be still the chief city and the organs of the kingdom. Yet a nearer approach confirmed the impression of the distance. It presents to the seaward one immense decline. Streams of lava have followed and submerged each other down this slope, and overflowed into the sea. These cooled and shrank, and were buried under fresh inundations, or dislocated by fresh tremors of the mountain. A multiplicity of caves is the result. The mouths of caves are everywhere; the <b>lava</b> is <b>tunnelled</b> with corridors and halls; under houses high on the mountain, the sea can be heard throbbing {{in the bowels of the}} land; and there is one gallery of miles, which has been used by armies as a pass. Streams are thus unknown. The rain falls continually in the highlands: an isle that rises nearly fourteen thousand feet sheer from the sea could never fail of rain; but the treasure is squandered on a sieve; and by sunless conduits returns unseen into the ocean. Corrugated slopes of lava, bristling lava cliffs, spouts of metallic clinkers, miles of coast without a well or rivulet; scarce anywhere a beach, nowhere a harbour: here seems a singular land to be contended for in battle as a seat for courts and princes. Yet it possessed in the eyes of the natives one more than countervailing advantage. The windward shores of the isle are beaten by a monstrous surf; there are places where goods and passengers must be hauled up and lowered by a rope, there are coves which even the daring boatmen of Hamakua dread to enter; and men live isolated in their hamlets or communicate by giddy footpaths in the cliff. Upon the side of Kona, the table-like margin of the lava affords almost everywhere a passage by land; and the waves, reduced by the vast breakwater of the island, allow an almost continual communication by way of sea.|$|R
