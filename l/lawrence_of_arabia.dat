5|$|At the 12th Academy Awards, Gone {{with the}} Wind {{set a record}} for Academy Award wins and nominations, winning in eight of the {{competitive}} categories it was nominated in, from a total of thirteen nominations. It won for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, and Best Editing, and received two further honorary awards for its use of equipment and color (it also became the first color film to win Best Picture). Its record of eight competitive wins stood until Gigi (1958) won nine, and its overall record of ten was broken by Ben-Hur (1959) which won eleven. Gone with the Wind also held the record for most nominations until All About Eve (1950) secured fourteen. It was the longest American sound film made up to that point, and may still hold {{the record of the}} longest Best Picture winner depending on how it is interpreted. The running time for Gone with the Wind is just under 221minutes, while <b>Lawrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arabia</b> (1962) runs for just over 222minutes; however, including the overture, intermission, entr'acte, and exit music, Gone with the Wind lasts for 234minutes (although some sources put its full length at 238minutes) while <b>Lawrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arabia</b> comes in slightly shorter at 232minutes with its additional components.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between skin, ego and second skins. It does so conceptually by re-examining Freud's suggestion, in The Ego and the Id (1923), that the ego {{is first and foremost}} a bodily entity, while also being a projection of a surface (i. e. skin). Drawing upon Anzieu, a dynamic model of inter-weaving surfaces can be seen to underpin an understanding of the ego – and skin ego. This model is fundamentally spatialized. Even so, an appreciation of the spatialities of skin and ego can be developed further. To illuminate these, this paper examines two key experiences <b>of</b> T. E. <b>Lawrence</b> during his military service in Arabia (c. 1917), as he describes them in his autobiographical account Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1926). In a meeting with British military police, and in the notorious Deraa rape incident, what is at stake is <b>Lawrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arabia's</b> skins. Reading these experiences using Freud and Anzieu, the paper argues that these events re-present an ongoing chafing <b>of</b> <b>Lawrence's</b> skin, ego and second skins, which can be called his 'skin of suffering'...|$|R
5|$|T. E.

He mentioned Navenby {{in a letter to}} a friend at the time, saying: I'm too shy to go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{structure}} {{influenced the}} biographical films <b>Lawrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arabia</b> and —which {{begin with the}} subject's death and show their life in flashbacks—as well as Welles's thriller Mr. Arkadin. Rosenbaum sees similarities in the film's plot to Mr. Arkadin, {{as well as the}} theme of nostalgia for loss of innocence throughout Welles's career, beginning with Citizen Kane and including The Magnificent Ambersons, Mr. Arkadin and Chimes at Midnight. Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced Warren Beatty's Reds. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in Citizen Kane.|$|E
