5|$|According to Naughty Dog, Cutter was {{originally}} supposed to remain by the protagonists' side {{until the final}} battle with Katherine Marlowe and Talbot, but McTavish was forced to drop out in order to fly to New Zealand after <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> role The Hobbit. Cutter's role was therefore reduced to only {{the first half of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the risks}} {{associated}} with the Lunar <b>landing,</b> <b>a</b> number of rescue spacecraft were proposed, to be used to allow the crew of an Apollo mission to return to Earth safely {{in the event of a}} problem. Many of these designs were based around the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|After an unopposed <b>landing,</b> <b>a</b> mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police mounted a stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured the wireless station at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of the war and the only significant action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window. The chaff and other countermeasures would hide {{the small size of}} the naval force while wireless traffic would play on the FUSAG story to mislead the Germans into expecting a major <b>landing.</b> <b>A</b> third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|During {{her years}} in Minneapolis, Hickok {{lived with a}} society {{reporter}} named Ella Morse, {{with whom she had}} an eight-year relationship. In 1926, Hickok was diagnosed with diabetes, and Morse persuaded her take a year's leave from the newspaper so the pair could travel to San Francisco and Hickok could write a novel.

5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds to go, but Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E
5|$|Round two {{started with}} two fighters {{throwing}} strikes with St-Pierre <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> punch drawing blood from Penn's nose. St-Pierre then clinched up and tripped Penn to the ground. There Penn attempted to defend using the rubber guard, but St-Pierre passed to half-guard and eventually side-control while landing punches. The two continued grappling with Penn taking several ground-and-pound punches from St-Pierre until the round ended.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Tripoli was {{a battle}} between the navies of the Kingdom of Sardinia and Vilayet of Tripoli on 26 September 1825 during the Sardinian-Tripolitanian war of the same year. In order to resist Tripolitanian demands for {{increased}} tribute, the Sardinian king sent a squadron to force Tripoli to a favorable peace treaty. The Tripolitanians refused to change their demands {{and as a result}} the Sardinian squadron assaulted the city of Tripoli, sinking several vessels and <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> force to attack the city. Suffering heavy naval losses the Tripolitanian government quickly agreed to a favorable peace treaty with Sardinia, thus ending the war on favorable terms for the Sardinians.|$|E
5|$|The medallions {{were struck}} in {{sterling}} silver {{two to three}} months prior to the scheduled mission, though it is unclear whether serial numbers were added pre or post-flight. The medallions were stored in the Command Service Module during flight and on missions involving a lunar <b>landing,</b> <b>a</b> small number were brought to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module. The flown medallions were returned to the Robbins Company after the flight to have the dates engraved and for a final polishing. Except where noted, all medallions struck for Apollo 7–14 were flown, and serial numbers for Apollo 14–17 medallions appear on the rim.|$|E
5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a clinch early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief flurry of punches and <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw a flurry of punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai Clinch before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle. Jackson scrambled out of the clinch and scored a takedown {{with a combination of}} a leg trip and a headlock. Jackson attacked with ground and pound, but to limited damage, while Silva attempted submissions unsuccessfully. The referee then stood the fighters up due to inactivity.|$|E

Steam-powered steering gear was {{installed in the}} sisters in 1887 and they were reclassified as coast-defense ironclads on 13 February 1892. By this time, their role in Russian war plans was to defend the Gulf of Riga against an anticipated German amphibious <b>landing.</b> <b>A</b> few years later they often served with the fleet's Artillery Training Detachment. Admiral Lazarev was transferred to the port of Libava as a guardship during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.|$|E

5|$|A Junkers F.13 {{called at}} Lympne on 10 January 1923 {{to clear customs}} and then flew to Croydon where it was {{inspected}} by Secretary of State for Air Sir Samuel Hoare. In February, {{it was reported that}} Lympne had taken part in a test of the newly introduced Mayday radio signal used by aircraft to indicate that they were in distress. Georges Barbot won a prize of F.25,000 from Le Matin when he made a flight from St Inglevert to Lympne and back again on the same day, 6 May. He flew the route in a Dewoitine aircraft fitted with a Clerget engine. On <b>landing</b> <b>a</b> bracing wire in the undercarriage of the aircraft broke, but repairs were effected within half an hour. Problems starting the engine then delayed his departure slightly. On 28 October the Light Aircraft Trials were held (see below). In 1923, Air Union started a service flying newspapers to Lympne using a Farman F.60 Goliath.|$|E
