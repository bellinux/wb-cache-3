50|$|One {{problem with}} X10 is {{excessive}} attenuation of signals {{between the two}} live conductors in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one live conductor may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other live conductor. Often, there's simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer <b>leg</b> <b>wire</b> to the other; this failure may {{come and go as}} large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an active repeater device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with a coupling device. A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.|$|E

50|$|The blue 3P+N+E, 9h (270°) plug is a {{three phase}} {{connector}} available {{in areas with}} both 115 V and 230 V supply systems (mains). It is prevalent in the outdoor event lighting and audio power industry as an outdoor-safe replacement for NEMA connectors. In the United States it is not usually used for three phase power but for the high <b>leg</b> delta <b>wiring</b> of split-phase electric power (unknown in Europe). This allows one to choose single-phase AC power at either 110-120 volts between phase and neutral or 220-240 volts between phase and phase.

The controller proposed here is an extension of the one proposed for a three-wire Shunt Active Power Filter. The controller is a two-level nested controller. The outerloop generates the reference current for the inner-loop. The latter, is a state-feedback current controller with integral action. The former consists of (i) a selective harmonic elimination technique and (ii) a DC-capacitor-voltage controller. This paper will focus on the neutral-wire current control and on the balance control of the DC-capacitor voltage.

40|$|This review {{provides}} a comprehensive {{overview of the}} vascularization of the avian growth plate and its subsequent role in the pathogenesis of bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO, femoral head necrosis). BCO sporadically causes high incidences of lameness in rapidly growing broiler (meat-type) chickens. BCO {{is believed to be}} initiated by micro-trauma to poorly mineralized columns of cartilage cells in the proximal growth plates of the leg bones, followed by colonization by hematogenously distributed opportunistic bacteria. Inadequate blood flow to the growth plate, vascular occlusion, and structural limitations of the microvasculature all have been implicated in the pathogenesis of BCO. Treatment strategies have been difficult to investigate because under normal conditions the incidence of BCO typically is low and sporadic. Rearing broilers on wire flooring triggers the spontaneous development of high incidences of lameness attributable to pathognomonic BCO lesions. Wire flooring imposes persistent footing instability and is thought to accelerate the development of BCO by amplifying the torque and shear stress imposed on susceptible <b>leg</b> joints. <b>Wire</b> flooring per se also constitutes a significant chronic stressor that promotes bacterial proliferation attributed to stress-mediated immunosuppression. Indeed, dexamethasone-mediated immunosuppression causes broilers to develop lameness primarily associated with avascular necrosis and BCO. Prophylactic probiotic administration consistently reduces the incidence of lameness in broilers reared on wire flooring, presumably by reducing bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract that likely contributes to hematogenous infection of the leg bones. The pathogenesis of BCO in broilers is directly relevant to osteomyelitis in growing children, as well as to avascular femoral head necrosis in adults. Our new model for reliably triggering spontaneous osteomyelitis in large numbers of animals represents an i...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{to improve}} speed and energy {{efficiency}} of a sprawling-type quadruped robot, {{we focused on}} three design concepts (increase of walking velocity to reduce cost of transport, using the trot gait as low duty factor and safety gait, and increase of gear ratio of the actuator supporting gravitational force). Based on the concepts, we developed a sprawling-type quadruped robot named TITAN-XIII. To achieve a compact and low inertia <b>leg,</b> right-angle type <b>wire</b> driven mechanism was proposed and adopted to the robot. To confirm {{the validity of the}} developed sprawling-type quadruped robot, several experiments was conducted. In the experiment, the robot walked at 1.38 m/s and minimum cost of transport of 1.76 was achieved. We compared the walking speed and minimum COT with other quadruped robots. In comparison, TITAN-XIII shows almost the same level of walking velocity and energy efficiency. Considering advantages of the sprawling-type quadruped robot, which are static stability and wide range of motion, we can say the sprawling-type quadruped robot is highly practical on rough terrain.|$|R
40|$|The X-pinch plasma {{produces}} extreme {{material conditions}} {{that make it}} interesting both as a high-energy-density plasma and an x-ray source for imaging. These extreme conditions include high densities (near solid density, 10 ^ 23 ions/cm^- 3 for Mo), high temperatures (above 2. 5 keV for Mo), high energy densities (up to 10 ^ 12 J/cm^ 3), high x-ray power densities (up to 10 ^ 22 W/cm^ 3), small source sizes (which can be less than 1 micron in diameter), and short time scales for the x-ray radiation (less than 100 ps). These extreme conditions are difficult to produce in a laboratory setting and even harder to study. The X-pinch plasma is produced by driving a high current (100 - 500 kA, 100 ns FWHM pulse for our experiment) through two or more wires that cross at a point forming an "X. " A magnetically driven z-pinch forms near the cross point allowing the X-pinch to reliably reproduce the conditions given above. As such, we present a range of experiments designed to study the conditions produced in the X-pinch plasma. Until recently many of the diagnostics used to study the X-pinch {{have not had the}} resolution (spatial or temporal) necessary to determine the actual size or duration of the X-pinch x-ray source. We present experimental results showing the temporal extent of the x-ray radiation produced by an X pinch using an x-ray streak camera with better than 10 ps resolution. We also present experiments designed to study the temporal and spatial relationship of the two different radiation sources (thermal and energetic-electron-generated) observed from an X pinch using a filtered diode array. In addition, we studied the plasma dynamics using both a multi-channel 150 ps, 532 nm (Nd:YAG) laser backlighting system and x-ray radiography (using an X pinch as an x-ray source). We correlate the observed plasma parameters (implosion and explosion rate, neck diameter, axial jet propagation speed, and coronal plasma axial modulation wavelength along the X-pinch <b>legs)</b> to <b>wire</b> material...|$|R
5000|$|In the morning, Quinn, having finally {{lost his}} sanity, crucifies the German prisoner, Friedrich, {{on a wooden}} beam in no-man's land, binding his arms and <b>legs</b> with barbed <b>wire.</b> He then {{proceeds}} to beat him with his spiked club, daring any Germans there might be to shoot him and save their comrade. In the trench, Jennings, appearing to have also lost touch with reality, suddenly decides he wants a company inspection, and relieves Tate of duty when he refuses to comply. Fearing for {{the outcome of the}} standoff, both Shakespeare and Fairweather comply with the order, saving Tate from discipline. In the meantime, Jennings notices Friedrich screaming and moves off, going after Quinn. Apparently oblivious to Quinn's madness, he demands that he fall in for the inspection, but Quinn, already in a murderous frenzy, forces Jennings to his knees. Tate moves into no man's land and tries to stop him, and as he does so, Quinn tells Jennings to [...] "make his peace", and stabs him to death with a knife. Tate attacks Quinn, and during the fight, Tate gets tangled in the barbed wire. Shakespeare rushes out of the trench to try and save Tate, but is too late, and Quinn kills Tate with the club. Shakespeare confronts him with his rifle raised, though he cannot bring himself to shoot him. Quinn taunts Shakespeare and, when he refuses to kill him, berates him as a coward. Shakespeare shouts that he at least isn't a murderer, to which Quinn replies that murder is all that soldiers do. Quinn raises the club and starts towards Shakespeare, but is stopped by living strands of barbed wire that rise up from the dirt and begin to wrap around and skewer him. Shakespeare then shoots Quinn, ending his torment, before cutting Friedrich loose.|$|R
5000|$|The Lebanese Civil war was not {{the only}} {{influence}} in Kanso's work but also the wars in Vietnam and the continuing war in the Middle East. We can clearly see this in his paintings Desert Storm. Here he shows women suffering by losing a child becoming victims of war. [...] "The victims," [...] an art critic writes, [...] "are the newborn torn out of wombs or clinging to mothers fleeing natural catastrophes or political disasters." [...] It is noted by some critics that motherhood is important with Kanso’s women; you see mothers at the moment of birth and in death holding children in their arms. The bars that recur from one work to another are sometimes placed {{at the opening of the}} woman’s womb. The children suffer with their mothers as fire, storms, or ice intensifies the human situation. People of different religions are united in suffering and passion in these works of art. [...] The noted lack of greens in Kanso’s art marks his criticism of destruction of the environment. Nothing can grow during war. Flesh and blood appears to be everywhere. Water is for drowning, or for freezing. Icicles look like hairy insect <b>legs</b> or barbed <b>wire.</b> The rarely discerned sky sometimes reveals a glimpse of the forefathers like pale blue ghosts look down at their descendants. [...] War has a major influence in his work and has made his work become almost biblical and it's represented in his paintings dealing with war and apocalyptic themes, and the Apocalypse He uses apocalyptic science in his art work making them almost biblical by painting his work with earthquakes, floods, ice, fire and blood referring this to the bible's apocalypse. Nabil Kanso's apocalyptic themes can be said to be linking with the destruction of the Middle East due to war, to the destruction of the birthplace of Jesus and Christianity.|$|R
