The charity provides free education, as well as food, clothing, <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> other home missionary services for those too poor to pay. In 2007, the Shaftesbury Society was merged with John Grooms Crippleage, reorganising under the new name of Livability.|$|E
5|$|The small landowner-cultivators {{formed the}} {{majority}} of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators out of debt and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E
50|$|Starved Rock State Park's <b>Lodge</b> <b>and</b> Cabins {{were listed}} on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1985, {{as part of the}} Illinois State Park <b>Lodges</b> <b>and</b> Cabins Thematic Resources Multiple Property Submission. By the National Register's {{criteria}} the <b>Lodge</b> <b>and</b> Cabins are considered significant in the areas of architecture and entertainment/recreation. The size of the <b>lodge</b> <b>and</b> the land area the cabins cover are both nearly unrivaled in the Illinois state park system; only Pere Marquette State Park's <b>Lodge</b> <b>and</b> Cabins come close.|$|R
50|$|Starved Rock <b>Lodge</b> <b>and</b> Cabins {{were built}} from 1933 to 1939 by the Depression-Era Civilian Conservation Corps. The <b>lodge</b> <b>and</b> cabins {{originally}} cost between $200,000 and $300,000 to build. Another $200,000 {{was spent on}} the construction of a 48-room hotel wing after original construction was completed. Other alterations were completed between 1986 and 1988 when a major renovation added amenities such as a heated swimming pool and 30-room addition to the hotel.

5|$|The {{younger son}} of Henry and Margaret Wright, Edward Wright {{was born in}} the village of Garveston in Norfolk, East Anglia, and was baptised there on 8 October 1561. It is {{possible}} that he followed in the footsteps of his elder brother Thomas (died 1579) and went to school in Hardingham. The family was of modest means, and he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge, on 8 December 1576 as a sizar. Sizars were students of limited means who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> other assistance during their period of study, often in exchange for performing work at their colleges.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{officials}} in Réunion declared a disaster {{area for the}} island. The government started an emergency relief fund to provide assistance to the affected families. The European Economic Community donated ₣1.42million francs ($222,000 1989USD) due to the storm. Residents on the island assisted each other by providing <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> donating clothing. France sent 15,000ration kits, 1,500beds and blankets, and 20cisterns to the island {{in the aftermath of}} Firinga. In addition, 400troops and 50vehicles were dispatched from an insular military base in order to assist the affected populations. Within two days, crews in Réunion restored water access to about 20,000people. Conditions returned to normal in northern Réunion within about a day. In the southern portion, however, it took up to four weeks for life to return to normal. The significant amount of flooding damaged the coral reef system due to excessive runoff. Due to dead animals being washed into the ocean, diving at the reefs was banned for several weeks. The waves had damaged the coral reef system to such extent that there was no regrowth after seven years.|$|E
5|$|Combs {{also won}} {{approval}} of a $10million bond issue to benefit the state parks, which had poor <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> few amenities. Combs combined the bond issue with $10million in revenue bonds and effected major renovations at all 26 of the state's parks. Though his dreams of seeing privately owned tourist facilities spring up around the parks {{did not come to}} fruition, out-of-state tourism to Kentucky more than doubled during his administration, accounting for about sixty percent of state park visitors and fifty-three percent of the overnight visitations to the parks. Journalist John Ed Pearce recounts that Kentucky natives began to complain that they could not get reservations in the parks during peak seasons and called for limitations on the number of out-of-state visitors or a reservation system that favored Kentuckians, although nothing was done to address these complaints.|$|E

At the Milam Gap Parking, a trail leads {{east to the}} Rapidan Camp, where President Herbert Hoover had {{a summer}} residence from 1929 to 1932. The road passes Hazeltop before it passes through Bootens Gap, where it straddles the boundary of Page and Greene counties. The roadway traverses Bush Mountain before coming to Bearfence Mountain Parking at Bearfence Mountain. Skyline Drive continues to the south to Lewis Mountain, where a campground, picnic grounds, <b>lodging,</b> <b>and</b> restrooms are located. The road heads along the border between Rockingham and Greene counties as it runs southerly. The drive continues to the south-southwest and reaches South River, which is home to restrooms and picnic grounds. The roadway heads southwest and comes to an interchange with US 33 at the Swift Run Gap Entrance Station, which is situated in Swift Run Gap east of Elkton and west of Stanardsville.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{received}} German {{citizenship in}} 1930, but was already {{uneasy about the}} political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his savings of £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E
5|$|During the Ming Dynasty (13681644), the Mongols {{enrolled}} in military service were either originally {{prisoners of war}} or they were those who voluntarily submitted to the Ming and settled in China. Others fled their homeland on the northern steppe due to natural disasters such as droughts, seeking refuge in China where Mongol families found <b>lodging</b> <b>and</b> hospitality. Some Mongols became distinguished military officers, were granted noble ranks, and on rarer occasions became ministers in the state bureaucracy. Mongols of noble lineage socialized with Chinese literati of the two capitals (Nanjing and Beijing) while they also had their sons educated in the Chinese classic texts. Nonetheless, Mongols in the Ming Empire were often held in suspicion by Chinese Ming authorities. Mongols of lower social stature were often accused by Chinese officials of being prone to violence, banditry, and becoming beggars and even prostitutes. Ming officials used the excuse of military campaigns to relocate and scatter Mongol troops and families throughout China {{so that they would}} not be concentrated in North China (which neighbored the enemy territory of the Mongol heartland). Wu Tingyun argues that there was a noticeable shift in Ming court policies after the 1449 Tumu Crisis in dealing with the Mongols; he stated that beforehand the Ming court actively encouraged Mongol immigration, and afterwards merely managed those who had already sided with the Ming.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} days tourism was a {{relatively}} new concept, but grew slowly before exploding {{with the advent of}} air travel around 1959, the year Hawaii became a state. Today tourism is driven by the island's exotic tropical locations, and Kīlauea, being one of the few volcanoes in the world in a more or less constant state of moderate eruption, is {{a major part of the}} island's tourist draw. Today, Kīlauea is visited by roughly 2.6 million people annually, most of whom proceed up the volcano from the recently revamped Kilauea Visitor Center near the park entrance. The Thomas A. Jaggar Museum is also a popular tourist stop; located at the edge of Kīlauea caldera, the museum's observation deck offers the best sheltered view on the volcano of the activity at Halemaumau Crater. The Volcano House still provides the nearest <b>lodging,</b> <b>and</b> the nearby Volcano Village the most numerous; visitors associated with the military can find lodging at the Kilauea Military Camp. A number of hiking trails, points of interest, and guided ranger programs exist, and the Chain of Craters Road, Hilina Pali Road, and Crater Rim Drive provide access. In 2008, Lava Viewing Area was opened for tourists in Kalapana on the southeastern side of the National Park, accessible only from State Route 130.|$|E

50|$|Freemasonry in Spain {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1728, in an English lodge. As various papal bulls condemned Freemasonry the Spanish Inquisition {{did their best}} to close <b>lodges</b> <b>and</b> demonise Freemasons, therefore the success of Freemasonry from year to year depended on the sympathy or antipathy of the ruling regime. Nevertheless, <b>lodges</b> <b>and</b> even Grand <b>Lodges</b> were formed, <b>and</b> even thrived during more liberal periods. When Francisco Franco consolidated power in 1939, all Freemasonry was banned.
