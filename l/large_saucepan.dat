6000|$|... 'Oh, PLEASE {{mind what}} you're doing!' cried Alice, {{jumping up and}} down in an agony of terror. 'Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose'; as an unusually <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.|$|E
60|$|The men who officiated as cooks--and who, by agreement, {{had been}} {{released}} from all night duty in consideration of their regularly undertaking that occupation--now brought in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> full of soup; and each man went up with his canteen, and received his portion, returning to his bed upon the straw to eat it.|$|E
60|$|Entering {{one morning}} after the {{delivery}} of a telegram which had cost him a pretty long walk, Phil proceeded to the boys' hall, and took his seat {{at the end of}} the row of boys who were awaiting their turn to be called for mercurial duty. Observing a very small telegraph-boy in a scullery off the hall, engaged in some mysterious operations with a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan,</b> from which volumes of steam proceeded, he went towards him. By that time Phil had become pretty well acquainted with the faces of his comrades, but this boy he had not previously met with. The lad was stooping over a sink, and carefully holding in the contents of the pan with its lid, while he strained off the boiling water.|$|E
60|$|The {{kitchen was}} full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops. On the hob a <b>large</b> black <b>saucepan</b> steamed slowly. Mrs. Morel took a panchion, a great bowl of thick red earth, {{streamed}} a heap of white sugar into the bottom, and then, straining herself to the weight, was pouring in the liquor.|$|R
6000|$|Behind {{the corps}} {{followed}} the cart; loaded with the stores of the corps, {{a considerable amount}} of ammunition, two or three cases of gun cotton for blowing up bridges, several small barrels of powder, a large quantity of fine iron wire, three or four crowbars, bags of coffee and rice, and a keg of brandy, four kettles and as many <b>large</b> <b>saucepans,</b> together with all sorts of odds and ends. By the side of the horse walked Tim Doyle; dressed in the uniform of the corps, but without the equipments, and with a long blouse worn over his tunic. He was, in fact, already enrolled as {{an active member of the}} corps. This was done, in the first place, at his own earnest request; and upon the plea that thus only could he escape the chance of being seized as a spy, whenever he might for a moment be separated from the corps; and also that, unless he had a uniform like the rest, how could he take any vacancy in the ranks, even when it should occur? ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Disability and Rehabilitation [© Informa Healthcare]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] The aim of the pilot study was to provide information about the design and use of saucepan handles to enable clinicians and designers to specify and provide products that are more appropriate for use by people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The objectives were: to evaluate aspects of new handle design for saucepans in terms of their ease of use for people with RA; document hand grip strength and configuration (grip patterns); record relevant anthropometric data to aid the development of new designs and perform an assessment of lifting techniques used in conjunction with perceived optimum handle configuration. Method/Results: Observation and video footage show that subjects continued to use familiar, but damaging, ways of lifting the saucepan even after extensive joint protection training by occupational therapists. Grip strengths recorded using a sphygmomanometer were similar to those found by other studies. The anthropometric measurements taken from the sample group were found to be within available anthropometric surveys of able-bodied people. However, hand length within the sample group with RA was longer than the equivalent in surveys of able-bodied subjects. Conclusions: Subjects preferred the narrower handles with some surface texture to the larger and more rounded tapered handles. <b>Large</b> handled <b>saucepans</b> were found not to be viable due to the constraints of UK cooking hob sizes and existing British Standards relating to saucepan specification...|$|R
50|$|For {{volumetric}} objects (e.g. pillow, blanket, sleeping bag, rug), boiling in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> {{for more}} than 10 minutes represents a reliable method. In this manner, the lethal temperatures propagate with certainty deep inside the object, which {{is not necessarily the}} case of a washing machine cleaning cycle.|$|E
50|$|Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 13 by 9 in baking pan. In a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan,</b> combine 1 {{cup white}} sugar, 2 cups {{firmly packed brown}} sugar, 2 cups water, 1 cup shortening, 4 cups {{seedless}} raisins, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 2 tsp salt. Boil together for 3 minutes, then cool.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variants}} to local recipes for its preparation but basically {{the meat and}} rind are boiled with salt, then minced and mixed with finely ground green cabbage. Fresh blood is added together with breadcrumbs and the mixture is put into intestine casings. The sausages are then boiled for 15 minutes in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> until cooked.|$|E
60|$|At {{the hour}} I now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the {{afternoon}} sun was now agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance, but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro {{in one of their}} most manageable moods. They moved slowly, in unison, below us, over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. Mrs. Grose watched them with positive placidity; then I caught the suppressed intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me a view {{of the back of the}} tapestry. I had made her a receptacle of lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority--my accomplishments and my function--in her patience under my pain. She offered her mind to my disclosures as, had I wished to mix a witch's broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a <b>large</b> clean <b>saucepan.</b> This had become thoroughly her attitude by the time that, in my recital of the events of the night, I reached the point of what Miles had said to me when, after seeing him, at such a monstrous hour, almost on the very spot where he happened now to be, I had gone down to bring him in; choosing then, at the window, with a concentrated need of not alarming the house, rather that method than a signal more resonant. I had left her meanwhile in little doubt of my small hope of representing with success even to her actual sympathy my sense of the real splendor of the little inspiration with which, after I had got him into the house, the boy met my final articulate challenge. As soon as I appeared in the moonlight on the terrace, he had come to me as straight as possible; on which I had taken his hand without a word and led him, through the dark spaces, up the staircase where Quint had so hungrily hovered for him, along the lobby where I had listened and trembled, and so to his forsaken room.|$|R
50|$|The dish {{is a basic}} white stew {{made with}} a few simple {{ingredients}}: skirts, kidneys, onions, thyme, salt, white pepper, water, and potatoes. All the ingredients are placed in a <b>large</b> <b>saucepan</b> of boiling water and slowly simmered for about two hours. At the end of cooking, if necessary, a little cornflour (cornstarch) mixed as a slurry with a little water can be stirred in as thickening.|$|E
5000|$|After {{soaking the}} ribs are steamed {{over a little}} water in a <b>large</b> <b>{{saucepan}}.</b> A layer of twigs from the birch tree may {{be placed in the}} bottom of the saucepan instead of a metal steamer. The name pinnekjøtt (literally: stick meat) is disputed. It may refer to the birch twigs of the cooking process, but the word 'pinne' is in dialectal Norwegian also used in reference to single ribs - akin to [...] "rib sticks", a dialectal expression in English.|$|E
