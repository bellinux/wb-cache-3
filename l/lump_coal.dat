50|$|A {{large coal}} seam was first found in Moweaqua on October 3, 1889, {{after two months}} of {{drilling}} by the Samuel Warner and Son firm {{as reported in the}} Moweaqua Call-Mail, the local newspaper. Two years later in November the first mining shaft site was commissioned {{a few blocks from the}} railroad depot, but under a new drilling company called the Cochran Coal and Mining Company under James G. Cochran. Ground was broken for mine construction on December 21, 1891, on land bought from Mrs. M.K. Duncan and the Moweaqua Coal and Manufacturing Company was officially formed. The Moweaqua Call-Mail urged people living in the town to hold out for the coal they hoped to find because then they could buy the coal locally and it would be much cheaper for farmers and manufacturers. On August 30, 1892, three six-foot veins of coal were found in the mine 570 feet below the Earth’s surface and were sold in the market a few days later. The success of the mine increased over the coming months and by February 9, 1893, 25-30 tons of coal was being raised per day and sold at $1.25 for nut coal and $1.50 for <b>lump</b> <b>coal.</b> The mine also introduced plans to have steel fiber cables installed so they could lift eleven tons of coal at once. On August 8, 1894, the first mule was taken into the mine which allowed the mine to hire more workers to watch over the animals in the mine. By 1897, over 100 miners were working in the mine as cage men, motor men, mule drivers, shot firers, blacksmiths and miners. With the increasing number of workers in the mine, Catholic families began to express interest to build a church in Moweaqua and four lots were purchased from a man named Mr. Prescott to start a church. Many single men as well as families were drawn to Moweaqua over the years leading up to the 1932 Disaster because of the prosperous mine and the growing sense of community in the town, but the migrant workers ended up being disconnected from the community and everyone kept to themselves.|$|E

40|$|There {{is limited}} {{literature}} on the classification and characterization of chars generated from <b>lump</b> <b>coals</b> during synthesis gas production, especially from a South African perspective. Two inertinite-rich medium rank C Highveld <b>lump</b> <b>coals</b> (Coals A and B) were utilized to study their burning behaviour in a packed-bed reactor combustion unit. Seven sample increments were dissected per coal obtained from predefined zones within the reactor. Proximate analysis revealed that Coal A released 10 % more of its volatile matter yield within the reactor zones when compared to Coal B. Petrographic analysis showed that Coal B had a higher content of reactive macerals when compared to Coal A. The reactive maceral content of Coal A was dominated by vitrinite and liptinite whereas for Coal B, reactive macerals were comprised of 49 % vitrinite and liptinite and the other 51 % is reactive semifusinite and reactive inertodetrinite. This difference leads to different reactivity behaviour when these coal samples were subjected to high temperatures. Coal B produced {{a greater proportion of}} inert chars, ran at higher temperatures in the hotter region of the reactor because of its aromatic richness thus leads to lower CO 2 reactivity. This paper highlights the need for a detailed characterization of coals to fully determine their conversion performance; detailed coal petrography is one such tool that its value is frequently underplayed.

Based on the coal occurrence in Yongxia Mining Area and mining conditions of a coalface in Xinqiao Coal Mine, {{we proposed a}} systematic study on the technical support {{for the production of}} high-quality anthracite. Six key steps were explored, including coal falling at the coalface, transport, underground bunker storage, main shaft hoisting, coal preparation on the ground, and railway wagon loading. The study resulted in optimized running parameters for the shearers, and the rotating patterns of the shearer drums was altered (one-way cutting was employed). Mining height and roof supporting intensity were reduced. Besides, loose presplitting millisecond blasting and mechanized mining were applied to upgrade the coal quantity and the <b>lump</b> <b>coal</b> production rate. Additionally, the coalface end transloading, coalface crush, transport systems, underground storage, and main shaft skip unloading processes were improved, and fragmentation-prevention techniques were used in the washing and railway wagon loading processes. As a result, the <b>lump</b> <b>coal</b> production rate was maintained at a high level and fragmentation was significantly reduced. Because of using the parameters and techniques determined in this research, high-quality coal production and increased profits were achieved.
