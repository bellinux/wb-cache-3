30|$|Similar {{comments}} {{can be made}} {{in relation}} to Geneva Call’s Deeds of Commitment. There are three types of commitment, dealing with anti-personnel mines, the protection of children from the effects of armed conflict and the prohibition of sexual violence and gender discrimination (see Geneva Call 2014 a, 2014 b). The deed relating to the protection of children has been a landmark development within the global campaign against child soldiers. The deed is the first international instrument that NSAGs could voluntarily and unilaterally sign and be judged upon their implementation thereof. Nevertheless, they may only have real value as a positive gesture. The deeds have been instrumental in raising awareness and encouraging NSAGs to consider the human rights impacts of their actions more concretely. In particular, the deed for the prohibition of sexual violence and gender discrimination provides a substantial <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> to which the groups agree to adhere to. These include certain provisions that would also fall under international human rights law, such as a prohibition of discrimination against women and equal access to healthcare (Geneva Call 2013 a, para 5). Additionally, the deed does acknowledge that it is “one step or part of a broader commitment” to human rights and humanitarian law (Geneva Call 2013 a, para 9). Nonetheless, there is no direct reference to human rights obligations of NSAGs.|$|E
40|$|Canada {{has made}} {{numerous}} international and national commitments to sustain marine biodiversity. International commitments include {{the implementation of}} ecosystem-based management, the establishment a network of marine protected areas, and the restoration of commercially exploited fish stocks. However, the international commitments tend to be quite general in nature with the precise governance implications of key principles, such as precaution and the ecosystem approach, being open to interpretation, thus leaving considerable room for discretion in implementation. Consequently, a plethora of soft law documents has emerged to provide more specific guidance to decision-makers and progressively develop international law and policy. Nationally, Canada has embraced a long <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> that are supportive of sustaining marine biodiversity through legislation and numerous policy-related documents. Nonetheless, Canada has left many of these commitments unfulfilled or inadequately fulfilled, such as (i) the development of integrated management plans for coastal and marine waters, (ii) {{the implementation of the}} precautionary approach for Canada's fisheries, and (iii) the establishment of recovery strategies and identification of critical habitat for species at risk. Although the goal of effective protection of marine biodiversity in Canada appears to be guided by international and national commitments, there remains a clear need to fully implement, operationalize, and strengthen these commitments as articulated in the Oceans Act, fisheries management-related policies, the Species at Risk Act, and others. © 2012 Published by NRC Research Press...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{construct}} a 3 -move public coin special honest verifier zero-knowledge proof, a so-called Sigma-protocol, for a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitments</b> having {{at least one}} commit-ment that opens to 0. It is not required for the prover to know openings of the other commitments. The proof system is efficient, in particular in terms of communication requiring only the transmission of a logarithmic number of commitments. We use our proof system to instantiate both ring signatures and zerocoin, a novel mech-anism for bitcoin privacy. We use our Sigma-protocol as a (linkable) ad-hoc group identi-fication scheme where the users have public keys that are commitments and demonstrate knowledge of an opening {{for one of the}} commitments to unlinkably identify themselves (once) as belonging to the group. Applying the Fiat-Shamir transform on the group identification scheme gives rise to ring signatures, applying it to the linkable group iden-tification scheme gives rise to zerocoin. Our ring signatures are very small compared to other ring signature schemes and we only assume the users ’ secret keys to be the discrete logarithms of single group elements so the setup is quite realistic. Similarly, compared with the original zerocoin protocol we rely on a weak cryptographic assumption and do not require a trusted setup. A third application of our Sigma protocol is an efficient proof of membership of a secret committed value u belonging to a public list L = {λ 1, [...] ., λN}...|$|E

The acceptance tests demonstrate that the cask has been fabricated in accordance with the design criteria and that the initial operation of the cask complies with regulatory requirements. The maintenance program describes actions that the licensee needs to implement during the storage period to ensure that the cask continues to perform its intended functions. As defined in Section V, "Review Procedures, " a comprehensive evaluation may encompass the following acceptance tests and maintenance programs: 1. acceptance tests a. visual and nondestructive examination inspections b. structural/pressure tests c. leak tests d. shielding tests e. neutron absorber tests f. thermal tests g. cask identification 2. maintenance program a. inspection b. tests c. repair, replacement, and maintenance III.
