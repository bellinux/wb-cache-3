5|$|The storm slowly {{strengthened}} {{over the}} warm {{waters of the}} eastern Atlantic thereafter as it tracked west-northwest. Some dry air from the Saharan Air Layer continued to slow development on September 14 as Helene remained a low-end tropical storm. However, a bout of intensification took place on September 15 as shear diminished. The storm became much better organized with well-defined banding, and <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> that evening at just under hurricane intensity. On the morning of September 16, the storm began to develop a ragged eye, and the storm strengthened to hurricane status. The intensity <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> for a while as a marginal Category 1 hurricane, as the intensification was slowed {{by the presence of}} moderate wind shear despite the absence of significant dry air. Late that evening, the storm began to slowly intensify once again.|$|E
5|$|Yaw (oscillations), begun at {{the time}} of missile detonation, {{continue}} decreasingly {{until the end of the}} minute 44 second section of the tape. The Boeing did not break up, explode or plummet immediately after the attack; it continued its gradual descent for four minutes, then <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> at 16,424feet (5,006 m) (18:30–18:31UTC), rather than continue descending to 10,000 (3,000 m) as previously reported to Tokyo Area Control Center, continuing at this altitude for almost five more minutes (18:35UTC).|$|E
5|$|By {{early on}} 14 April, the eye became better defined after an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. The intensity fluctuated after outflow decreased to the north, although increasingly warm waters favored further intensification. Early on 15 April, the MFR upgraded Fantala to an intense tropical cyclone, {{as the storm}} rapidly deepened. The outflow was enhanced by a large upper-level low well to the southeast, and shear had decreased to a minimum. After reaching an initial peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) at 12:00UTC that day, Fantala's intensity <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> for the following 48 hours, with its 10-minute sustained winds fluctuating between 195km/h (120mph) and 215km/h (130mph).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ignacio {{threatened}} Hawaii during July 1985. A {{tropical depression}} formed on July 21 far from land. It became Tropical Storm Ignacio later that day. Ignacio then rapidly intensified and peaked with 130mph (215km/h) winds on July 24. Ignacio weakened quickly, though it briefly <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> in intensity as a Category 2 hurricane. Ignacio was downgraded into {{a tropical storm}} on July 26 while passing south of Hawaii. Continuing to weaken, Ignacio dissipated on July 27. A hurricane watch was briefly issued for the Hawaiian Islands even though the watch was dropped when Ignacio weakened. However, Ignacio still brought high waves and light rainfall to the islands. A few roads were closed, but otherwise, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Allison {{remained}} somewhat disorganized, as no eye was visible, {{even when}} Reconnaissance flights confirmed {{that it was}} at hurricane intensity. The storm maintained itself as a minimal hurricane throughout the day on June 4 before it began {{to turn to the}} northeast, in response to southwesterly shear. Late that evening, the storm began to weaken, dropping back to tropical storm intensity as it approached the Florida Big Bend area. The intensity <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> on June 5 until it made landfall that morning. Allison made its first landfall at about 10:00 am EDT (1400 UTC) near Alligator Point, Florida as a high-end tropical storm with 70mph (110km/h) winds. It briefly re-emerged over Apalachee Bay and made another landfall near St. Marks, Florida about one hour later with 65mph (100km/h) winds. Operationally, Allison was considered a hurricane until it made landfall, and was considered the earliest hurricane landfall in the United States for some time.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dot of August 1959 was at {{its time}} the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Hawaiian history. Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaii on August1. The storm was potentially a continuation of a previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July24-27, but was never confirmed {{due to a lack}} of ship reports. Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August3, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150mph (240km/h). Intensity <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August5, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August8.|$|E
5|$|Karl {{originated}} {{in a strong}} tropical wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 13. The wave gradually became better organized, and it was declared Tropical Depression Twelve about 670miles (1,080km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on the morning of September 16, as it headed westward in the open tropical Atlantic following the periphery of the subtropical ridge. That afternoon, the depression continued to rapidly organize and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. Due to healthy outflow around an upper-level anticyclone over Karl and a favorable environment with the warmest sea surface temperatures of the year, rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17, with the storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to Hurricane Karl. With water around 28°C (83°F) and low wind shear, the cyclone continued to rapidly intensify on the morning of September 18. The intensity <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> somewhat that afternoon as a strong Category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph (175km/h).|$|E
5|$|Needing a draw at minimum, United {{were in a}} keen {{position}} to win their second-consecutive Challenge Cup. The club closed out their cup run with their third and final match against last-place Toronto FC; who had fallen to both Chicago and Charleston earlier in the week. The match started out heavily in favor of United, who scored off a Charlie Davies goal in the ninth minute. The 1–0 lead over the Reds was short-lived, as TFC quickly <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> of a penalty kick scored by TFC captain, Dwayne De Rosario, leveling the match at one-all. Immediately minutes later, the Reds struck again, taking a 2–1 lead. The lead was Toronto's first in the entire tournament and, ironically, United's first time trailing in a match in the entire tournament.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{development}} was different in southern Indiana. The state's commerce along the Ohio River was reduced during the war, {{especially after the}} closure of the Mississippi River to commercial trade with the South and increased competition from the state's expanding railroad network. Some of Indiana's river towns, such as Evansville, recovered by providing transport to Union troops across the Ohio River, but others did not. Before the war, New Albany was the largest city in the state, primarily due to its commerce with the South, but its trade dwindled during the war. After the war much of Indiana viewed New Albany as too friendly to the South. New Albany's formerly robust steamboat-building industry ended in 1870; the last steamboat built in New Albany was named the Robert E. Lee. New Albany never regained its pre-war stature; its population <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> at 40,000, and only the antebellum, early-Victorian Mansion Row district remains from its boom period.|$|E
5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a time when many young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Linfa, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Chedeng, brought deadly {{flooding}} to areas of the Philippines and Japan in May and June2003. The fifth named storm within the northwestern Pacific that year, Linfa developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May25. The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity {{a few hours after}} cyclogenesis. However, intensification <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> as Linfa executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May27. Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and decoupled before reforming in the Philippine Sea. Afterwards Linfa began reintensifying and reached its peak intensity on May29 with maximum sustained winds of 100km/h (65mph) and a barometric pressure of 980mbar (hPa; 28.94inHg). Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May30; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of Okhotsk on June4.|$|E
5|$|Throughout August22, Danny's {{structure}} deteriorated {{with its}} surface and mid-level circulations becoming tilted with height {{due to the}} shear. The surface low soon became exposed with convection displaced to the northeast, and Danny weakened to a tropical storm by 00:00UTC on August23. The storm briefly <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> in intensity somewhat later that day, with its circulation back under convection; intense lightning was observed near the cyclone's center. Late on August23, Danny's structure began degrading once more with its circulation becoming significantly displaced from the remaining ragged convection. Early on August24, Hurricane Hunters struggled to find a circulation center as Danny neared the Lesser Antilles, and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC as it passed between Guadeloupe and Dominica. Hours later it degenerated into a tropical wave, marking its dissipation as a tropical cyclone. The remnants of Danny continued to the west-northwest for another day and were last noted over Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Clara, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Rubing, left {{flooding}} in the northern Philippines and southern China during September1981. An area of disturbed weather was first detected on September11 near Ponape. After moving westward, the system gradually became better organized and thunderstorm activity increased. On September16, the system attained tropical storm status. Two days later, Clara attained typhoon intensity and subsequently began to deepen at a faster rate. On September19, Clara reached maximum intensity, before making landfall along {{the northern tip of}} Luzon. Clara steadily weakened after interacting with land, but by late on September20, Clara <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> in intensity over the South China Sea. The next day, Clara moved ashore to the east-northeast of Hong Kong while still at typhoon intensity before rapidly dissipating over land.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Dinah, {{known as}} Typhoon Luding in the Philippines, {{was the fourth}} typhoon to form during August1987. An area of low {{pressure}} developed near Guam on August19, and two days later, the low reached tropical storm intensity as it moved generally west. Intensification was initially gradual, with Dinah becoming a typhoon early on August24 before it subsequently intensified at a faster pace. Dinah reached its highest strength on August 26 before turning northward on August28 and into a less favorable conditions aloft, which prompted weakening. Dinah entered the Sea of Japan after passing near Okinawa on August29, where Dinah <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> in intensity. The system then began to recurve towards southwestern Japan, and after tracking through the area, Dinah transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on August31, although the remnants could be traced for four more days as it approached the International Date Line.|$|E
5|$|Late on August 29, the cyclone <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> in {{intensity}} as a mid-level Category4 hurricane {{due to an}} eyewall replacement cycle, where one eye gets replaced by another. The cycle continued for another 24 hours, only to start another burst of intensification. By the evening of August 31, Hurricane hunters measured winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a pressure of 931 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg) while the powerful cyclone began {{to turn to the}} north due to nearby Tropical Storm Kevin and a low pressure area west of Baja California. Wind shear increased as the hurricane moved over progressively cooler water. Despite weakening slightly, Jimena was anticipated by meteorologists to still remain a major hurricane as the storm moved ashore. This did not occur and Jimena steadily weakened. On September 1, Hurricane hunters found Jimena weaker, reporting winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). About 12 hours after the flight, the winds of Jimena dropped below major hurricane intensity despite an increase of convection.|$|E
5|$|On September3, Nabi began {{weakening}} as {{it turned}} more to the north, {{the result of an}} approaching trough weakening the ridge. Later that day, the winds <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> at 155km/h (100mph), according to the JMA. On September5, Nabi passed near Kitadaitōjima and Yakushima, part of the Daitō and Ōsumi island groups offshore southern Japan. Around that time, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215km/h (130mph). After turning due north, Nabi made landfall near Isahaya, Nagasaki around 05:00UTC on September6, after passing through the Amakusa of Kumamoto. Shortly thereafter, the storm entered the Sea of Japan. The typhoon turned to the northeast into the mid-latitude flow, influenced by a low over the Kamchatka Peninsula. At 18:00UTC on September6, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi, declaring it extratropical, although the JMA continued tracking the storm. On the next day, Nabi moved across northern Hokkaido into the Sea of Okhotsk. The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September8, which continued eastward until dissipating on September10 south of the Aleutian Islands. The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern Alaska on September12.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression quickly intensified into early on September 25 {{as the system}} continued to organize, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karen that morning. The strengthening trend was temporarily halted, and Karen remained a weak tropical storm with relatively shallow convection. Late that evening, new bursts of deep convection developed with the storm. Early on September 26, Karen intensified significantly and an inner core began to develop. That morning, a ragged eye developed and the system strengthened into a hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds. The intensification trend was short-lived, and the storm <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> that afternoon as upper-level wind shear increased substantially due {{to the presence of}} a nearby tropical upper tropospheric trough. The storm became less organized that evening. Hurricane Karen weakened to a tropical storm as flight data from NOAA Hurricane Hunters confirmed surface winds of 72mph (115km/h) and a very large wind field late that evening. Operationally, Karen was classified as a strong tropical storm, but was reclassified as a Category1 hurricane based on data from the reconnaissance flight late on September 26and the less organized structure of the storm at that time.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, the {{intensification}} {{became more}} rapid and Helene {{quickly became a}} Category2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection. Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic, which {{was in response to}} a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north. The northward turn shifted the course away from any land areas. The intensification continued through the afternoon, and that evening, Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962mbar. As shear remained low and the oceans remained warm, Helene intensified slightly more, peaking as a solid Category3 hurricane with 120mph (195km/h) winds early on September 18. At that time, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean. Operationally, Helene was estimated to have had 125mph (205km/h) winds, but the post-storm analysis downgraded it slightly. As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th, a narrow ridge built in, forcing Helene westward. The eyewall collapsed somewhat, and Helene weakened slightly to a Category2 hurricane, where it <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> for about 48hours until September 20 due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern. On the 20th, Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened slightly due to a slight increase in wind shear. That afternoon, it was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane, which Helene remained until becoming extratropical.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a hurricane on September13, Odile began to accelerate towards the north-northwest {{in the direction of}} the Baja California Peninsula under the influence of both a strengthening mid-level ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and an upper-level low to the northwest. Following the formation of an eye, Odile began a phase of rapid intensification. Odile attained Category 2 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale at 00:00UTC on September14. Six hours later, the cyclone had reached Category4 intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), a pressure typical for a Category 5 hurricane. At the time, this pressure reading was tied for the sixth-lowest on record for an east Pacific hurricane. Even though additional deepening was forecast, strengthening <b>leveled</b> <b>off</b> thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle, common in intense hurricanes, began to run its course. Despite the leveling off in intensity, a United States Air Force aircraft reconnaissance flight observed a barometric pressure of 922mbar (hPa; 27.23inHg); this measurement was the lowest pressure reading officially measured throughout Odile's existence. Nonetheless, the eroding of the hurricane's inner core due to the eyewall replacement cycle resulted in gradual weakening after peak intensity. Still maintaining its north-northwesterly course with little deviation, Odile made landfall near Cabo San Lucas at 04:45UTC on September15 with winds of 125mph (205km/h) and a central pressure of 941 mbar (hPa; 27.79 inHg). The wind estimates tie Odile with Hurricane Olivia in 1967 as the strongest tropical cyclone to move ashore Baja California Sur in the satellite era.|$|E
