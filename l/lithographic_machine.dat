40|$|Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) {{lithography}} is a {{new technology}} for production of integrated circuits. In EUV <b>lithographic</b> <b>machines,</b> optical elements are heated by absorption of exposure energy. Heating induces thermoelastic deformations of optical elements and consequently, it creates wavefront aberrations. These Thermally Induced Wavefront Aberrations (TIWA) can significantly degrade the resolution of EUV <b>lithographic</b> <b>machines.</b> One {{of the ways to}} correct TIWA and consequently, to improve the resolution of EUV <b>lithographic</b> <b>machines,</b> is to use the Adaptive Optics (AO) technique and predictive control algorithms. However, the predictive control of TIWA is a challenging problem, mainly because the dynamical behavior of TIWA is described by thermoelastic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). By discretizing the thermoelastic equations using the finite difference or finite element methods, large-scale state-space models can be obtained. A striking feature of these state-space models is that they have sparse (multi) banded matrices. Consequently, these state-space models can be interpreted as large-scale networks of local subsystems. All this implies that the problem of correcting TIWA can be placed in a much more general context of identifying, estimating and controlling large-scale interconnected (distributed) systems. However, currently used estimation and control algorithms are not computationally feasible for large-scale systems. For this reason, this thesis focuses on the development of computationally efficient identification, estimation and control algorithms for large-scale interconnected systems. In this thesis, we prove that the inverses of (finite-time) Gramians of large-scale interconnected systems, obtained by discretizing PDEs, belong to a class of off-diagonally decaying matrices. Consequently, these inverses can be approximated by sparse (multi) banded matrices with O(N) complexity, where N is the number of local subsystems. To compute the approximate inverses, the Chebyshev approximation method and the Newton iteration are used. On the basis of these theoretical results, we develop novel estimation and identification algorithms for large-scale interconnected systems. The computational and memory complexity of these methods scale with O(N). This is the main advantage over the traditional estimation and identification methods, which complexity is O(N^ 3). Furthermore, in this thesis we develop and experimentally verify AO control algorithms for predictive correction of TIWA. The experimental results give a good first indication for a possible implementation of the developed predictive control algorithms in EUV <b>lithographic</b> <b>machines.</b> Finally, we develop and experimentally test an iterative learning control algorithm for high performance correction of wavefront aberrations.

The emphasis is on those devices that offer more than just an empty channel for, e. g., electrophoretic separation. Topographic structures have been incorporated in the channels during their microfabrication, offering a variety of possibilities for the separation of (mainly) DNA molecules based on different principles. Supports for a stationary phase for chromatographic separations have been introduced in the channels in different ways: by packing of the channels with stationary phase particles, by polymerization of monolithic structures, or by <b>lithographic</b> <b>machining</b> of pillars in the channels.

Manually created integration and test plans are often not optimal regarding time-to-market. Furthermore, creating and maintaining these plans costs a lot of effort. In this paper, we introduce a method that allows to automatically create optimal integration and test plans. This method can be used by intelligent enterprises to shorten the time-to-market of a system and to reduce the effort needed to create and maintain integration and test plans.

The problem of which tests must be executed in what sequence to ensure in the shortest possible test time that the system works, which is the test-sequencing problem, was already solved by Pattipati et al. for the diagnosis of systems during operation. Test-sequencing problems during the development and manufacturing phases of systems, however, require a different approach than the test-sequencing problems during operation. In this paper, the test problem description and algorithms developed by Pattipati et al. are extended to solve test-sequencing problems for the development and manufacturing of manufacturing systems.

40|$|Testing complex {{manufacturing}} systems, like ASML lithographic machines, {{can take}} up to 45 % of the total development time. The decision of when to stop testing is often difficult to make because less testing may leave critical faults in the system, while more testing increases time-to-market. In this paper, we solve the problem of deciding when to stop testing by introducing a test-sequencing method that incorporates several stopping criteria. These stopping criteria consist of objectives and constraints on the test cost and the remaining risk cost. For a given problem, a suitable stopping criterion can be chosen. For example, with the risk-based stopping criterion, testing stops when the test time or cost exceeds the risk cost. Furthermore, we show that it also is possible to model reliability problems with this test-sequencing method. The method is demonstrated on ASML systems with two case studies. The first case study was conducted in the test phase during the development of the software that is used to control an ASML <b>lithographic</b> <b>machine.</b> The second case study was conducted on the reliability testing of a <b>lithographic</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Testing complex systems, {{such as the}} ASML TWINSCAN <b>lithographic</b> <b>machine,</b> is {{expensive}} and time consuming. In a previous work, a test sequencing method to calculate time-optimal test sequences has been developed. Because complex systems are composed of several subsystems, which are again composed of several modules, there exists a need to hierarchically model test sequencing problems. Such a hierarchical test sequencing problem consists of a high-level model that describes a test sequencing problem at the system level, and one or more low-level models that describe the test sequencing problems at the subsystem or module level. The tests at the system level correspond to the solutions of low-level problems. This paper describes a hierarchical test sequencing model and proposes two algorithms to compute an optimal test sequence. The benefits of hierarchically modeling a problem are less computational effort and less modeling effort, because not all relations are needed. This is illustrated by a small example. The industrial relevance of this method is illustrated on a case study related to a manufacturing testing phase of a <b>lithographic</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Distributed feedback, DFB, lasers are a major source for long haul optical fibre based telecommunication systems. They rely on ultrahigh precision gratings to reduce mode competition within the laser cavity, thereby making single frequency operation possible. Techniques applied to DFB grating manufacture tend to be either holographic, or a direct serial write process using slow and expensive electron beam <b>lithographic</b> <b>machines.</b> An entirely new approach is proposed which compliments {{the accuracy of the}} electron beam systems with the high throughput and relatively low cost of a conventional contact mask regime. The new process relies on a group of materials which are able to retain an embossed relief upon curing with ultraviolet radiation. The main manufacturing stages of this new technique are presented including details of the embossing tool fabrication using reactive ion etching, and characterisation of material properties. It is proposed that the technique, whilst intended for DFB manufacture, could find applications in many other areas, for instance as a route to low cost replication of photomasks. In addition a new grating assessment technique, based on normal reflectance measurements, has been developed. The technique has been used to investigate hitherto unmeasured effects in electron beam lithography on a variety of substrate materials before and after semiconductor overgrowth. Details of a theoretical exercise which agrees closely with experimental results are included. The technique is non-destructive and should be of interest to all areas of microlithography and holographic imaging where {{it is important to have}} control over a wide range of process stages or where the feature size rules out the use of conventional optical microscopes...|$|R

Many types of medical devices rely on microsystem architecture to improve {{the health and well-being of}} millions of people. These systems are found in devices which are used for short and long periods of time, in diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and in devices which have limited contact with the patient and devices that are permanently implantable. Many types of implantable devices rely on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) to achieve their functionality. Integrated circuit technology has extended beyond the fabrication of electronic elements to millimeter-scale mechanical structures with subelements in the nanometer to micrometer range. These MEMS devices often possess a high level of integration and provide numerous functions in one monolithic package. In addition, these devices allow the creation of sensors and actuators with enhanced stability and low power consumption. However the MEMS device on its own is not able to function in the body without the requisite power source, physiologic interface, and packaging that allow it to perform its intended function over the intended lifetime.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} novel {{approaches for}} fabrication of nanostructured functional surfaces: a fast molding and curing for reproduction of artificial leaves, facile replication for ceramic nanostructures, one-step self-assembly for sequenced patterns and functional templates of block copolymer. In a first approach, {{a simple and}} fast two-step molding process has been demonstrated the successful replication of hierarchical structures on a native leaf surface. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) negative structures were generated through a fast UV curing to avoid shrinkage of the cells due to loss of water. Subsequently, hierarchical artificial leaf surface structures were produced with high fidelity by UV- and thermal-curing of a ceramic precursor polymer, polyvinylsilazane (PVSZ, SiCN ceramic precursor), mold. Through a molding and curing method involving no <b>lithographic</b> or mechanical <b>machining</b> process, regularly wrinkled ceramic nanostructures could also be achieved. Wrinkled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps, generated in a lithography-free way, were used as masters for structure replication onto PVSZ films. The replicated PVSZ wrinkles were fabricated via a molding followed by photopolymerization using a wrinkled PDMS master. The PVSZ replica was converted to a silicon carbonitride (SiCN) ceramic material by pyrolysis at 800 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Corrugated SiCN ceramic substrates fabricated by a facile replication process using nonlithographic PDMS masters were employed for the directed assembly of block copolymer microdomains. During thermal annealing of a polystyrene-b-polybutadiene (PS-b-PB) diblock copolymer, the material transport was guided by a wrinkled substrate to form regular modulations in the film thickness. As {{a consequence of the}} thickness-dependent morphological behavior of cylinder forming block copolymer, the material was guided into sequenced patterns of alternating cylinder (C), perforated lamella (PL), and lamella (L) phases which follow the topography of the substrate. Morphological behavior in thin films of a cylinder-forming PS-b-PB diblock copolymer affected by film preparations and annealing conditions onto corrugated substrates has been studied.
