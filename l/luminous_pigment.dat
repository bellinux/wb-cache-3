The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of a mosquito repelling lamp, E Da under indoor conditions. E Da lamp is a lamp coated with yellow <b>luminous</b> <b>pigment</b> on the inner part of the glass bulb of the lamp which is used to screen out the UV radiation, and when it is turned on, the yellow illuminating wavelength will drive the mosquitoes away. The tests were conducted inside 2 cabins measuring 8 'X 8 'X 20 '. The mosquito population was estimated by using the Bare Leg Catch (BLC) techniques. For treated test, E Da lamp was placed indoor 2 - 3 meters away from a human bait. Another cabin without the lamp was used as untreated control. BLC was conducted in both sites simultaneously. The mosquitoes collected in this study were solely those of Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aibopictus. There was an 91. 34 reduction of Cx. quinquefasciatus population in the treated test compared with the untreated cabin during the 4 hours catches (p < 0. 05). E Da mosquito repelling lamp used in this study exerted repellency effect against the mosquitoes especially Cx. quinquefasciatus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Variations in the {{photoluminescence}} (PL) spectra from porous {{silica gel}} containing the <b>luminous</b> organic <b>pigments</b> were evaluated {{before and after}} the exposure in the vapors of CHCl 3. Peak intensity of PL from rhodamine and fluorescein contained silica gel vary with the concentration of pigment. Peak intensity of PL also varies after exposure in the organic vapors of CHCl 3. Temperature dependences of PL intensity from rhodamine and fluorescein contained silica gel are also evaluated for sensor applications. The organic <b>luminous</b> <b>pigments</b> contained silica gel is suggested to be useful fluorescent sensor materials...|$|R
30|$|An {{in-depth}} investigation of Maki’s pigment choices using non-invasive light-based technologies like Raman microspectroscopy facilitated by in situ XRF analysis has identified an extensive palette of <b>luminous</b> <b>pigments.</b> This unprecedented study of his material choices suggests {{the use of}} commercial paints that while similar in color, varied in composition over the years. Of particular note in these colorants are the occurrences of aniline black and molybdate orange, which have not been positively identified previously in fine art prints.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} and most common support—material {{to which the}} paint is applied—for watercolor paintings is paper. Other supports include papyrus, bark papers, plastics, vellum, leather, fabric, wood and canvas. Watercolor paper is often made entirely or partially with cotton, which gives a good texture and minimizes distortion when wet. Watercolors are usually translucent, and appear <b>luminous</b> because the <b>pigments</b> are laid down in a pure form with few fillers obscuring the pigment colors. Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding Chinese white.|$|R
