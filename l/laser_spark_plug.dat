25|$|Traditional <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> {{need to be}} {{indented}} {{into the}} walls of the combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass over the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> and removing the narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in the glow plug used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow Plugs in the JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. The laser plug can fire its spark through the narrow slit. <b>Laser</b> <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Cycle-resolved {{measurements}} of the fuel concentration near a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> in both a commercial spark-ignition piston engine and a commercial rotary engine were performed. An in situ laser infrared (IR) absorption method was developed using a <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor and a 3. 392 -μm He–Ne laser as the light source. This wavelength coincided with the absorption line of hydrocarbons. The newly developed IR <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> sensor had a higher signal-to-noise ratio than its previous version due to the optimization of its quartz lens and two optical fibers. The new sensor provided quantitative cycle-resolved fuel concentration measurements around the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> with a high temporal resolution. At lean preset air/fuel (A/F) ratios, fuel was mixed with the surrounding air gradually near the <b>spark</b> <b>plug.</b> Strong mixture inhomogeneities were measured during the compression stroke; the magnitude of these inhomogeneities decreased throughout the compression stroke.

5000|$|Bartlett was a {{geologist}} who {{was interested in}} <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> and contributed greatly to the motor vehicle world, being the first to invent insulating materials for <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> using alumina ceramics. When <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> insulators were first invented, {{they were made of}} porcelain and molded on a potter's wheel, and thus, were prone to break easily. She has been credited to have discovered that high alumina metls, containing approximately 0.35 percent lithium oxide precipitated zeta alumina, and over the course of her career, gained 7 patents in connection with her work. Bartlett left her position at General Motors Corporation to work on The Manhattan Project, a research project for nuclear weapons at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but later returned. Dr. Bartlett's essential work on <b>spark</b> <b>plugs</b> improved the overall capabilities of motor vehicles. Alumina insulator material allows plugs to handle high heat and voltage within the <b>spark</b> <b>plug,</b> enabling vehicles to operate in a more clean and, in turn, more efficient manner. By encasing the <b>spark</b> <b>plugs,</b> Dr. Bartlett had made possible for them to become quite durable.

The 2-piece OE <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> design is intrinsically flawed, thus making it susceptible to this problem. Ford acknowledges this issue in TSB 08-7-6 as well as earlier TSBs. Ford's TSB does not state that this issue is caused by owner neglect. The TSB provides a special procedure for <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> removal on these engines. For situations in which the <b>spark</b> <b>plug</b> has partially broken off in the cylinder head, Ford distributes multiple special tools for removing the seized portion of the plug.
