2500|$|In an {{accounting}} sense, assets are recorded on the left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts, {{because they are}} typically shown on the left-hand side of the accounting equation (A=L+SE/OE).

This means if [...] "assets are increased with left-hand entries, the accounting equation is balanced only if increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are recorded on the opposite or right-hand side. Conversely, decreases in assets are recorded on the right-hand side of asset accounts, and decreases in <b>liabilities</b> <b>and</b> <b>equity</b> are recorded on the left-hand side".

However, in case of Malaysia which is more based on IFRS which is treated this account as a liability, “alpha is close to one (1) ”.
