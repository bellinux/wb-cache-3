40|$|Assessing the {{potential}} impact of climate changes on a hydrologic time serie is based on identifying the trend of the annual mean discharges. Time series of annual mean <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges</b> from all the hydrometric posts situated in the� pper basin of Bârlad river are studied: Băceşti and Negreşti on Bârlad (1950 – 2007), Ţibana and Tungujei on Şacovăţ (1987 – 2007), Frenciugi and Căzăneşti on Stavnic (1950 – 2007). Parametric (linear, second degree polynomial and exponential equations) and non-parametric methods (Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope) are applied in order to detect a trend in data. The parametric testing shows that the polynomial model is the most apropiate, which means that during the interannual evolution of discharges a natural fluctuation seems to be more probable that an effect of the climate warming. The results of the non-parametric tests do not show a trend in data. We can conclude that in the studied area there is no clear impact of the climate change upon the annual mean <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges...</b>|$|R

40|$|The INEEL {{contractors}} and their associated facilities {{are required to}} identify all <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>discharges</b> that may impact the environment at the INEEL. This liquid effluent information is then placed in the Liquid Effluent Inventory (LEI) database, which is maintained by the INEEL prime contractor. The purpose of the LEI is to identify and maintain a current listing of all <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>discharge</b> points and to identify which discharges are subject to federal, state, or local permitting or reporting requirements and DOE order requirements. Initial characterization, which represents most of the INEEL liquid effluents, has been performed, and additional characterization may be required {{in the future to}} meet regulations. LEI information is made available to persons responsible for or concerned with INEEL compliance with liquid effluent permitting or reporting requirements, such as the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, Wastewater Land Application, Storm Water Pollution Prevention, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures, and Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment. The State of Idaho Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Program also needs the information for tracking <b>liquid</b> effluent <b>discharges</b> at the INEEL. The information provides a baseline from which future <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges</b> can be identified, characterized, and regulated, if appropriate.

50|$|In February 2010, Renault {{opened a}} new {{production}} factory near Tangier, Morocco, with an annual output capacity of 170,000 vehicles. Initially, it manufactured the Dacia Lodgy and Dacia Dokker models followed in October 2013 by the second generation Dacia Sandero. The output capacity increased to 340,000 vehicles per year with the inauguration of a second production line. The site {{is located in a}} dedicated free trade area, neighboring Tanger Automotive City. According to Renault, the new factory emits zero carbon and industrial <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges.</b> Over 100,000 vehicles were produced there in 2013. Renault expects to eventually increase production at the Tangier plant to 400,000 vehicles per year.|$|R
50|$|The San Miguel River {{is part of}} the Chalma-Malinalco sub-basin. It is an {{intermittent}} {{river and}} crosses the entire municipality, including the town itself. It has been used to dump trash so that the river produces disease, fetid odors and environmental damage. This has discouraged tourism to the town, and prevented the town from becoming a “Pueblo Mágico.” Plans to rescue the river include reforestation around the river’s source, improving drainage systems in Malinalco and other communities, eliminating <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges</b> into the river and better solid waste management in the municipality. A recycling facility has been built in Malinalco, in order to better handle the waste generated here, sending less to the landfill.|$|R
30|$|The {{emission}} spectrum [30 – 32] {{has shown that}} the main contributions to the {{emission spectrum}} of the water vapor plasma are OH, atomic hydrogen, and the oxygen radical. In the case of the bubble mode, when the streamers fill the entire bubble, a significant emission from the nitrogen second positive system and the nitrogen ion (first negative system). The discharge operates in two different modes. For small conductivities of the <b>liquid,</b> the <b>discharge</b> is a direct <b>liquid</b> streamer <b>discharge</b> (<b>liquid</b> mode). This mode is similar to the typical so-called corona discharges in water. For conductivities above typically 45  μS cm− 1 a large vapor bubble is formed. In the bubble mode, the streamers are located at the bubble–liquid interface. The hydrogen peroxide formation efficiency is dependent on power with a maximum for intermediate powers. The hydrogen peroxide formation efficiency is significantly smaller in the bubble mode than in the liquid mode. In the work [33], the kinetic parameters of electrons for the dielectric barrier <b>discharge</b> with a <b>liquid</b> electrode at atmospheric pressure have been estimated. Thus, we may suppose that the CNP will possess chemical activity with respect to its application in realization of the different oxidative-reductive processes.|$|R
50|$|As per {{a report}} by CRISIL, {{prepared}} in February 2011, ensuring Zero <b>Liquid</b> <b>Discharge</b> (ZLD), will primarily affect the operational costs of dyeing and bleaching units, increasing it by 7% to 10%. Eventually, by complying with the above order, Tiruppur became the first textile cluster in India to achieve Zero <b>Liquid</b> <b>Discharge</b> in their units. Both the Common Effluent Treatment Plant and Individual Effluent Treatment Plant are in place to treat effluents. Farmers in Tiruppur and its hinterland, who have faced {{the brunt of the}} indiscriminate discharge of industrial effluents into the water bodies for the past many decades, are yet again becoming concerned. Untreated effluents, mostly containing dyes and chemicals in high concentration, are now seen let off clandestinely once again in large quantities through storm water drains into water bodies or into open areas with the discharge mostly happening during the early morning hours or during rain.|$|E
50|$|NGS {{was built}} {{with one of}} the first zero <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> (ZLD) systems in a power plant, {{recovering}} all cooling tower blow-down and runoff from developed areas of the site. The waste water is processed through three brine concentrators and a crystallizer, which remove the solids and produce distilled water for re-use within the plant. Several lined ponds are used in conjunction with the ZLD system to capture and regulate the flow of waste water to the system.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{above all}} affect {{the clarity of}} the liquid output which is dependent on the volumetric throughout rate, where a higher flow rate will result in a poor liquid clarity. Another characteristic that influences {{the clarity of the}} liquid output is the differential speed. A low differential speed results in a better clarity therefore aiding in the separation process. The G-Force also plays a role in the clarity of the <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge.</b> Higher G-force results in an increase in the separation of the solid particles from the liquid and yields a better clarity.|$|E

25|$|The {{second step}} was to {{separate}} the plutonium from the uranium and the fission products. Bismuth nitrate and phosphoric acid were added, producing bismuth phosphate, which was precipitated carrying the plutonium with it. This was {{very similar to the}} lanthanum fluoride process, in which lanthanum fluoride was used as the carrier. The precipitate was removed from the solution with a centrifuge and the <b>liquid</b> <b>discharged</b> as waste. Getting rid of the fission products reduced the gamma radiation by 90 percent. The precipitate was a plutonium-containing cake which was placed in another tank and dissolved in nitric acid. Sodium bismuthate or potassium permanganate was added to oxidize the plutonium. Plutonium would be carried by the bismuth phosphate in the tetravalent state but not in the hexavalent state. The bismuth phosphate would then be precipitated as a by product, leaving the plutonium behind in solution.|$|R
40|$|Arnas and Araguas are two well-instrumented basins {{located in}} the Spanish Pyrenees.

The hydrological model is based on simple but physically-based laws to calculate the evapotranspiration and the infiltration. The surface runoff is modelled by means of a 2 D diffusive-wave model. Sediment transport phenomena are simulated by means of a hillslope erosion model. All the differential equations involved in the processes have been discretized using an explicit scheme on quadrilateral meshes.

5000|$|Tiruppur, {{like any}} other {{industrial}} town, faces its share of environmental pollution complaints. As per the directive of Madras High Court, zero <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> (ZLD) should be strictly followed in Tiruppur knitwear cluster during the effluent treatment process. Failure to implement this order, led to a court ordered closure of all dyeing units and bleaching units. In turn, Tirupur Exporters Association made a representation to the Government that export revenues of [...] 11 billion were lost and about 100,000 labourers lost their job due to a closure of dyeing units in Tirupur.|$|E
50|$|Both conical plate {{centrifuge}} and tubular bowl centrifuge can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the advantage of conical plate centrifuge over tubular bowl centrifuge is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of solids in tubular bowl is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> in conical plate centrifuge is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl centrifuges unless special skimming or centripetal pumps are used. Tubular bowl centrifuges are easier to clean and good sludge dewatering as compared to conical plate centrifuge.|$|E

Because an IGCC plant has minimal water consumption, the plant will not harm water sources of the area. A study conducted by Southern Company (parent of Mississippi Power) states that the Kemper Project “is a large undertaking with high visibility and will help set the stage for future coal-based power generation.” [...] The facility will be a [...] "zero" [...] <b>liquid</b> <b>discharge</b> facility.|$|E
40|$|For {{the future}} storage-ring {{experiments}} at the FAIR facility besides a large target area density (10 13 - 10 15 cm- 2) a small interaction length (< 5 mm) is also required, {{especially for the}} low-Z gases hydrogen and helium. State-ofthe-art internal targets are realized by producing a supersonic gas jet, i. e., by expanding a gas through a nozzle into vacuum, providing a target with a thickness < 10 13 cm- 2 spreading out over several millimeters in the interaction region. Recent experiments suggested that significantly higher target densities could be achieved by expanding the liquid at significantly lower temperatures [1]. In particular, a <b>liquid</b> <b>discharged</b> into vacuum delivers a uniquely functional target {{in the form of}} a droplet beam, where the droplet size, which can be as large as few micrometers, is univocally set by the source parameters...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{earthquake}} and tsunami in {{the east coast of}} Japan in 11 March 2011 caused a loss of power at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) that resulted {{in one of the most}} important releases of artificial radioactivity to the environment. Although several works were devoted to evaluate the atmospheric dispersion of radionuclides, the {{impact of the}} discharges to the ocean has been less investigated. Here we evaluate the distribution of Fukushima-derived 90 Sr and 89 Sr throughout waters 30 – 600 km offshore in June 2011. Concentrations of 90 Sr and 89 Sr in both surface waters and shallow profiles ranged from 0. 8 ± 0. 2 to 85 ± 3 Bq m − 3 and from 19 ± 6 to 265 ± 74 Bq m − 3, respectively. Because of its short half-life, all measured 89 Sr was due to the accident, while the 90 Sr concentrations can be compared to the background levels in the Pacific Ocean of about 1. 2 Bq m − 3. Fukushima-derived radiostrontium was mainly detected north of Kuroshio Current, as this was acting as a southern boundary for transport. The highest activities were associated with near-shore eddies, and larger inventories were found in the closest stations to Fukushima NPP. The data evidences a major influence of direct <b>liquid</b> <b>discharges</b> of radiostrontium compared to the atmospheric deposition. Existing 137 Cs data reported from the same samples allowed us establishing a 90 Sr/ 137 Cs ratio of 0. 0256 ± 0. 0006 in seawater off Fukushima, being significantly different than that of the global atmospheric fallout (i. e. 0. 63) and may be used in future studies to track waters coming from the east coast of Japan. <b>Liquid</b> <b>discharges</b> of 90 Sr to the ocean were estimated, resulting in an inventory of 53 ± 1 TBq of 90 Sr in the inshore study area in June 2011 and total releases of 90 Sr ranging from 90 to 900 TBq, depending upon the reported estimates of 137 Cs releases that are considered...|$|R
