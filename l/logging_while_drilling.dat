5000|$|Driller's Depth {{measurement}} {{is tied to}} drilling {{operations and}} other closely associated activities such as <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD), measurement while drilling (MWD) and coring.|$|E
50|$|The tools can be {{categorized}} a number of ways: energy source (electrical, acoustic, or nuclear); conveyance (wireline or <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD)); and mud type (water-based mud (WMD) or oil-based mud (OBM)).|$|E
5000|$|Hydraulic energy {{provides}} {{power to}} mud motor for bit rotation and for MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (<b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling)</b> tools. Hydraulic programs base on bit nozzles sizing for available mud pump horsepower to optimize jet impact at bottom well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinction}} between [...] "loggers' depth" [...] and [...] "drillers' depth" [...] is becoming blurred {{due to the}} increasing use of <b>logs</b> acquired <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD). At the time of writing, the common practice remains that the petrophysicists or geologists define the [...] "official depths" [...] in a well, and these depths are frequently different from the [...] "drillers' depth", after various corrections, tie-ins, etc., have been applied.|$|R

In transmitter, output of transducer amplified and shifted with respect to bias or reference level, then fed to voltage-to-frequency converter to control frequency of repetition of current pulses applied to infrared-light-emitting diode. In receiver, frequency of repetition of pulses converted back into voltage indicative of temperature or other measured quantity. Potential applications include <b>logging</b> data <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> for oil, transmitting measurements from rotors in machines without using slip rings, remote monitoring of temperatures and pressures in hazardous locations, and remote continuous monitoring of temperatures and blood pressures in medical patients, who thus remain mobile...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Measurement/Logging <b>while</b> <b>Drilling</b> (M/LWD) {{system is}} used to collect and {{transmit}} the <b>logging</b> data <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> oil/gas wells, in which logging data is transmitted using Mud Pulse Telemetry. Due to the one-way non-feedback erasure channel property, {{it is hard to}} correct transmission errors caused by Mud channel noises in real time. This paper proposes a Compressive Sensing (CS) based Transmission (CST) scheme for logging data delivering in M/LWD systems. The CTS scheme is tolerant to transmission errors without Automatic Request for Repetition mechanism and error correcting code, and also provides an interface for field technicians to adjust the effective coding rate according to various transmission accuracy requirements. To further improve the communication efficiency of CST, we introduce the improved Bernoulli matrix as the measurement matrix in the CS framework. Extensive experiments results with the real logging data are presented to verify the performance of the CST scheme...|$|R
5000|$|The {{assembly}} of rotating parts that {{goes down the}} hole, which {{is a series of}} drill pipe connections and drill collars, ending in a rotating bit. There may optionally be tools for <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> as well. The length of all these is measured, and this gives us the Driller's Depth at a given point in time. As more pipe is added, and the drilling deepens, this measurement will be updated.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} {{area for}} error is the Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA). The BHA {{consists of the}} drill bit, drill collars and stabilizers. Additionally, it can also include a downhole motor, MWD (measurement while drilling) and LWD (<b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling)</b> tools. Errors come about if the total BHA is not correctly measured or recorded. Often BHA changes may be made during operations and if these changes are not recorded then the depths will be incorrect.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{oil and gas}} wells are drilled directionally. At first, loggers had to {{run their}} tools somehow {{attached}} to the drill pipe if the well was not vertical. Modern techniques now permit continuous information at the surface. This is known as <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD) or measurement-while-drilling (MWD). MWD logs use mud pulse technology to transmit data from the tools {{on the bottom of}} the drillstring to the processors at the surface.|$|E
50|$|Resistance {{and good}} {{behavior}} under high-temperature, high-vibration environments {{is especially important}} for applications such as oil exploration (wireline <b>logging,</b> measurement <b>while</b> <b>drilling).</b> For most scintillators, light output and scintillation decay time depends on the temperature. This dependence can largely be ignored for room-temperature applications since it is usually weak. The dependence on the temperature is also weaker for organic scintillators than it is for inorganic crystals, such as NaI-Tl or BGO. Strong dependence of decay time on the temperature in BGO scintillator is used for remote monitoring of temperature in vacuum environment. The coupled PMTs also exhibit temperature sensitivity, and can be damaged if submitted to mechanical shock. Hence, high temperature rugged PMTs should be used for high-temperature, high-vibration applications.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEarly kick {{detection}} is {{of great}} concern <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> wells. The late kick detection can lead to uncontrolled blowout which increases the possibility of injury and potential lose of life and equipment. Causes of kick {{and the importance of}} early kick detection are introduced. Kick detection from mud logging real time data and kick detection in the offshore Nile Delta are discussed. Limitation of the conventional well control procedure in low permeable formation is introduced. A comparison between gas parameters warning sign and drilling parameters warning sign was carried out. A new advanced early kick detection method is proposed based on more than 10 years of experience in monitoring real time mud <b>logging</b> data <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> and analyzing flow and kick reports. The proposed advanced early kick detection method uses additional accurate flow check using trip tank and recommends adding two additional accurate pressure sensors while shut-in well. The proposed method has a great advantage using gas parameters which can detect near-balance state before kick occur. The advanced kick detection method does not require any rig equipment modification nor interfere with any drilling operation. Case studies in the offshore Nile Delta wells illustrate the limitation of the conventional well control procedure and the advantage of the proposed method...|$|R

50|$|The most typical {{reason for}} {{tripping}} pipe is {{to replace a}} worn-out drill bit. Though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe. Downhole tools such as MWD (measurement while drilling), LWD (<b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling)</b> or mud motors break down quite often. Another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe. It is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap.|$|E
50|$|Telemetry {{is used to}} {{transmit}} drilling mechanics and formation evaluation information uphole, in real time, as a well is drilled. These services are known as Measurement while drilling and <b>Logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling.</b> Information acquired thousands of feet below ground, while drilling, is sent through the drilling hole to the surface sensors and the demodulation software. The pressure wave (sana) is translated into useful information after DSP and noise filters. This information is used for Formation evaluation, Drilling Optimization, and Geosteering.|$|E
50|$|While the {{borehole}} {{is being}} drilled {{according to the}} well plan, new geological information is gathered from mud logging, measurement while drilling (MWD) and <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD). These usually show some differences from what is expected from the model. As the model is continuously updated with the new geological information (formation evaluation) and the borehole position (well deviation survey), changes start {{to appear in the}} geological substructures and can lead to the well plan being updated to reach the corrected geological targets.|$|E

50|$|The IntelliServ network {{components}} {{are embedded in}} drill string components, known as IntelliPipe, which transmit subsurface data at 57,000 bits per second. The IntelliServ network upgrade can raise the speed to one million bits per second. The two-way data communication between downhole Measurement while drilling (MWD) and <b>Logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD) measurement tools and the operators at the surface allow the operators to command rotary-steering tools, or configure downhole tools such as the formation pressure testing tool or sonic tools.|$|E
5000|$|The data {{itself is}} {{recorded}} either at surface (real-time mode), {{or in the}} hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a [...] "well log" [...] is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data. Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see <b>Logging</b> <b>While</b> <b>Drilling),</b> to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.|$|E
5000|$|The BHA {{is made up}} of: a drill bit, {{which is}} used to break up the rock formations; drill collars, which are heavy, {{thick-walled}} tubes used to apply weight to the drill bit; and drilling stabilizers, which keep the assembly centered in the hole. The BHA may also contain other components such as a downhole motor and rotary steerable system, measurement while drilling (MWD), and <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD) tools.

40|$|Casing <b>While</b> <b>Drilling</b> {{technology}} {{is one of}} the greatest developments in drilling operations. The Casing <b>While</b> <b>Drilling</b> involved drilling and casing a well simultaneously and hence, overall cost of drilling may be reduced significantly by lessening drilling time and drillstring problems encountered during conventional drilling process. This {{technology is}} highly applicable in depleted reservoir as an alternative to the underbalanced drilling, which requires special equipment. This paper presents the applicability of the concept of Casing <b>While</b> <b>Drilling</b> in context of the Arabian (Middle East) drilling operations. Attempts are made in order to overcome some unscheduled hole problems, such as lost circulation, differential sticking and casing stuck due to tight hole during running casing after drillstring pulled out. This paper also presents simplified method that has been developed to predict the torsional and drag forces subjected to the casing string. Method of evaluating fatigue life of casing string has also been developed using simplified analytical techniques based on prevailing drilling conditions in Arabian fields. Both the static and dynamic cyclic loads as encountered in vertical and deviated wells are considered for the evaluation of fatigue life of casing string used for Casing <b>While</b> <b>Drilling.</b> Valuable guidelines are provided based on field representative case studies in order to minimize the various problems of conventional drilling operation through using the Casing <b>While</b> <b>Drilling</b> approach for Arabian field condition.

5000|$|<b>Logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD) is a {{technique}} of conveying well logging tools into the well borehole downhole {{as part of the}} bottom hole assembly (BHA). LWD tools work with its measurement while drilling (MWD) system to transmit partial or complete measurement results to the surface via typically a drilling mud pulser or other improved techniques, while LWD tools are still in the borehole, which is called [...] "real-time data". Complete measurement results can be downloaded from LWD tools after they are pulled out of hole, which is called [...] "memory data".|$|E
50|$|Mud pumps come in {{a variety}} of sizes and {{configurations}} but for the typical petroleum drilling rig, the triplex (three piston/plunger) mud pump is the pump of choice. Duplex mud pumps (two piston/plungers) have generally been replaced by the triplex pump, but are still common in developing countries. Two later developments are the hex pump with six vertical pistons/plungers, and various quintuplex's with five horizontal piston/plungers. The advantages that these new pumps have over convention triplex pumps is a lower mud noise which assists with better Measurement while drilling (MWD) and <b>Logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD) decoding.|$|E
5000|$|A {{drilling}} rig {{is used to}} create borehole or wells (also called a wellbore) in the earth's sub-surface, for example in order to extract natural resources such as gas or oil. During such drilling, data is acquired from the {{drilling rig}} sensors {{for a range of}} purposes such as: decision-support to monitor and manage the smooth operation of drilling; to make detailed records (or well log) of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole; to generate operations statistics and performance benchmarks such that improvements can be identified, and to provide well planners with accurate historical operations-performance data with which to perform statistical risk analysis for future well operations. The terms Measurement While Drilling (MWD), and [...] <b>Logging</b> <b>While</b> <b>Drilling</b> [...] (LWD) are not used consistently throughout the industry. Although, these terms are related, within the context of this section, the term MWD refers to directional-drilling measurements, e.g., for decision support for the smooth operation of the drilling, while LWD refers to measurements concerning the geological formation made while drilling.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, a new {{approach}} to wireline logging was introduced in the form of <b>logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD). This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the drill string and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled. This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions {{about the future of the}} well and the direction of drilling. In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well's mud fluid column. This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information. A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes. High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through networked or wired drillpipe that deliver memory quality data in real time.|$|E

Chikyu is the only research vessel with the capabilities for the necessary drilling in very deep water of over 6900 meters. Two months of operations from April 1 to 24 May 24, 2012 were scheduled for drilling several boreholes to carry out <b>Logging</b> <b>while</b> <b>drilling</b> (LWD), install temperature sensors and retrieve core samples. The extreme water depths caused many technical challenges {{that had to be}} considered, such as the strength of the long pipe string, onboard handling of the pipe sections, and instrument operations at very high water pressure. These aspects needed careful planning and new tools on the ship. Various equipment had not been previously used in such deep water and caused many problems and delays during the first month at sea. Eventually difficult engineering problems were overcome enabling retrieval of borehole core and installation of a temperature observatory across the fault zone at a depth of about 820 meters below the sea floor. New records were set for scientific drilling including, longest drilling string (7740 m) from the ocean surface and deepest core from the ocean surface (7752 m).|$|E
