5|$|The Moon's {{appearance}} is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits — known as lunistices rather than solstices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a sidereal month to complete its cycle {{rather than the}} year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon's movement move on an 18.6 year cycle. For slightly over nine years the extreme <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the phase of the Moon. The cycle from one New Moon to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the Synodic month. Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See Moon for more details.|$|E
5|$|The shred {{music of}} the 1980s was a major {{influence}} on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's Beard and Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vinyl LP.|$|E

5|$|For long-distance {{holiday traffic}} {{travelling}} through {{the county to}} and from Devon and Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey.

Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this unfair, as he is believed to have understood the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stop lines and never expected them to hold out indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|We study a {{fluid flow}} {{traversing}} a porous medium and obeying the Darcy's {{law in the}} case when this medium is fractured by a periodical distribution of fissures filled with a Stokes fluid.

Lambda is a blue-white B-type main sequence dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 4.48 located around 423 light-years from Earth.

5|$|Climatologically speaking, {{approximately}} 97 {{percent of}} tropical cyclones that {{form in the}} North Atlantic develop between the dates of June 1 and November 30 – dates which delimit the modern-day Atlantic hurricane season.

Regardless, on average once every few years a tropical cyclone develops outside the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season; as of January2016 there have been 66tropical cyclones in the off-season, with the most recent being Tropical Storm Arlene in 2017.

5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway or York Regional Road48, also {{referred}} to historically as the Markham Bypass or Markham Bypass Extension, is a regionally maintained arterial bypass of Markham in the Canadian province of Ontario. Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007, the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove, south of Highway407, to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road25). A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line. In addition to its role of funneling through-traffic around downtown Markham, the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land {{to the north and}} east are part of the protected Rouge Park and southwest <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planned Pickering Airport.|$|E
