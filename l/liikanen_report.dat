This project {{that has to be}} doubled by the fiscal union is more advanced on banking supervision component, where the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Banking Authority (EBA), involved also in bank assessments and stress tests, play a key role and less advanced on components of bank resolution and common deposit guarantee, the last two involving the creation of common European funds and institutional structures for their proper management. The project will likely to be completed in few years and represents a significant contribution to the reform of EU economic governance which started in 2010, and it was initiated by the European Commission experts together with other experts (see Larosière and <b>Liikanen</b> <b>reports),</b> and it has already resulted in the coordination and the political will displayed by the European Council to carry out the objectives, in the actions undertaken by the legislators (ECOFIN and European Parliament) by adopting regulations and analyzing the proposed directives and in the intense activity carried out by the European Commission, ECB and EBA. The urgency of completing banking union established by the European Council and the commitments made by other European institutions can contribute to a substantial progress until the new European elections (May 2014). Later on it may be taken into account a treaty change, specifically requested by United Kindgom, to clarify certain political and organizational aspects, including also those of fiscal union and political union...|$|R

The United States response {{came in the form of}} the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, although full implementation of the Volcker Rule that restricts proprietary trading by retail banks has been postponed until at least 2017. In the United Kingdom the 2011 Vickers report of the Independent Commission on Banking has recommended the ring fencing of retail from investment banking by 2019. In the Eurozone the <b>Liikanen</b> <b>report</b> of 2012 recommended a similar ring-fence between the two activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{predecessor}} {{paper to}} this publication, “Volcker/Vickers Hybrid”: The <b>Liikanen</b> <b>Report</b> and Justifications For Ring Fencing and Separate Legal Entities, considered the merits, objectives and cost-benefit attributes of respective models {{associated with the}} Vickers Report, <b>Liikanen</b> <b>Report</b> and Volckers Rule – by way of reference {{to the degree of}} separation of legal entities or banking activities involved, as well as whether an outright ban or prohibition on proprietary trading is involved. This paper is aimed at highlighting why ring fencing not only presents a more feasible and cost effective option to other models, but also why its degree of flexibility provides the more appropriate balance in a financial environment whose trend is increasingly inclined towards conglomeration. ...|$|E
40|$|Whilst some {{valid and}} {{justified}} arguments {{have been put}} forward in favour of ring fencing, that is, constructing a fire-wall between consumer and investment banks, and that such activities can be achieved without re structuring banks into separate legal entities, the <b>Liikanen</b> <b>Report</b> highlights why there is need for such re structuring. As well as considering the merits of ringfencing {{and the establishment of}} separate legal activities and entities, this paper aims to highlight why a suitable model aimed at mitigating risks of contagion can to a large extent, be justified on a cost-benefit analysis basis. Furthermore, the paper ultimately concludes that even though a greater degree of separation of legal entities and activities persist with the model which is referred to as „total separation“, a certain degree of independence between bank activities would also be necessary under ring fencing if its purposes and objectives are to be fulfilled. ...|$|E

On 29 January 2014 the European Commission published a {{proposal for}} a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council “on structural measures improving the resilience of EU credit institutions” 1. This proposed legislation is the EU’s equivalent of Volcker 2 and Vickers 3. It was initiated by the <b>Liikanen</b> <b>report</b> 4 published on 2 October 2012 but the legislative proposal departs {{in a number of ways}} from the report’s conclusions. There are two significant departures: the legislative proposal contains a Volcker-style prohibition, which also departs from the individual EU Member States’ approach, and, although the proposal contains provisions which mirror the Vickers ‘ring-fencing’ approach they are not, in direct contradiction to Liikanen’s recommendation, mandatory. Background 2. Post financial crisis, various jurisdictions have started to overhaul bank regulation and supervision. Bank structural reform is part of that agenda and involves separating retail and commercial banking from wholesale and investment banking, as well as outright prohibitions. The objective is to protect core banking activities and depositors from the ‘riskier ’ trading activities, which have been deemed as ‘socially less important’, by reducing the risk of contagion spreading from trading activities to traditional retail banking and protecting the 1 See her...|$|E

The two main structural proposals of the <b>Liikanen</b> <b>Report</b> are: first, for large banks, {{the separation of the}} trading business {{from other parts of the}} banking business (the Separation Proposal), and the mandatory issuing of subordinated bank debt thought to be liable (the strict Bail-in Proposal).
