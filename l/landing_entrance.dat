50|$|The {{territory}} is reached mostly by helicopter via a helipad {{located on the}} upper sections. A landing area {{is located on the}} south end near the <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> to Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera.|$|R
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour's walking {{took them to the}} palazzo of Polani. They rang twice at the bell at the <b>land</b> <b>entrance,</b> before a face {{appeared}} at the little window of the door, and asked who was there.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the centre}} of the {{rectangular}} palazzo is a small courtyard decorated with sculptures and a small fountain; the court is overlooked by the colonnaded balcony of the piano nobile. [...] The ground floor resembles a mere expansion of the vaulted portego - a hall which links the canal <b>entrance</b> to the <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The <b>land's</b> <b>entrance</b> {{once had}} towering studio gates that {{featured}} intricately carved elephants atop massive columns. The gateway was {{a tribute to}} the spectacular epics made throughout Hollywood history, especially pioneering director D. W. Griffith's 1916 silent film Intolerance. After the park's re-design, the archway sign, elephants and columns were removed, whereas the repainted pedestals remained.|$|R
50|$|Shuqrah on the Arabian Sea, east of Aden, {{fell to the}} Houthis on 27 March, {{giving the}} militants control of all <b>land</b> <b>entrances</b> to Aden. Fighting was {{reported}} {{on the outskirts of}} the provisional capital itself. By the start of April, Houthi and allied military forces had pressed into central Aden, taking control of the presidential palace on 2 April.|$|R
60|$|The den in {{the river}} bank was never disturbed, and the {{following}} year another litter was raised there. With characteristic cunning--a cunning which grows keener and keener {{in the neighborhood of}} civilization--the mother-otter filled up the <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> among the roots with earth and driftweed, using only the doorway under water until {{it was time for the}} cubs to come out into the world again.|$|R
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of Barkers Bush is located on private property, however, trespassing has generally been accepted and the public has used the trails extensively for many years. Historically, the only public <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> to the bush was through Lion's Park, however, this changed in 2002 when the local municipality built a steel footbridge from the east banks of the Nith to the west banks located in the bush itself.|$|R
50|$|After {{his arrival}} in the city, Colonel Gaspar Sanchez Ochoa rapidly {{fortified}} the northern <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> of the city {{at the foot of}} the Nevería hill, extending to the old harbor. On the opposite side, towards the town, he set up his headquarters on the beach, and installed some small pieces of artillery. Additionally, groups of soldiers were placed in reserve in a well situated position to the west, where there are three islands close to the side of the old port.|$|R
500|$|Plymouth {{makes up}} the entire western shore of Cape Cod Bay. It is bordered on land by Bourne to the {{southeast}}, Wareham to the southwest, Carver to the west, and Kingston to the north. It also shares a small border with Duxbury at the <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> of Saquish Neck. Plymouth's border with Bourne makes {{up most of the}} line between Plymouth and Barnstable counties. The town is located roughly [...] southeast of Boston (it is almost exactly [...] from Plymouth Rock to the Massachusetts State House) and equidistantly east of Providence, Rhode Island.|$|R
50|$|Little Harbor {{was located}} between Garden and Thompson on the Garden Peninsula. It was a steam powered sawmill town founded between 1885 and 1887 by Alfred Tracy and William L. Marble (although some fishing cabins {{existed at the}} harbor {{at the time of}} Meriweathers survey for the United States Geological Survey in 1848). The {{entrance}} to the town is from the southeast with a narrow passage which leads to a natural twenty-foot deep harbor which is protected from all sides. The <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> was a stairway that led from the bluff to the town site.|$|R
50|$|Plymouth {{makes up}} the entire western shore of Cape Cod Bay. It is bordered on land by Bourne to the {{southeast}}, Wareham to the southwest, Carver to the west, and Kingston to the north. It also shares a small border with Duxbury at the <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> of Saquish Neck. Plymouth's border with Bourne makes {{up most of the}} line between Plymouth and Barnstable counties. The town is located roughly 44 mi southeast of Boston (it is almost exactly 40 mi from Plymouth Rock to the Massachusetts State House) and equidistantly east of Providence, Rhode Island.|$|R
50|$|The Tomb {{was built}} during the Zapotec culture {{classical}} period (650-900 CE)., hence {{it is about}} 1240 years old; some scholars {{believe that it was}} used at least twice after the Great Lord who originally ordered it construction for his own burial ceremony, known as “Señor 12 Monos (12 monkey) who probably ruled this <b>land.</b> <b>Entrance</b> is down nine steps leading to a hall, {{that at the time of}} its discovery was sealed with a large stone block. Two stones carved in bas-relief with the representation of richly dressed priests form the entry, on top is a large monolithic lintel holding a feline head with open jaws, a precious bird head sticks out the mouth.|$|R
50|$|Valledupar {{has four}} {{different}} <b>land</b> <b>entrances,</b> and is crossed by national highway Route 80 from south to north. Route 80 is still under-construction, a segment between {{the village of}} Badillo via the village of Patillal {{and the town of}} San Juan del Cesar in the department of La Guajira. As an alternative route 80 also crosses the town of La Paz in order to drive north to the northern department of La Guajira. To the south, the route 80 highway connects with the rest of Colombia including northern regions of Colombia, like Santa Marta, Barranquilla and Cartagena; to the west two road access to some other villages to the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.|$|R
5000|$|On the landward side, a ditch, ramparts, terreplein, caponier and {{flanking}} batteries {{defended the}} approaches. The bunkered barracks on the north-east corner (close to the <b>land</b> <b>entrance)</b> housed the garrison and commanded the landward defences. The barracks overlooks the approach road which enters the fort on a {{bridge over the}} dry moat. A two-tiered musketry gallery {{and a number of}} flanking galleries also covered this moat - which at points is [...] deep and [...] wide. Additionally a two-storied caponier had positions for landward gunners. On the ramparts, the terreplein had a number of movable cannon (supported by fixed magazines) and covered an arc of the landward approaches. In 1898, the landward defences are recorded as having four 32 pounder smooth bore breech loading guns.|$|R
5000|$|The King's Lines are a walled rock-cut trench on {{the lower}} slopes of the north-west face of the Rock of Gibraltar. Forming part of the Northern Defences of the fortifications of Gibraltar, they were {{originally}} created some time during the periods when Gibraltar was {{under the control of}} the Moors or Spanish. They are depicted in a 1627 map by Don Luis Bravo de Acuña, which shows their parapet following a tenaille trace. The lines seem to have been altered subsequently, as maps from the start of the 18th century show a more erratic course leading from the Landport, Gibraltar's main <b>land</b> <b>entrance,</b> to the Round Tower, a fortification at their western end. A 1704 map by Johannes Kip calls the Lines the [...] "Communication Line of the Round Tower".|$|R
50|$|Fortín de San Antonio was a {{fortification}} {{created by}} the Spanish in San Juan, Puerto Rico {{with the aim of}} fortifying the San Antonio Bridge. The bridge was of great strategic importance, given that it was the only <b>land</b> accessible <b>entrance</b> to the islet of San Juan. It was located southeast of Fort San Jeronimo.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, the {{development}} of “smart cities” {{with a high level}} of quality of life is becoming a prior challenge to be addressed. In this paper, promoting the model shift in railway transportation using tram network towards more reliable, greener and in general more sustainable transportation modes in a potential world class university is proposed. “Smart mobility” in a smart city will significantly contribute to achieving the goal of a university becoming a world class university. In order to have a regular and reliable rail system on campus, we optimize the route among major stations on campus, using shortest path problem Dijkstra algorithm in conjunction with a computer software called LINDO to arrive at the optimal route. In particular, it is observed that the shortest path from the main <b>entrance</b> gate (Canaan <b>land</b> <b>entrance</b> gate) to the Electrical Engineering Department is of distance 0. 805 km...|$|R
50|$|Venice {{is built}} on an {{archipelago}} of 118 islands formed by 177 canals in a shallow lagoon, connected by 409 bridges. In the old centre, the canals serve the function of roads, and almost every form of transport is on water or on foot. In the 19th century, a causeway to the mainland brought the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station to Venice, and the Ponte della Libertà road causeway and parking facilities (in Tronchetto island and in piazzale Roma) were built during the 20th century. Beyond the road and rail <b>land</b> <b>entrances</b> at {{the northern edge of}} the city, transportation within the city remains (as it was in centuries past) entirely on water or on foot. Venice is Europe's largest urban car-free area. Venice is unique in Europe, in having remained a sizable functioning city in the 21st century entirely without motorcars or trucks.|$|R
50|$|During the 18th and 19th centuries, the sea {{came up to}} the {{defensive}} walls and there were four outer gates through which the town could be entered. Four keys locked these entrances to the town. The ceremony's origins date from the Great Siege of Gibraltar, which started in 1779 when French and Spanish troops attempted to capture Gibraltar. The keys were kept by the Governor who would hand them to the Port (Gate) Sergeant each evening at sunset, so that the four <b>land</b> <b>entrances</b> could be locked shut. The Gate Sergeant with an escort consisting of several armed soldiers, fife and drums would then march to each of the four gates in turn. He would be challenged by the sentry at the gate with the same words as used in London. Once all the gates were locked, the keys would be returned to the Governor at The Convent. In the morning, the Port Sergeant would once again collect the keys to open the town.|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{a popular}} tourism and {{recreation}} centre, containing natural and artificial attractions including an amusement park. The Outer Ring Road Phase 2 has acquired <b>lands</b> at the <b>entrance</b> and is set to intersect the city.|$|R
50|$|Inchcolm Abbey has {{the most}} {{complete}} surviving remains of any Scottish monastic house. The cloisters, chapter house, warming house, and refectory are all complete, {{and most of the}} remaining claustral buildings survive in a largely complete state. The least well-preserved part of the complex is the monastic church. The ruins are cared for by Historic Scotland, which also maintains a visitor centre near the <b>landing</b> pier (<b>entrance</b> charge; ferry from South Queensferry).|$|R

60|$|He {{came out}} on the <b>landing</b> above the <b>entrance</b> hall and looked about him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had passed and the marks of the soldiers' slugs were there. And it was there that the old {{servants}} had seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal.|$|R
50|$|Pineda's {{defiance}} {{did not go}} unanswered. At 2 PM on 2 Oct. 1847, Lieutenant Craven with seventeen {{marines and}} fifty-seven sailors <b>landed</b> at the <b>entrance</b> to Muleje Creek (El Sombrerito) and proceeded up the right bank. Just after landing, USS Dale began her bombardment which reportedly had little effect.|$|R
50|$|Around 1955, the Number 11 bus {{operated}} by Red Bus Services crashed through a wooden retaining wall and <b>landed</b> in The <b>Entrance</b> Channel after its brakes failed while turning onto The Entrance Bridge. The driver and three passengers were uninjured, although the boat that the bus landed on was heavily damaged.|$|R

50|$|On 21 March 1806, he {{captured}} three Spanish luggers under {{a battery of}} six 24-pounders in the port of Avilés. On 19 April 1806, 24 men from Colpoys and the gun-brig , under Lieutenant Thomas Swain, <b>landed</b> at the <b>entrance</b> of the river Doelan, spiked two guns of a battery, and captured two chasse-marées.|$|R
50|$|The true half-rotation jump with a loop <b>entrance,</b> <b>landed</b> forward (on {{the left}} toe pick and right forward inside edge, for a {{counterclockwise}} jump), {{is called a}} falling leaf. This jump can be performed with a split position {{at the peak of}} the jump, which is called a split falling leaf (see split jump).|$|R
50|$|Both {{entrances to}} the Sinks {{are located on}} private <b>land.</b> The {{upstream}} <b>entrance</b> {{is owned by the}} Teter family and the downstream exit is owned by the Tingler family. (This same Teter family owned this land way back in 1854 when David Hunter Strother visited.) The location of the cave is not identified by any signage in the area.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 and 1967 Senior Constable Alan Walker (1964-67) {{requested}} a septic system, and in 1968 this request was repeated by Senior Constable Luis Olsen (1968-73), who also {{asked that the}} back <b>entrance</b> <b>landing</b> be enclosed, as well as part of east veranda, where rain was beating against the doors into the main bedroom and the lounge.|$|R
50|$|The {{campus was}} {{designed}} to have an informal layout. The architectural concept uses scale and placement of buildings, multilevel plazas, brick, wood and concrete building materials and glass window walls to give a variety of interior and exterior views. The structures are built into the natural contours of the <b>land,</b> with <b>entrances</b> on several levels. The Avanté Center for Science, Health Careers and Emerging Technologies covers more than 6 acre of learning space including 35 laboratories, nine lecture halls, a nursing lab, and a working dental clinic. According to the architects Hellmuth, Obata + Kassabaum Inc. (HOK), Avanté incorporates energy-saving elements using a holistic approach.|$|R
50|$|Back Bay is a bay 1 km wide {{along the}} west coast of Graham <b>Land,</b> Antarctica. Its <b>entrance</b> lies between Stonington Island and Fitzroy Island, {{with the head of the}} bay formed by Northeast Glacier. The bay was first {{surveyed}} by the US Antarctic Service, 1939-41, and so named by them because of its location at the rear (north-east) side of Stonington Island.|$|R
50|$|Tarakan Airport on the eponymous island {{serves the}} province, {{as well as}} an {{international}} ferry port with services to Malaysia from Tawau. There are no international <b>land</b> crossings - <b>entrance</b> into the mainland of the province is by ferry from Tarakan or by road from the south. Large stretches of the roads in this province are of unpaved muddy ditches.|$|R
