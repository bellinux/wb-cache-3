5|$|Montreal was {{incorporated}} {{as a city}} in 1832. The opening of the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> permitted ships to bypass the unnavigable Lachine Rapids, while {{the construction of the}} Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub. The leaders of Montreal's business community had started to build their homes in the Golden Square Mile (~) from about 1850. By 1860, it was the largest municipality in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada.|$|E

Jean-Guy had a son named Alain Dubois who grew up as Jean-Guy served his time for second degree murder and later {{continued}} the cycle of criminality because as he claimed it was the only place he felt like he fit in.|$|E
25|$|Canada {{originally}} {{ordered the}} construction of 33 frigates in October 1941. The design was {{too big for the}} locks on the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> so it was not built by the shipyards on the Great Lakes and therefore all the frigates built in Canada were built in dockyards along the West Coast or along the St. Lawrence River below Montreal. In all Canada ordered {{the construction of}} 60 frigates including ten for the Royal Navy that transferred two to the United States Navy.|$|E

50|$|The canal {{gets its}} name from the French word for China (La Chine). The European explorers sought to find a route from New France to the Western Sea, and from there to China and hence auspiciously the region where the canal was built was named <b>Lachine.</b> Currently, the <b>canal,</b> due to the {{continuous}} disposal of industrial waste, has the prevalence of harmful substances, although the water quality is said to be good.|$|R
500|$|It was {{initially}} {{expected that the}} corvette fleet would be superseded by a line of larger frigates and destroyers, but the narrowness of Montreal's <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> prevented larger ships from getting to Atlantic Ocean from Great Lake shipyards. The corvette fleet stayed. Eventually 123 were built, the largest class of ships ever used by the Canadian Navy. The corvettes were dubbed the [...] after a similar British design. The British gave them names of flowers such as [...] and [...] The Canadian Navy decided to name their ships after Canadian towns. While {{they should have been}} called the , a line of American destroyers was already using that name so the term [...] "flower" [...] was retained for Canadian corvettes.|$|E
2500|$|After lengthy negotiations, in 1840 the British Crown {{recognized}} the possessions of the Sulpicians, {{the status of}} which had been ambiguous since the Conquest, while also providing for the gradual termination of the seigneurial regime. This enabled the Sulpicians to keep their holdings and continue their work, while allowing landowners who so desired to make a single final payment (commutation) and be relieved of all future seigneurial dues. [...] The vast Sulpician land-holdings included the Saint-Gabriel Farm through which entrepreneurs had constructed the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> in 1825. After accepting the government designation of the property {{on the banks of the}} canal as an industrial zone, the Society began selling off parcels for industrial development at enormous profits, which helped finance their good works.|$|E
2500|$|The Neils and Mackenzie {{settled in}} Kingston, Ontario. [...] The {{limestone}} {{in the area}} proved too hard for his stonemason tools and, not having money to buy new tools, Mackenzie {{took a job as}} a labourer constructing a building on Princess Street. [...] The contractor on the job claimed financial difficulty and so Mackenzie accepted a promissory note for summer wages. [...] The note later proved to be worthless. [...] Subsequently, Mackenzie won a contract building a bomb-proof arch at Fort Henry. [...] He later became a foreman on the construction of Kingston's four [...] Martello Towers - [...] Murney Tower, Fort Frederick, Cathcart Tower, and Shoal Tower. [...] He was also a foreman on the construction of the Welland Canal and the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal.</b> [...] While working on the Beauharnois Canal a one ton stone fell and crushed one of his legs. [...] He recovered but never regained the strength in that leg. [...] It was while in Kingston that Mackenzie became a vocal opponent of religious and political entitlement and corruption in government.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the canal has seen a large {{increase}} in residential and commercial development. In what was originally a very heavy industrial neighbourhood, Pointe-Saint-Charles and Saint-Henri have become very up and coming districts. House values have skyrocketed and many real estate developers have turned the century old industrial factories and warehouses, like that of Dominion Textiles (5524 Saint-Patrick, now Complexe Dompark) & Simmons Bedding Company (4710 St-Ambroise, now Complexe <b>Canal</b> <b>Lachine)</b> into prestigious loft buildings. Complexe Dompark recently celebrated its 100th anniversary and now houses more than 90 multimedia, fashion, publishing and service industry-based companies in custom designed lofts. The area around the Atwater Market {{has become one of}} Montreal's most desirable residential areas for condo owners. Much of this is thanks to the continued effort to clean up the Canal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> {{fell victim}} to deindustrialization. Many of the {{factories}} that lined the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> were torn down and replaced by houses and apartments. By 1990 there was {{the feeling that the}} area's industrial history was being forgotten. In response, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board named the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> “Lachine Canal Manufacturing Complex”. The area was renovated after Parks Canada took over the Administration.|$|E
5000|$|Streets {{are named}} [...] "Ouest" [...] or [...] "Est" [...] when they cross Saint Laurent Boulevard. Street numbers rise eastward and westward from Saint Laurent Boulevard, and northward from the St. Lawrence River and the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal.</b> (A few streets in Le Sud-Ouest borough, such as rue Charlevoix, cross the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal.</b> In those cases, the {{addresses}} {{south of the}} <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> have an [...] "O" [...] prefixed to their street numbers.) ...|$|E
50|$|Railway {{transportation}} {{proved to}} be very important for Montreal. The Grand Trunk Railway had its workshop in Point. St. Charles. This {{proved to be}} very important for the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> because its workshop in Point St. Charles provided a link to the Atlantic during the winter months. It was the door {{to the rest of the}} Grand Trunk railway line that went from Toronto to Maine. Because the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> was the link between the ocean and the interior of Canada and America, the <b>Lachine</b> <b>Canal</b> was a major centre for transportation.|$|E
