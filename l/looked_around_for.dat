5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
25|$|With the German {{invasion}} {{starting on}} 9 April 1940, the Luftwaffe had initially {{intended to use}} Værnes Air Station as its main stronghold for operating aircraft of the 10th Air Corps in Trøndelag. Contrary to their intelligence statements, Værnes was in a dilapidated state, lacking such amenities as a paved runway. The Luftwaffe therefore <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> other suitable sites {{to allow them to}} continue battle in the Norwegian Campaign. All supplies would need to be flow in to Trøndelag until 13 April, and it was therefore imperative for the Wehrmacht that an air base be established in the region.|$|E

25|$|As his {{business}} grew Pao <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> suitable new ventures and in 1955 decided to branch into shipping (still focusing on assets {{that were not}} fixed in Hong Kong) and embarked on an intensive learning process. Shipowning in Hong Kong had a poor reputation at that time with the banks and so the first vessel, a 28-year-old coal burning 8,200 tonne freighter, was purchased without finance. Having seen this and the rigorousness employed by Pao in the purchase process, the Hongkong Bank extended a loan for the second purchase, the start of long and fruitful relationship which led to Pao being appointed {{to the board of}} the bank in 1971 and later to become its vice-chairman.|$|E

2500|$|Legend {{states that}} Hanina was greatly grieved at not being able, with other pious people, to present {{something}} to the Temple. In his despondency {{he walked out of}} town, and, seeing a huge rock, he vowed to carry it to Jerusalem as a gift to the Holy City. He smoothed and polished it, and then <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> help to transport it. Five laborers appeared, and offered to carry the rock to its destined place for one hundred gold pieces. Hanina, who did not possess half that amount, turned away in despair. Soon, however, other laborers appeared and demanded only five [...] "sela'im," [...] but they stipulated that Hanina himself should aid in the transportation. The agreement concluded, they all seized the rock, and in an instant stood before Jerusalem. When Hanina turned to pay the laborers they were nowhere to be found. He repaired to the Sanhedrin to inquire what disposition he should make of the uncollected wages. The Sanhedrin heard his tale and concluded that the laborers were ministering angels, not human laborers, and that Hanina was therefore at liberty to apply the money to his own use. He, however, presented it to the Temple (Cant. R. i. 1; Eccl. R. i.).|$|E

2500|$|Many of {{the locals}} conceded that the {{speedway}} would be sold {{after the war and}} become a housing development. With {{the end of the war}} in sight, on November 29, 1944, three-time 500 winner Wilbur Shaw came back to do a [...] tire test approved by the government for Firestone. Shaw was shocked at the dilapidated state of the speedway and contacted owner Eddie Rickenbacker, only to discover that it was for sale. Shaw then sent out letters to the automobile industry to try to find a buyer. All the responses indicated that the speedway would be turned into a private facility for the buyer. Shaw then <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> someone to buy the speedway, who would reopen the racetrack as a public venue. He found Terre Haute businessman Tony Hulman. Meetings were set up and the speedway was purchased on November 14, 1945. Though not officially acknowledged, the purchase price for the speedway was reported by the Indianapolis Star and News to be $750,000. Major renovations and repairs were made at a quick pace to the frail speedway, in time for the 1946 race. Since the record 42 cars that started the 1933 edition of the 500, the field size has been set at 33 drivers, with only three exceptions to this rule, the first being 1947, when only 30 cars started due to a strike by certain teams affiliated with the ASPAR drivers, owners and sponsors association.|$|E
