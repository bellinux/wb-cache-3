5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players roll the upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> hollowed out his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
30|$|For {{correcting}} the B parameter error of CLNF, a novel hybrid dynamic correlation template method (HD-CTM) using the first derivative of smoothed luminance variation is proposed {{to detect the}} outer <b>lower</b> <b>lips.</b> Then, inner <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> position can be estimated by subtracting the validated <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> thickness (VLLT) from the outer <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> position. This method is robust for any lips shape.|$|R
30|$|In some patients, {{the lips}} {{have to be}} pulled to the {{opposite}} side for compensatory contractions. In this case, often the fascia lata is fixed to the opposite lip {{through the center of the}} lips. This method passes the fascial lata extension connected to the temporalis tendon through the tunnel of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips.</b> Fix the fascia lata extension to the center of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> and pull the philtrum and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> to the center.|$|R

She also has several piercings, including a 'Monroe' (a piercing near the upper lip that resembles a beauty mark) and 'Snakebites' (a piercing {{on each side of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>lip).</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which had been dead for three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with a blunt tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{may also}} {{refer to the}} {{junction}} of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> (see labial commissure of mouth).|$|R

5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E

25|$|P. alpina only begins {{flowering}} {{after several}} years of growth. Six to eight (occasionally up to 13) flowers are borne singly on unbranched inflorescences up to 12cm (5in) tall. The zygomorphic flowers are 10–16mm (⅜-⅝in) long with a short yellow-green spur and are composed of a two-lobed upper lip and three-lobed <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> They are white with one or sometimes three yellow markings on the <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> These can be variable in size and shape. The flowers are protogynous, meaning that the female stigmas mature before the male anthers, and are pollinated by flies.|$|E
25|$|The lingual frenum is also {{vulnerable}} to ulceration by repeated friction during oral sexual activity ("cunnilingus tongue"). Rarely, infants can ulcerate the tongue or <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> with the teeth, termed Riga-Fede disease.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{lips are}} falling {{position}} and are thick, but without printing or looseness or drooling. The nose and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> are tight {{and are not}} as they fall below the upper lips.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} includes bracts {{armed with}} centimeter-long spines and glandular, hairy white to pink-tinted flowers up to 2.5 centimeters long. Each flower has lobed, hooded upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> forming a deep cup.|$|R

25|$|As {{with almost}} all {{carnivorous}} plants, the flowers of butterworts are held {{far above the}} rest of the plant by a long stalk, {{in order to reduce the}} probability of trapping potential pollinators. The single, long-lasting flowers are zygomorphic, with two <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> petals characteristic of the bladderwort family, and a spur extending from the back of the flower. The calyx has five sepals, and the petals are arranged in a two-part <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> and a three-part upper lip. Most butterwort flowers are blue, violet or white, often suffused with a yellow, greenish or reddish tint. P. laueana and the newly described P. caryophyllacea are unique in having a strikingly red flowers. Butterworts are often cultivated and hybridized primarily for their flowers.|$|E
25|$|Hemifacial {{sensorimotor}} seizures {{are often}} entirely localised in the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> or {{spread to the}} ipsilateral hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of clonic contractions, usually lasting from {{a few seconds to}} a minute. Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly {{in the corner of the}} mouth.|$|E
50|$|Bats of {{the genus}} Chalinolobus are {{commonly}} known as pied, wattled, or long-tailed bats. They have fleshy lobes at the bottom edge of their ears and on their <b>lower</b> <b>lips.</b> The bats otherwise classified in the genus Glauconycteris are included in Chalinolobus by some zoologists.|$|R
50|$|The glandular {{inflorescence}} bears tubular purple flowers around 2 centimeters long. Unlike {{most other}} penstemon flowers which have wide open mouths, the flower's upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> come together, closing the mouth.

25|$|In ASL (American Sign Language), {{some signs}} have {{required}} facial components that distinguish them from other signs. An {{example of this}} sort of lexical distinction is the sign translated 'not yet', which requires that the tongue touch the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> and that the head rotate from side to side, in addition to the manual part of the sign. Without these features it would be interpreted as 'late'.|$|E
25|$|Centipedes have {{a rounded}} or {{flattened}} head, bearing {{a pair of}} antennae at the forward margin. They have a pair of elongated mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. The first pair of maxillae form the <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> and bear short palps. The first pair of limbs stretch forward from the body to cover {{the remainder of the}} mouth. These limbs, or maxillipeds, end in sharp claws and include venom glands that help the animal to kill or paralyze its prey.|$|E
25|$|When {{the entire}} platysma is in action it {{produces}} a slight wrinkling of {{the surface of the}} skin of the neck in an oblique direction. Its anterior portion, the thickest part of the muscle, depresses the lower jaw; it also serves to draw down the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> and angle of the mouth in the expression of melancholy, i.e. surprise or horror. However, the platysma plays only a minor role in depressing the lip which is primarily performed by the depressor anguli oris and the depressor labii inferioris by Dr. Hardy Franklin.|$|E
30|$|Difference in {{treatment}} modalities {{is one of}} the factors influencing the profile change. In one study, the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips</b> were more retrusive in the extraction group than in the non-extraction group [4].
