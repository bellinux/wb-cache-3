40|$|Software product lines, such as {{the process}} {{families}} addressed in the PESOA project require specific approaches for project management, because the development and usage of a software product line encompasses {{a number of different}} software development projects that build and evolve the product line infrastructure and that derive products from the infrastructure. In addition to these projects, there is also a strategic, long-term aspect to the management of software product lines that addresses the improvement of the product line engineering practices that aims at improving the maturity of the organisation developing a software product line. This report relates the different aspects of project management for product lines. Specifically, it describes the different parts of product line management, namely the product line strategy that aims at optimising the product line infrastructure, the product line maturity model that enables the assessment of a product <b>line</b> <b>organisation</b> with the goal of improving its maturity, and, finally, project planning that manages the different software development projects that build and evolve the product line infrastructure and that derive products from the infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the {{experiences with the}} introduction of a product line architecture in a multi business line environment within Philips Medical Systems. In this product line the reuse percentage is very high. The platform that implements the generic functionality covers a very substantial part (> 75 %) of the functionality of all derived systems. For this project an architecture was created that allows reuse of a software platform through binary extension. Technically this architecture relies heavily on standard technology like Windows-NT and Microsoft’s component object model (COM). Initially the product line introduction was organised according to the AFE/ASE/CSE models as described by Griss et al [4]. Furthermore a broad introduction was envisaged with the first release of the product line covering multiple products. Major organisational difficulties encountered with this model included: problematic decision structures in the multi-businessline context and subcritical ASE projects. The project was therefore finally reorganised to a reduced scope with less business lines involved. Our main conclusion is that for platform development in which such substantial parts are reused a single business <b>line</b> <b>organisation</b> seems the most adequate solution. Furthermore the Griss ASE/CSE organisational model is probably not very suited for this situation. ...|$|E

The case study shows several interesting results. The process of managing architectural changes {{as well as the}} information the architects maintain and update is surprisingly similar between the two companies, despite that one has a strong <b>line</b> <b>organisation</b> and the other a strong project organisation. The architecting process found does not differ from what can be seen in other business domains. What does differ is that the architects studied see themselves interacting much more with other stakeholders than architects in general. The actual architectures are based on similar technology, e. g. CAN, but the network topology, S/W deployment and interfaces are totally different. The results indicate how the company’s different core values influence the architects when defining and maintaining the architectures over time. One company maintains four similar architectures in parallel, each at a different stage in their respective life-cycle, while the other has a single architecture for all products since 2002. The organisational belonging of the architects in the former company has been turbulent in contrast to the latter and there is some speculation if this is correlated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: It is {{essential}} not to ignore {{that the world}} is continuously changing. Hence, it is vital that organisations also alter, and adopt new ways to manage this constant evolving environment in order not to fall behind competition. One way to achieve this is by executing efficient product development (PD) projects. However, there are studies today showing that a third of all PD projects performed nowadays fail. Aim: This research aims to explore how an MNC could increase the efficiency of their product development process through enhancing the project management activities. For this purpose, the research identifies the factors, and their attached issues, that constitute the knowledge areas within project management. Further, the research will also examine how these potential issues could be solved. Theory: There are three main theoretical frameworks used in this study: Project Management, Organisational Efficiency, and Product Development. Further, the purpose of these is to create the foundation for the discussion of the findings generated in this research. Method: The method used to perform this investigation is a case study executed at a Swedish MNC. Moreover, a qualitative approach was adopted and the data were collected mainly by conducting semi-structured interviews with case company employees. Results: The study disclosed that there are several issues connected to the project management practices. For example, the MNC has poor communication methods, the projects spend too much time on the process of bargain for resources from the <b>line</b> <b>organisation,</b> the top management strategies are not as well-defined as they need to be, which creates poorly defined project scopes and changes to the project scope. Besides, the MNC also {{spends a lot of time}} on their local request process. Conclusion: The main problem areas in a product development process with regards to project management are: Communication, Scope, Time, and Human Resource. Nevertheless, the study also reveals that there are methods on how to deal with these issues. One solution could be to implement a lean mindset into product development project management activities...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the management of planned change and development efforts in manufacturing environments. Two models for improving and sustaining operational performance (technical, economic and social) are presented: the discontinuous change model and the continuous improvement model. Six papers form {{the foundation for the}} thesis: two literature reviews and four empirical studies, of which two are case studies and two are survey-based investigations. Taken together, the studies provide an integrated picture of manufacturing development efforts, although the studies have focused on different aspects in each of the development models. It is shown that the often-cited concept of balancing technological, organisational and human aspects in manufacturing redesign projects must to be modified. Rather than striving for an 'absolute and simultaneous' balance, project management should be concerned with rebalancing the focus of a project. As the potential of the "current" problem/solution area diminishes, the design of the development effort must facilitate a search for additional problem definitions, as well as solutions, among other aspects. This rebalance is more likely in projects where human and organisational factors are upgraded via management's commitment to a policy of emphasising the importance of employee behaviour for manufacturing performance. The Continuous Improvement (CI) model is distinguished from discontinuous development efforts through its change logic (inductive learning vs. procedural planning), and through its relation to the ordinary work context (integrated vs. parallel). It is suggested that combining the procedural planning with the inductive learning logic requires an organisational form capable of integrating the development effort with the regular <b>line</b> <b>organisation.</b> The multifunctional work group is submitted as one such organisational form which should be taken into consideration when evaluating {{the pros and cons of}} team-based organisations. The survey-based observations of CI practices in Sweden revealed an indirect employee-involvement CI profile which is distinctly different from the Japanese kaizen original. The incidence of fewer detailed improvement activities in the Swedish CI experience is explained by the fact that CI is managed consciously as an integral part of a team-based organisation. In fact, this feature is essential if the necessary behaviour and motivation for a sustained CI process (where improvement is "part of the ordinary work") are to evolve. In addition, the enlargement of the role of department managers and functional specialists in order to support the CI process, and the upgrading of the importance of first-line managers is also essential for this development. It is further suggested that the multifunctional work group is a prime example of how an organisational design can be functionally equivalent to a quite different original (kaizen), provided it is adapted to its organisational context in terms of labour market, educational levels, industrial relations, incentive systems and motivational structure of the work itself...|$|E

40|$|Summary Today's {{economic}} systems are characterised by flexible specialisation {{driven by a}} growth of service-based firms, a servicification of manufacturing firms and projectification. There is therefore {{a growing number of}} matrix organisations being co-dependent on <b>line</b> <b>organisations</b> and projects. The study aims to advance theorising on such organisations by empirically studying the assumption that tensions act as drivers for managerial action in project organisations and that they constitute a foundation upon which theories may be built. The study shows that tensions are concerns in project organisations and that sources of tensions are primarily created by the co-existence of fundamentally different organising principles, the way employees identify themselves with either the line function or with projects and by competition for limited organisational resources. The study differentiates project-oriented organisations and project-based organisations from one another. The main contribution is to empirically study and validate Lundin and Söderholm's (1995) [Lundin, R. A., & Söderholm, A. (1995). A theory of the temporary organisation.
