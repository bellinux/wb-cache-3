5|$|A {{drawback}} {{of carrying}} WE.177 on external pylons was a limitation due to aerodynamic heating of the bomb's casing.

50|$|Under many circumstances, it is {{desirable}} <b>to</b> assign <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> series which fails to converge in the usual sense.

Summability methods include Cesàro summation, (C,k) summation, Abel summation, and Borel summation, in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the zero heat conductivity <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> contact discontinuity for the mono-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. The method {{is based on}} the relative entropy method, and do not assume any smallness conditions on the discontinuity, nor on the $BV$ norm of the initial data. It is proved that for any viscosity $\nu\geq 0 $, the solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system (with well prepared initial value) converges, when the heat conductivity $\kappa$ tends to zero, to the contact discontinuity solution to the corresponding Euler system. We obtain the decay rate $\kappa^{\frac 12 }$. It implies that the heat conductivity dominates the dissipation in the regime of the <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> contact discontinuity. This is the first result, based on the relative entropy, of <b>an</b> asymptotic <b>limit</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> discontinuous solutions for a system...|$|R

5|$|Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the Malay Archipelago was {{gradually}} {{taken over by}} the European colonial powers, beginning {{with the arrival of the}} Portuguese at Malacca in 1509. The early dominance of the Portuguese was challenged during the 17th century by the Dutch, who came to control most of the ports in the region. The Dutch established a monopoly over trade within the archipelago, particularly in spices, then the region's most important product. Other colonial powers, including the British, were <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> relatively minor presence.|$|E
5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both {{believed it}} necessary to expel the Germans from the captured positions.
