When the network operator is subject to a break-even regulation, the investment incentives are crowded out under legal and ownership unbundling whereas they remain nearly unchanged under vertical integration.

40|$|First {{published}} online on 8 September 2011. This paper {{addresses the}} effectiveness of auctions and <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> as regulatory measures to tender a vertically integrated industry more competitive. Specifically, I analyze if implementing auctions and <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> can counter market power in an industry where a Vertically Integrated Corporation (VIC) has a monopoly position in an essential, scarce upstream activity and also owns one of the firms active in the competitive downstream activity. In an earlier paper, Van Koten (2011), I showed that in this configuration the VIC, by having its downstream firm bid more aggressively, can—through increased auction revenue—increase its profit, while disadvantaging downstream competitors and lowering efficiency. Here I analyze the regulatory measure of also legally separating the downstream firm from the VIC. I show that such a measure may only be partially effective; the VIC can formulate a simple compensation scheme that does not violate restrictions typically imposed by legal separation but induces {{the manager of the}} VIC-owned downstream firm to bid more aggressively. This increases the profits of the VIC, decreases efficiency, and disadvantages downstream competitors...|$|E
40|$|The Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs has {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} currently implemented structure of <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> of the energy distribution industry by ownership unbundling. In this study we analyse {{the costs and benefits}} of this proposal. We compare the proposal�to the current situation and to two alternative options that strengthen <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling.</b> We identify four mutually-related categories of benefits: better performance of networks, more efficient regulation, improved effectiveness of competition, and benefits of privatisation; and three categories of costs: one-off transaction costs, loss of economies of scope and the risk of less investment in generation. The analysis highlights that the benefits depend on the future development in small-scale generation and on allocation of the management of transmission networks. Mainly because of the uncertainty about the future role of small-scale generation and the uncertainty about the magnitude of the one-off transaction costs related to cross-border leases, the net welfare effect of ownership unbundling at the distribution level is ambiguous. We identify an alternative route for achieving some of the benefits considered. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> vs {{ownership}} unbundling on the incentives of a network operator to invest and maintain its assets. We consider an industry where the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm 8 ̆ 5 rst chooses {{the size of a}} network, while several downstream rms then compete in selling goods and services that use this network as a necessary input. We contrast the (socially) optimal allocation with several equilibrium situations, depending on whether the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm owns zero, one or two downstream 8 ̆ 5 rms. The 8 ̆ 5 rst situation corresponds to ownership unbundling between upstream and downstream parts of the market. As for the other two cases, we equate <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> with the following two assumptions. First, each downstream 8 ̆ 5 rm maximizes its own pro 8 ̆ 5 t, without taking into account any impact on the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rms pro 8 ̆ 5 t. Second, the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm is not allowed to discriminate between downstream 8 ̆ 5 rms by charging di¤erent access charges for the use of its network. On the other hand, we assume that the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm chooses its network size in order to maximize its total pro 8 ̆ 5 t, including the pro 8 ̆ 5 t of its downstream subsidiaries. Our main results are as follows. Because the investment in the network is not protected, at the time at which it is made, by a contract, the upstream 8 ̆ 5 rm will {{not take into account the}} interests of its clients when choosing its size. This e¤ect can be mitigated by allowing it to own part of the downstream industry. In other words, ownership separation is more detrimental to welfare than <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling.</b> We also obtain that these results are robust to the introduction of asymmetry in network needs across downstream 8 ̆ 5 rms, imperfect downstream competition and downstream investments. ...|$|E

CTS introduces new difference models for CIM/XML-serialized topologies. 1 Interoperability in the energy utilities domain Various reasons result in a growing need for energy distribution companies to exchange data between them. One reason is the close coupling and the physical interdependencies between networks operated by different companies.

40|$|The {{literature}} on vertical integration in markets with regulated upstream prices {{suggests that the}} integrated upstream firm might engage in non-price discrimination. Several studies provide policy recommendations derived either from case study approaches or based on theoretical modeling which addresses the unbundling issue. In this study we analyze the impact of vertical integration of retail incumbent and network operator on retail prices and upstream charges. As the vertical structure is heterogeneous across the 850 German electricity submarkets for residential customers (there exist legally unbundled, vertically integrated or fully separated firms), we use firm level data to analyze the effects of different vertical structures and regulation schemes on retail electricity prices. We find significantly higher prices in markets with vertically integrated firms compared to markets with fully separated firms. This finding could indicate non-price discrimination. Furthermore, we find no evidence that <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> eliminates the incentives for non-price discrimination because the prices do not differ from prices in markets under vertical integration.

Polish energy and gas sector in space of few recent years underwent breakthrough changes as far as regulations, structure, organisation and ownership are concerned. Drivers of change included the necessity to align national regulations with EU standards through transposition, and creating entities strong enough to finance their own investment outlays. As a result of those changes, {{both private and public}} producers and providers can compete for customers whilst using the regulated network infrastructure. Through those changes regulatory bodies were established and some of the following measures were used: TPA rule, accounting unbundling, <b>legal</b> <b>unbundling</b> and functional unbundling, merger & acquisition supervision on the national and regional level, state aid programmes and a range of other instruments facilitating consumer access to competitive power purchase offers concerning energy and natural gas. However, electricity and gas markets still remain dominated by market incumbents plus the competition is still limited, particularly so in the natural gas market. Among barriers impeding development of Polish energy sector and liberalisation of electricity and gas markets are: vertical consolidation in the sector; wrong architecture of the wholesale market; unstable regulatory environment; maintaining retail prices for households regulated; low consumer activity in the energy market...|$|E
