50|$|Anti-siphoning laws in Australia {{regulate}} the media companies' access to significant sporting events. In 1992, {{when the country}} experienced growth in paid-subscription media, the Parliament of Australia enacted the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 that gave free-to-air broadcasters essentially first refusal to certain sporting event broadcasting rights. The anti-siphoning list {{is a list of}} events, the televising of which should, in the opinion of the relevant Minister, be available free to the general public. To effect this 'freedom', the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 includes a licence condition on pay TV providers that prohibits them from acquiring anti-siphoning events unless a national broadcaster or a network of commercial television broadcasters have the right to televise the events. This prohibition drops away a certain period before the event starts. The current anti-siphoning rules also prohibit national television broadcasters and commercial television broadcasters from premiering <b>listed</b> <b>events</b> on digital multi-channels. <b>Listed</b> <b>events</b> may be shown on digital multi-channels if they have already been broadcast, or are simultaneously broadcast on the broadcasters main (core/primary) channel.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the code come from the Broadcasting Act 1996. Although the Home Secretary, Kenneth Baker, had devised a list of events not {{permitted}} to be broadcast solely on pay-per-view (PPV) services in 1991, the Act required the ITC to create a permanent list of such events. In 1997, the initial list was drawn up, and was revised in 1999, where the code was divided into two categories, A and B. The code was further amended in 2000 to give the ITC responsibility over UK-based broadcasters wanting to transmit <b>listed</b> <b>events</b> in other countries.|$|E

50|$|Wragg's patient {{approach}} was richly rewarded with the both Island House and Swallow Flight, neither horse showing {{anything other than}} useful form until their four-year-old careers. Swallow Flight ended his three-year-old rated 104 having progressed through the handicap ranks and into Listed company, but the son of Bluebird excelled in his third season as a four-year-old, winning <b>Listed</b> <b>events</b> at Windsor and Goodwood, with a third-place finish in the Group 2 Queen Anne Stakes sandwiched between those two successes. He would repeat his Listed success at Windsor the following season and finally made the breakthrough at pattern level when winning the Group 2 Attheraces Mile at Sandown in April 2002. His last appearance on a racecourse would be in July of that year, turning in a lacklustre performance to come home last of four in Scottish Classic at Ayr. He went on to stand as a stallion, enjoying very minor success.|$|E
50|$|The anti-siphoning list {{came into}} effect in 2006. The {{relevant}} Minister {{has the power to}} add, amend or remove events from the list. Currently, only sporting events are listed, even though the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 does not limit the types of events that can be listed. There are currently ten sport types (e.g. Tennis, Soccer, Rugby League) on the anti-siphoning list plus the Olympic and Commonwealth Games. Events on the anti-siphoning list are delisted 12 weeks before they start to ensure pay TV broadcasters have reasonable access to <b>listed</b> <b>events,</b> if free-to-air broadcasters decide not to purchase the broadcast rights for a particular event. Any rights to listed sporting events that are not acquired by free-to-air broadcasters are available to pay TV. Before the end of 2009, the Federal Government conducted a review of the anti-siphoning scheme, with the Minister proposing changes to the scheme.These changes can not come into effect until amending legislation is passed through the Australian Parliament.|$|E
