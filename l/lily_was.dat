Later that year, a Louisville militia known as the Citizens' Guard was formed, and Buckner was made its captain.

5|$|Hurricane <b>Lily</b> <b>was</b> a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that devastated {{the city of}} Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming from an area of cloudiness associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building to peak intensity just before landfall northwest of Manzanillo, Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due to the limited warning, which was partially set back due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Horticulturally, water <b>lilies</b> have <b>been</b> hybridized for {{temperate}} gardens {{since the}} 19th century, and the hybrids {{are divided into}} three groups: hardy, night-blooming tropical, and day-blooming tropical water lilies.

25|$|The exact {{extent to}} which the secrecy and {{isolation}} of the wizarding world is maintained varies. Many references are made to the Ministry of Magic performing memory charms to preserve secrecy; however, some Muggles have necessary interactions with the wizarding world. Hermione’s parents are Muggles, but have been seen in Diagon Alley. They are fully aware that magic exists, but they forbade Hermione to use magic to fix her teeth (as dentists, they felt that this was cheating). The Dursleys are also aware of the Wizarding World; Petunia Dursley indicates that she learned of it when her sister, <b>Lily,</b> <b>was</b> accepted for Hogwarts. She shared this information with her husband, who is shown to be contemptuous of the wizarding world even before Harry shows up at their doorstep. There is no indication that Dudley was aware of this until Harry is told about Hogwarts.|$|E

500|$|Multiple storylines {{spanning}} {{the first two}} seasons were brought to a close in the two-part season finale, including {{the search for the}} demon Azazel and the existence of Azazel's psychic children. As many of the show's questions are answered in one long conversation by Azazel, series creator Eric Kripke and writer Sera Gamble had to rewrite the demon's speech multiple times because they felt that [...] "the payoff [...] never as good as the anticipation". Though {{it would have been easier}} for them to keep postponing the revelations, the writers believed they would get [...] "crushed under the anticipation" [...] because they would not be able to satisfy fans if they kept building up more expectations. As for the psychic children, the writers originally intended to continue their storyline into the third season, but ultimately killed them off after deciding that the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters. In the first version of the script, the character of <b>Lily</b> <b>was</b> two roles: a girl named Alex who could kill with a single touch, and a telepath named Lily. Believing they had too many characters, the writers combined Alex and Lily into one. Gamble had envisioned the episode as a [...] "psychic Breakfast Club", so the new Lily's motivation was that she was Ally Sheedy. The Acheri demon responsible for two of the psychic children's deaths was based on the Acheri from Hindu mythology; writer Sera Gamble felt that it being a [...] "diseased spirit" [...] that comes down from the mountains and [...] "kills everybody in the settlements" [...] fit in with the abandoned mountain-side town that the episode takes place in. Harvelle's Roadhouse—a saloon frequented by demon hunters—was dropped from the show in these episodes as well, as Kripke disliked the concept of having a fixed home for a road-based series. With the Roadhouse's destruction came the death of recurring character Ash, whom the writers had been phasing out during the season because they felt his [...] "comical" [...] and [...] "wacky" [...] personality was too unrealistic for the show.|$|E
