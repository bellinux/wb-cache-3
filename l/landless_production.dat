It is argued that investment in livestock raises farm production by extending the area of land utilised, diversifying productive activity for crop cultivators or intensifying production, and that changes from grassland-based systems to mixed farming systems and thence to <b>landless</b> <b>production</b> systems represent stages of increasing intensity. The author draws on New Institutional Economics concepts such as property rights, transaction costs and agency theory to provide insights into the institutions affecting livestock development. Thus, patterns of land tenure, intra-household rights and gender issues, credit provision, contractual arrangements, animal health services and their change over time are examined. The lack of circulating capital is recognized as a major constraint for smallholder livestock development. The development of world trade in livestock and livestock products is analysed. Despite expanding markets for livestock products the developing countries as a group have recently switched from being net exporters and become net importers of livestock products. Although patterns of trade depend on differences in comparative advantage between countries they are also influenced by trade regulations. Domestic producer protection by the European Union, the USA and Japan in particular is identified as destabilising world prices and imposing cheap priced competition on developing country producers. Nevertheless, the overall gains from trade liberalisation for developing countries are expected to be small. The paper concludes by stressing the need for increased investment in livestock production, given the rapidly growing demand for animal products and the important contribution of livestock to the incomes and welfare of the rural poor and outlines policy options that could be pursued by developing country governments as well as by the donor community.

40|$|Organic {{livestock}} farming {{is intended to}} contribute to the equilibrium of agricultural production systems; establish and maintaining an interdependence between soils, plants and animals; is land-related ruling out <b>landless</b> <b>productions,</b> and should support the development of a sustainable agriculture. The criteria for the evaluation of non-organic and organic feed inputs should be consistent with these principles of organic livestock production. This report provides an overview of issues to be considered with regard to the inclusion of criteria for non-organic and external feed materials in the further development of the EC-Regulation 2092 / 91 on organic food. The various implications of a criteria based approach are discussed in relation to the main objectives and principles in organic production. A system approach is recommended to provide a tool for balancing the divergent and ambivalent issues in relation to the inclusion of non-organic and external feed material on the different levels relevant in organic production...|$|R
40|$|Dairying {{has become}} an {{important}} secondary {{source of income for}} more than 15 million rural families and has assumed an important role in providing employment and income generating opportunity for the most vulnerable sections of our population. For millions of small and marginal farmers as well as <b>landless</b> labourers, milk <b>production</b> provides ready cash in hand for fulfilling their daily household requirements. According to 2012 livestock census data, Gujarat had 9984 thousand cattle and 10386 thousand buffalo population. The daily milk yield per animal in the state for Cow (Crossbreed), Cow (indigenous) and Buffalo is around 9. 08 kg/day, 4. 19 kg/day & 5. 15 kg/day respectively. The present study was conducted to evaluate the status of Medium Milk Producers in Gujarat state. The study covered all districts of the state and information was collected by using questionnaire. After analyzing the collected data it could be seen that there is enormous opportunity to develop indigenous cattle as it is more suitable to our environment. Further, it can be concluded that the major characteristics of Medium dairy farmers were- “Mixed Farming” is being practiced by significant number of respondents, irrigation facility and educational background of SSC to Post graduation. The main weakness observed was low milk yield lack of awareness of clean milk Production and Scientific Animal Husbandry practices...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 El Salvador's land {{resources}} are intensively cultivated. Labor is relatively abundant and wages are low. This study analyzed {{the effects of}} government policies and observed farm price distortions on enterprise/weed control system choices and associated income-employment effects. A regional linear programming framework was employed to analyze the effects of alternative government policies and observed farm prices on farm efficiency, employment, and income distribution within Central El Salvador. A major conclusion {{of the study was}} that the presence of price distortions and off-farm employment alternatives were not sufficient to induce changes in weed control technology on small and medium farms. The most efficient system both from an individual and social point of view was the use of manual weed control for all selected enterprises. The principal effects of price distortions on the small and medium farms (when compared with their undistorted price solutions) were the tendencies {{to reduce the number of}} selected enterprises and to modify the area allocated between enterprises. On the other hand, the process of capital-labor substitution on large farm appeared to be sensitive to direct and indirect government subsidies on capital when off-farm employment alternatives existed between 0 and 50 percent of total available labor supply. Herbicide-area diffusion ranged from 75 to 87 percent of total area on the large farm whenever the policy mix included direct or indirect capital subsidies. Comparisons of the alternative distorted price solutions using the undistorted price solutions revealed that whenever capital subsidies were present in any policy mix when off-farm employment opportunities were held at 50 percent of the available labor supply, total weed control employment levels were lower than the social price solution by 45 to 55 percent. The group most seriously affected by weed control employment reductions was the landless laborer. The group's weed control employment losses ranged from 73 to 89 percent below their social price-employment solution. The presence of capital subsidies in any policy mix under the 50 percent off-farm employment opportunity solutions induced relatively larger income gains (20 to 67 percent) to the three sizes of farms and income losses (3 to 13 percent) to the <b>landless</b> laborers. <b>Production</b> efficiency losses were relatively high in each of the three sizes of farms whenever capital subsidies were present. In view of these findings the El Salvador government should recognize a conflict between the use of direct and indirect capital subsidies particularly on herbicides and farm machinery and between stated national goals of increasing employment and improving income distribution. Fixing the wage rate at 3. 85 cents/day induced relative income gains that tend to favor the small farm and landless laborers... the least privileged and the biggest group in El Salvadors' total population. Output support induced equal relative income gains (19 percent) to the three sizes of farms. Maintaining subsidies on labor-using modern farm inputs (fertilizer, insecticides and improved seeds) would provide incentives for increasing grain production and intensify the widespread diffusion of these inputs into the basic grain sector of El Salvador...|$|R
