40|$|Most of the {{empirical}} {{literature on the}} informational role of options markets and the stock price response {{is based on a}} simple dichotomy of companies with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> versus companies without <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> with an implicit assumption that the benefits of options trading are homogenous across companies with <b>listed</b> <b>options.</b> However, when options trading volume is low, <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> may hardly have any impact on the underlying stock price and the company value in turn. This study was therefore taken up to investi-gate relationship between options trading volume and the valuation of underlying company. Using regression analysis between Tobin’s q, which captures company value and options trading volume, along with other control variables that could impinge upon company valuation, we find conclusive evidence that company valuation is significantly related to options trading volume. Therefore, investors and traders must remember that <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> must be supported by sufficient liquidity to offer any insights to future price trends...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} whether investors produce more information on firms that have <b>listed</b> stock <b>options</b> than on similar firms that do not have options and, if so, whether this additional information translates into a smaller stock-price reaction to releases of public information such as earnings announcements. After correcting for factors previously found to explain changes in two indicators of investor interest, analyst attention and institutional ownership, we find that firms with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> exhibit significantly higher average levels of each of these variables than firms without <b>listed</b> <b>options.</b> Prior results regarding this issue are limited and contradictory. We also find, contrary to previous research, that this additional information production does not lead to a smaller price reaction to earnings announcements.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented that {{the introduction of}} options seems to affect the volatility, liquidity, price and other characteristics of the underlying stock. Existing research, however, has not adequately accounted {{for the fact that}} <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> is endogenous, a result of decisions made by exchanges and regulators. We investigate the factors affecting the exchanges’ listing decisions by comparing the characteristics of stocks selected for <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> to other stocks that were eligible but not listed. We find that firm size, volume, and volatility are positively related to the probability of listing, but their relative contributions have changed significantly over time. We re-examine the <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> effects by using control samples of stocks that were eligible, and appeared to be good candidates for listing, but were not selected. Contrary to previous research, we find that in recent subperiods, volatility increases with <b>option</b> <b>listing,</b> consistent with the hypothesis that forward-looking exchanges <b>list</b> <b>options</b> in anticipation of increasing volatility. We verify previous findings that underlying volume increases with <b>option</b> <b>listing,</b> and that there was a positive price effect associated with <b>option</b> <b>listing</b> prior to 1981. However, evidence of a negative price effect after 1981 appears to be much weaker than previously reported. Finally, we document a cross- sectional relationship between the price effect, the volume effect and the volatility effect. <b>option</b> <b>listing,</b> derivatives, regulation, SEC...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} literature on <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume {{has focused on}} the benefits of trading in options to shareholders only, arguing that stock <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and subsequent trading volume improve the informational environment of equity market. While debt capital is a major part of firms’ capital structure, the cost of debt capital implications of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume has been overlooked in the literature. Again, the extant literature shows that much of the benefits that shareholders might receive from <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume stems from the informational advantage arising from increased trading by informed investors who possess private information in optioned firms compared to firms without <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> and increased activities of information intermediaries. This informational advantage should also benefit the lenders of the firms because <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume facilitate access to more and higher quality information and also increase stock liquidity. Therefore, informational advantage of optioned firms should allow lenders to better assess the risk of default and facilitate more effective monitoring of debt agreements, which in return, lowers the rates of returns demanded by the lenders. Further, this informational advantage of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and <b>options</b> trading may be far more beneficial to lenders of young firms than old firms because young firms have shorter credit history in the market, thus, exposing their lenders to higher information asymmetry costs. This suggests that lenders could consider the age of borrowing firms as a risk factor when reacting to the informational advantages from options trading and deciding on the rate of return they demand on their lending. To empirically examine the above conjectures, I use three proxies of cost of debt capital comprising credit rating, interest rate on debt, and offering yield spread on new bond issues. My thesis documents the following main findings. First, the results show that all the three proxies used for cost of debt capital are negatively and statistically significantly associated with <b>options</b> <b>listing.</b> Second, the results from further tests on a restricted sample of firm-year observations with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> show that all three proxies of cost of debt capital are negatively and statistically significantly associated with options trading volume. Third, the results of the analysis based on credit rating and interest rate proxies of cost of debt capital show that the reducing effect of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> on the cost of debt capital gradually subsides over time, as firms accumulate a credit history in the capital market. Finally, the results of the analysis based on a restricted sample of firm-year observations with <b>listed</b> <b>options</b> and all three proxies of cost of debt capital show that that the reducing effect of options trading volume on the cost of debt capital gradually diminishes over time. The above results remain robust in most of the additional and robustness tests. My thesis contributes to the stream of literature that examines the effect of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume on the cost of capital by providing empirical evidence on the decreasing effect of <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and <b>options</b> trading volume on the cost of debt capital. It also contributes to the extant literature on the determinants of the cost of debt capital by documenting that increased information quality stemming from <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume is priced by lenders, i. e., they demand lower rate of return. Also, my thesis improves our understanding of the moderating influence of firm’s age on the ex ante effect of information asymmetry and quality, proxied by <b>options</b> <b>listing</b> and trading volume, on the cost of debt capital. The findings of this thesis would inform firm managers that {{they may be able to}} access cheaper debt if they can influence options exchanges to select their firm for <b>options</b> <b>listing,</b> and also would be insightful for options exchanges so as to understand the critical implications their selection decisions may have in terms of influencing the firms’ cost of debt capital...|$|R
