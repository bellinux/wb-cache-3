The executor translates the reconfiguration into a script able to concretely apply the changes to the managed system. This script is passed to the <b>local</b> <b>executor</b> component. The latter uses the reconfiguration services to compute the resuming state, and when the system enters a quiescent state, applies the changes via the mapper component. The option of having a <b>local</b> <b>executor</b> component is due to AaaS being {{not aware of the}} internal state of the systems it manages. Thus, interrupted and resuming states have to be computed locally. This is also necessary because such states have to be computed in the instant before the changes are applied to the system, so that the managed system consistently resumes its production.|$|E

The architect has also to define a local mapper component that contributes a reflection model of the managed system. A <b>local</b> <b>executor</b> component, actually an AaaS off-the-shelf component, also needs to be attached to the system.|$|E

One example is robot navigation {{with a global}} path planner and a <b>local</b> <b>executor.</b> This paper examines whether a shift from optimizing the two typical modules in navigation towards a dynamic interaction of more, not necessarily hierarchically linked, modules leads to robust navigation behavior. We empirically evaluate different organizations of modules for navigation in a simulated household with a simulated PR 2 robot...|$|E

The value of social networks and social capital has shown to be a key resource for large parts of the internationalizing event firms’ operations on all levels, ranging from top management to <b>local</b> <b>executors.</b> Previous research has identified a gap in the event management literature regarding the managerial use of social capital and networks, and the literature on international event management is weak when it comes to smaller events. To address this current gap in the literature this study aims at making a theoretical contribution through an exploratory study on how an event firm utilizes social connections and networks as well as the social capital embedded within these. This research is conducted through a case study of a young internationalizing firm in the young “fun-run” industry, which has stretched out across the globe during the past two years. The result of our research has been an initial indication of how, and what types of, social networks and social capital are valuable at different levels within the international event industry. A general conclusion made in the paper is that social networks and social capital is highly important at all levels within the internationalizing event firm, however in what way differs between the levels. One of the major differences between the use of networks, found in this case study, is that stronger ties are more important at the international event firm’s lower hierarchical levels than at the top levels where weak ties show greater importance.
