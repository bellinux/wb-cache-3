5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept is that everyone should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible <b>litmus</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a <b>litmus</b> <b>test</b> <b>for</b> whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E

40|$|Among private lawyers {{trained in}} Western European or Western European-derived legal traditions there is broad {{consensus}} about the central features of law. This consensus crystallizes around {{the features that}} distinguish law from other normative systems (exogenous criteria of identification), and around the features that distinguish Western European law from other legal orders (endogenous criteria of identification). This paper presents alternatives to both orthodoxies: it adopts a legal pluralist conception of normativity itself, rejecting the tenets of monism, centralism, positivism and prescriptivism that together define conventional conceptions of law’s domain (law’s sites); and it adopts a legal pluralist conception of legal normativity in particular, rejecting both institutionalization and formalization as <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> identifying legal rules (law’s modes). As a ground for exploring the legal pluralist heresy we have chosen a central concept of private law – marriage. Consistently with critical legal pluralist methodology, which emphasizes heterogeneity, flux and dissonance in the normative lives of human agents and which is especially attuned to trajectories of internormativity, we organize this inquiry around (and in counterpoint to) the liturgical form of the Roman Catholic wedding ceremony. Ultimately what is heresy in one normative order may be apostasy in another; and what is apostasy in one may be revelation in a third. In a legal pluralist cosmology, eschatological questions are always present and must always be subject to attornment because they can themselves never be finally decided...|$|R

Unlike most recent Castlevania games, Ayami Kojima {{did not participate in}} the character designs for Dawn of Sorrow. Instead, the characters were drawn in a distinctive anime style. This was done due to influence from producer Koji Igarashi, who wanted to market the game to a younger audience. Aria of Sorrows sales figures did not meet expectations, and as a result, Igarashi consulted Konami's sales department. The staff concluded that the demographics of the Game Boy Advance did not line up with the series' target age group. Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to empirically examine the {{attitudinal}} founda-tions of "pro-life " people who support capital punishment. To abortion oppo-nents, the procedure represents he deliberate killing of human beings and should be a punishable criminal offense. According to death penalty sup-porters, the capital defendant deserves the ultimate punishment because he or she has destroyed innocent human life. Although these attitudes may seem contradictory to some, in that taking "human life " is condemned in one instance and supported in another, empirical analysis demonstrates that the desire for punishment is essential to understanding them. Individuals who express a strong commitment to punishment are more likely to oppose abortion and also to favor capital punishment. In the political arena, abortion and the death penalty have be-come <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> persons eeking public office. Pro-life advo-cates have been vocal for more than 25 years and have had an important impact on recent federal and state elections, especially in Republican contests (McKeegan 1992). The death penalty has been politically important since the 1988 presidential campaign, where angry lines were drawn between proponents and opponents of capi-tal punishment (Cook 1998; Jamieson 1992; Radelet and Pierce 1992). Perhaps even more curious is the political overlap between those who are pro-life when discussing abortion and pro-death when discussing capital punishment; some of this overlap, however, may be explained by attitudes toward punishment in general. The power to punish, to secure obedience to the law or moral order be means of punishment, is one of the most influential social forces for obtaining conformity in human societies (Garland 1990). Americans widely support the use of punishment (Ellison an...|$|R

40|$|Ante-bellum American utopias {{have been}} usually portrayed as {{isolated}} and exotic phenomena {{that had no}} impact upon society at large. This study proposes a look at communities from a different angle: their relation to the mainstream, especially to ante-bellum editors and correspondents. The study consists of 133 newspapers and magazines which were published during the early to late 18202 ̆ 7 s and the early to late 18402 ̆ 7 s. This sample represents {{a wide range of}} newspapers: small town and big city, sectarian and nonsectarian, partisan and independent, national and local, well known and obscure. It covers twenty-three states from across the country. ^ Four major communitarian groups were selected for the purpose of assessing their significance to American society: the Owenites, the Shakers, the Fourierites and the Mormons. Additionally, other smaller groups such as the Harmonists and Frances Wright 2 ̆ 7 s community are included in this work. ^ The study of the press reactions to these communities reveals how the existence of utopias helped middle-class writers to sort out their own confusion about American society and to elaborate their own vision of the American dream. On the other hand, the study reveals the very stringent limits of America 2 ̆ 7 s ideologies regarding opportunity, openness, innovation and reform. The different communities were <b>litmus</b> <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> the depth and sincerity of American attachments to ideals such as individualism, democracy and capitalism. Instead of tainting the communards as anti-individualist or anti-capitalist, the journalists made an attempt to assimilate the communitarians into their vision of a moral, orderly, religious and affluent society. Thus, the commentators evaded confronting the communalism of the groups and their radical religious callings. ^ For communities to be accepted by the media they had to be Bible-worshipping, apolitical, moral, family-oriented and, moreover, small, prosperous, well behaved, industrious and peaceful. If they deviated from these standards, the purpose of their existence was defeated and the journalists rejected them as enemies of the social order. At no point did the press suggest that middle-class Americans consider joining the utopian alternative. However, the writers advocated it as a haven for the poor and ill-adjusted. ...|$|R
