50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either riveted to the <b>lining</b> <b>table</b> or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the wheel cylinder is applied through the web to the <b>lining</b> <b>table</b> and brake lining. The edge of the <b>lining</b> <b>table</b> generally has three “V"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{genes for}} {{resistance}} to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), were transferred individually by backcrossing and selfing into 2 ̆ 7 Newton 2 ̆ 7 (Cl 17715) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a commercial hard red winter cultivar susceptible to all Hessian fly biotypes {{to which it}} has been tested. The eight germplasm <b>lines</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) were developed by the Purdue University Agricultural Experiment Station {{in cooperation with the}} USDAARS, with release in 1993. Newton {{is the source of the}} cytoplasm of the germplasm lines. Newton has a moderate level of winterhardiness suitable for commercial production in Kansas. The germplasm lines have not been tested adequately for level of winterhardiness, but survived two winters during seed increase at Lafayette, IN. The resistance source parental <b>lines</b> (<b>Table</b> 1) include the cultivars 2 ̆ 7 Lamed 2 ̆ 7 (Cl 17650), 2 ̆ 7 Arthur 712 ̆ 7 (Cl 15282), 2 ̆ 7 Knox 622 ̆ 7 (Cl 13701), and 2 ̆ 7 Luso 2 ̆ 7; the germplasm line Ella (Cl 17938); and Purdue University-developed lines IN 76529 and IN 916.
