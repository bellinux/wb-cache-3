5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled and began {{weakening}} {{to the southeast}} of Bermuda on September15, spawning a low-pressure area by September18. A stationary wind circulation developed around the <b>low</b> <b>by</b> September19, aided by a trough aloft to its west. Convection developed into narrow banding features far from the center, and the overall structure gradually consolidated. It is estimated that the system developed into a subtropical depression late on September20, about 490miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical {{because of the large}} distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on September21, and as such was named Kyle by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A {{large and}} {{convective}} tropical wave moved off the western coast of Africa in late August, developing into a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on August30 about 1,035mi (1,665km) {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles. Satellite imagery and data from a research aircraft indicated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fiona six hours later. Directed by an expansive mid-level ridge to its north, the cyclone moved west-northwest for several days, attaining peak winds of 65mph (100km/h) by 18:00UTC on September1 as it passed close to the northern Leeward Islands. Fiona's position between the mid-level ridge and the large circulation of Hurricane Earl off The Carolinas turned the storm northwest and then north as it encountered increasingly strong wind shear and began to weaken. Expansive outflow from Earl caused Fiona's low-level circulation to become dislocated from its convection, and the system degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 00:00UTC on September4. The remnant low passed near Bermuda, producing light winds and about 0.78in (19.8mm) of rainfall, before dissipating the next day.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would become an increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap in the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on August27 {{and reached the}} eastern Pacific on September7. Tracking westward, little development occurred until September18, when associated shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase. Following visible satellite trends, the National Hurricane Center deemed the disturbance organized enough to be declared a tropical depression at 0600UTC on September19, while located about 1,200mi (1930km) west-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. In an environment of cool ocean temperatures and stable air, the depression failed to organize as it turned west-northwest. Associated deep convection dissipated, leading to degeneration into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 0000UTC on September20. Performing a slow counter-clockwise loop, the remnant low dissipated five days later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on July10. Once {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, convective growth {{and the development of}} a well-defined surface low led to the formation of a tropical depression just south of Acklins Island by 06:00UTC on July22. Amid a brief reprieve in strong upper-level winds, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it crossed Ragged Island around 23:15UTC that day. It later traversed Andros Island at peak intensity, with sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), and weakened slightly before moving ashore near Elliott Key, Florida, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on July23. Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed South Florida, and the persistent effects of strong wind shear prevented intensification in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 00:00UTC on July25 and later moved into southeastern Louisiana before dissipating later that day.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on June24, eventually emerging into the Gulf of Mexico on July7. An {{area of low pressure}} became discernible, and {{with data from}} a reconnaissance aircraft, the system was upgraded to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on July8. The depression failed to organize appreciably as it tracked west to west-northwest, moving ashore South Padre Island, Texas with winds of 35mph (55km/h) by 14:00UTC that day. The depression degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 06:00UTC on July9 and dissipated over northern Mexico a day later.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16.

The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September11 {{and almost immediately}} {{led to the formation}} of a tropical depression by 06:00UTC the next day. Steered in a traditional west-northwest fashion, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Julia twelve hours later and continued steady strengthening to become a hurricane by 12:00UTC September14. As a reminder of limited hurricane intensity forecasting skill, the system began a period of rapid intensification thereafter, attaining peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) by 12:00UTC on September15. Julia became the easternmost Category4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic as a result. After peak, the system recurved around a ridge while simultaneously weakening under influence of Hurricane Igor's outflow. It fell back to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on September18 and degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 18:00UTC on September20 while located about 1,095mi (1,760km) west of the Azores.

5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather {{within a}} persistent, broad trough across the southwestern Caribbean organized into the nineteenth tropical {{depression of the}} season by 06:00UTC on October20 about 195mi (315km) north of Cabo Gracias a Dios. The depression was slow to organize at first, affected by dry air and moderate shear from a trough over the Southeast United States and western Atlantic, but eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Richard by 12:00UTC on October21 as it curved south and then west. Upper-level winds slackened over subsequent days, allowing the cyclone to attain hurricane intensity early on October24 and reach peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) by 00:00UTC the next day. Richard moved ashore near Gales Point, Belize, thirty minutes later. The system weakened rapidly once inland, degenerating into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>by</b> 00:00UTC on October26. Despite emerging over the Bay of Campeche, high wind shear prevented redevelopment and instead caused the feature to dissipate eighteen hours later.|$|E
5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, {{and close to}} the city of Ichchapuram.

After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant <b>low,</b> <b>by</b> which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal.
