40|$|In {{research}} of <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelling</b> engine, often used method of fuel consumption measurement is weighing of fuel tank. This method is not proper for <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> with fuel pump {{located in the}} tank. When LPG pump is working are generated vibration that introduce significant disturbance of fuel tank mass measurement. For test bed {{research of}} liquid <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelling</b> engine with sequential injection system (system of V generation), measurement of fuel consumption is very difficult because there are fuel vaporization problems in the fuel pipes, too. This paper presents LPG measurement system, with two of mass flow meters in differential configuration, proposed by authors. This system allow for accurate measurement of LPG fuel consumption. The described system was used for MD- 111 E engine in test bench research. This engine was fuelling with liquid phase sequential injection system into the suction manifold. Significant problem in the liquid phase injection system is the measuring of fuel consumption. This required of LPG pump installed of the proper rate of delivery to reduce vaporization of fuel.

40|$|The fine {{particle}} size distribution characteristics obtained from a diesel taxi, a diesel light bus, a gasoline private car and a liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> <b>fuelled</b> taxi were carried out on a chassis dynamometer system. The measurements were performed at different driving modes, i. e., with low and high idling and from 10 km· h - 1 to 70 km· h - 1, 4 cruise operations using the instrument SMPS for collecting particles of 0. 015 ∼ 0. 7 μm diameter in range. It was found that different fuelled vehicles and different driving modes characterize considerable differences in size number and mass concentration distributions. Diesel vehicles contribute much more nuclei and accumulation mode particles of 30 ∼ 150 nm, while <b>LPG</b> and gasoline <b>fuelled</b> vehicles exhaust much more nuclei mode particles of 15 ∼ 30 nm. Overall, diesel-fuelled vehicles exhaust much more particles number and mass than gasoline and <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelled</b> vehicles; In the present study, diesel vehicles exhaust the ranges of total SMPS particle number, mass concentration with (0. 3 ∼ 3. 6) × 10 8 number ·cm - 3, 0. 03 ∼ 0. 6 μ·cm - 3 respectively, and gasoline and <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelled</b> vehicles exhaust 2. 3 × 10 4 ∼ 1. 2 × 10 7 number·cm - 3, 8 × 10 - 5 ∼ 0. 1 μg·cm - 3; 8. 2 × 10 3 ∼ 8. 8 × 10 6 number·cm - 3, 1. 7 × 10 - 5 ∼ 0. 09 μg·cm - 3, respectively; For all types of vehicles, the particle number and mass concentrations are small at low-idle and low-speed-driving modes, and are large at high-idle and high-speed-driving modes.

40|$|Abstract. The severe {{legislation}} regarding {{pollution from}} actual time determine {{us to find}} new alternative solutions for diesel engine fuelling. This paper objective {{is the use of}} LPG as alternative fuel at a diesel engine in the purpose of pollutant emissions level decreasing in general and especially of NOx and smoke emissions. Is difficult to use LPG as single fuel at the diesel engine because it has an high auto ignition endurance (CN =- 3). There are many fuelling methods of the diesel engine with LPG, but the authors of this paper used the diesel-gas method. The research followed the establishment of the optimal LPG cyclic dose and the diesel engine adjustments for different engine operating regimens. The paper presents results of some theoretical and experimental investigations of the <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelled</b> diesel engine. Three substitute ratios of diesel fuel with LPG were taken into account for full load and 2000 rpm engine speed. Thus, the NOx emissions decreased with 20 - 28 % for different substitute ratios of diesel fuel with LPG. The smoke emission decreased with 35 - 47 % for the same substitute ratios. <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelling</b> represents a very good solution for a cleaner environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{is based on}} development of a small compact Low Pressure Dimethyl Ether (DME) <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> with the scope of one day being retrofitted to a diesel Light Duty Vehicle (LDV). The development of the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> is discussed along with the engine injector haracteristics, the energy release, and the NOx emissions. The recorded data was compared to a previous DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> and conventional diesel results. The report discusses in detail the complete design phase of the Low Pressure DME system, with emphasis on the delivery pressure and portability of the system. The testing phase was run using a 1330 cc PH 2 Lister Petter diesel engine, with the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> connected to the inlet of the original diesel injector fuel pumps. Three individual tests were run, ranging from 1100 rpm to 1800 rpm, at loads of 25 Nm, 35 Nm and 45 Nm. Engine performance and emission data were recorded for each case, with emphasis placed on the fuel injector line pressure. The results obtained indicated that the bulk modulus of the fuel {{played an important role}} when it came to fuel injector performance. Injector timing was also identified as having a significant effect. The energy released, while running on the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system,</b> clearly indicated that the maximum peak occurred well after top dead centre, this in turn influenced the cylinder pressure which ultimately reduced the usable power. From the NOx emissions it was seen that running the engine on DME, the concentration levels started off high for low engine speeds and rapidly tapered down as the speed increased. The Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> produced the lowest NOx concentration levels for high engine speeds and especially high engine loads. As a whole the Low Pressure DME <b>fuelling</b> <b>system</b> produced satisfactory results and showed definite potential for future development...|$|R

40|$|The use of LPG as {{fuel for}} spark {{ignition}} engines {{originally designed to}} be petrol fuelled is common practice in many countries. Despite some theoretical and technical advantages related to <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelling</b> of internal combustion engines, the driving force for the ever-increasing adoption of LPG as fuel for passengers cars still remains its low price. However, money saving for the end-user is falling down year after year enforcing both technical developments and scientific research. Following some previous experimental studies about the real performance of dual-fuel engines during LPG operation, the present paper deals with the two main problems related to LPG port-fuel SI engines: the volumetric efficiency drop and the LPG evaporator device performance. A passengers car SI engine equipped with a “third generation” kit for the dual-fuel operation was tested at the dynamometer. Measures of engine performance, volumetric efficiency and change of LPG thermodynamic states in the evaporator were acquired both in steady state and transient operation of the engine.

40|$|Abstract: Particulate {{emissions}} from 11 gasoline powered and 2 liquefied petroleum (LPG) powered passenger vehicles were characterised during the Accelerated Simulation Mode driving cycles on a chassis dynamometer. The test fleet consisted of 10 catalyst-equipped vehicles operated with unleaded gasoline (5 Ford Falcons and 5 Holden Commodores), 2 LPG powered vehicles (both Ford Falcons), and 1 older type noncatalyst vehicle operated with leaded gasoline. Particulate characterisation included determination of total particulate number concentration and size distribution using the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS). The average particle number {{concentrations in the}} SMPS range for all modes was lower for Ford Falcons and somewhat higher for Commodores, with values of 1. 5 x 104 and 4. 1 x 104 cm- 3, respectively. This difference is significant and was observed for all modes. The number concentration levels were higher for the <b>LPG</b> <b>fuelled</b> cars (8. 4 x 104 cm- 3) and for the leaded gasoline powered vehicle (7. 9 x 105 cm- 3).

The system is marketed under the commercial name d-gid.

In order to assess its environmental and cost effectiveness the system was tested on a Volvo city bus. The tests were performed on an HDV chassis dyno under various driving conditions. Fuels used were EN 590 diesel fuel and EN 589 LPG. Regulated pollutant emissions were measured including CO 2, CO. THC, CH 4, non methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), PM, NOx and Particle Number. Diesel fuel flow was also recorded. Vehicle simulation was performed using the PHEM simulation software to simulate more realistic operation. Results indicated small differences in exhaust emissions. Benefits were observed for PM and the emission levels of non methane hydrocarbons were increased. Minor reductions (up to 2 %) were observed for CO 2.
