However, more than a century after the pioneering work of Darwin, little is known on the sensing mechanism. Using a centrifugal device combined with growth kinematics imaging, we show that shoot gravitropic responses to steady levels of gravity in four representative angiosperm species is independent of gravity intensity. All gravitropic responses tested are dependent only on the angle of inclination from the direction of gravity. We thus demonstrate that shoot gravitropism is stimulated by sensing inclination not gravitational force or acceleration as previously believed. This contrasts with the otolith system in the internal ear of vertebrates and explains the robustness of the control of growth direction by plants despite perturbations like wind shaking.

Aims To investigate the relationship between shift work and sickness absence while controlling for organ-izational and individual characteristics and shift work attributes that have confounded previous research. Methods The study used archive data collected from three national surveys in Canada, each involving over 20 000 employees and 6000 private-sector firms in 14 different occupational groups. The employees reported the number of paid sickness absence days in the past 12  months. Data were analysed using both chi-squared statistics and hierarchical regressions. Results Contrary to previous research, shift workers took less paid sickness absence than day workers. There were no differences in the length of the sickness absence between both groups or in sickness absence taken by female and male workers whether working days or shifts. Only job tenure, the presence of a union in the workplace and working rotating shifts predicted sickness absence in shift workers. The results were consistent across all three samples. Conclusions In general, shift work {{does not seem to be}} linked to increased sickness absence. However, such asso...|$|R

Supporters of this approach deem those external relationships more important that the internal ones. This definition entices a relation of dependence between the organization and the factors that surround it.

In this study we developed two experimental tasks, which are physically identical, to analyze whether substance-dependent individuals are impaired in shifting response patterns (stimulus response links) or preferences (stimulus outcome links). To increase the specificity of the dependent variable, we also used two control tasks to analyze for unspecific performance deficits. We included 35 young subjects with polysubstance abuse (International Classification of Diseases, F 19. 2 ICD 10 diagnosis, mean age of 22 years, maximum age 27 years) and 18 normal controls, but for a first step focused on only 22 patients and 15 age-matched controls, because we excluded all patients with an IQ below 100.

With these kinds of interfaces, {{it can be difficult}} to understand how individual pieces relates to each other and maintain a sense of place amongst the network being perused. To address this, I develop a focus+context browsing tool that uses a monadic approach to visualizing networks of semantic information in the form of metadata summaries. Focus+context visualizations present both the full detail of an object and the contextual information needed to relate that object to the entirety. The monadic approach, first suggested by sociologist Gabriel Tarde, is the idea that a network is best comprehended from the perspective of individual elements. This stands in opposition to the standard approach of viewing the entirety of the network at once. Semantic information, such as product specs and bibliography, provides essential and valuable contexts for people to make sense of information, assess values, and make decisions. I present a study, in which participants explored networks of academic publications, showed that a monadic metadata visualization helps users explore networked information, understand relationships, and maintain focus, when compared with traditional methods. Allowing the user to traverse the network laterally while using metadata to provide a summary of the focus node serves to maximize the amount of focus and context available to the user...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bernard Manin’s {{horizontal}} and Andrew Kuper’s vertical models of citizenship exemplify two prominent understandings of citizenship that incorporate {{access to and}} mediation of information. By bringing information’s role in citizenship into focus, both models imply that citizens must be information literate in order to practice good citizenship. Without such literacy, citizens are limited {{in their ability to}} engage in informed democratic participation. The difference between the models, however, changes the required nature of citizens’ information literacy. The 2003, 2005, and 2014 declarations on information literacy provide the guiding framework for international recommendations. Each links information literacy with good citizenship. Yet with each new statement, the rhetoric surrounding this <b>link</b> <b>shifts</b> in noticeable ways. Methods: The poster maps the rhetoric of the three international statements on information literacy and a UNESCO information literacy primer onto Manin’s and Kuper’s models.

Discussion 2 ̆ 6 Conclusion: The comparison indicates a pattern of the horizontal model’s displacement by the vertical model in information literacy rhetoric. This previously unexamined pattern raises further questions about the connections between citizenship and information literacy and about the nature of information literacy itself.

40|$|CONTEXT: Although the {{metabolic}} {{health effects of}} shift work have been extensively studied, a systematic synthesis of the available research is lacking. This review aimed to systematically summarize the available evidence of longitudinal studies <b>linking</b> <b>shift</b> work with metabolic risk factors. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic literature search was performed in 2015. Studies were included if (1) they had a longitudinal design; (2) shift work was studied as the exposure; and (3) the outcome involved a metabolic risk factor, including anthropometric, blood glucose, blood lipid, or blood pressure measures. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eligible studies were assessed for their methodologic quality in 2015. A best-evidence synthesis was used to draw conclusions per outcome. Thirty-nine articles describing 22 studies were included. Strong evidence was found for a relation between shift work and increased body weight/BMI, risk for overweight, and impaired glucose tolerance. For the remaining outcomes, there was insufficient evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Shift work seems {{to be associated with}} body weight gain, risk for overweight, and impaired glucose tolerance. Overall, lack of high-methodologic quality studies and inconsistency in findings led to insufficient evidence in assessing the relation between shift work and other metabolic risk factors. To strengthen the evidence, more high-quality longitudinal studies that provide more information on the shift work schedule (e. g., frequency of night shifts, duration in years) are needed. Further, research to the (mediating) role of lifestyle behaviors in the health effects of shift work is recommended, as this may offer potential for preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|Light {{detection}} {{not only}} {{forms the basis}} of vision (via visual retinal photoreceptors), but can also occur {{in other parts of}} the body, including many non-rod/non-cone ocular cells, the pineal complex, the deep brain, and the skin. Indeed, many of the photopigments (an opsin linked to a light-sensitive 11 -cis retinal chromophore) that mediate color vision in the eyes of vertebrates are also present in the skin of animals such as reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans and fishes (with related photoreceptive molecules present in cephalopods), providing a localized mechanism for light detection across the surface of the body. This form of non-visual photosensitivity may be particularly important for animals that can change their coloration by altering the dispersion of pigments within the chromatophores (pigment containing cells) of the skin. Thus, skin coloration may be directly color matched or tuned to both the luminance and spectral properties of the local background environment, thereby facilitating behavioral functions such as camouflage, thermoregulation, and social signaling. This review examines the diversity and sensitivity of opsin-based photopigments present in the skin and considers their putative functional roles in mediating animal behavior. Furthermore, it discusses the potential underlying biochemical and molecular pathways that <b>link</b> <b>shifts</b> in environmental light to both photopigment expression and chromatophore photoresponses. Although photoreception that occurs independently of image formation remains poorly understood, this review highlights the important role of non-visual light detection in facilitating the multiple functions of animal coloration...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAlthough {{epidemiological}} studies in shift workers and flight attendants have associated chronic circadian rhythm disturbance (CRD) with increased breast cancer risk, causal {{evidence for this}} association is lacking [1, 2]. Several scenarios have been proposed {{to contribute to the}} shift work-cancer connection: (1)  internal desynchronization, (2) light at night (resulting in melatonin suppression), (3) sleep disruption, (4)  lifestyle disturbances, and (5) decreased vitamin D levels due to lack of sunlight [3]. The confounders inherent in human field studies are less problematic in animal studies, which are therefore a good approach to assess the causal relation between circadian disturbance and cancer. However, the experimental conditions of many of these animal studies were far from the reality of human shift workers. For example, some involved xenografts (addressing tumor growth rather than cancer initiation and/or progression) [4, 5], chemically induced tumor models [6, 7], or continuous bright light exposure, which can lead to suppression of circadian rhythmicity [8, 9]. Here, we have exposed breast cancer-prone p 53 R 270 H©/+ WAPCre conditional mutant mice (in a FVB genetic background) to chronic CRD by subjecting them to a weekly alternating light-dark (LD) cycle throughout their life. Animals exposed to the weekly LD inversions showed a decrease in tumor suppression. In addition, these animals showed an increase in body weight. Importantly, this study provides the first experimental proof that CRD increases breast cancer development. Finally, our data suggest internal desynchronization and sleep disturbance as mechanisms <b>linking</b> <b>shift</b> work with cancer development and obesity...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{approaches have}} <b>linked</b> <b>shifts</b> in firms' internal funds and investment spending, holding constant underlying investment opportunities. An important impediment to convincing tests {{of these models}} {{is the lack of}} firm-level data on the relative costs of internal and external funds. We use a tax experiment, the Surtax on Undistributed Profits (SUP) in the 1930 s, to identify firms' relative cost of internal and external funds and analyze its effect on firms' investment decisions. Finns' responses to the surtax on retained earnings permit estimation of shadow price differentials between internal and external finance, and measurement of the link between access to capital markets and investment. Almost one-fourth of the 273 publicly-traded manufacturing firms in our sample retained in excess of 40 percent of their earnings in spite of the surtax, paying the highest marginal rates of surtax. The investment spending of these firms was sensitive to shifts in cash flow, holding constant investment opportunities (measured by the ratio of market-to-book value). No sensitivity of investment to internal funds could be detected for firms with higher dividend payout and lower surtax liability. In addition, many firms with high marginal rates of surtax were in the growth industries of the day. The sensitivity of investment spending to internal funds for firms with high marginal surtax rates appears mainly to reflect information-related capital-market frictions as opposed to the waste of corporate cash flows by entrenched managers. ...|$|R

However, evidence <b>linking</b> <b>shift</b> work and other circadian disruption factors to prostate cancer risk is limited. PurposeTo examine associations of work schedule (i. e., rotating shift work, fixed night and fixed afternoon/evening shift work); sleep duration; and insomnia frequency with prostate cancer mortality. MethodsThe Cancer Prevention Study–II is a large prospective cohort study of U. S. adults. Work schedule, sleep duration, insomnia frequency, and other information was self-reported in 1982. Among 305, 057 employed men, aged ≥ 29 years who were cancer free at baseline, there were 4974 prostate cancer deaths during follow-up through 2010. In 2013, multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95 % CIs were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression. ResultsWork schedule and insomnia frequency were not associated with risk of fatal prostate cancer. Short sleep duration was associated with higher risk of prostate cancer during the first 8 years of follow-up, compared to 7 hours/night, the RRs (95 % CIs) for 3 – 5 and 6 hours/night were 1. 64 (1. 06, 2. 54), and 1. 28 (0. 98, 1. 67), respectively. There was no association between sleep duration and fatal prostate cancer during later follow-up.
