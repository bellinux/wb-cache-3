2500|$|Although other {{technologies}} for coal gasification currently exist, all employ, in general, the same chemical processes. For <b>low-grade</b> <b>coals</b> (i.e., [...] "brown coals") which contain {{significant amounts of}} water, there are technologies in which no steam is required during the reaction, with coal (carbon) and oxygen being the only reactants. As well, some coal gasification technologies do not require high pressures. Some utilize pulverized coal as fuel while others work with relatively large fractions of coal.

2500|$|Locomotive numbers 92165-92167 {{were built}} with a {{mechanical}} stoker, {{which was a}} helical screw that conveyed coal from the tender to the firebox, {{where it would be}} directed to the required part of the [...] by high-pressure steam jets controlled by the fireman. The stoker made higher steaming rates possible, and it was hoped that mechanical stoking might enable the burning of <b>low-grade</b> <b>coal.</b> It was relatively inefficient, and the locomotives used in this trial were rebuilt to the normal configuration. Simply supplying more low grade coal than a fireman could do by hand did not provide efficient burning. Trials found that the maximum coal delivery rate of the mechanical stoker was slightly faster than firing by hand, and it could maintain that maximum {{for hours at a time}} when a fireman would tire. However this was of little practical benefit in actual service as even a long-distance freight train would frequently stop to allow faster trains to pass or would be held at signals. For the short periods when maximum firing rate was needed a skilled fireman was more than sufficient. The success of mechanical stoker on North American railroads was mainly because the locomotives were significantly larger (with a suitably greater demand for coal) and many routes required hours of supplying coal at a rate beyond the physical limit of a single fireman.|$|E

40|$|The coals are {{the main}} and {{dominant}} energy resource in FYROM. The mineral and inorganic chemical composition of two types of samples have been studied from the Oslomej, Bitola and Berovo lignite coals and their products generated from the Oslomej and Bitola thermo-electric power stations (TEPSs). They include <b>low-grade</b> <b>coals</b> (coals for TEPS) and solid wastes (flyashesandbottomashes).

The phase composition of waste products is represented by glass, quartz, albite, magnetite, gypsum. The concentration and behaviour of 43 elements have been also tested. All of the ash-forming elements (Si, Al, Mg, K, Ca, Fe, C, P, S, Ti, and Mn) are present in varying concentrations in the lignites and waste products. The trace elements enriched in coals (Mo, Sc, Pb, Cr, Y, Zr, Ti, Zn, and V) and waste products (Nb, Mn, Sb, Hg, Y, and Cd) normally have low over Clarke values.

40|$|The South African {{economy is}} {{strongly}} based on coal as a mined resource, and various grades of coal are supplied to {{local and international}} customers. However, the environmental impacts associated with the preparation and production of different coal grades from Run of Mine (RoM) or raw coal are variable; specifically, the different mining methods used for coal extraction – opencast or underground mining – have different environmental impacts. The entire life cycles of the grades of coal must therefore be evaluated in order to compare environmental performances with supplied economic values. In this paper, a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology, based on the ISO 14040 standard, is applied for this purpose. Four cases are considered in South Africa: typical high-grade and <b>low-grade</b> <b>coals</b> from opencast and underground mines...|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the second}} batch of 5th Class {{locomotives}} which were to be delivered a year later in 1891, it had a short smokebox on which the chimney {{was so close to}} the front of the smokebox that the headlight had to be mounted on a platform, attached {{to the front of the}} smokebox. The smokeboxes were later extended to suit South Africa's <b>low-grade</b> <b>coal</b> and to make room for wire-netting spark arresters.|$|E

50|$|On the Eastern System, {{problems}} were experienced with the <b>low-grade</b> local <b>coal</b> from the Cyphergat and Molteno collieries in the Stormberg.

50|$|Another {{modification}} involved {{modifying the}} boiler and frame to accommodate oscillating firebars {{and a larger}} firebox to overcome {{the problems associated with}} the <b>low-grade</b> local <b>coal</b> from the Cyphergat collieries. Mechanical firegrate shaking was accomplished by means of a collar on the leading coupled axle which could be engaged by a roller with eccentrically mounted connecting rods to the oscillating firebars.

50|$|Although the {{production}} {{was to be}} American, the locomotive was designed by Russian engineers. This called for 10 drive wheels, a low axle loading, a large firebox to burn <b>low-grade</b> <b>coal,</b> and an overall similar design to the class Э class 0-10-0. Because {{the weight of the}} boiler, particularly the firebox, caused the axle load on some axles to exceed 16 tonnes, it was decided to add a lead pony truck, thus turning it into a 2-10-0. This also allowed a slightly bigger boiler whilst keeping the axle loadings within acceptable limits.|$|E

40|$|Circulating {{fluidised}} bed combustion (CFBC) is receiving wide research attention in view its potential {{as an economic}} and environmentally acceptable technology for burning <b>low-grade</b> <b>coals,</b> biomass and organic wastes, and thereby mixtures of them. Designs of the existing {{fluidised bed}} boilers for biomass combustion are mainly based on experience from coal combustion because the mechanism of combustion of biomass in fluidised beds is still not well understood. A good understanding of the combustion and pollutant formation processes and the modelling of the combustor can greatly avoid costly upsets of the plants. In this paper the performance of CFBC burning coal and biomass mixtures was analysed. Experimental results {{were obtained from the}} combustion of two kind of coals with a 2 forest residue (Pine bark) in two CFB pilot plants (0. 1 and 0. 3 MWth). The effect of the main operating conditions on carbon combustion efficiency was analysed. Moreover, a mathematical model to predict the behaviour of the co-combustion of coal and biomass wastes in CFB boilers has been developed and validated. The developed model can predict the different gas concentrations along the riser (O 2, CO, CH 4, etc.), and the carbon combustion efficiency. The experimental results of carbon combustion efficiencies were compared with those predicted by the model and a good correlation was found for all the conditions used...|$|R

50|$|The {{power station}} {{consisted}} of two 30-megawatt (MW) generation units for a peak rating of 57 MWe. It was commissioned in 1965 for the then South of Scotland Electricity Board.

Optimum semi-fused leaching conditions and effects of different types of salts were investigated. Magnesia and Sorel cement, NaCl, MgCl 2 and KCl were also used as desulfurizing salt agent. Use of Sorel cement (3 MgO. MgCl 2) - caustic mixture in coal desulfurization were distinctly investigated and discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide useful coal-petrographic data, which will further help the characterization, exploitation, and {{utilization}} of the Kardia lignite deposit and also initially to access the depositional conditions mainly in terms of water table level and subsidence rate of the fen substrate. Ash contents, as well as the C, H, N, O, and S were determined in nine lignite samples from core KT 6 A- 3. The ash contents (750 degrees C) of the studied lignite seams range among 14 - 37 % (on dry basis). Contents of C, H, N, and O have values between 34 - 52 %, 2. 5 - 4. 2 %, 0. 8 - 2 %, and 21 - 30. 6 %, respectively. Sulfur does not exceed 1. 2 %. Huminite group dominates with values between 84 - 99 vol%, mmf. All samples display a distinct prevalence in detrohuminite (up to 82 vol%) with attrinite being most abundant. Liptinite and inertinite macerals have low contents, which do not exceed 8 % and 12 %, respectively. The Kardia lignites are medium to very <b>low-grade</b> <b>coals.</b> They formed in fens under limnotelmatic regime and originated from herbaceous vegetation. During peat deposition, conditions were well moist, intense reducing, and favored increased bacterial activity. The ratio of plant growth and peat accumulation versus rise of water table due to the subsidence rate was not well balanced. The petrographical composition of the Kardia lignites is related either to a long residence time of the organic matter in the acrotelm or to an herbaceous vegetation origin...|$|R
