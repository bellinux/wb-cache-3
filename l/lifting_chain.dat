However, after a September 2001 incident in which a guest fell out of the boat during the descent and was killed, the boats were retrofitted with four-point harnesses. Shortly after the incident the ride received a more vibrant color scheme consisting of a green and blue track with lavender gray supports. After a period of time, Knott's received two new boats with over-the-shoulder restraints. These new boats were drastically different in design and thus created a much smaller splash than the first set of boats. In addition, newer designs caused problems with the <b>lift</b> <b>chain.</b> Stress fractures appeared in the <b>lift</b> <b>chain</b> shortly after the arrival of the new boats. The ride was shut down, and a new chain was ordered. This time, the <b>lift</b> <b>chain</b> snapped (though the anti-rollback device prevented the boat from reversing down the lift hill).

5000|$|In late 1832, Hall became mining {{engineer}} at South Hetton {{in addition to}} his other duties. Over the next four years, he made his first major contribution to the mining industry by developing the tub, cage and guide-rod system for raising coal from the pit, [...] Established practice had been to bring coal to the surface in wicker baskets or “corves”. These had increased in size over the years from 3 cwt. to about 6 cwt., making them difficult to fill and handle underground and prone to snagging while being lifted in the shaft. Adding to the difficulties was the common practice amongst miners of hanging to the ropes or <b>lifting</b> <b>chain</b> to ascend and descend the 1500 ft or more of the pit shaft. Hall replaced the corves with low tubs which ran on rails underground. Initially these were emptied at the shaft bottom, but he subsequently developed a frame or cage into which several tubs could be loaded for lifting. To prevent the cage fouling the sides of the shaft, he developed an idea proposed initially by a Mr. Curr of Sheffield and fitted guide rods to constrain it. A model of the system was exhibited at the Polytechnic Exhibition Newcastle and Museum of Practical Geology, London. These developments {{had a profound effect on}} mining costs which Hall later quantified as a saving of 1s.3 d. per ton of coal or over £1m. p.a. for the NE Coalfield By 1836, Hall was entering a partnership with Buddle and Potter to work the Ryton Glebe and Stella Collieries. This soon extended to the Townley Main and Whitefield pits and workings in the Crawcrook area. The group became known as the Stella Coal Company and traded successfully until the 1860s. Hall became resident at Stella House and, as part of the developments, leased an area of land to the west of Blaydon Burn, Fig.1. As his principal interest was the development of the Stella staithes, land was sub-leased to a range of industrial users including an acid and white lead factory. These complex legal arrangements were to return to haunt him in later life.|$|E

500|$|Many Bolliger & Mabillard {{coasters}} feature {{an element}} {{known as a}} [...] "pre-drop", a short drop after {{the top of the}} lift hill and {{before the start of the}} first drop, designed to reduce stress on the <b>lift</b> <b>chain.</b> The flat section between the pre-drop and the first drop serves as a shelf to support the weight of the train, reducing related stresses on the chain. On most coasters without a pre-drop, the weight of the train tends to pull on the <b>lift</b> <b>chain</b> as it begins its descent because the latter half of the train is still being <b>lifted</b> by the <b>chain.</b> Pre-drops have not been used on the company's Dive or Flying coasters, or on hyper coasters built after 1999. OzIris at Parc Astérix was the first B inverted roller coaster that does not feature a pre-drop. Ever since no coaster built by B has featured a pre-drop because the chain accelerates on newer coasters of B after the train passes the crest to acquire the same speed as the train when it is being taken over by gravity.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lifted</b> Markov <b>chains</b> are Markov chains on graphs {{with added}} local "memory" {{and can be}} used to mix towards a target {{distribution}} faster than their memoryless counterparts. Upper and lower bounds on the achievable performance have been provided under specific assumptions. In this paper, we analyze which assumptions and constraints are relevant for mixing, and how changing these assumptions affects those bounds. Explicitly, we find that requesting mixing on either the original or the full lifted graph, and allowing for reducible <b>lifted</b> <b>chains</b> or not, have no essential influence on mixing time bounds. On the other hand, allowing for suitable initialization of the lifted dynamics and/or imposing invariance of the target distribution for any initialization do significantly affect the convergence performance. The achievable convergence speed for a <b>lifted</b> <b>chain</b> goes from diameter-time to no acceleration over a standard Markov chain, with conductance bounds limiting the effectiveness of the intermediate cases. In addition, we show that the relevance of imposing ergodic flows depends on the other criteria. The presented analysis allows us to clarify in which scenarios designing lifted dynamics can lead to better mixing, and provide a flexible framework to compare lifted walks with other acceleration methods.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{examples}} where the mixing {{time of a}} Markov chain can be reduced substantially, often to about its square root, by ", i. e., by splitting each state into several states. In several examples of random walks on groups, the <b>lifted</b> <b>chain</b> not only mixes better, but is easier to analyze. We characterize the best mixing time achievable through lifting in terms of multicommodity ows. We show that the reduction to square root is best possible. If the <b>lifted</b> <b>chain</b> is time-reversible, then the gain is smaller, at most a factor of log(1 = 0), where 0 is the smallest stationary probability of any state.

2500|$|Sky Screamer, a first-generation Intamin Freefall ride, was {{constructed}} in the Plaza de Fiesta section and opened in 1983. Consisting of a tower reaching [...] in height and a horizontal braking runout, Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and unloading area of the ride (smaller rollers located {{on the bottom of}} the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a <b>lift</b> <b>chain.</b> Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the <b>lift</b> <b>chain</b> and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud klaxon (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking runout. The freefall drop into the horizontal curve applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a non-fatal accident on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's [...] "G-Block" [...] was moved farther down the horizontal braking runout. The end of [...] "H-Block" [...] was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994.
