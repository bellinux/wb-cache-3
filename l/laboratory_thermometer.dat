30|$|Temperature, {{salinity}} and pH {{were measured}} along the sampling period (April 2010 -April 2011). The temperature of seawater {{was measured using}} a <b>laboratory</b> <b>thermometer.</b> The pH was measured by a pH-meter (WTW pH  522), and values of salinity were detected using a salinometer (W.T.W.LF 18, Measuring Cells Tetracon 325).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} principally {{in order to obtain}} information regarding the extent of natural mortality during the egg and larval stages of certain salmonid fishes in a small California stream, to gather essential knowledge of the spawning behavior of these fishes, and to compare the results of such observations with similar evidence from other waters. Daily stream observations were conducted during the fall, winter, and spring of two separate seasons. The study was begun on October 15, 1948, and continued until June 1, 1949. It was resumed on October 20, 1950, and was finally concluded on May 30, 1951. During the 1950 – 51 season temperature and flow records were taken at a centrally located station (near the confluence of Godwood and Prairie Creeks) which was close to the spawning areas of the species being studied. The water temperatures in nearby parts of the watershed rarely varied more than 1 degree F. from those taken at this station. The temperature (F.) was taken at midday with a standard <b>laboratory</b> <b>thermometer</b> immersed {{in the center of the}} stream. The volume of flow was calculated by means of a standard float method over a 50 -foot section...|$|E
50|$|Tool kits for maker {{cosmetics}} {{can include}} beakers (250 and 400 ml), digital scales, <b>laboratory</b> <b>thermometers</b> (if possible, from -20 to 110 °C), pH paper, glass rods, plastic spatulas, and spray to disinfect with alcohol.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} and tested a multifacteted curriculum {{for use in}} introductory earth science classes from the secondary-school to the introductory undergraduate level. The centerpiece of this curriculum is a project-based investigation of greenhouse warming that can be conducted during one or more lab sessions using off-the-shelf materials. Other facets of the curriculum include: 1) literature review, 2) review of popular-press coverage, 3) assessment of internet-based information, and 4) interviews of fellow students. Simulation of the greenhouse effect utilizes two fish tanks, heat lamps, and either <b>laboratory</b> <b>thermometers</b> or laptop-driven temperature probes. Experiments are run by creating a CO 2 -enriched environment and measuring the differential heating of that experimental apparatus compared to an identical control. This experiment can be run as a hands-on student project or by the instructor as a demonstration for larger lecture classes. This greenhouse experiment and the broader curriculum have been developed around the central theme of teaching students to distinguish (1) solid scientific mechanisms from (2) actively debated hypothesis from (3) the broader genre of misperception and misinformation. This process provides {{students the opportunity to}} gain a much deeper understanding of the climate system, the nature of scientific uncertainty, the burden of proof in ongoing research, and the difficulties in transferring scientific results to the public-policy realm...|$|R
5000|$|Limitations:RTDs in {{industrial}} applications are rarely used above 660 °C. At temperatures above 660 °C it becomes {{increasingly difficult to}} prevent the platinum from becoming contaminated by impurities from the metal sheath of the thermometer. This is why <b>laboratory</b> standard <b>thermometers</b> replace the metal sheath with a glass construction. At very low temperatures, say below −270 °C (3 K), because {{there are very few}} phonons, the resistance of an RTD is mainly determined by impurities and boundary scattering and thus basically independent of temperature. As a result, the sensitivity of the RTD is essentially zero and therefore not useful.|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{the current}} status and {{position}} of mercury {{as one of the}} most typical representative of present day's fear from "harmful chemistry" is for the first time concisely reviewed (with 100 refs.). Mercury as such means a danger for the environment and the human beings, but the contemporary life of the civilized man without utilization of this metal element would be hardly imaginable. It is shown that mercury has occupied a significant position in the industry (in mining, as an inevitable component of electrolyzers, batteries, and various lightning devices), in medicine (as amalgams in dentistry or some special medicaments), as well as in physical and chemical <b>laboratories</b> (<b>thermometer</b> and barometers, or as traditional electrodes for polarography and voltammetry). Such a usage of mercury is considered in relation with toxicological aspects, from almost harmless liquid mercury, via potentially harmful Hg 2 II- and HgIIprecipitates, up to highly poisonous Hg-vapors or deadly toxic organomercury compounds. The individual forms and compounds are characterized, also using less known or even extreme examples from the past, recent time, as well as from the present, including rather curious reflections of the so-called mercurophobia. Regarding the evaluation of the actual toxicity, numerous inquiries concerning exposures to mercury have been extracted from the Czech Toxicological Information Center (CTIC), gathering the respective data over the period of 1995 - 2011. Finally, some future prospects mainly, in context with nowadays hugely popularized "green chemistry" are given and possible consequences outlined...|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} {{was based on}} the production of glassware and porcelain during the 19th and 20th century with many large and famous companies (porcelain brands: Henneberg (est. 1777), Metzler & Ortloff (est. 1873)). The porcelain industry didn't survive the structural change after the German reunification in 1990, so that the factories got closed like the most ones in Western Germany already during the 1970s and 1980s. The glass {{industry was}} always focussed on <b>laboratory</b> glassware like <b>thermometers,</b> test tubes and other chemical and medical uses. During the GDR period, all the glass factories of Ilmenau and the surrounding villages were centralized in a new Kombinat, opened in 1976 with 5,000 workers in Ilmenau being one of the biggest glass producers within the Comecon. After the reunification, the factory survived and is still a leading company for laboratory glassware in Germany, nevertheless, due to rationalization efforts during the 1990s, the number of employees decreased to 225. After 1990, new branches established in Ilmenau, especially mechanical engineering and polymer processing are playing an important role in Ilmenau, same as software engineering. These new branches benefit from the vicinity to the university and the research institutes. In 2012, there were 26 companies in industrial production with more than 20 workers employing 1,500 persons and generating a turnover of €170 millions.|$|R
