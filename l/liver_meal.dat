40|$|COD <b>LIVER</b> <b>MEAL</b> is {{obtained}} as a by-product in the cod liver oil industry. In {{the manufacture of}} cod liver oil by direct stem process, {{a large portion of}} the oil and water-soluble proteins are removed from the liver tissues. The remaining liver tissue, after it is dried and ground, is sold as "cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal.</b> " The physical appearance of cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> varies greatly due primarily to the length of time which elapses between cooking the livers and the subsequent drying. When the liver residue is dried very promptly after the oil is extracted, a good quality of cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> is ob tained. On the other hand, when the liver residue is allowed to remain in a moist condition several months previous to drying, the resulting <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> is a dark color and has a pronounced odor. Considered from a nutritive standpoint, cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> contains about 40 per cent of protein and nearly as much fat. In view of the relatively large amount of residual fat in cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal,</b> it has been frequently suggested that it could be used in poultry rations instead of cod liver oil as a source of vitamins. The present investigation was undertaken to secure data con cerning the vitamin value of commenÃ§ai cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal.</b> Four lots of commercial cod <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> were obtained on the open market.

40|$|Anautogenicity {{refers to}} a state of strict {{nutritional}} regulation of egg development which is initiated by ingestion of a protein meal. As demonstrated in blood sucking mosquitoes, decapitation of S. crassipalpis females within 3 hours post <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> confirms the need of one or more head factors to enhance proteolytic activity in the midgut. Injection of corpora cardiaca extracts rescued the decapitation caused digestion arrest provided the donor CC were collected from females no later than 3 hours post <b>liver</b> <b>meal.</b> In order to identify the factor which presumably is needed to enhance proteolytic activity in liver fed female flies we compared the retrocerebral complex peptidome prior and post release of the signaling molecule(s). This study highlighted AKH to be a candidate regulator of proteolytic activity in the midgut. Indeed injection of AKH- 1 in decapitated liver fed females enhanced the midgut proteolytic activity to the level of liver fed non-decapitated control females. Injection of AKH in sugar fed control females also resulted in increased digestive activity in this way bypassing the need of the protein meal ingestion stimulus. Since it cannot yet be excluded that the observed AKH effect is a-specific, further research will be needed to correctly place our experimental data in the background of insulin and TOR signaling pathways which previously have been reported to help regulate anautogenicity in other species. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{three dogs}} {{provided}} with chronic gastric and pancreatic fistulae, gastric acid {{response to a}} peptone meal was measured by a method of intragastric titration at pre-selected pH values ranging from 6 · 0 to 2 · 0 or at a constant pH during intravenous infusion of secretin in graded doses ranging from 0 · 25 to 4 · 0 u. /kg. hr. Simultaneously, pancreatic secretion {{was determined by the}} standard collection technique and serum gastrin response was measured by radio-immunoassay. In this way the pH profile for the inhibition of gastric response and stimulation of pancreatic secretion as well as serum gastrin response to a peptone meal have been determined and compared with that obtained with exogenous secretin or feeding a <b>liver</b> <b>meal.</b> Truncal vagotomy resulted in a significant decrease of gastric acid response to the meal at all pH levels or at all doses of secretin but the inhibitory effect of gastric acidification or secretin on serum gastrin and gastric acid response to a meal remained unchanged. Vagotomy caused a decrease of pancreatic secretory response to meals at all pH levels and at all doses of secretin except the largest one. Pancreatic secretion stimulated by secretin alone was not affected by vagotomy, whereas that induced by feeding a <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> was markedly decreased by this procedure. From these studies we have tentatively concluded that the vagus nerve facilitates the release of intestinal hormones and that vagotomy causes a decrease of gastric and pancreatic responses to endogenous but not to exogenous stimuli...|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of brain signals on the {{biosynthesis}} juvenile hormone by the corpora allata of the grey fleshfly Neobellieria bullata, exposed corpora allata connected to the brain were surgically removed from sugar-fed flies and incubated in vitro with L-[H- 3 -methyl]methionine, After incubation, the media together with, the tissues were analyzed by HPLC. [H- 3]Juvenile hormone III (JH III), [H- 3]JH III bisepoxide (EE), [H- 3]methyl farnesoate (MF) and an unknown [H- 3]labeled metabolite (Un) were identified as the primary products. The rate of synthesis of [H- 3]JH PII bisepoxide was {{higher than that of}} [H- 3]JH III, [H- 3]MF and [H- 3]Un. Two days after a <b>liver</b> <b>meal,</b> female flies synthesized more JH III, MF, BE, and the Un than did males. Synthesis of JH III, BE, and MF in females was lower during the previtellogenic, sugar-feeding period than during the vitellogenic liver-feeding period. Isolated corpus cardiacum-corpus allatum (CC-CA) complexes that were incubated in vitro synthesized less JH III, MF, and SE, as compared to complexes that were attached to the brain, indicating that the brain probably modulates the biosynthesis of JH IPI, MF, and BE in the corpora allata. Upon incubation of brain-CCCA complexes with Neb-TMOF (10 (- 8) M), Neb-colloostatin (10 (- 8) M) ovarian, of brain extracts resulted in significant inhibition of JH III and BE biosynthesis in the presence of ovarian extracts.

40|$|Trypsin mRNA {{from the}} grey fleshfly (Neobellieria bullata) was reverse {{transcribed}} and amplified {{by means of}} PCR. Two cDNA species of 600 bp and 800 bp were cloned and sequenced. The 3 ' end of the gene (300 bp) was amplified {{by means of the}} rapid amplification-of-cDNA-ends method, cloned and sequenced. The deduced protein sequence of 254 amino acids exhibited 46 % identity to Drosophila trypsin and 32 % identity to Anophiline trypsin and Aedes trypsin. Three-dimensional models of Neobellieria trypsin and Drosophila trypsin were built and compared. Both models contain two domains of beta-barrel sheets as was shown by means of X-ray crystallography of mammalian trypsin. The catalytic active site is composed of the canonical triad of His 42, Asp 87 and Ser 182 whereas Asp 276 sits {{at the bottom of the}} specificity pocket. Southern blot analysis suggested that Neobellieria trypsin is encoded by one gene. Northern blot analysis showed that an early trypsin transcript is found in the midgut of sugar-fed females. This message disappeared after a <b>liver</b> <b>meal,</b> and was replaced by a late transcript. Injection of trypsin-modulating oostatic factor (TMOF) at 10 (- 9) M prevented the disappearance and the translation of the early transcript.

30|$|According to Kim and Bai (1997), when a {{fishmeal}} {{mixed with}} animal protein sources including blood meal, squid <b>liver</b> <b>meal,</b> meat and bone meal, greaves, feather meal, and {{essential amino acids}} that were gradually substituted for to 20 – 60 % of the regular diet was fed to black rockfish for 6  weeks, growth performance did not significantly change at concentrations up to 40 % of the fishmeal. In addition, once black rockfish were fed the fishmeal mixed with 12.5 – 50 % animal protein supplement for 16  weeks, up to 12.5 % of the fishmeal could be substituted before the rate of gain and feed efficiency started showing large differences {{as the level of}} supplement increased. This was reported to be because of diet intake preferences, in vivo enzyme activity, and metabolism (Kim and Bai 1999). In the present study, although significant differences were not found between the control group and the FSM supplement groups, it tended to decrease gradually with an increase of the supplement. Such an FSM supplement at the same fishmeal ratio seems to be capable of facilitating the preference and metabolism of fish, and vitamin C addition would provide synergetic effects in the FSM supplement. Aksnes et al. (2008) added 0.7 – 5.6  g/kg of hydroxyproline to vegetable protein diets and fed them to salmon (Salmo salar L.) for 88  days. They found that adding 2.9  g/kg of hydroxyproline to the diet increased the growth of the salmon by approximately 14 %. The diet from the current study is also expected to improve the growth performance because the FSM used in this study contains abundant hydroxyproline, which is a collagen-specific amino acid.|$|E

40|$|Pig meat {{production}} in New Zealand {{has traditionally been}} associated with the dairy industry, relying upon dairy by-products (principally skim-milk and whey) as major sources of protein and energy for pig feed. However, export market prospects for milk protein led to the diversification of dairy factory products, such as the ultra-filtration of whey protein and lactose extraction of whey. The prevailing economic climate also encouraged dairy farmers to change to whole milk,anker collection and large numbers of the supplementary pig enterprises were closed down. Despite fluctuations, market prices generally showed an increase and many farmers began investigating alternative food supplies in order to take advantage of these higher prices. Garbage and other edible waste provided only limited scope for expansion, and the main alternative appeared to be the use of cereal grains. The New Zealand pig industry, in the last 5 - 10 years, has therefore begun to move towards a specialised form of production based upon the use of diets containing a predominance of cereals, similar to what has prevailed in many overseas countries for a longer period. The local report of Kingma and Ryan (1971) illustrates the need for efficiency in the high cost system of production based upon meal feeding. Where skimmilk is the principal ingredient in the ration, the supply of dietary protein is generally adequate due to the high nutritive value of the protein in this feedstuff. However, when the major source of nutrients comes from cereal grains, although these provide a concentrated source of energy, the poor balance of amino acids becomes limiting to the utilization of such rations. In New Zealand there is a restricted range of feeds high in protein and suitable for incorporation into pig rations. They include skimmilk powder, buttermilk powder, meat meal, meat and bone meal, <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> and fish meal.

Earlier studies on proctolin demonstrated {{that the presence of}} the -CH 2 - group between C-alpha and the phenyl ring at position 2 of the peptide chain is important for the myotropic activity. Based on these results, we replaced Tyr at position 2 by different phenylglycine derivatives, lacking the methylene group at the side chain. Myotropic activity of the proctolin analogs was assayed in vitro on the semi-isolated heart of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor and on the foregut of the locust Schistocerca gregaria. All analogs (I-X) were practically inactive. For Neb-TMOF, it was previously demonstrated that the exchange of His- 6 by p-substituted Phe-derivatives, especially by Phe(p-NH 2), an amino acid containing a basic function, results into analogs which inhibit trypsin biosynthesis in the gray fleshfly. For this reason these new Neb-TMOF analogs with L- or D-phenylglycine p-substituted derivatives at position 6, were developed and tested (in vivo) in the trypsin biosynthesis assay of the gray fleshfly N. bullata. Only analogs XV and XVI slightly inhibited trypsin biosynthesis in the midgut. Because more than 50 % of the injected animals died and none of the surviving animals ate much of the <b>liver</b> <b>meal,</b> the lower trypsin level in the gut might be a indirect effect.

30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{performed}} investigated vegetable and animal proteins that could replace fishmeal in fish feed. In particular, {{there have been many}} studies on the use of vegetable protein sources such as soybean meal (Lee and Jeon 1996; Murai et al. 1982 b; Robert et al. 1993), cottonseed meal, and rapeseed meal (Lee and Yoo 1996; Pham et al. 2005), which have a relatively stable supply compared to fishmeal, to replace fishmeal as a source of protein. However, plant resources are constantly in competition with livestock and human consumption, and the recent development of plant extract fuels such as bioethanol will eventually lead to an increase in the price of the plant resources usable as protein resources (Rena and Hasan 2009). The by-products of the processing of terrestrial livestock such as cows, chickens, and pigs could be used as animal protein sources, since they have a relatively high protein content and qualitatively similar amino acid composition to fishmeal, and are inexpensive and stably supplied. Various {{studies have been}} conducted on their use as protein sources to replace fishmeal in fish feed (Ai et al. 2006; Bai et al. 1998; Kikuchi et al. 1994; Kim and Bai 19971999; Lee and Lee 1998; Sato and Kikuchi 1997). However, the rise of safety issues due to serious infectious diseases like mad cow disease, swine fever, and avian influenza has gradually restricted the use of livestock by-products lately. Thus, as there are economic and safety issues with using terrestrial protein sources to replace fishmeal, securing economic and safe protein sources from marine products rather than terrestrial products is necessary. Many researchers have investigated by-products obtained from processing marine animal as potential protein sources, including shrimp by-products (Cruz-Suárez et al. 1993), tuna muscle by-products (Uyan et al. 2006), shrimp and fish by-products (Li et al. 2004), squid <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> mixing soybean meal with by-products of squid processing (Kim and Bai 1997), fish bone and crab by-products (Goytortúa-Bores et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2010; Toppe et al. 2006), and fish by-products (Foster et al. 2005). Of the fishery by-products, even though fish skins obtained from the consumption of raw fish are a good protein source high in collagen content, by-products such as bones and internal organs are only partially used and mostly discarded.|$|E
40|$|In the past, bile acids were {{considered}} to be just detergent molecules derived from cholesterol in the liver. They were known to be important for the solubilization of cholesterol in the gallbladder and for stimulating the absorption of cholesterol, fat-soluble vitamins, and lipids from the intestines. However, during the last two decades, it has been discovered that bile acids are regulatory molecules. Bile acids have been discovered to activate specific nuclear receptors (farnesoid X receptor, preganane X receptor, and vitamin D receptor), G protein coupled receptor TGR 5 (TGR 5), and cell signaling pathways (c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 / 2, AKT, and ERK 1 / 2) in cells in the liver and gastrointestinal tract.

50|$|When glucose {{has been}} {{converted}} into G6P by hexokinase or glucokinase, it can either be converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) for conversion to glycogen, or it is alternatively converted by glycolysis to pyruvate, which enters the mitochondrion where it is converted into acetyl-CoA and then into citrate. Excess citrate is exported from the mitochondrion back into to the cytosol, where ATP citrate lyase regenerates acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate (OAA). The acetyl-CoA is then used for fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis, two important ways of utilizing excess glucose when its concentration is high in blood. The rate limiting enzymes catalyzing these reactions perform these functions when they have been dephosphorylated through the action of insulin on the <b>liver</b> cells. Between <b>meals,</b> during fasting, exercise or hypoglycemia, glucagon and epinephrine are released into the blood. This causes liver glycogen to be converted back to G6P, and then converted to glucose by the liver-specific enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase and released into the blood. Glucagon and epinephrine also stimulate gluconeogenesis, which coverts non-carbohydrate substrates into G6P, which joins the G6P derived from glycogen, or substitutes for it when the liver glycogen store have been depleted. This is critical for brain function, since the brain utilizes glucose as an energy source under most conditions. The simultaneously phosphorylation of, particularly, phosphofructokinase, but also, {{to a certain extent}} pyruvate kinase, prevents glycolysis occurring {{at the same time as}} gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.|$|R

From this small beginning, pisciculture has become an industry of national importance. McCay of Cornell University and Davis of the United States Bureau of Fisheries have clarified many problems pertaining to fish culture and nutrition. The food of wild trout varies with the locality, the season, {{and the age of}} the fish, but it consists mainly of the larvae of various insects such as the dragonfly or caddis fly and crayfish (l). Species’ differences play a part in food selection; for example, 15 % of the stomach contents of rainbow trout consists of algae (2), while green vegetation is eaten in negligible amounts by other species of trout. Perhaps this fact may account for the difficulty which is sometimes experienced in raising rainbow trout in captivity. The food available for hatchery feeding may be divided into three classes: (a) fresh meat, such as liver, heart, et cetra; (b) dried animal products such as meat or fish meal, and dried skim-milk; (c) vegetable products such as wheat middlings and cottonseed <b>meal.</b> <b>Liver</b> {{was one of the first}} substances to be used and has continued to be one of the most successful of artificial trout foods.

The tallow produced from the rendering of meat is of great importance in war materials, for from this harmless substance, glycerine is obtained and in turn, is used for the manufacture of many explosives. The so-celled edible tallows or fats are generally produced under different conditions to the inedible and as a result are much more expensive. The oils from animals are also important. tin oil such as neatsfoot oil is regarded as quite a common oil, but little thought is ever given to the tedious processes necessary in its manufacture. When - it ultimately reaches the world's markets, its uses are much greater than one would ever imagine. Today a very large amount of the famous "fish and chips" are fried in neatsfoot oil. The delicate machinery of a spinning mill (either silk or woollen threads) is lubricated with an oil that has neatsfoot oil as its basis. Even the very threads are often lubricated with an emulsified form of neatsfoot oil. The foregoing products have up to comparatively recent years been the chief by-products of the meat rendering industry. When Laws discovered that bones {{could be used as a}} fertilizer, then, another aspect of the industry was opened up and bones were much in demand for soil fertilization purposes. Following this, flesh and blood came to be used to make up a more complete fertilizer. With the discoveries of bacterioligists that various diseases could be transmitted by bones, then sterilization of these bones became necessary. Today all fertilizers of animal origin are sterilized under steam pressures generally in the region of 50 lbs. per square inch. With further progress in studies on the feeding of animals, the meat industry was again called upon to supply important articles. Bones that had previously been used as fertilizer were diverted to other channels and now supply that important compound, calcium phosphate, as a lick or a mixture in the food of animals subject to phosphate deficiency. The next avenue opened up was the protein side of the question. The continual demand for increased production from all animal life has rendered it necessary that high protein foods should be available to animals. Cows that are heavy producers of butter - fat, poultry under intense production and similar branches of agriculture demand a protein concentrate. The meat industry has risen to the occasion and produced a meat meal, <b>liver</b> <b>meal</b> and blood meal with protein percentages as high as 70 %. Originally a protein content of 35. ` in a meat meal was considered quite good, but today the tendency is to aim at 7 u and exceed this mark if possible. One of the chief reasons for this great advance, is, that raw materials producing these "meals",are for the most part low fat bearing offals and a means of getting rid of them, without expensive treatment, has been long sought after. Apart from the foregoing reason, the overseas demand for meat meals, liver meals and such concentrates has increased tremendously in the last two years. Some of the larger rendering companies ship almost their entire out ? to overseas consumers. The Australian consumer has still to be educated to the use of concentrated foods for his animals and when this happens the bones and meat now going into fertilizer will be diverted into animal foods. In England the shank bones from lambs are ground into a special bone meal which is entirely strange to Australia, although its results are far ahead of anything we produce here at present. The meat industry is one in which nothing is wasted and every year sees some new use for one of its many by-products. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} recent studies, {{understanding of}} the normal postprandial processes underlying immediate storage of substrate and maintenance of glucose homeostasis in humans after a mixed meal has been incomplete. The present study applied 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure sequential changes in hepatic glycogen concentration, a novel tracer approach to measure postprandial suppression of hepatic glucose output, and acetaminophen to trace the pathways of hepatic glycogen synthesis to elucidate the homeostatic adaptation to the fed state in healthy human subjects. After the liquid mixed <b>meal,</b> <b>liver</b> glycogen concentration rose from 207 +/- 22 to 316 +/- 19 mmol/liter at an average rate of 0. 34 mmol/liter per min and peaked at 318 +/- 31 min, falling rapidly thereafter (0. 26 mmol/liter per min). The mean increment at peak represented net glycogen synthesis of 28. 3 +/- 3. 7 g (approximately 19 % of meal carbohydrate content). The contribution of the direct pathway to overall glycogen synthesis was 46 +/- 5 and 68 +/- 8 % between 2 and 4 and 4 and 6 h, respectively. Hepatic glucose output was completely suppressed within 30 min of the meal. It increased steadily from 60 to 255 min from 0. 31 +/- 32 to 0. 49 +/- 18 mg/kg per min then rapidly returned towards basal levels (1. 90 +/- 0. 04 mg/kg per min). This pattern of change mirrored precisely the plasma glucagon/insulin ratio. These data provide {{for the first time}} a comprehensive picture of normal carbohydrate metabolism in humans after ingestion of a mixed meal...|$|R
40|$|Four isoproteinous (40 % crude protein) feeds (based on chicken <b>liver,</b> lean shrimp <b>meal,</b> mus- sel meal or squid meal) {{were fed}} to goldfish, Carassius auratus, of 4. 61 ± 0. 427 g for 30 days at 10 % {{of their body}} weight. The effect of the feeds on growth {{performance}} were compared with two commercial feeds, Brine Shrimp Flake and Tubifex Worm (59 % crude protein each). There {{were no significant differences}} in food conversion ratio or specific growth rate between the treat- ments. The protein efficiency ratios (PER) of all the formulated feeds were significantly better than that of the Brine Shrimp Flake and the PER of the diets based on mussel and squid meal were also significantly better than Tubifex Worm. The weight increment with Tubifex Worm was significantly highest of all the treatments. Considering the nutritional parameters and cost of pro- ducing one kilogram of fish, the diet based on lean shrimp meal was the best. The cost of pro- ducing one kilogram fish using the formulated feeds ranged Rs. 93. 75 - 231. 30. Using Brine Shrimp Flake and Tubifex Worm, the costs were Rs. 1150 and Rs. 3500 per kg, respectively. The cost of goldfish rearing can be appreciably reduced by using feeds prepared with locally available protein sources. The crude protein level of 40 % was sufficient for the goldfish, as the PER of the fish fed the formulated feeds was better than that of the fish fed the commercial feeds...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that rats prone to obesity exhibit an exaggerated increase in glucose oxidation and an exaggerated decline in lipid oxidation under a low-fat high-carbohydrate (LF/HC) diet. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in these metabolic dysregulations. After a one week adaptation to laboratory conditions, 48 male Wistar rats were fed a LF/HC diet for 3 weeks. During weeks 2 and 3, glucose tolerance tests (GTT), insulin tolerance tests (ITT) and meal tolerance tests (MTT) were performed to evaluate blood glucose, plasma and insulin. Glucose and lipid oxidation were also assayed during the GTT. At the end of the study, body composition was measured in all the rats, and they were classified as carbohydrate resistant (CR) or carbohydrate sensitive (CS) according to their adiposity. Before sacrifice, 24 of the 48 rats received a calibrated LF/HC <b>meal.</b> <b>Liver,</b> muscle and intestine tissue samples were taken to measure mRNA expression of key genes involved in glucose, lipid and protein metabolism. ITT, GTT and MTT showed that CS rats were neither insulin resistant nor glucose intolerant, but mRNA expression of CCK in the duodenum was higher and that of CPT 1, PPARα and PGC 1 α in liver were lower than in CR rats. From these results, we make the hypothesis that in CS rats, CCK increased pancreatic secretion which may favor a quicker absorption of carbohydrates and consequently induces an enhanced inhibition of lipid oxidation in the liver leading to a progressive accumulation of fat preferentially in visceral deposits. Such a mechanism may explain why CS rats share many characteristics observed in rats fed a high glycemic index diet...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground & aimsGut health {{relates to}} a diet {{with a high}} {{digestibility}} and quality. Limited data {{are available on the}} acute effects of low quality foods on gut metabolism and the consequences for <b>liver</b> metabolism. MethodsA <b>meal</b> with the low quality protein gelatin (tryptophan deficient and low amount of essential amino acids) was compared to a meal with the high quality protein Whey and a tryptophan supplemented gelatin meal (Gel + TRP) in healthy pigs with chronic implanted catheters. In a conscious state, amino acid, ammonia, urea, glucose and lactate fluxes across the portal drained viscera (PDV) and liver were studied for 6  h after administration of the protein meal. ResultsThe average net portal appearance of amino acids was 99. 8  ±  14. 6 % of the intake in the Gel group as compared to 61. 4  ±  9. 0 % (p =  0. 022) in the Whey group. In addition, a net portal appearance of tryptophan was observed in the Gel group (p =  0. 005) of about 42 % of tryptophan released in the Whey group. Intestinal energy metabolism and citrulline production was not affected. Adding tryptophan to the Gel meal diminished net portal AA appearance to 41. 6  ±  24. 0 % of the intake (p =  0. 012), but did not reduce the stimulated liver urea production. ConclusionsIn the post-prandial phase after intake of a low protein quality meal, net anabolism in the healthy intestine is absent. It is likely that the intestine responds with a net breakdown of endogenous (labile) proteins to secure amino acid availability for the body. Addition of the first limiting essential amino acid to this meal improved protein anabolism in the intestine. Protein quality of a meal is related to the anabolic response of the intestine during the meal...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} food intake and body weight by the brain relies upon the {{detection}} {{and integration of}} signals reflecting energy stores and fluxes, and their interaction with many different inputs related to food palatability and gastrointestinal handling as well as social, emotional, circadian, habitual and other situational factors. This review focuses upon the role of hormones secreted by the endocrine pancreas: hormones, which individually and collectively influence food intake, with an emphasis upon insulin, glucagon and amylin. Insulin and amylin are co-secreted by B-cells and provide a signal that reflects both circulating {{energy in the form}} of glucose and stored energy in the form of visceral adipose tissue. Insulin acts directly at the liver to suppress the synthesis and secretion of glucose, and some plasma insulin is transported into the brain and especially the mediobasal hypothalamus where it elicits a net catabolic response, particularly reduced food intake and loss of body weight. Amylin reduces meal size by stimulating neurons in the hindbrain, and there is evidence that amylin additionally functions as an adiposity signal controlling body weight as well as meal size. Glucagon is secreted from A-cells and increases glucose secretion from the liver. Glucagon acts in the <b>liver</b> to reduce <b>meal</b> size, the signal being relayed to the brain via the vagus nerves. To summarize, hormones of the endocrine pancreas are collectively at the crossroads of many aspects of energy homeostasis. Glucagon and amylin act in the short term to reduce meal size, and insulin sensitizes the brain to short-term meal-generated satiety signals; and insulin and perhaps amylin as well act over longer intervals to modulate the amount of fat maintained and defended by the brain. Hormones of the endocrine pancreas interact with receptors at many points along the gut-brain axis, from the liver to the sensory vagus nerve to the hindbrain to the hypothalamus; and their signals are conveyed both neurally and humorally. Finally, their actions include gastrointestinal and metabolic as well as behavioural effects...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that supplementation of rumen-protected choline (RPC) reduces the hepatic triacylglycerol concentration in periparturient dairy cows during early lactation. Here, we investigated {{the effect of}} RPC on the transcript levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in liver and adipose tissue biopsies, taken at wk - 3, 1, 3, and 6 after calving, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this RPC-induced reduction of hepatic lipidosis. Sixteen multiparous cows were blocked into 8 pairs and randomly allocated to either 1 of 2 treatments, with or without RPC. Treatments were applied from 3 wk before to 6 wk after calving. Both groups received a basal diet and concentrate mixture. One group received RPC supplementation, resulting in an intake of 14. 4 g of choline per day, whereas controls received an isoenergetic mixture of palm oil and additional soybean <b>meal.</b> <b>Liver</b> and adipose tissue biopsies were taken at wk - 3, 1, 3, and 6 to determine the mRNA abundance of 18 key genes involved in liver and adipose tissue lipid and energy metabolism. Milk samples were collected in wk 1, 2, 3, and 6 postpartum for analysis of milk fatty acid (FA) composition. The RPC-induced reduction in hepatic lipidosis could not be attributed to altered lipolysis in adipose tissue, as no treatment effect was observed on the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ¿, lipoprotein lipase, or FA synthase in adipose tissue, or on the milk FA composition. Rumen-protected choline supplementation increased the expression of FA transport protein 5 and carnitine transporter SLC 22 A 5 in the liver, suggesting {{an increase in the}} capacity of FA uptake and intracellular transport, but no treatment effect was observed on carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A, transporting long-chain FA into mitochondria. In the same organ, RPC appeared to promote apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein assembly, as shown by elevated microsomal triglyceride transfer protein expression and apolipoprotein B 100 expression. Cows supplemented with RPC displayed elevated levels of glucose transporter 2 mRNA and a reduced peak in pyruvate carboxylase mRNA immediately after calving, showing that supplementation also resulted in improved carbohydrate metabolism. The results from this study suggest that RPC supplementation reduces liver triacylglycerol by improved FA processing and very-low-density lipoprotein synthesis, and RPC also benefits hepatic carbohydrate metabolism...|$|R
