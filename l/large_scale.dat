5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} oligonucleotide synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput synthesis on small scale to satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides. A number of oligonucleotide synthesizers for small scale synthesis and medium to <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> synthesis are available commercially.|$|E

5|$|A natural form of <b>large</b> <b>scale</b> {{environmental}} shading/dimming {{has been}} identified that affected the 2006 northern hemisphere hurricane season. The NASA study found that several major dust storms in June and July in the Sahara desert sent dust drifting over the Atlantic Ocean and through several effects caused cooling of the waters, thus dampening the development of hurricanes.|$|E

40|$|Using a gauge-invariant {{formalism}} we derive {{and solve}} the perturbed cosmological equations for the BSBM theory of varying fine structure 'constant'. We calculate the time evolution of inhomogeneous perturbations {{of the fine}} structure constant, δα/α on small and <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> {{with respect to the}} Hubble radius. In a radiation-dominated universe small inhomogeneities in α will decrease on <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> but on scales smaller than the Hubble radius they will undergo stable oscillations. In a dust-dominated universe small inhomogeneous perturbations in α will become constant on <b>large</b> <b>scales</b> and on small scales they will increase as t^ 2 / 3, and δα/α will track...|$|R
