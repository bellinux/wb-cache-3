60|$|A {{few days}} {{afterwards}} I went by steamer to Batavia, where I stayed {{about a week}} at the chief hotel, while I made arrangements for a trip into the interior. The business part of the city is near the harbour, but the hotels and all the residences of the officials and European merchants are in a suburb two miles off, laid out in wide streets and squares so as to cover a great extent of ground. This is very inconvenient for visitors, as the only public conveyances are handsome two-horse carriages, whose <b>lowest</b> <b>charge</b> is five guilders (8s. 4d.) for half a day, so that an hour's business in the morning and a visit in the evening costs 16s. 8d. a day for carriage hire alone.|$|E

Lady Northlake lives in a fashionable neighbourhood in London, and has splendid carriages and horses. This is a fashionable neighbourhood.

The game appears {{to be similar to}} other 2D versus {{fighting}} games during its release, but has different gameplay. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in single round matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player, while using very simplistic commands that summon charging attacks. Players press and hold two out of three buttons down to charge up, then move the joystick toward a direction to perform an attack. The longer the players hold two buttons down, the more powerful and longer the attack gets and lasts; however, there are three levels of energy, and after the third and highest charge, it returns to the first and <b>lowest</b> <b>charge.</b> Short charges create weak moves, medium charges create moderate moves, and long charges create strong attacks. Both players have 3 levels of health in each round, instead of one like in most other fighting games. Ta•o Taido also has a cooperative 2-player feature similar to the ones in SNK's Street Smart and Fatal Fury: King of Fighters. The controls can be switched to what most other fighting games have.|$|E

40|$|Different {{families}} of unconventional superconductors present a <b>low</b> <b>charge</b> carrier density {{as a common}} trait, suggesting that the <b>low</b> <b>charge</b> density can be at {{the basis of a}} unifying picture for different superconductors. In the past years we have suggested that the electron–phonon interaction can be responsible for a high-Tc superconducting pairing in a nonadiabatic regime, where nonadiabatic effects are triggered on by the small electronic Fermi energy associated with the <b>low</b> <b>charge</b> density character. A coherent picture of such a framework requires however reconciling the <b>low</b> <b>charge</b> density and the small Fermi energy with a finite metallic character (sizable density of states and large Fermi surfaces). In this paper we investigate the peculiar conditions which are needed to be encountered in order to fulfill these requirements. We discuss the specific case of fullerenes, cuprates and MgB 2 alloys by analyzing their specific structural and electronic properties The comparison between these materials and simple instructive models permits to underline the different routes to reconcile these characteristics in different compounds. In cuprates and fullerenes the interplay between small Fermi energies and large Fermi surface is strictly connected with strong electronic correlation effects. A comprehensive understanding of these issues can be useful to the future search for new nonadiabatic high-Tc materials. (© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|R

By establishing the existence of flow trees numerically and refining the index factorization scheme, we reproduce and improve some results obtained by Gaiotto, Strominger and Yin.

The snowflake shaped molecule behaves like an antenna capturing photon at different frequencies and transferring the photon energy to the porphyrin where electron transfer occurs from the porphyrin to the fullerene. Molecular structure of this large complex is first optimized using plane wave projector augmented wave methodology. Subsequent {{electronic structure}} calculations are performed using the real space methodology using an all electron pseudopotential basis set containing total of 12478 basis functions.

The energies of the HOMO and LUMO states in the complex, as adjudged by the ionization potential and the electron affinity values, show significant differences with respect to their values in participating subunits in isolation. We have systematically examined the effect of structural strain and the presence of ligands on the ionization energy and the electron affinity. Finally, we have calculated a few <b>lowest</b> <b>charge</b> transfer energies involving electronic transitions from a the porphyrin component to the fullerene subunit of the complex using the perturbative delta-SCF method.
