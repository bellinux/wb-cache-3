5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

Every evening, we went to pieces and during the night, we tried to build ourselves up again, so we could go into the street... and look like human beings again... And [...] was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> windmill; it turned and moved.|$|E
500|$|Possessed of {{a strong}} intelligence, McCain did well in a few {{subjects}} that interested him, such as English literature, history, and government. [...] There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all midshipmen; [...] McCain's classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities on mathematics, science, and engineering courses and thought his low grades were by inclination and not ability, while McCain would later acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him. [...] His class rank was further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership, which reflected his sloppy appearance, rebellious attitude, and poor relations with his company officer. [...] Despite his low standing, he was popular and a leader among his fellow midshipmen, in what biographer Robert Timberg called a [...] "manic, intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way". Good at attracting women, he was famed for organizing off-Yard activities with a group who called themselves [...] "the Bad Bunch"; one classmate said that [...] "being on liberty with John McCain was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> train wreck." [...] Other midshipmen were annoyed by his behavior. [...] A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer [...] found McCain showing good skills at the conn, and the destination stop in Rio de Janeiro led to a dream-like romance with Brazilian fashion model and ballerina Maria Gracinda that persisted through a Christmastime reunion.|$|E
60|$|I {{grabbed the}} back of the nearest piece of {{furniture}} and the splendour of marbles and mirrors, of cut crystals and carvings, swung before my eyes in the golden mist of walls and draperies round an extremely conspicuous pair of black stockings thrown over a music stool which remained motionless. The silence was profound. It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enchanted place. Suddenly a voice began to speak, clear, detached, infinitely touching in its calm weariness.|$|R

The security guy was sitting here ready to jump. I told him that I was going to put the plane into negative-G mode. Everyone would fall. When you put the plane into negative, it's <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> falling elevator. Instead of the plane flying this way, it dives and everyone who is standing falls down." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 October 2012, his 50th birthday, Flea gave an {{interview}} with CNN discussing the Chili Peppers and {{was asked if he}} plans to continue with them. Flea responded by saying [...] "I love the Chili Peppers, and I would love to. If there's anything I know, it's every time you start making plans, you don't know what's going to come up next. Anything can happen. So I love being in the Chili Peppers and it's my home, and I've been doing it for more than half my life. Of course, during the course of doing it, there's been all kinds of ups and downs, and moments of extreme (positivity), floating on clouds of greatness, and times of just groveling, and misery, and uncertainty, and anger, and love and all those things. <b>Like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family. I really can't predict. But I love being in it for now, and right now, about as far as I'm thinking is getting through this tour that we're doing, performing at the highest level possible, then hunkering down and writing another record." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E

[...] "I'll never tell you what that song is about," [...] she told Salon in 2006. [...] "That feeling of not being understood, but supposedly being understood by everyone ... being inside of a spectacle, it's <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a prisoner of war. I don't know if that makes sense. It would be <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> insane asylum, where you are who you are, and the only person you've ever been is yourself, but then {{they want you to}} be someone else." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between Steve Hewitt {{and the rest}} of the band had become tense during the recording of Meds and eventually, in October 2007, the band announced that Hewitt was no longer in Placebo. Molko commented that [...] "Being in a band is very much <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> marriage, and in couples—in this case a triple—people can grow apart over the years. To say that you don't love your partner anymore is inaccurate, considering all that you've been through and achieved together. There simply comes a point when you realise that you want different things from your relationship and that you can no longer live under the same roof, so to speak". Olsdal commented [...] "We couldn't go on with Steve Hewitt. We didn't have the same goals, nor the same vision anymore. We had to separate. It all went wrong during the Meds tour. [...] There was no communication between us. Brian and I are one, but at some point we even didn't talk to each other anymore. We realised Placebo was dying. To be able to go on, things had to change." [...] According to Hewitt, [...] "Alex Weston, our manager, [...] called me in to the office and said I was not in the band anymore. And that's it. I was thrown out". Hewitt claims that it was [...] "very hurtful" [...] and [...] "disappointing" [...] to have been ejected in this way after being in the band for over a decade. Early in 2008 Hewitt founded the band Love Amongst Ruin, switching to guitar and singing lead vocals. In August 2012 he became the drummer of the reformed Six by Seven.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1997, Weld was {{nominated}} to become United States Ambassador to Mexico by President Bill Clinton. His nomination stalled after Senate Foreign Relations committee Chairman Jesse Helms refused {{to hold a}} hearing on the nomination, effectively blocking it. Helms was also a Republican and their party held the majority in the chamber, but Helms objected to Weld's moderate stance on social issues such as his support for gay rights, abortion rights, and the legalization of medical marijuana. This refusal to hold hearings was also rumored to be at the request of former United States Attorney General and friend of Helms, Edwin Meese. Meese reportedly had a long-standing grudge against Weld stemming from Weld's investigation of Meese during the Iran-Contra affair. Meese denied the speculation, asserting that he wished to keep his distance from Weld. Weld publicly criticized Helms, which the White House discouraged him from doing, but Weld relished the opportunity, saying: [...] "It feels <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> campaign. I feel newly energized. I love to stir up the pot. I seem to click on more cylinders when the pot is stirred up." [...] Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that Weld's chances of being confirmed weren't [...] "very good, and that he hurt himself by attacking the chairman unfairly and with political rhetoric that was just uncalled for." [...] There was speculation that the White House would let his nomination [...] "die", but he refused, saying that he hoped President Clinton [...] "does not plan to give in to ideological extortion" [...] and that [...] "I wanted to send a message that I wanted to be captain of my ship [...] even if it's going to bottom." [...] Some speculated that attacking the more conservative Helms was a way to position him to pick up votes from fellow moderate Republicans in a potential run for president in 2000, but he rejected this, saying that [...] "I've {{had a lot of people}} come up to me on the street and say, 'Give 'em hell. That's the Bill Weld we know and love.'" ...|$|E

40|$|Participation {{in after}} school {{programs}} {{is associated with}} increases in academic achievement and improved behavior in students at risk. Process evaluation data from participants and key stakeholders was used to gauge implementation, satisfaction, and program attendance of an after school arts program. Lack of scheduling flexibility resulted in low attendance. Students and community partners reported problems with school staff. Students reported being less likely to react negatively to teachers and peers, and <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> safe place. Careful selection of staff members who provide autonomy, perceptions of safety, and varied activities may result in increased program attendance and satisfaction.

He was no ways jagged, but thawed--thawed, Sir, and among friends. They began {{discussing}} previous scraps all along the old man's beat--about sixty of 'em--as well as side- shows with other generals and columns.

60|$|The {{coach was}} fairly full of people, {{returning}} from market. On these railways the third class coaches are not divided into compartments.

60|$|One hears {{everything}} from a tent. It seems {{to stand in the}} midst of the world. It is <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> diving-bell under water. Life goes on almost uninterruptedly. The girl heard a hundred obscure, singular, sibilant sounds, as of serpents conferring. Mysterious footsteps advanced, paused, retreated. Whispered colloquies arose among the leaves, giving her heart disquiet. Every unfamiliar sound was a threat. The voices of birds and beasts no longer interested her--they scared her; and, try as she would to banish these fancies, her nerves thrilled with every rush of the wind. It was deep night before she dropped asleep.|$|E
60|$|From their {{platform}} a stair {{descended into}} the house, {{and the children}} and the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the way. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothing more; so after a time they came back to the platform again. Had there been any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of the house been so thick and stout, escape could have been easy; but to remain down below was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cellar or the hold of a ship, and they did not like the darkness or the damp smell.|$|E

Still, after all, there is nothing <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house of one's own; and it would give Polly and me something to do to see after the housekeeping. Besides, Harry said that he wanted a place where he could have men in of an evening to have a glass of grog and smoke a pipe with him; for, although he did not mind smoking when alone with us, he said he did not wish the room where his sisters were to look like the bar parlour in a public-house.|$|E
60|$|Phoebe {{had only}} time to utter a {{somewhat}} melancholy 'Very likely,' before Miss Charlecote returned {{to take her}} to her room, the promised brown cupboard, all wainscoted with delicious cedar, so deeply and uniformly panelled, that when shut, the door was not obvious; and it was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> box, for there were no wardrobes, only shelves shut by doors into the wall, which the old usage of the household tradition called awmries (armoires). The furniture was reasonably modern, but not obtrusively so. There was a delicious recess in the deep window, with a seat and a table in it, and a box of mignonette along the sill. It looked out into the little high-walled entrance court, and beyond to the wall of the warehouse opposite; and the roar of the great city thoroughfare came like the distant surging of the ocean. Seldom had young maiden's bower given more satisfaction. Phoebe looked about her as if she hardly knew how to believe in anything so unlike her ordinary life, and she thanked her friend again and again with such enthusiasm, that Miss Charlecote laughed as she told her she liked the old house to be appreciated, since it had, like Pompeii, been potted for posterity.|$|E

Sometimes, through the clouds of smoke, one caught a sight of the Dutchman one was firing at; more often one didn't. There was no time for looking about, I can tell you, and if there had been time there was nothing to see. It was <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> big thunderstorm, with thunderbolts falling all round you, and a smashing and a grinding and a ripping that would have made your hair stand on end if you had only had time to think of it. But we hadn't time. It was 'Now then, my hearties, blaze away! Keep it up, lads! The Dutchmen have pretty near had enough of it!' And then, at last, 'They are running, lads. Run in your guns, and tend the sails.' And then a cheer as loud as we could give--which wasn't much, I can tell you, for we were spent with labour, and half choked with powder, and our tongues parched up with thirst." ...|$|E
