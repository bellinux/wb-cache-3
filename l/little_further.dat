5|$|In Bronze Age Britain {{this was}} an {{important}} seaport. Eleven Bronze Age Britain round barrows sit on the promontory with two more a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> inland. Eleven of the round barrows were excavated; three by Bushe Fox in 1911–12 and eight by Harold St George Gray in 1919 and 1922. Two appear to be undisturbed. Numerous finds including Early Bronze Age axes and cremation urns were recovered from these tumuli, which have been consistently found to be between 3500 and 4000 years old.|$|E

While it aimed to complete the biometric register within four months, <b>little</b> <b>further</b> was reported.

Cartier returned for a time to the United States, where he studied production methods in the new medium of television.|$|E
5|$|The first ambush was {{conducted}} by two platoons from B Company on 27 May 1965 and resulted in significant Indonesian casualties, for no loss to the Australians. The second ambush {{was conducted}} a fortnight later and was set a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> downstream from the last one, this time by a platoon from C Company, occurring on 12 June 1965 and again resulting in heavy Indonesian casualties for no loss to the Australians.|$|E

5|$|Below {{the bridge}} is a small island, after which an {{artificial}} cut built to avoid the circuitous route of the River Rother Navigation heads westwards. The river now discharges over a weir {{at the site of}} the former Hardham corn mill to join the Arun a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> downstream, and the junction is followed by another small island. Hardham lock was necessary because of the drop in levels caused by the mill, and the branch through Hardham tunnel headed due south a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> up the Rother. Exploration of the tunnel was described by an article in Sussex County Magazine in 1953, when both ends were accessible, and again in 2012, when only the southern end was explored. A waterworks has been built over the bed of the canal at the northern end, and the tunnel mouth is within the site. The river continues in a large loop to the east. The Arun Valley railway line crosses it to reach Pulborough railway station. There is another island, with the A29 road crossing both channels. Pulborough Brooks nature reserve is to the east of the loop, and the course then meanders westwards to Greatham Bridge. The bridge consists of eight low elliptical arches, two taller arches, a cast iron span over the navigable channel, and a solid ramp to the east. Although its construction suggests that it is medieval, most of the arches were erected in 1827.|$|E
5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and that the federal authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received <b>little</b> <b>further</b> attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
5|$|Degraded by revolt and fifth-column activity, the 27th Infantry Division Savska {{numbered}} about 2,000 effectives {{when the}} German attack began. The 14th Panzer Division vanguard reached their {{positions in the}} Bilogora range around 08:00, and {{the remnants of the}} division began withdrawing towards Križevci under heavy air attack. When they reached the town around 14:00, they were quickly encircled by German motorised troops that had outflanked them. The divisional headquarters staff escaped, but were captured a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> down the road at Bojnikovec. The remnants of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment had to fight its way towards Bjelovar, but was attacked by German tanks on the outskirts, captured and detained. The 14th Panzer Division continued its almost completely unopposed drive on Zagreb using two routes, KriževciDugo SeloZagreb and BjelovarČazmaIvanić-GradZagreb.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{implies that}} this {{occurred}} {{more or less}} directly after Labraunda, {{but it has also}} been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time to regroup. The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently <b>little</b> <b>further</b> campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} junction, NY22 begins a long curve {{away from the}} state line that has it running due west {{at the end of}} NY40 in North Granville. It heads {{northwest}} a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> until, after passing between Great Meadows and Washington state prisons, it reaches US4 and turns right to join it, resuming its northward course. The overlap with US4, one of the few along Route22 that pairs it with another north–south route, lasts for seven miles (11km) along the base of the Adirondack foothills between the low country and Lake George, before ending in Whitehall, where US4 leaves to assume the east–west course it takes across northern New England.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June a patrol—designated Operation Faun Fare—consisting of 7 Platoon, C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest, {{accompanied}} the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson, the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party, {{left the company}} base at Serikin to mount an ambush on the Sungei Koemba river. The site of the ambush {{was to be a}} <b>little</b> <b>further</b> downstream from the successful action the previous month, being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding. The Australian patrol occupied its intended ambush position early the next morning and proceeded to wait. During the day two boats occupied by civilians were observed and allowed to pass unhindered, as were three more the next morning.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Mounted Division {{was joined}} {{a few hours}} later by the Yeomanry Mounted Division which had left Huj early in the morning.

By the afternoon of 10 November the whole of the Desert Mounted Corps {{with the exception of the}} New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, (still at Tel el Khuweilfe) were in line from a point a little east of Arak el Menshiye to the sea. Both the Australian and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions reconnoitred the left half of the Ottoman line running from Qastina, roughly through Balin and Barqusya, to the neighbourhood of Bayt Jibrin in the foot hills of the Judean Hills.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} with {{upgrading}} the Wakefield branch was {{the dimensions of}} George Leather's cast iron aqueduct over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. Structural analysis showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete aqueduct was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a <b>little</b> <b>further</b> upstream. The complete structure was then pushed into position by hydraulic jacks in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used.|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows. They were built of dressed stone, and are the best-preserved of the original hatches. There is no modern sluice at Conegar Lock, and the change in level has resulted in fast-flowing rapids which have cut back the channel above the lock. A <b>little</b> <b>further</b> south at Fish House Bay, the navigation crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made its {{way back to the}} main river. A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the towpath over the Barton River, but the navigation below this point is dry, with its line occupied by a vegetable garden.|$|E
