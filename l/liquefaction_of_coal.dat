40|$|This Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory {{sponsored}} project developed {{processes for}} converting coal feedstocks to carbon products, including coal-derived pitch, coke foams and fibers based on solvent extraction processes. A key {{technology is the}} use of hydrogenation accomplished at elevated temperatures and pressures to obtain a synthetic coal pitch. Hydrogenation, or partial direct <b>liquefaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> is used to modify the properties of raw coal such that a molten synthetic pitch can be obtained. The amount of hydrogen required to produce a synthetic pitch is about an order of magnitude less than the amount required to produce synthetic crude oil. Hence the conditions for synthetic pitch production consume very little hydrogen and can be accomplished at substantially lower pressure. In the molten state, hot filtration or centrifugation can be used to separate dissolved coal chemicals from mineral matter and insolubles (inertinite), resulting in the production of a purified hydrocarbon pitch. Alternatively, if hydrogenation is not used, aromatic hydrocarbon liquids appropriate for use as precursors to carbon products can obtained by dissolving coal in a solvent. As in the case for partial direct liquefaction pitches, undissolved coal is removed via hot filtration or centrifugation. Excess solvent is boiled off and recovered.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{was to develop a}} new approach for the direct <b>liquefaction</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> to produce an all-distillate product slate at a sizable cost reduction over current technology. The approach integrated coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst impregnation, liquefaction, product recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. Heterofunctional solvents were the most effective in swelling coals. Also solvent blends such as isopropanol/water were more effective than pure solvents alone. Impregnating slurry catalysts simultaneously during coal swelling showed that better uptake was achieved with nonswelling solvent and higher impregnation temperature. Some enhancement in initial coal conversion was seen liquefying SO{sub 2 }-treated Black Thunder coal with slurry catalysts, and also when hydrogen donor liquefaction solvents were used. Noncatalytic reactions showed no benefit from SO{sub 2 } treatment. Coupling coal swelling and SO{sub 2 } treatment with slurry catalysts was also not beneficial, although high conversion was seen with continuous operation and long residence time, however, similar high conversion was observed with untreated coal. SO{sub 2 } treatment is not economically attractive unless it provides about 17 % increase in coal reactivity.

The approach integrates coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst impregnation, liquefaction, product recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and carrying out a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. The primary coal of this program, Black Thunder subbituminous coal, can be effectively beneficiated to about 3. 5 wt % ash using aqueous sulfurous acid pretreatment. This treated coal can be further beneficiated to about 2 wt % ash using commercially available procedures. All three coals used in this study (Black Thunder, Burning Star bituminous, and Martin Lake lignite) are effectively swelled by a number of solvents. The most effective solvents are those having hetero-functionality. laboratory- and bench-scale liquefaction experimentation is underway using swelled and catalyst impregnated coal samples.

Anthrone, Dibutylmethyl phenol, dinaphthyl ether and xanthene were studied to provide a comparison of conversions to deoxygenated products. Studies of the deoxygenating abilities of these catalyst precursors in coal liquefaction systems have also been performed. Improvements in conversion and product quality are observed. Both these factors are dependent on the coal used. It is also considered that some mineral matters in coal may have catalytic actions. Demineralization by successive HCl/HF treatments of a low rank coal has demonstrated that removal of the inherent mineral matter imparts no serious detrimental effect upon low temperature liquefaction. It appears that elimination of such species allows for better access for gaseous H{sub 2 }, as suggested by previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Western Research Institute has {{conducted}} a study of different methods <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> drying as pretreatment steps before <b>liquefaction.</b> The objectives <b>of</b> this study were to develop a combined chemical dehydration/nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method for measuring the moisture content <b>of</b> <b>coal,</b> to measure the changes in coal structure that occur during drying, and {{to determine the effects}} of different drying methods on <b>liquefaction</b> reactivity <b>of</b> <b>coals.</b> Different methods <b>of</b> drying were investigated to determine whether coal drying can be accomplished without reducing the reactivity <b>of</b> <b>coals</b> toward <b>liquefaction.</b> Drying methods included thermal, microwave, and chemical dehydration. <b>Coals</b> <b>of</b> rank lignite to high volatile bituminous were studied. Coals that were dried or partially dried thermally and with microwaves had lower liquefaction conversions than coals containing equilibrium moisture contents. However, chemically dried coals had conversions equal to or greater than the premoisturized coals. The conversion behavior is consistent with changes in the physical structure and cross linking reactions because of drying. Thermal and microwave drying appear to cause a collapse in the pore structure, thus preventing donor solvents such as tetralin from contacting reactive sites inside the coals. Chemical dehydration does not appear to collapse the pore structure. These results are supported by the solvent swelling measurements in which the swelling ratios of thermally dried and microwave-dried coals were lower than those <b>of</b> premoisturized <b>coals,</b> indicating a greater degree of cross linking in the dried coals. The swelling ratios of the chemically dried coals were greater than those <b>of</b> the premoisturized <b>coals</b> because the pore structure remaining unchanged or increased when water was removed. These results are consistent with the NMR results, which did not show significant changes in coal chemical structure...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to optimize the design and operation of the bench scale batch reactor (SCTBR) for studying direct coal liquefaction at short contact times (. 01 to 10 minutes or longer). An additional objective is to study the kinetics <b>of</b> direct <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> particularly at short reaction times. Both of these objectives have been nearly achieved, however this work has shown the great importance <b>of</b> the <b>liquefaction</b> solvent characteristics and the solvent-catalyst interaction on the liquefaction process. This has prompted us to do a preliminary investigation of solvents and the solvent-catalyst systems in coal liquefaction. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1) Conversion vs time data have been extended to 5 <b>coals</b> <b>of</b> ranks from lignite to low volatile bituminous coal. A broad range of reaction rates have been observed with a maximum in the high volatile bituminous range. 2) A series <b>of</b> direct <b>coal</b> <b>liquefaction</b> runs have been made using a range of nitrogen containing solvents that given high <b>liquefaction</b> conversions <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> These runs are now being analyzed. 3) The coalification process has been shown by TGA to go through an intermediate stage which may account for the greater reactivity <b>of</b> bituminous <b>coals</b> in the direct coal liquefaction process. 4) It was shown that coal rank can be accurately determined by thermogravimetric analysi...|$|R
