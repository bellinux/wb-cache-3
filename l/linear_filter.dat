25|$|Even {{though this}} is not what is {{physically}} done, an identical output can be generated by applying the hypothetical sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), to a linear, time-invariant system, otherwise known as a <b>linear</b> <b>filter</b> with such characteristics (which, for an LTI system, are fully described by the impulse response) so that each input impulse results in the correct piecewise linear function in the output.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal <b>linear</b> <b>filter</b> in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the real system, b) the entering noise is white (uncorrelated) and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore the whiteness property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E

40|$|Images {{are often}} {{degraded}} by noises. Noise can occur during image capture, transmission, etc. Noise removal {{is an important}} task in image processing. In general {{the results of the}} noise removal have a strong influence {{on the quality of the}} image processing technique. Several techniques for noise removal are well established in color image processing. The nature of the noise removal problem depends on the type of the noise corrupting the image. In the field of image noise reduction several linear and non <b>linear</b> <b>filtering</b> methods have been proposed. <b>Linear</b> <b>filters</b> are not able to effectively eliminate impulse noise as they have a tendency to blur the edges of an image. On the other hand non <b>linear</b> <b>filters</b> are suited for dealing with impulse noise. Several non <b>linear</b> <b>filters</b> based on Classical and fuzzy techniques have emerged in the past few years.
