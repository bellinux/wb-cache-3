It wants to have a House of Commons which is not weighted with nominees of the landed class, but with representatives of the other interests.

6000|$|Ah, {{not in the}} wastes of Speculation, nor {{the sterile}} din of Politics, were 'the haunts meet for thee.' Watching the yellow bees in the ivy bloom, and the {{reflected}} pine forest in the water-pools, watching the sunset as it faded, and the dawn as it fired, and weaving all fair and fleeting things into a tissue where light and music were at one, that was the task of Shelley! 'To ask you for anything human,' you said, 'was <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a leg of mutton at a gin-shop.' Nay, rather, like asking Apollo and Hebe, in the Olympian abodes, to give us beef for ambrosia, and port for nectar. Each poet gives what he has, and what he can offer; you spread before us fairy bread, and enchanted wine, and shall we turn away, with a sneer, because, {{out of all the}} multitudes of singers, one is spiritual and strange, one has seen Artemis unveiled? One, like Anchises, has been beloved of the Goddess, and his eyes, when he looks on the common works of common men, are, like the eyes of Anchises, blind with excess of light. Let Shelley sing of what he saw, what none saw but Shelley! ...|$|E

50|$|The Expert Resource Role is {{the most}} common of the three. It assumes the client, the person being helped, is seeking {{information}} or expert service that they cannot provide for themselves. For example, simple issues <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> directions or more complex issues like an organization hiring a financial consultant will fall into this category.|$|E
5000|$|These signals often {{indicate}} that the sender is {{trying to decide whether}} he or she is interested in the [...] "receiver". However, some individuals, instead of playing along, will overestimate the sender's interest and do something more obvious, <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a phone number. This can be clumsy and confusing to both parties, and understanding the concept of protean signals is useful for avoiding such missteps. Misinterpreting those cues and responding to them overeagerly is commonly said to happen to men more than women, although both can suffer when this happens.|$|E

From everyday tasks <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> directions and ordering food to more difficult situations like financial advice or finding housing; Asian Americans have a tough time adjusting to American lifestyle, especially if they were not born here learning the language.|$|E

Creationist cosmology, however, holds that the cause of the universe does lie outside time and space: a 1981 law from the US state of Arkansas setting out six cardinal tenets of [...] "creation science", described the first as the principle that the universe, energy and life were the result of [...] "sudden creation ... from nothing." [...] The idea that God created the world [...] "out of nothing" [...] has been a fundamental tenet of Christian theology since the 2nd century, but scholars agree that the idea is not actually in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible, and is found no earlier than later Judaism.|$|E
50|$|Laurie Stark is {{very excited}} when popular, {{athletic}} Quentin Palmer (Quin for short) asks her {{out on a}} date. While they are on their date, Analise Bower is babysitting. After her job has ended, she doesn't feel <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a ride. She knows the roads and feels safer on her bike. While riding back home in Quin's mother's SUV, Laurie falls asleep and is awakened by a crash. Quin assures {{her that it was}} only a deer he mistakenly hit, though he isn't so sure himself. Seeing that the crash had damaged some property, Quin covers the scene and drives away. Sometime after the accident, Analise's talented boyfriend Jeremy receives a call from her parents concerning Analise's location. For a few days, Jeremy and Mr. and Mrs. Bower try to locate Analise. They are unsuccessful and hand the case over to the police. One morning, the police announce that they found Analise injured. Because of the attempt to cover the accident, the case is therefore called a hit and run. In the hospital, the doctors say that Analise has gone in coma because of a serious head injury.|$|E
5000|$|A new {{subscriber}} asks to be {{subscribed to}} the mailing list, but unlike unconfirmed or single opt-in, a confirmation email {{is sent to}} verify it was really them. Generally, unless the explicit step is taken to verify the end-subscriber's e-mail address, such as clicking a special web link or sending back a reply email, {{it is difficult to}} establish that the e-mail address in question indeed belongs to the person who submitted the request to receive the e-mail. Using a confirmed opt-in (COI) (also known as a Double opt-in) procedure helps to ensure that a third party is not able to subscribe someone else accidentally, or out of malice, since if no action is taken {{on the part of the}} e-mail recipient, they will simply no longer receive any messages from the list operator. Mail system administrators and non-spam mailing list operators refer to this as confirmed subscription or closed-loop opt-in. Some marketers call closed-loop opt-in [...] "double opt-in". This term was coined by marketers in the late 90s to differentiate it from what they call [...] "single opt-in", where a new subscriber to an email list gets a confirmation email telling them they will begin to receive emails if they take no action. Some marketers contend that [...] "double opt-in" [...] is <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> permission twice and that it constitutes unnecessary interference with someone who has already said they want to hear from the marketer. However, it does drastically reduce the likelihood of someone being signed up to an email list by another person.|$|E

Almost one-quarter of school-aged children are now overweight or obese. While the causes of obesity are complex and many, children’s exposure to high levels of unhealthy food marketing is one factor that affects the food and drinks that children <b>like,</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for,</b> buy and consume. Extensive research evidence has found that, in general, children are exposed to high levels of food marketing, most of which is for unhealthy or high fat, sugar and/or salt food and drinks.

5000|$|Closer to home, {{he gives}} this example: [...] "If someone fixing a broken water pipe says, 'Hand me the wrench,' his co-worker will not, {{generally}} speaking, say, 'And what do I get for it?' ... The {{reason is simple}} efficiency... : if you really care about getting something done, {{the most efficient way}} to go about it is obviously to allocate tasks by ability and give people whatever they need to do them." [...] Moreover, we tend to ask and give without thinking for things like asking directions, or small courtesies <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> a light, or even for a cigarette. It seems more legitimate to ask a stranger for a cigarette than for an equivalent amount of cash, or even food; in fact, if one has been identified as a fellow smoker, it's rather difficult to refuse such a request. In such cases—a match, a piece of information, holding the elevator—one might say the [...] "from each" [...] element is so minimal that most of us comply without even thinking about it. Conversely, the same is true if another person's need—even a stranger's—is particularly spectacular or extreme: if he is drowning, for example. If a child has fallen onto the subway tracks, we assume that anyone who is capable of helping her up will do so. The thing which makes it [...] "everyday" [...] is this argument: [...] "communism is the foundation of all human sociability. It is what makes society possible. There is always an assumption that anyone who is not actually an enemy can be expected to act on the principle of [...] "from each according to their abilities," [...] at least to an extent, which is to say, the extent just described.|$|E

40|$|AbstractViolence {{which is}} a form of {{physical}} aggression is on the rise among adolescents. Verbal and physical aggressions are associated with anger. Although anger is a common and natural emotion, problems associated with inappropriate expression of anger remain among the most serious concerns of parents, educators, and the mental health community. The aim of this descriptive study was to ascertain the behavioral and emotional effects of expression of anger and ways of managing anger among adolescents. Subjects for this study were 1162 (552 male and 610 female) adolescents age between 14 to 16 years old. They were randomly selected from all public schools in the state of Selangor in West Malaysia. The instrument used was developed based on the definition of anger and the eight dimensions suggested by Sisco (1991), Novaco (1994) and Spielberger (1988). Nearly everyone in the study said that they had experienced anger. When angry, 7. 1 % hit other people while 25. 1 resort to hitting objects while 27. 8 % became aggressive verbally or cursing. More than 50 % seemed to have regretted expressing their anger while 44. 7 % felt <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> forgiveness.

30|$|The {{simulated}} study, however, can {{consist of}} nearly 100 students {{the same as}} those in the sample of the real study. The participants may first take a paper-and-pencil test of English proficiency in order to test their homogeneity at the initial stage and match them against their English ability (matching subtest). The students in this group can then take part in an attitude toward paper-and-pencil assessment survey. In the real study, the students should sit in front of their computers with the CATSIB program already implemented on each computer (to ensure test security), and in the registration stage, they may fill out a background questionnaire form <b>like</b> <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> their age, gender, language, educational, and cultural backgrounds, as well as computer and technology familiarity. They can then start the MSCAT of their English proficiency. Finally, an attitude toward MSCAT questionnaire can be administered among the participants in order to see how they felt about their MSCAT experiences and to possibly find out their feedback (suggestions, weaknesses, etc.). So, first, the examinees can be given a paper-and-pencil test of English proficiency in order to control for the effect of proficiency affecting DIF. Then, in {{the next step in the}} construction of the computer-adaptive test, the researchers can estimate the difficulty of a large number of items that are to be used in the test. This process, known as item calibration, involves administering test items to a sample of examinees representative of the sample who will be given the computer-adaptive test.|$|E

Esse contexto implica diretamente em motivos encontrados pelos indivíduos para aprender, como {{resolver}} um problema, por exemplo, levando os mesmos a utilizarem diferentes estratégias no processo de aprendizagem. As estratégias podem ter um caráter informal, como pedir ajuda aos colegas, pesquisar material escrito, ou formal, como participar de cursos oferecidos pela empresa. Este estudo procurou mensurar e compreender quais estratégias de aprendizagem são mais utilizadas de acordo com quatro finalidades identificadas {{no local}} de trabalho: resolver um problema, executar uma nova tarefa, obter autonomia e aumentar as chances de crescimento na empresa. A amostra foi composta por 463 profissionais que atuam na linha de produção de uma empresa do ramo automotivo. Foram realizadas análises fatoriais confirmatórias para se garantir a validade e confiabilidade das medidas, posteriormente, os escores fatoriais foram utilizados nas comparações do uso de cada estratégia de aprendizagem para cada finalidade. Os resultados demonstraram que as estratégias de aprendizagem utilizadas não diferem conforme as quatro finalidades apresentadas. Dentre as estratégias pesquisadas, a mais utilizada é a ajuda interpessoal, ou seja, buscar informações e conhecimentos com outras pessoas. As estratégias menos utilizadas são a consulta a material escrito e a participação em cursosThe growth of competitiveness has forced organizations {{to adapt and}} reinvent themselves constantly.

This study aimed to measure and understand which learning strategies are mostly used according to four different objective identified in the workplace: solving a problem, performing a new task, obtaining autonomy and increasing the growth chances in the company. The sample was consisted of 4632 workers from the production line in an automotive company. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to ensure the validity and reliability of the measures subsequently, the factor scores {{were used in the}} comparisons of the use of each learning strategy for each purpose.
