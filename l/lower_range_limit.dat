40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 What factors {{determine}} where species occur, known as their geographic <b>range</b> <b>limits?</b> This classic ecological question has fascinated scientists for centuries, and {{is even more}} relevant today, {{in the face of}} anthropogenic climate change. Unfortunately, despite decades of research, we still lack a full understanding of the ecological processes driving <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Of particular interest, given forecasted global warming, {{is the extent to which}} climate determines species' <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> If climate is important in controlling species' <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> then <b>ranges</b> will likely shift up in elevation, as temperatures rise. This research examined how climatic factors, including temperature and precipitation, interact with biotic factors (specifically, competition between plants) to determine the distributions of common conifers on Mt. Rainier. I conducted observational studies of adult and sapling tree rings, as well as an experiment, in which seeds and seedlings were transplanted across species' altitudinal ranges and beyond their <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> into different competitive environments. Taken together, my studies suggest that climate limits growth and survival at high elevations, while competition is more important at low elevations. These results support a classic, but little tested, hypothesis: biotic factors, such as competition, are more important at <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> while abiotic factors, such as temperature, control upper <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Furthermore, these results suggest that climate change will lead to increased tree growth and upward expansion of Mt. Rainier's forests, beyond current high elevation treeline. Climate change will likely have less dramatic effects at low elevations, where climate does not appear to strongly limit growth and survival of focal tree species, but competitive dynamics between plants do limit growth and survival. More experimental studies of other biotic interactions, diverse species, and widespread locations are necessary to better understand effects of climate change, and to prioritize conservation and natural resource management efforts...|$|R

The determination of dynamic velocity u* and velocity {{at the height of}} + 10 m above the dusting surface u 10 which are necessary to evaluate the dust intensity has been demonstrated. The method is based on two-dimensional numerical model of atmosphere aerodynamics in the area of "tailing dumps of ANOF- 2 ‒ the town of Apatity". The study provides calculations of horizontal velocity at the height of + 10 m above the dusting surface at the wind speed varying from 5 to 23 m/sec.

40|$|I {{propose that}} random method error be {{expressed}} {{as a percentage of}} the range(s) of clinical interest (upper range limit minus <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit),</b> in addition to its usual forms of presentation. The interpretation of this percent random error is simple because a given per-centage error implies the same reliability, regardless of test or range of clinical interest. Two different upper limits for percent random analytical error are suggest-ed, based on the medical application of the test and the statistical properties of various amounts of error. When the purpose of the test is to distinguish an upper medi-cally defined limit from a lower medically defined limit, a maximum random error equivalent to 60 % of the dif-ference between the limits is proposed. If the purpose of the test is to monitor values in the neighborhood of a normal range or therapeutic range, an upper limit for random error equal to 20 % of the difference between the limits of the range is suggested. Additional Keyphrases: statistics #{ 149 } systematic error #{ 149 } more informative reporting of results The maximum acceptable random analytical error for a method is related to the range or interval of values for which the method is used.

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{invasive}} plants along elevational gradients {{is considered a}} threat to fragile mountain ecosystems, {{but it can also}} provide the opportunity to better understand some of the basic processes driving the success of invasive species. Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae) is an invasive plant of global importance and has a broad distribution along elevational gradients in the Western Himalayas. Our study aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary processes (e. g. local adaptation and clinal differentiation) and different life history stages in shaping the distribution pattern of the invasive plant along an elevational gradient in the Western Himalaya. We carried out extensive distributional surveys, established a reciprocal transplant experiment with common gardens at three elevational levels, and measured a suite of traits related to germination, growth, reproduction and phenology. Our results showed a lack of local adaptation, and we did not find any evidence for clinal differentiation in any measured trait except a rather weak signal for plant height. We found that seed germination was the crucial life-cycle transition in determining the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> while winter mortality of plants shaped the upper range limit in our study area, thus explaining the hump shaped distribution pattern. Differences in trait values between gardens for most traits indicated a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Possible causes such as apomixis, seed dispersal among sites, and pre-adaptation might have confounded evolutionary processes to act upon. Our results suggest that the success and spread of Ageratina adenophora are dependent on different life history stages at different elevations that are controlled by abiotic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Aim We {{examined}} whether species occurrences {{are primarily}} limited by physiological tolerance in the abiotically more stressful end of climatic gradients (the asymmetric abiotic stress limitation (AASL) hypothesis) and the geographical predictions of this hypothesis: abiotic stress mainly determines upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal species <b>range</b> <b>limits,</b> {{and the importance}} of abiotic stress for these <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> increases the further northwards and upwards a species occurs. Location Europe and the Swiss Alps. Methods The AASL hypothesis predicts that species have skewed responses to climatic gradients, with a steep decline towards the more stressful conditions. Based on presence-absence data we examined the shape of plant species responses (measured as probability of occurrence) along three climatic gradients across latitudes in Europe (1577 species) and altitudes in the Swiss Alps (284 species) using Huisman-Olff-Fresco, generalized linear and generalized additive models. Results We found that almost half of the species from Europe and one-third from the Swiss Alps showed responses consistent with the predictions of the AASL hypothesis. Cold temperatures and a short growing season seemed to determine the upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> of up to one-third of the species, while drought provided an important constraint at lower-latitudinal <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> for up to one-fifth of the species. We found a biome-dependent influence of abiotic stress and no clear support for abiotic stress as a stronger upper range-limit determinant for species with higher latitudinal and altitudinal distributions. However, the overall influence of climate as a range-limit determinant increased with latitude. Main conclusions Our results support the AASL hypothesis for almost half of the studied species, and suggest that temperature-related stress controls the upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> of a large proportion of these species, while other factors including drought stress may be important at the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits...</b>|$|R

Here, we investigate changes in the elevational distribution of dung beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in two separate mountain regions in Europe. Location: South-western Alps (France) and Sierra Nevada (Spain). Methods: We compared historical and current data on dung beetle distributions along elevation gradients for 30 species in the SW Alps and 19 species in the Sierra Nevada. We tested for significant changes between survey periods in three parameters: mean elevation and upper and <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Results: We found up-slope range shifts for 63 % and 90 % of the species in the SW Alps and Sierra Nevada, respectively. Up-slope range shifts resulted mainly from expansion of upper <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> in the SW Alps and from changes of both <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> in the Sierra Nevada.

40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} altitudinal range {{shifts of}} bryophytes in Switzerland by comparing recent altitudinal distributions with historical distributions derived from herbarium specimens. Location Switzerland, covering 41, 285 km 2 in Central Europe. Methods We used a dataset of 8520 herbarium specimens of 61 bryophyte species and compared altitudinal data {{between the two}} periods 1880 – 1920 and 1980 – 2005. The records we used were not specifically sampled for climatological analyses, but originate from non-systematic fieldwork by various collectors. Historical and recent records were distributed all over Switzerland with occurrences in all major biogeographical areas. To account for different sampling efforts in the two time periods, different subsampling procedures were applied. Results Overall, we found a significant mean increase in altitude of 89 ± 29 m which was mainly driven by the cryophilous species (+ 222 ± 50 m). The mean increase in altitude of cryophilous species corresponds to a decadal upward shift of 24 m. The upper range limit of cryophilous species also increased by 189 ± 55 m, {{but there was no}} effect on the <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limit.</b> For intermediate and thermophilous species neither mean, nor upper or lower range limits changed. However, the proportion of records of thermophilous to cryophilous species increased considerably at lower altitudes, but levelled off above approximately 1800 m. Main conclusions We conclude that cryophilous bryophytes are expanding their range to higher elevations in Switzerland and that at lower elevations, a slow extinction process is going on, probably as a result of climate warming trends. The observed decadal upward shifts of cryophilous species closely match those reported from vascular plants in Europe and those expected, given recent estimates of climate warming trends.

In this study, we present {{the results of a}} resurvey of a plot-based phytosociological study from Sikkilsdalen, central Norway, originally executed between 1922 and 1932. By using a detailed phytosociological study we are able to investigate several aspects of elevational shifts in species ranges. Here we tested for upward and downward shifts in observed upper and lower distribution limits of species, as well as changes in species optima along an elevational gradient, and related the observed range shifts to species traits that could explain the observed trends. More species shifted upwards than downwards, independently of whether we were investigating shifts in species’ upper or <b>lower</b> distribution <b>ranges</b> or in species optima. However, shifts in species upper range margins changed independently of their <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> margins. Linking different species traits to the magnitude of shifts we found that species with a higher preference for prolonged snow cover shifted upwards more in their upper elevational limits and in their optima than species that prefer a shorter snow cover, whereas no species traits were correlated with the magnitude of changes in lower limits. The observed change in species ranges concord both with studies on other mountains in the region and with studies from other alpine areas. Furthermore, our study indicates that different factors are influencing species ranges at the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits.</b> Increased precipitation rates and increased temperatures are considered the most important factors for the observed changes, probably mainly through altering the pattern in snow cover dynamics in the area...|$|R

40|$|The {{aeronautical}} industry, {{more precisely}} the aircraft manufacturing sector, is a demanding business {{area in which}} the design development cycles are continuously shrinking whilst the technical requirements are becoming more stringent due to the fierce competition. The present work considers the adoption of the multidisciplinary design optimization concept, which is also known by the MDO acronym, as a way of adapting to this new reality. In the MDO concept, the design is performed in a concurrent fashion through the integration of the engineering processes in environments know as ``frameworks';';. The work presents the development of a set of tools that can be adopted as numerical procedures inside existing frameworks or they can be coupled to create the basic structure of an open MDO framework, focused in aeronautical engineering and with special attention to aerodynamic design problems. These tools are embedded in different modules and they are employed in a series of study cases focused in aeronautical applications. These studies have shown how aspects associated with the choice of the geometrical parameterization and the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> of the parametric variables can yield different geometries during the optimization process. Moreover, the present work shows that only those geometric parameterizations that consider high order polynomials can guarantee that the same final geometry is achieved {{at the end of the}} optimization process. The increase in the polynomial order leads to optimized solutions with lower drag coefficients. The aerodynamic optimizations performed with a neural network have shown the benefits that the approximation methods can provide in terms of computational cost. The complete set of tools developed during this work can contribute to improve the capability of the Computational Fluid Dynamics group at Instituto de Aeronáutica e Espaço (IAE) and at Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) by the incorporation of this open environment for analysis and multidisciplinary optimizations.

40|$|Understanding the {{processes}} that create and maintain species' geographic <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> has implications for many questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. Many expectations for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations at the range margin rest on the concordance of geographic limits {{and the limits of}} a species' ecological niche. If <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> are coincident with niche limits, then marginal populations should have lower and/or more variable vital rates and population growth rates than central populations. Using data from 8 annual censuses of marked individuals, I investigated the demography of Mimulus cardinalis and Mimulus lewisii across the species' elevation ranges. Central and marginal populations exhibited striking demographic differences, but only for one species were differences in expected directions. Marginal populations from the M. lewisii <b>lower</b> elevation <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> had <b>lower</b> and more variable survival than central populations and appeared to be demographic sinks. In contrast, marginal populations from the M. cardinalis upper elevation limit had higher fecundity and higher population growth rates than central populations. Although the species differed with respect to central-marginal patterns, they were concordant with respect to elevation; that is, both species had higher fitness in higher reaches of their examined ranges. Potential explanations for these patterns include source-sink dynamics, with asymmetrical gene flow mediated by river currents, and climate change, with recent warming shifting the species' climatic envelopes to higher elevations. Hence, assessment of spatiotemporal variation in both demography and dispersal is necessary to fully understand the relationship between the niche and species' distributions...|$|R

Predictions of species' responses to climate change, incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal, {{allow us to}} explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns, shifts {{at the edge of}} the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For Romerolagus diazi (volcano rabbit), the <b>lower</b> elevation <b>range</b> <b>limit</b> shifted upslope by approximately 700  m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation, as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare), we modelled the British metapopulation. Increasing the dispersive estimate caused the metapopulation to shift faster on the northern range margin (leading edge). By contrast, it caused the metapopulation to respond to climate change slower, rather than faster, on the southern range margin (trailing edge). The differential responses of the leading and trailing range margins and the relative sensitivity of <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> to climate change compared with that of the metapopulation centroid have important implications for where conservation monitoring should be targeted.

Three-dimensional two-phase flow of gas and liquid is considered in which the interaction was modeled based on the concept of phasic volume defined in the Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model through k-epsilon Simulation. All governing equations including surface tension and wall adhesion are solved simultaneously using the FLUENT code. Gas-liquid interfaces and the existence of froth regime are clearly visualized via VOF model. Due to the importance of trays, it is vital to predict <b>lower</b> operating <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> for such gas-liquid contacting devices. Weeping phenomenon is observed in bubbling regime and occurs at low vapour flow rates. To approach this aim, continuity and momentum equations are solved simultaneously for the fluid on tray and the results were compared with data of sieve trays.

40|$|AbstractSeesaw {{models with}} a small lepton number {{breaking}} can naturally accommodate electroweak-scale pseudo-Dirac neutrinos with a sizable mixing with the active neutrinos, while satisfying the light neutrino oscillation data. Due to the smallness of the lepton number breaking parameter, the ‘smoking gun’ collider signature of same-sign dileptons is suppressed, and the heavy neutrinos in these models would manifest at the LHC dominantly through lepton number conserving trilepton final states. Using the recent CMS results for anomalous production of multilepton events at the s= 8  TeV LHC with an integrated luminosity of 19. 5  fb− 1, we derive direct upper bounds on the light-heavy neutrino mixing parameter {{as a function of}} the heavy Dirac neutrino mass. These limits extend the collider sensitivity to higher heavy neutrino masses up to about 500 GeV. In the <b>lower</b> mass <b>range,</b> our <b>limits</b> are comparable to the existing indirect constraints derived from Higgs and electroweak precision data...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} {{constraints}} on the lifetime of decaying gravitino dark matter in models with bilinear R-parity violation derived from observations of cosmic-ray antiprotons with the PAMELA experiment. Performing a scan over a viable set of cosmic-ray propagation parameters we find <b>lower</b> <b>limits</b> <b>ranging</b> from 8 × 10 ^ 28 s to 6 × 10 ^ 28 s for gravitino masses from roughly 100 GeV to 10 TeV. Comparing these limits to constraints derived from gamma-ray and neutrino observations we conclude that the presented antiproton limits are currently the strongest and most robust limits on the gravitino lifetime in the considered mass range. These constraints correspond to upper limits {{on the size of}} the bilinear R-parity breaking parameter in the range of 10 ^- 8 to 8 × 10 ^- 13.

These events, produced at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at s√= 7 [*][*]TeV, were recorded by the ATLAS detector. The data sample, collected throughout 2011, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4. 9 and 5. 0 [*][*]fb− 1 in the e+e− and μ+μ− channels, respectively. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectation are observed. Using a Bayesian approach, 95 % confidence level <b>lower</b> <b>limits</b> <b>ranging</b> from 9. 0 to 13. 9 TeV are placed on the energy scale of ℓℓqq contact interactions in the left-left isoscalar model. <b>Lower</b> <b>limits</b> <b>ranging</b> from 2. 4 to 3. 9 TeV are also set on the string scale in large extra dimension models. After combining these limits with results from a similar search in the diphoton channel, slightly more stringent limits are obtained.

40|$|ArticleABSTRACT Aim There {{is little}} {{consensus}} {{about the relative}} roles of biotic versus abiotic factors in setting limits to species distributions or in generating geographical patterns of species richness. However, despite the probable importance of host availability in governing the distribution and diversity of consumers, few studies have simultaneously tested the effects of resource distribution and diversity on consumer ranges and richness patterns. Location Sierra de Guadarrama, central Spain. Methods We {{examined the effects of}} biotic resources, consumer attributes and climate on the ranges and species richness patterns of 43 specialist butterflies at 40 sites over a 1800 -m elevational gradient. Evidence for resource use was based on comprehensive field records of oviposition and larval feeding on host plants. Results We show that limitation by either biotic interactions with resources (the distributions and parts eaten of the larval host plants) or intrinsic dispersal ability was stronger at upper than <b>lower</b> elevational <b>range</b> <b>limits</b> for butterflies. Both resource and consumer richness followed a unimodal, humped pattern over the elevational gradient, but host plant richness peaked 300 m lower than butterfly richness. In addition, whereas changes in butterfly species richness were roughly symmetrical around peak richness over the gradient studied, the host plants showed markedly lower species richness at high elevations (> 1750 m). Butterfly species richness increased with host plant resource diversity and relative humidity, with a steeper response to host plant richness in cooler sites (at higher elevations). Main conclusions The results demonstrate the role of bottom-up control by resource availability in limiting consumer distributions and richness. Importantly, resource limitation had increasing relevance towards the coolest parts of environmental gradients and those poorest in resource species, with potential consequences for ecological responses to environmental change.

40|$|Emitter {{discharge}} of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) decreases {{as a result}} of the overpressure in the soil water at the discharge orifice. In this paper, the variation in dripper discharge in SDI laterals is studied. First, the emitter coefficient of flow variation CVq was measured in laboratory experiments with drippers of 2 and 4 L/h that were laid both on the soil and beneath it. Additionally, the soil pressure coefficient of variation CVhs was measured in buried emitters. Then, the irrigation uniformity was simulated in SDI and surface irrigation laterals under the same operating conditions and uniform soils; sandy and loamy. CVq was similar for the compensating models of both the surface and subsurface emitters. However, CVq decreased for the 2 -L/h non-compensating model in the loamy soil. This shows a possible self-regulation of non-compensating emitter discharge in SDI, due to the interaction between effects of emitter discharge and soil pressure. This resulted in the irrigation uniformity of SDI non-compensating emitters to be greater than surface drip irrigation. The uniformity with pressure-compensating emitters would be similar in both cases, provided the overpressures in SDI are less than or equal to the compensation <b>range</b> <b>lower</b> <b>limit...</b>|$|R
