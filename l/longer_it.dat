5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|E
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up <b>longer.</b> <b>It</b> meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|Divided is an American {{television}} {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) {{based on the}} British series of the same name. Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on answers to questions they are given. The <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> takes the team {{to come to an}} agreement, the less money the team earns for each question. The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration.|$|E

5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is left on the clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

25|$|Another {{variation}} of the regression hypothesis is the best learned-last-forgotten hypothesis, which emphasizes the intensity {{and quality of the}} acquired knowledge, not the order in which it is learned. Therefore, the better something is learned, the <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> will remain. Because the language component is repeated again and again, it becomes automated and increases the probability that it will last in the memory (Schöpper-Grabe 1998: 241).|$|E

The plates on its back were perhaps not as tall, but were <b>longer.</b> <b>It</b> possibly had a deeper skull than Stegosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{stabilising}} {{force was}} lower than the force available in the pinch, it lasted considerably <b>longer.</b> <b>It</b> appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the Lawson criterion from a different direction; through extended confinement times rather than increased density.

Today this approach is known as the reversed field pinch (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include {{sleepiness}} and trouble with coordination. Serious side effects are rare. They include suicide, decreased breathing, {{and an increased}} risk of seizures if used too frequently in those with epilepsy. Occasionally excitement or agitation may occur. Long term use can result in tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms on dose reduction. Abrupt stopping after long-term use can be potentially dangerous. After stopping, cognitive problems may persist for six months or <b>longer.</b> <b>It</b> is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Its mechanism of action is by increasing the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA).|$|E

25|$|After {{the opening}} of the loop, the line became a much more profitable. Despite being <b>longer,</b> <b>it</b> could still be run with only seven trams; the higher speed up the Singsaker Hill allowed faster travel times. Ridership in November 1955 was up 33 percent since the {{previous}} November. Subsequently, the Solhaug bus route operated by Trondheim Bilruter had lost sufficient ridership to be terminated. During rush hour, an extra tram was put into service, decreasing the intervals from six to five minutes. Eventually trailers were also put into use. All this was despite a price increase with 50% in 1955.|$|E

25|$|Broken Walrus I {{was made}} of mild steel, a {{material}} which corrodes {{at a faster rate}} than other forms of steel such as cast iron or stainless steel. Mild steel is commonly used because of its cost, ease of use, strength, and ability to take on more deformation without failing. It also corrodes more quickly in outdoor environments, especially moist atmospheres, and causes increased loss of metal due to rusting the <b>longer</b> <b>it</b> is exposed. Broken Walrus I was displayed outdoors for nearly thirty years, through cycles of harsh, midwestern winters and humid summers, causing the structure to become increasingly corroded until it was more efficient to remove the sculpture rather than repair it.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{the theory}} of {{programmed}} death by ageing, individuals from a single species usually live much longer in a protected (laboratory, domestic, civilized) environment than in their wild (natural) environment, reaching ages that would be otherwise practically impossible. Also, in majority of species, there doesn't exist any critical age after which death rates change dramatically, as intended by the programmed death by ageing, but the age-dependence of death rates is very smooth and monotonic. However, as mentioned above, V.P. Skulachev explained that a process of gradual ageing has the advantage of facilitating selection for useful traits by allowing old individuals with a useful trait to live <b>longer.</b> <b>It</b> is also easy to imagine that animals with gradual ageing will live longer in a protected environment.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} and most popular {{intervention}} {{of this nature}} was performed when the artist created a projection for Nelson’s column in Trafalgar Square, London in 1985.
