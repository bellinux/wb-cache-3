40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{the use of}} fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP’s) as a preferred method of retrofitting existing structures has dramatically increased. This has brought about improvements in the mechanical properties of the materials and greater options for engineers and designers. This research has determined the most suitable fibre material to provide a maximum increase in structural performance at the lowest possible cost. Carbon fibre sheet and yarn were used. A unidirectional CFRP sheet and yarn had a cotton sheath attached that was been designed to promote resin impregnation and thus improved bond performance. The test methodology was to statically test concrete beams with surface applied FRP to comparatively examine the flexural strength and toughness. Sixteen beams were manufactured, eight with rebar and eight plain. Carbon fibre sheet and carbon fibre yarn was applied to all beams in equal proportions. The theoretical moment capacity was calculated for the steel reinforced beams using Eurocode 2 and compared against the actual moment capacity derived from the three point loading test. The findings displayed a tendency for higher flexural strength, moment capacity and toughness due to the surface application of FRP composite sheet and yarn. The carbon fibre sheet provided the most suitable form of retrofitted reinforcement. However the <b>loose</b> <b>yarn</b> was 25...|$|E
40|$|The Battle of Trafalgar {{took place}} in 1805 and is {{generally}} accepted to mark the last occasion of combat between major fleets of sailing ships, when a combined Franco-Spanish force of 33 battleships was defeated by a British fleet of 27 battleships blockading Cadiz and the approaches to the Mediterranean Sea. The HMS Victory Trafalgar sail, the fore-topsail from Admiral Lord Nelson’s flagship, was severely damaged and has since suffered significant natural deterioration. As the only extant early 19 th century sail in the world, it is a unique artefact and arguably Britain’s foremost maritime textile treasure. Prior to its display at the bicentennial exhibition in 2005, the sail was analysed by Raman spectroscopy. Complementary tensile tests were also completed on <b>loose</b> <b>yarn</b> from around the damaged areas. The mechanical data and Raman spectral comparisons suggest a good correspondence between the historic sailcloth and surrogate specimens. The latter were prepared by subjecting modern linen canvas to a four-stage regime of artificial ageing {{in an attempt to}} reproduce the weakened state of the 200 -year-old sailcloth, and provide model material to help appreciate the properties of the historic canvas. Detailed analysis suggests that certain Raman signatures are characteristic of ageing and may correlate with reduced performance of the fabric, suggesting that the technique could offer a non-destructive approach to informing the preservation of a national textile heritage...|$|E

30|$|Fabric was {{cut into}} 15  cm square samples. The samples were ironed to reduce {{wrinkling}} {{and to give}} an even surface height for treatment. Samples were then mounted on the stage using double sided sticky tape. Sample surface was made as smooth as possible, and <b>loose</b> <b>yarns</b> were removed or taped down. Once stable plasma was generated, stage was turned on to move sample into the plasma field for the desired exposure time for the pre-deposition surface activation treatment. After the sample passed out of the plasma field, it passed beneath the applicator, which deposited the monomer to condense and graft activated species on the fabric surface. Monomer flow was then turned off. Stage direction was reversed, and the sample passed through the plasma field for second time to induce free radical polymerization of the monomer on the fabric surface. Fabric sample was then removed from the stage and the treatment was done on both the sides.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{reinforcement}} for unidirectional natural fiber composites has been developed, where a paper layer is assembled {{with a layer of}} unidirectional flax yarns. The paper layer chemically and mechanically bonds to the <b>loose</b> <b>yarns</b> to maintain their alignment and enables better manipulability of the reinforcement during stacking in the mold. Unfortunately, the paper layer adversely affects the permeability of the whole reinforcement to liquid resin and thus limits the impregnation quality of the final part. In this paper, a technique is adopted to increase the impregnation performance by modifying the architecture of the fibrous network in the paper layer. In particular, a method has been developed to replace a proportion of the Kraft fibers by short flax fibers in the paper layer, in an attempt to open the structure and increase the paper permeability. Permeability measurements show a major improvement in global reinforcement permeability. Basic mechanical properties of resulting composites were also analysed. Results show a slight decrease in modulus and strength when the paper layer is present. This is compensated by an important reduction in variability. Furthermore, increasing the flax proportion in the paper layer limits the loss of mechanical properties, while reducing variability even further...|$|R
