40|$|In optical dating of potassium-feldspar, the {{luminescence}} signals can be {{stimulated by}} both infrared (IR) light and blue light (BL). To develop reliable dating methods using different stimulation light sources for feldspars, {{it is important}} to understand the sources of the traps associated with the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) and blue light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) and their relationship. In this study, we explored the luminescence characteristics of IRSL and BLSL at different stimulation temperatures (from 60 °C to 200 °C) and their relationship based on five sets of experiments, i. e. post-IR BLSL, post-BL IRSL experiments, pulse annealing test, dose–response test and <b>laboratory</b> <b>fading</b> rate test. Our results suggest that the luminescence characteristics of IRSL and BLSL and their relationship are dependent on stimulation temperature. For IR stimulation at a relatively high temperature of 200 °C, at least two components of IRSL signals are involved in the process. One component of IRSL signals can be easily bleached by BL stimulation at 60 °C, while the other is relatively hard to be bleached by BL stimulation at 60 °C. The two components have different luminescence properties, such as thermal stability, dose–response and <b>laboratory</b> <b>fading</b> rate. postprin...|$|R
40|$|In {{luminescence}} {{measurements of}} potassium-feldspar (K-feldspar), both infrared (IR) and blue light (BL) {{can be used}} as stimulation sources. Component analysis suggests that the blue light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) measured at 60 °C from K-feldspar can be fitted using three components, namely fast, medium and slow. In order to explore the relationship between the origin of the infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal and the different components of the BLSL, five sets of experiments were conducted, namely post-IR BLSL (pIR-BLSL), post-BL IRSL (pBL-IRSL), pulse annealing tests, dose response and <b>laboratory</b> <b>fading</b> rate tests. It is observed that most of the IRSL signal can be bleached by BL, while the BLSL signal can only be partially bleached by the IR. The sources for IRSL are mainly associated with the fast and medium components of the BLSL signal...|$|R
30|$|Fading {{of museum}} {{textiles}} {{has been investigated}} using different <b>laboratory</b> <b>fading</b> simulations {{and the results were}} analyzed using different instrumental techniques such as spectrocolorimetric measurements, chromatography, or mass spectrometry. Crews (1987) examined the fading rates of wool dyed with some of the natural dyes by artificially fading the samples with a weather-O-meter. Whitmore and Cass (1988) and Ye et al. (2000) investigated the fading of silk samples dyed with traditional Japanese or Chinese dyes by exposing the samples in ozone. Grosjean et al. (1987) examined the ozone fading of alizarin and Grosjean et al. (1988) of indigo deposited on Teflon membrane, the degradation product was analyzed using the mass spectrometry analysis. Colombini et al. (2007) examined the degradation of flavonoid yellow dyes such as weld, fustic, and dyer’s broom using GC-MS and the degradation pathway was proposed.|$|R
40|$|Anomalous fading of the {{feldspar}} infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal hampers {{possibilities of}} using feldspar IRSL to obtain burial ages for sediments beyond the dating range of quartz optically stimulated luminescence. Here, we propose {{a new approach}} to quantify anomalous fading of the feldspar IRSL signal over geological burial times based on <b>laboratory</b> <b>fading</b> experiments. The approach builds on the description of the quantum mechanical tunnelling process recently proposed by Huntley [2006. An explanation of the power-law decay of luminescence. J. Phys. Condensed Matter 18, 1359 – 1365]. We show that our methods allow the construction of un-faded and natural IRSL dose–response curves as well as anomalous fading rates in field saturation. The predicted level of field saturation closely approximates the measured saturation level for five samples from fluvial deposits (Lower Rhine) known to be older than 1 Ma. The modelled anomalous fading rate in field saturation (13. 4 % per decade) is close to the measured value of 11. 2 % per decade. These results indicate that the proposed method may allow anomalous fading corrected IRSL dating beyond the linear part of the IRSL dose–response curve...|$|R
40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the sediments from Sulawesi, Indonesia, provides a particular challenge for luminescence dating due to the dim optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) from quartz, and the high anomalous fading rate in the infrared (IR) stimulated luminescence (IRSL) from feldspars. In this study, we present results of dating the sanidine feldspars from 2 samples taken from an archaeological site (Leang Bulu Bettue) in the Maros karsts of South Sulawesi. We tested the post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) procedures {{in order to find}} a stable luminescence signal that is less affected by anomalous fading. It was found that there is a highly variable anomalous fading rate in the IRSL and pIRIR signals for different grains and aliquots, and a low temperature IR stimulation (at 50 ◦C or 100 ◦C) used in a pIRIR procedure cannot completely remove the anomalous fading for the subsequent pIRIR signals. The large uncertainties associated with fading rates prevent the application of fading-correction procedures. We propose a method to obtain reliable De estimates by extrapolation of the relationship between De and <b>laboratory</b> <b>fading</b> rate (g-value). The resultant luminescence ages show consistency with other radiometric age determinations from the site. Our results suggest that a systematic and detailed investigation of the relationship between De and anomalous fading rate for different grains or aliquots is necessary for dating volcanic feldspars.

50|$|In 1922, A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C. Young, {{researchers}} {{working with}} the U.S. Navy, had a transmitter and a receiver {{on opposite sides of}} the Potomac River and discovered that a ship passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, Lawrence A. Hyland at the Naval Research <b>Laboratory</b> observed similar <b>fading</b> effects from a passing aircraft; this led to a patent application as well as a proposal for serious work at the NRL (Taylor and Young were then at this laboratory) on radio-echo signals from moving targets.|$|R
40|$|Natural zircon is {{irradiated}} internally by U and Th impurities. After {{exposure to}} ionizing irradiation zircon exhibits thermoluminescence (TL), {{which can be}} used to calculate the irradiation dose and the sample age. A kinetic model for TL of zircon developed earlier is used to model the processes relevant for dating. The response of zircon to irradiation at different dose rates is simulated for different temperatures. Several scenarios for the dating procedure are considered, including <b>laboratory</b> added irradiation, <b>fading</b> and preheat. It is shown that by irradiating the sample at elevated temperatures one can imitate natural irradiation, i. e. it is possible to reproduce the structural state of the trap system (distribution functions of filled electron and hole traps), which is responsible for the TL behavior. This implies that the dose dependence of the TL signal from samples, which had been irradiated under natural conditions, can be produced by irradiation at an elevated temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOptically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) is a {{well-established}} Quaternary dating method, which {{has recently been}} adapted to application in low-temperature thermochronometry. The Infra-Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) of feldspar, which so far is the most promising target signal in thermochronometry, is unfortunately prone to anomalous fading. The fading of feldspar IRSL is at times not only challenging to measure, but also laborious to incorporate within luminescence growth models. Quantification of IRSL fading is therefore a crucial step in OSL thermochronometry, raising questions regarding (i) reproducibility and reliability of <b>laboratory</b> measurements of <b>fading,</b> as well as (ii) the applicability of existing fading models to quantitatively predict the level of IRSL field saturation in nature. Here we investigate the natural luminescence signal and anomalous fading of IRSL measured at 50 °C (IRSL 50) in 32 bedrock samples collected {{from a variety of}} lithologies and exhumation settings (Alaska and Norway). We report a large span of IRSL 50 fading rates between samples (g 2 days ranging from ∼ 0. 5 to ∼ 45 %/decade), which further demonstrates (i) a good reproducibility between two common fading measurement protocols, and (ii) the ability of tunnelling models to predict the level of feldspar IRSL 50 field saturation in nature. We observe higher IRSL 50 fading in feldspar with increasing Ca content, although other factors cannot be dismissed at present. Finally, our dataset confirms that the applicability of feldspar IRSL 50 in OSL thermochronometry is limited to rapidly-exhuming settings or warm subsurface environments...|$|R
