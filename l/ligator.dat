Gao Wolf's formation special attack is Wolf Attack (Urufu Atakku), whereas it is known as Blue Wolf Attack (Burū Urufu Atakku) in Blue Moon Mode. Gao Wolf can also transform into Gao Silver's Wolf Roader (Urufu Rōdā) motorcycle. Gao Wolf normally forms the left arm of Gao Hunter (Gao Hantā), who is armed with the Crescent Boomerang (Kuresento Būmeran) and <b>Ligator</b> Blade (Rigētā Burēdo). A millennia prior, Gao Hunter was formed by Shirogane using {{the power of the}} Thousand-Year Evil during his battle with Hyakkimaru. However, due to the energy's influence, Gao Hunter assumed an Org-like form called Gao Hunter Evil (Gao Hantā Ibiru) whose signature move is the Evil Sixteenth Night Cut (Mashō Jūrokuya Giri). While as Gao Hunter Evil, it can combine with Gao Giraffe to become Gao Hunter Spear and use Spirit Penetration - Neck Thrust (Seirei Kantetsu Nekku Surasuto) or Gao Bear and Gao Polar to become Gao Hunter Double Knuckle and use Spirit Blaze - Bear Strike (Seirei Enmetsu Beā Sutoraiku). It only once Shirogane revived his Power Animals after the evil is purged from them that Gao Hunter assumed its true form: The [...] "Hunter of Justice" [...] (Seigi no Kariudo) known as Gao Hunter Justice (Gao Hantā Jasutisu). Gao Hunter's attack is the Animal Heart-like Natural Quake - Beast Hurricane (Tenchi Shinkan Bīsuto Harikēn) and uses its <b>Ligator</b> Blade for its Demon Rush - Revolver Phantom (Akki Tokkan Riborubā Fantomu).

The use of energy to deliver heat and coagulate target lesions is commonly practiced. This study compares the histologic effects produced on intestinal tissues by two energy-based systems which employ different approaches of heat delivery. Methods: Two heat delivery systems were evaluated in vivo in a single porcine subject: infrared coagulator and bipolar tissue <b>ligator</b> utilizing constant tissue compression and temperature guidance. Eighteen treatment sites divided into three groups of six were assessed. Treatment site temperature was measured {{and the effects of}} thermal treatment in the mucosa, submucosa, submucosal vessels, and muscularis layer were scored. Lateral thermal spread beyond the energy application site was also assessed. Results: Treatment site temperatures were much lower in the bipolar <b>ligator</b> group than in the infrared coagulator group. The mucosal and submucosal tissue changes observed in tissues treated with infrared energy and bipolar energy at 55 &deg;C were similar. Both the mucosal and submucosal tissue changes with bipolar energy at 50 &deg;C were significantly less. Conclusion: Both devices achieved similar histologic results. However, the unique design of the bipolar <b>ligator,</b> which allows consistent capture, constant compression, and temperature monitoring of target tissue, accomplished the desired histologic changes with less muscular damage at much lower temperatures than the infrared coagulator. The use of bipolar ligation could offer clinical advantages such as reduced patient pain and a minimized chance of heat-related collateral tissue damage.

40|$|Aim: due to surgery's high {{mortality}} and morbidity, local therapeutic techniques {{are required for}} Barrett's high-grade dysplasia (BHGD) and early gastric cancer (EGC). Various techniques are available for endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in the GI tract. The "suck and cut" technique, which uses a transparent cap or modified multiband variceal <b>ligator,</b> is usually the most practiced method. A multiband <b>ligator</b> (ML) allows sequential resection {{without the need for}} submucosal injection and endoscope withdrawal. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of EMR with a ML device in the treatment of Barrett's high-grade dysplasia and early gastric cancer. Patients and methods: prospective study. Eight consecutive patients (4 men; median age, 62 years; range 38 - 89 years) with BHGD (4) or EGC (4) were treated. EMR was performed with a multiband <b>ligator</b> in order to create a pseudopolyp and then permit snare polypectomy of flat mucosal lesions. The pseudopolyp was resected by using pure coagulating current. No submucosal saline injection was administered before resection. Results: a total of 8 consecutive patients were treated with the multiband <b>ligator</b> (ML) technique. Barrett's esophagus (BE) : one patient with long BE received 3 EMR sessions. Three patients presented with short BE and received 1 EMR session each. The histology of the EMR specimens confirmed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with submucosal infiltration (1 patient) and BHGD (3 patients). Early gastric cancer (EGC) : 3 patients had EGC (type IIa) and 1 patient had high-grade dysplasia. EMR was accomplished in 1 session for each patient. The histology of EMR specimens confirmed a mucinous adenocarcinoma with submucosal infiltration (1 patient), EGC (2 patients), and HGD (1 patient). Complications (mild esophageal stenosis, minor bleeding) occurred in 2 patients. Conclusions: EMR has diagnostic and therapeutic implications, and represents a superior diagnostic modality as compared to traditional biopsy. By means of EMR the resected mucosa is pathologically examined, and the lesion may be appropriately treated. EMR-ML is a safe and effective technique for the treatment of superficial lesions of the digestive tract, and is accepted as an alternative to surgical therapy for non-invasive lesions.

40|$|ObjectiveThis {{prospective}} randomized {{clinical trial}} was undertaken {{to compare the}} use of a single-operator vacuum suction <b>ligator</b> and the traditional forceps <b>ligator</b> in terms of pain perception following the procedure, intra-procedure bleeding and other complications. MethodsOne hundred consecutive patients with second- and third-degree haemorrhoids presenting between July 2002 and September 2003 were randomized into suction and forceps groups for rubber band ligations. They were equally distributed in both groups, {{with a mean age of}} 48. 7 years (range, 15 - 83 years). The immediate, 24 -hour, 7 -day and 14 -day pain scores after the procedure were evaluated using a visual analogue scale. Intraprocedure bleeding and other complications at follow-up were evaluated. ResultsPain perception was worse in the forceps group immediately after ligation, with a mean score of 6. 08 compared with 3. 08 in the suction group (p < 0. 001). Pain score remained high among the forceps patients at 24 hours post-banding, with a mean score of 4. 00 compared with 1. 92 in the suction group (p < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in terms of immediate and 24 -hour pain perceptions whether two or three haemorrhoids were banded per session (p = 0. 904 and p = 0. 058). The amount of analgesia consumed after banding correlated well with the severity of pain reported, being higher among the forceps group with a mean of 4. 48 tablets (p = 0. 003). Intra-procedure bleeding occurred in 25 patients in the forceps group compared with five in the suction group (p < 0. 001). There were no severe complications such as perianal sepsis, urinary retention, sphincter dysfunction or bleeding during the trial.

40|$|Background: Endoscopic {{resection}} (ER) is {{an important}} treatment for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and early cancer in Barrett's esophagus. ER-cap requires submucosal lifting and positioning of a snare in the cap, making it technically demanding and laborious. Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) uses a modified variceal band <b>ligator</b> and requires no submucosal lifting or positioning of a snare. Objective: To compare ER-cap and MBM for piecemeal ER of early Barrett's neoplasia. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Tertiaiy-care and community-care centers. Patients: This study involved 84 patients (64 men; median age 70 years) undergoing piecemeal ER of Barrett's neoplasia. Intervention: Piecemeal ER was performed by using ER-cap (n = 42) or MBM (n = 42). Main Outcome Measurements: Safety, efficacy, procedure time, costs. Results: Procedure time (34 vs 50 minutes; P =. 02) and costs ((sic) 240 vs (sic) 322; P Limitations: Potential bias because of different levels of experience among participating endoscopists. Conclusion: Piecemeal ER with MBM is faster and cheaper than with ER-cap. Despite the lack of submucosal lifting, MBM appears not {{to be associated with}} more perforations. Although MBM results in slightly smaller specimens, the clinical relevance of this may be limited because depth of resections does not differ between both techniques.

The generated pharmacophoric features include, F 1 : hydrogen bond donors (Don), F 2 : aromatic rings (Aro), F 3 : hydrogen bond acceptors (Acc) /metal <b>ligator</b> (ML), F 4 : Aro/hydrophobic (Hyd). In all hit set, {{it was found that the}} amidic nitrogen CONH-NC fitted the region of the Don, F 1, while the amidic carbonyl group fitted the region of the Acc/ML, F 3. The distances bridging F 1 to F 2, F 3 and F 4 were essential for anti-TB activity in the developed pharmacophore model, as it was confirmed from model validation procedure.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) remains {{among the}} world's great public health challenges. Worldwide {{resurgence}} of TB {{is due to}} two major problems: the AIDS epidemic, which started in the mid- 1980 s, and the outbreak of multidrug resistant (MDR) TB. Thus, there is an urgent need for anti-TB drugs with enhanced activity against MDR strains. In recent years, Schiff bases of 1 H-indole- 2, 3 -diones are reported to exhibit anti-TB activity. On the other hand, several quinolone antibacterial agents have been examined as inhibitors of TB, {{as well as other}} mycobacterial infections. Accordingly, the current work involved design and synthesis of Schiff bases of nalidixic acid carbohydrazide and isatin derivatives (5, 6 a-f and 7, 8 a-c). Structures of the synthesized derivatives were confirmed on the bases of spectral methods of analyses. Anti-TB activity of the synthesized derivatives was investigated against four Mycobacterium strains: Mycobacterium intercellulari, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium cheleneo and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Modest anti-TB activity was observed within the investigated compounds, however, compound 5 f revealed potent anti-TB activity with MIC 0. 625 mug/ml, which is 20 times greater than the reference drug isoniazid, INH, (MIC = 12. 5 mug/ml). A hypothetical pharmacophore model was built using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) program and 10 compounds structurally related to the synthesized ones with reported anti-TB activity. The Pharmacophoric model built revealed the necessity of the following pharmacophoric features for anti-TB activity: aromatic center, hydrogen bond acceptor/metal <b>ligator</b> center, hydrogen bond donor center and aromatic center/hydrophobic area. Theses features were consistent with the found anti-TB activity of the tested compound...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Piece-meal {{endoscopic}} resection of early neoplastic lesions larger than 15 - 20 mm is a laborious procedure with the cap technique. Multiband mucosectomy {{is a new}} technique using a modified variceal band <b>ligator.</b> Submucosal lifting and prelooping of the snare in the cap is not necessary and multiple resections can be performed with a single snare. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of multiband mucosectomy for widespread endoscopic resection in patients with a Barrett's esophagus with early neoplasia and compared results retrospectively with prospectively registered endoscopic cap resection procedures. Results Eighty multiband mucosectomy procedures were performed in 40 patients and 86 endoscopic cap resection procedures in 53 patients. Median duration of the multiband mucosectomy procedures was 37 vs. 50 min for endoscopic cap resection procedures (P= 0. 06); median duration per resection was 6 vs. 12 min, respectively (P < 0. 001). Mean diameter of the specimens was 17 vs. 21 mm (P < 0. 001). One perforation in the endoscopic cap resection group was successfully treated conservatively. Mild bleeding occurred in 6 % of multiband mucosectomy and 20 % of endoscopic cap resection procedures (P= 0. 012). Technical difficulties during multiband mucosectomy procedures included a decreased visibility owing to the black bands and the releasing wires. Conclusions Multiband mucosectomy allows safe and easy widespread piece-meal resections in Barrett's esophagus. Time and costs appear to be saved compared with the cap technique, and multiband mucosectomy appears to cause less bleeding during the endoscopic resection procedure. Multiband mucosectomy, however, results in smaller specimens and is, therefore, most suited for en-bloc resection of lesions smaller than 10 mm or for widespread resection of flat mucos...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{resection}} (ER) is {{an important}} treatment for high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and early cancer in Barrett's esophagus. ER-cap requires submucosal lifting and positioning of a snare in the cap, making it technically demanding and laborious. Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) uses a modified variceal band <b>ligator</b> and requires no submucosal lifting or positioning of a snare. To compare ER-cap and MBM for piecemeal ER of early Barrett's neoplasia. Randomized, controlled trial. Tertiary-care and community-care centers. This study involved 84 patients (64 men; median age 70 years) undergoing piecemeal ER of Barrett's neoplasia. Piecemeal ER was performed by using ER-cap (n = 42) or MBM (n = 42). Safety, efficacy, procedure time, costs. Procedure time (34 vs 50 minutes; P =. 02) and costs (€ 240 vs € 322; P <. 01) were significantly less with MBM compared with ER-cap. MBM resulted in smaller resection specimens than ER-cap (18 × 13 mm vs 20 × 15 mm; P <. 01). Maximum thicknesses of specimens and resected submucosa were not significantly different. There were no clinically relevant bleeding episodes. Four perforations occurred, 3 with ER-cap, 1 with MBM (P = not significant). Potential bias because of different levels of experience among participating endoscopists. Piecemeal ER with MBM is faster and cheaper than with ER-cap. Despite the lack of submucosal lifting, MBM appears not {{to be associated with}} more perforations. Although MBM results in slightly smaller specimens, the clinical relevance of this may be limited because depth of resections does not differ between both techniques. MBM may thus be preferred for piecemeal ER of early Barrett's neoplasia. (Clinical trial registration number: NTR 1435. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) is a {{relatively}} new technique for endoscopic resection in Barrett's esophagus. This ligate-cut technique uses a modified variceal band <b>ligator</b> allowing for six consecutive resections without prior submucosal lifting. The aim was to evaluate the safety of MBM and its efficacy for complete endoscopic removal of delineated target areas in Barrett's esophagus. Methods: Prospective registration of all MBM procedures in Barrett's esophagus was carried out between November 2004 and October 2009 in two hospitals. Prior to MBM, the target area was delineated with coagulation markings, followed by endoscopic resection until the delineated area was completely resected. Primary end points were acute (during procedure) plus early complications (< 30 days) and the rate of complete endoscopic resection of the delineated target area. Results: A total of 243 MBM procedures, with 1060 resections, were performed in 170 patients. MBM was performed for focal lesions (n = 113), for Barrett's esophagus removal as part of a (stepwise) radical endoscopic resection protocol (n = 117), and as escape treatment after radiofrequency ablation (n = 13). The only acute complication was bleeding (in 3 %, endoscopically managed); no perforations occurred despite absence of submucosal lifting. Early complications consisted of delayed bleeding (in 2 %, endoscopically managed) and stenosis, which occurred in 48 % of patients treated in a (stepwise) radical resection protocol; patients treated for focal lesions or in escape treatment showed no stenosis. Complete endoscopic resection was achieved in 91 % of the focal lesions, in 86 % of cases treated under the (stepwise) radical endoscopic resection protocol, and 100 % for escape treatment after radiofrequency ablation. Conclusion: MBM is a safe and effective technique for the removal of delineated target areas in Barrett's esophagu...|$|E
40|$|Piecemeal {{endoscopic}} resection for esophageal high grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) or early {{squamous cell carcinoma}} (ESCC) is usually performed by cap-assisted {{endoscopic resection}}. This requires submucosal lifting and multiple snares. Multiband mucosectomy (MBM) uses a modified variceal band <b>ligator</b> without submucosal lifting. In high-risk areas where ESCC is common and endoscopic expertise is limited, MBM {{may be a better}} technique. We aimed to compare MBM to the cap-assisted technique for piecemeal endoscopic resection of esophageal ESCCs. Patients with mucosal HGIN/ESCC (2  -  6  cm, maximum two-thirds of esophageal circumference) were included. Lesions, delineated by 1. 25  % Lugol staining, were randomized to MBM or cap-assisted piecemeal resection. Endpoints were procedure time and costs, complete endoscopic resection, adverse events, and absence of HGIN/ESCC at 3 -month and 12 -month follow-up.   Endoscopic resection was performed in 84 patients (59 men, mean age 60) using MBM (n =  42) or the endoscopic resection cap (n =  42). There were no differences in baseline characteristics. Endoscopic complete resection was achieved in all lesions. Procedure time was significantly shorter with MBM (11 vs. 22 minutes, P  <  0. 0001). One perforation, seen after using the endoscopic resection cap, was treated conservatively. Total costs of disposables were lower for MBM (€ 200 vs. € 251, P =  0. 04). At 3 -month and 12 -month follow-ups none of the patients had HGIN/ESCC at the resection site. Piecemeal endoscopic resection of esophageal ESCC with MBM is faster and cheaper than with the endoscopic resection cap.  Both techniques are highly effective and safe. MBM may have significant advantages over the endoscopic resection cap technique, especially in countries where ESCC is extremely common but limited endoscopic expertise and resources exist.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} results of rubber band {{ligation}} and infrared photocoagulation {{for the treatment of}} hemorrhoidal disease through the analysis of the incidence of complications after each treatment and respective success rate. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with first, second or third degree hemorrhoidal disease were randomized to recieve treatment with either rubber band ligation (n= 23) or infrared photocoagulation (n= 25). Each patient was assessed at 1 week and 4 week intervals after treatment. We compared the incidence of complications and efficiency of each treatment modality and Qui-square, Fisher's Exact Test and Student's t Test were used to statistical analysis. RESULTS: Bleeding occured in eigth (34, 7 %) patients treated with rubber band ligation and in four (16, 0 %) after infrared photocoagulation (p= 0, 243). Thirteen (52, 0 %) patients felt pain during infrared photocoagulation and 9 (39, 1 %) after rubber band ligation (p= 0, 546). After rubber band ligation, 14 (60, 8 %) required medication for pain relief. One patient (4, 0 %) required medication after infrared photocoagulation (p< 0, 001). Three (13, 0 %) patients treated with rubber band <b>ligator</b> and 1 (4, 0 %) treated with infrared photocoagulation had symptomatic mucosal ulcers. Perianal dermatitis occured in two (8, 0 %) patients treated with infrared photocoagulation and one patient (4, 3 %) was observed to have prolapsed thrombosed piles after rubber band ligation. One month after treatment, 17 of 23 patients treated with rubber band ligation (73, 9 %) and 18 of 25 patients treated with infrared photocoagulation were asymptomatic. Rubber band ligation treated bleeding and prolapse in 90, 0 % and 82, 4 % respectively. Infrared photocoagulation treates bleeding and prolapse in 93, 7 % and 87, 5 % respectively. Those differences are not significant. CONCLUSION: Rubber band ligation causes significantly more pain than infrared photocoagulation during the first week after the procedures and their success rate are not different after four weeks of treatment...|$|E
