Two layered fault detection methods consist of fault detection methods of component <b>level</b> <b>controllers</b> and system <b>level</b> <b>controllers.</b> Component <b>level</b> <b>controllers</b> detect faults by using limit checking, model-based detection, and data-driven detection and system <b>level</b> <b>controllers</b> execute detection by stability analysis which can detect unknown changes.

The mechanical design of the bipedal robot is modular, making parts easy to change and replace. The frame of the robot is made out of a high-grade aluminium alloy. The weight of the machine, all included, is about 30 kg and its height 150 cm.

By installing an electrical device on the turbocharger, the excess energy in the air system can be captured, stored, and re-used. This new configuration requires a new control structure to manage the air path dynamics. The selection of optimal setpoints for each operating point is crucial for achieving the full fuel economy benefits. In this paper, a control-oriented model for an electrified turbocharged diesel engine is analysed. Based on this model, a structured approach for selecting control variables is proposed.

The {{interaction between the}} middle vessel (MV) design and control parameters is identified {{by means of a}} linear analysis. Transfer functions relating the dynamics of the product composition responses to changes in the disturbance inputs and manipulated inputs are derived. The role of the MV holdup and MV <b>level</b> <b>controller</b> gain in altering the product composition responses is identified. It is shown that the MV <b>level</b> <b>controller</b> gain can significantly affect the control performance when feed flow disturbances must be compensated for. However, it has a much lower impact in the control performance when feed composition disturbances need to be rejected; in this case, exploiting the “buffering” effect of the MV is more important for control. The analysis is carried out in detail for a LV control configuration, and is subsequently extended to an “on-demand” DB configuration. Finally, simple guidelines for the choice of the MV <b>level</b> <b>controller</b> gain and MV holdup are provided...|$|E
