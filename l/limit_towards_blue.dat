40|$|Positive phototaxis and {{negative}} geotaxis are behaviours that 1 st instar Helicoverpa armigera use to direct their foraging movement upward towards nutritious new plant growth and reproductive structures. Odours emitted by fruits or seeds can attract larvae directly via chemotaxis. In {{this study we}} clarify the effect of leaf and flower odours on foraging 1 st instar H. armigera. Using a Y-tube olfactometer we tested for chemotaxis towards two plant volatiles and found larvae were not attracted. Bioassays for phototaxis <b>towards</b> UV, <b>blue,</b> green and white light showed that a green leaf volatile ((Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate) and a flower volatile (phenylacetaldehyde) reduced larval phototaxis <b>towards</b> <b>blue</b> light. Feeding on a host plant reduced phototaxis <b>towards</b> <b>blue</b> and green light. We concluded that the upward movement of 1 st instars on plants {{is largely due to}} phototaxis <b>towards</b> the <b>blue</b> wavelengths of skylight. Plant attributes such as volatile chemicals affect the expression of phototaxis and therefore, indirectly influence larval movement to locate food resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) {{nanoparticles}} {{with varying}} concentration of capping agent were prepared using chemical technique. These particles were characterized using {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM), atomic force microscope (AFM) and x-ray diffraction (XRD). It is observed that particle size decreases with increasing capping agent concentra-tion. Optical absorption {{studies show that the}} absorption edge shifts <b>towards</b> <b>blue</b> region as the capping agent concentra-tion is increased indicating that effective band gap energy increases with decreasing the particle size. Using the effective mass approximation model the particle size of nanoparticles has been estimated from the increased band gap, which is practically the same as obtained by XRD. Photoluminescence (PL) investigations show that ZnS samples give single peak with stoke shift. PL emission peak is obtained at 460 nm for uncapped nanoparticles. The PL spectra of ZnS nanoparticles with different capping agent concentration reveals that the emission becomes more intensive and shifts <b>towards</b> <b>blue</b> as the size of the particles is reduced...|$|R

50|$|The light {{wavelength}} range {{over which the}} device is sensitive depends on the material used for the photoemissive cathode. A caesium-antimony cathode gives a device that is very sensitive in the violet to ultra-violet region with sensitivity falling off to blindness to red light.
