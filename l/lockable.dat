5|$|In the Sahara, 332 {{plant species}} have been {{recorded}} as food plants of the dromedary. These include Aristida pungens, Acacia tortilis, Panicum turgidum, Launaea arborescens and Balanites aegyptiaca. The dromedary eats Acacia, Atriplex and Salsola when they are available. Feral dromedaries in Australia prefer Trichodesma zeylanicum and Euphorbia tannensis. In India, dromedaries are fed with forage plants such as Vigna aconitifolia, V. mungo, Cyamopsis tetragonolaba, Melilotus parviflora, Eruca sativa, Trifolium species and Brassica campestris. Dromedaries keep their mouths open while chewing thorny food. They use their lips to grasp the food and chew each bite 40 to 50 times. Its long eyelashes, eyebrows, <b>lockable</b> nostrils, caudal opening of the prepuce and a relatively small vulva help the camel avoid injuries, especially while feeding. They graze for 8–12 hours per day and ruminate for {{an equal amount of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Although superficially {{the market}} {{remained}} little {{changed in the}} decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, {{and many of the}} stalls were converted into <b>lockable</b> units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19thcentury lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of market gardening meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, <b>lockable</b> containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
5|$|Development on Immortal Throne {{began in}} early June 2006, {{a few weeks}} after the {{original}} Titan Quest went gold. Preparatory work was in progress during the late development stages of Titan Quest, with staff drawing up feature lists and choosing what features to improve and what additions to make. According to producer Michael Verrette, Immortal Throne was considered an extension of Titan Quest, as many of the elements it included were features that could not be included in the original game due to time constraints. Multiple staff from Titan Quest returned, either in their original roles or different roles: Verrette became producer after being a sound designer for the original game, Arthur Bruno became lead gameplay designer, and Michael Sheidow and Scott Morton returned as art director and composer respectively. The original graphics engine was carried over from the original game with some accompanying refinements. The level design was based around the increased vertical elements in environments, giving a wider variety of gameplay spaces and vistas. A big addition to the game was the Dream Mastery character class, which was both designed to fit in among the existing character classes and to be a useful skill in cooperative multiplayer. The level editor, a feature present in the original game, was left mostly intact, although additional development features were added such as <b>lockable</b> day and night cycle and preview features for new elements. Visually, the game was themed around a descent into the Underworld: the deeper the player went on their journey, the darker the environments became. Immortal Throne would be the last original property worked on by Iron Lore Entertainment: after completing work on , an expansion to , the studio was forced to close in February 2008 due to difficulties in securing any funding for future projects.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, {{methylphenidate}} is a 'Schedule 8' controlled substance. Such drugs {{must be kept}} in a <b>lockable</b> safe until dispensed {{and possession}} without prescription is punishable by fines and imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|For smaller {{housings}} {{the pressure}} relief vent is carved in the bottom or the notch of the tub. Larger capacitors like screw-terminal capacitors have a <b>lockable</b> overpressure vent and must be mounted in an upright position.|$|E
25|$|The usual Daimler luxury {{fittings}} included: {{heating and}} ventilating equipment, windscreen washer, cigar lighter, <b>lockable</b> glove compartment, two courtesy lights when any door is opened, special reading lights for passengers, spring-balanced lid for the luggage compartment which is illuminated {{when the car}} sidelights are in use, etc.|$|E
25|$|DTSO(B) {{originally}} {{featured a}} <b>lockable</b> sliding door between the driving cab {{and the first}} set of power doors and tip-up longitudinal seating to enable parcels to be carried securely. This facility was rarely used and the sliding door has since been removed – but the tip-up seat area has been retained for carrying bicycles and wheelchairs.|$|E
25|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} of strong {{construction}} {{and may be}} integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides {{in and out of}} its <b>lockable</b> box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves cash is completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open the drawer.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{recommendation}} {{to have a}} lock on the letter box, if it is not built into a <b>lockable</b> door. Unlocked letter boxes are often used for identity theft, including the ordering of something valuable which is then stolen from the unlocked box. By policy, the USPS will not deliver mail to an unlocked or unsecured box which is located at a centralized mailbox installation.|$|E
25|$|Depending on culture, {{there may}} be varying degrees of {{separation}} {{between men and women}} and different levels of privacy. Typically, the entire room, or a stall or cubicle containing a toilet, is <b>lockable.</b> Urinals, if present in a men's toilet, are typically mounted on a wall with or without a divider between them. In the most basic form, a public toilet may be not much more than an open latrine. Another form is a street urinal known as a pissoir, after the French term.|$|E
25|$|Since {{it is the}} medium-terminus of {{this far}} to be {{extended}} U5, a two-pronged reciprocal trackage north was built a short branch railway. One of the two sweeping track is located at a <b>lockable</b> manhole through which the U-Bahn carriages can be replaced if necessary by using a crane. This currently represents {{the only way to}} spend U-Bahn carriages in the tunnel, because the line U55 with the U5 does not track connections {{to the rest of the}} underground network to the gap closure.|$|E
25|$|Steel {{supports}} {{around the}} quarter lights allowed the windscreen {{to be both}} more steeply raked and moved forwards to provide more interior room. This also allowed a properly sprung bench-type rear seat to be fitted capable of seating two adults. The front seats were adjustable for position and the passenger side now folded much further forward than on previous models to allow easier access to the rear, although the doors were still felt to be too narrow for easy entry. Controls were similar to the Mark F, but the fuel tap was now moved from beneath the bonnet to under the dash. Doors were now <b>lockable</b> and included wind-up windows.|$|E
25|$|The {{portable}} toilet is used {{on construction}} sites, film locations, and large outdoor gatherings {{where there are no}} other facilities. They are typically self-contained units that are made to be easily moved. Most portable toilets are Unisex single units with privacy ensured by a simple lock on the door. The units are usually light weight and easily transported by a flatbed truck and loaded and unloaded by a small forklift. Many portable toilets are small molded plastic or fiberglass portable rooms with a <b>lockable</b> door and a receptacle to catch waste in a chemically treated container. If used {{for an extended period of}} time, they have to be cleaned out and new chemicals put in the waste receptacle. For servicing multiple portable toilets, tanker trucks (vacuum trucks or honeywagons) are equipped with large vacuums to evacuate the waste and replace the chemicals. Portable toilets can also be urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
500|$|RTV: was {{released}} in September 2003. The name [...] "RTV" [...] stood for [...] "Rugged Terrain Vehicle" [...] and featured an increased ride height, additional underbody protection, a <b>lockable</b> rear differential, a unique grille, flared guards and 16-inch alloy wheels. Originally dubbed [...] "Hi-Ride" [...] prior to release, in early 2003 Ford Australia held a competition to find a name for this variant, with [...] "RTV" [...] announced as the winning entrant in July.|$|E

2500|$|Soft sleeper {{carriages}} (RW), with {{capacity for}} 36 (50 in double-decker cars (SRW)), have enclosed, <b>lockable</b> compartments with four sleeping berths. [...] The upper berths can be folded up {{to allow for}} seating in the lower berths.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{year after}} the {{population}} estimate is obtained, each management plan will set a maximum allowable take (quota) of between 10 and 20% of total population. The State's authority will then issue individually and sequentially numbered plastic <b>lockable</b> tags. [...] These tags are designed to ensure, once properly applied, any tampering with them will be perfectly obvious. Populations fluctuate seasonally. Some evidence suggests a correlation between droughts and population decline.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951 the 2CV {{received}} an ignition lock and a <b>lockable</b> driver's door. Production reached 100 cars a week. By {{the end of}} 1951 production totalled 16,288. Citroën introduced the 2CV Fourgonnette van. The [...] "Weekend" [...] version of the van had collapsible, removable rear seating and rear side windows, enabling a tradesman {{to use it as}} a family vehicle on the weekend as well as for business in the week.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{innovation}} was the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] {{center console}} on cars not {{equipped with a}} standard floor console. [...] It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could {{be transformed into a}} console, reducing the seating count by one. [...] The seat cushion folded out into a console with a <b>lockable</b> storage bin and cupholders, resting against the dashboard. [...] The seatback also folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center console with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold console.|$|E
2500|$|The Moke's {{construction}} is simple. The body mainly {{consists of two}} box-section [...] "pontoons" [...] or [...] "sideboxes" [...] running between {{the front and rear}} wheels, and include (non-hollow) extensions of that {{from the back of the}} car all the way up to the front. These are connected by the floor pan, the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small <b>lockable</b> storage area. The 1972 [...] "Moke, Special Export", commonly referred to as a [...] "Californian" [...] Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the rear floor area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional <b>lockable</b> storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows, and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{spaceship}} {{within the}} Eve Online universe {{has a different}} set of characteristics and can be fitted with different combinations of modules subject to their fitting requirements. Ships have a wide variety of characteristics, including power grid, CPU, capacitor size and recharge rate, energy shields, armor, maximum velocity and inertial modifier, agility, locking range and maximum number of <b>lockable</b> targets. [...] A ship's systems also receive bonuses depending on the level of various skills of the ship's pilot. These bonuses usually correspond to the role the ship has been designed for, and thus vary widely. For instance, the Caldari [...] "Caracal" [...] has a 5% bonus per skill level to certain missile launcher types' rate of fire.|$|E
2500|$|The car was {{introduced}} in September 1968. Power-assisted steering and leather upholstery were standard on the 2.8L De Luxe and 4.2L models and air conditioning was offered as an optional extra on the 4.2L. Daimler versions were launched in October 1969, {{in a series of}} television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these spots, he referred to the car as [...] "the finest Jaguar ever". An unusual feature, inherited from the Mark X and S-Type saloons, was the provision of twin fuel tanks, positioned {{on each side of the}} boot / trunk, and filled using two separately <b>lockable</b> filler caps: one on the top of each wing above the rear wheel arches. Preliminary reviews of the car were favourable, noting the effective brakes and good ride quality.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} Ridgeline has a [...] cargo bed {{which can be}} extended to [...] with the tailgate down. [...] The bed's width between the wheel-wells is [...] and [...] at its widest points. [...] The Ridgeline's drivetrain, frame, and suspension design allowed engineers to build the [...] "industry's first" [...] <b>lockable,</b> watertight, and drainable [...] In-Bed Trunk {{at the rear of}} the bed. [...] The cabin can accommodate five full-size adults with [...] of under-seat storage in the second row or [...] when the rear 60/40 split bench seat's bottom cushions are folded up. [...] It has [...] of ground clearance with approach, departure and breakover angles of 24.5º, 22º, and 21º respectively while maintaining a comfortable entry/exit height for passengers.|$|E
2500|$|The Record Book Committee {{decided that}} a book stand should also be designed, constructed, and donated to Arlington National Cemetery to permit display of the Record Book. Members of the {{subcommittee}} were asked to submit designs for the book stand, nine of which were received. In January 1904, the Record Book Committee chose a design submitted by Lois B. Cassatt of Pennsylvania. A [...] "Mr. Evans" [...] of Philadelphia was the designer (i.e., [...] Allen Evans, architect with the firm Furness & Evans. This firm designed Cheswold, the Cassatt summer home.) The winning design consisted of a table on a brick pillar, {{to be placed in}} the basement of Arlington House. The book was to be kept in a <b>lockable,</b> fire-proof box. The U.S. government provided an inscription for the inside lid of the box. The table was intended to be of soapstone or other durable, beautiful material.|$|E
2500|$|In-situ gas {{tests can}} be carried out in the {{boreholes}} on completion and in probe holes made in the sides of the trial pits as part of the site investigation. [...] Testing is normally with a portable meter, which measures the methane content as its percentage volume in air. [...] The corresponding oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations are also measured. [...] A more accurate method used to monitor over the longer term, consists of gas monitoring standpipes should be installed in boreholes. [...] These typically comprise slotted uPVC pipework surrounded by single sized gravel. [...] The top 0.5m to 1.0m of pipework is usually not slotted and is surrounded by bentonite pellets to seal the borehole. [...] Valves are fitted and the installations protected by <b>lockable</b> stopcock covers normally fitted flush with the ground. [...] Monitoring is again with a portable meter and is usually done on a fortnightly or monthly basis.|$|E
2500|$|The reopening of the Lucy Tongue Level {{was agreed}} to in 1993 {{by the present}} owners of the mine, the Lake District Special Planning Board (LDSPB), part of the National Park Authority. Groups of enthusiasts collaborated to dig through {{the roof of the}} level from above the {{original}} entrance, and installed a large concrete pipe with a <b>lockable</b> manhole cover. They were able to follow the level as far as [...] "Low Arches," [...] where it turned west into the Clay Vein. This soft vein had always been bad ground which needed supporting and roofing, and parts of it had collapsed. By 1996 the level had been cleared for [...] through this area. Eventually it was cleared right through, with the debris being bagged up and stacked {{along the side of the}} level. In 2003 there was another major collapse in the Lucy Tongue Level, just south of Smith's Shaft. This involved another major operation to clear it and install steel supports. Explorers can now pass right through the mine, in at the Glencoyne Level and out from the Lucy Tongue Level.|$|E
2500|$|The P7M8 is the P7's {{counterpart}} {{with larger}} trigger guard, lengthened trigger, heat shield, thumb operated magazine release, larger rear sight dovetail, protruding firing pin bushing and lanyard ring. Production began in 1983 and continued until 2007. A final production run of 500 P7M8 pistols were produced under the AH date code (year 2007). Each is {{marked on the}} right side of the slide with X of 500. [...] Other than the slide marking no other features nor accessories were added to the usual kit. To commemorate 25 years of P7 production, H offered a limited run of P7M8 [...] "Jubilee" [...] edition. [...] Only 500 examples were ever made. [...] Included in the package were a wooden <b>lockable</b> presentation case, P7 challenge coin, and special markings. [...] The slide's top-left radiused edge has the designer's name (Helmut Weldle) and [...] "1 von 500" [...] (German, and including the double quotes; it translates to [...] "1 of 500" [...] in English) etched onto its surface. [...] The wooden grips were made by Karl Nills and had the H logo.|$|E
2500|$|... 2008 saw Land Rover's 60th anniversary, {{for which}} {{a new series of}} special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the [...] "SVX", three models were built. All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a <b>lockable</b> storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E
2500|$|The three-light east window, {{containing}} {{plain glass}} and with quatrefoils at the top, {{dates from the}} 14th century (possibly as early as 1300) {{and is in the}} Decorated Gothic style. [...] In the absence of any structural division between the chancel and the nave, a large wooden screen was erected instead in about 1700. [...] This three-arched structure bears an [...] "extravagant" [...] Royal Arms of Queen Anne in its tympanum. [...] Other 17th-century changes included the insertion of wooden altar rails and an altar table, the repair of the lancet windows with brick, and the construction of a south-side entrance porch. [...] A vestry on the north side, while not contemporary, is of a similar era. [...] Some small-scale work was carried out before 1724 by James Butler, the year in which Bishop of Chichester Thomas Bowers visited the church and remarked [...] "church in extraordinarily good repair by the expence [...] of James Butler Esq." [...] Attributed to Butler was the blocking and rebuilding of certain windows and doors (and possibly the repairs in brick described by most sources as dating from the 17th century), the tall three-deck pulpit, and the font with its [...] "bulgy stem" [...] and very rare [...] "font crane" [...] (an iron bracket used to pull up the font cover). [...] In about 1770, a set of box-pews was installed, with high backs and <b>lockable</b> ends; unusually, these survive in excellent condition. [...] Such seats were [...] "complete anathema to 19th-century restorers"; the church remained untouched at that time, making its set of pews the most notable in Sussex according to one source.|$|E
2500|$|Balmoral Place {{was about}} two hundred metres from the Police Station in Harrison Road. The police office was quite large. At ground floor level there was the main {{reception}} behind double entrance doors. Further in were various rooms used for storage. At this level were the cells for the prisoners just arrested and for those prisoners attending the magistrates' court in the building. There was no basement in the building and this was why the court was on the first floor. Access from the cells to the court was up a short flight of stairs which had a double doored cage around them and a door at the stairs' base. This was for security and allowed the magistrates or judge to 'send the prisoner down'. There were twelve cells in total and these were for short duration use only. The prisoners travelled to and from Leeds prison. There was a large courtyard between the court building and the police station which was used for police parades. The parade ground was also used for exercising the horses and housed four stables. From reception, going {{up the steps to}} the first floor the first item encountered was the police enquiry desk. Behind the desk were three corridors. One corridor to the left housed the typists' room, a small room for the senior typist and a store room. There was also a sergeants anteroom and the sergeants main room. There was another corridor to the right which housed the chief typist, an inspector, a chief inspector and a superintendent. At the far end was the chief constable's office which had a constable seated at its entrance day and night. The Criminal Investigation Department was in another corridor. There was one more set of stairs at the rear of the police station. Letters from local residents in the Press i.e. [...] "The Halifax Courier", wrote that a measure of much needed discipline continue in the Halifax Force. Richardson was considered to be the man to bring this about and he had acquired the reputation of being a strict disciplinarian which continued throughout his career. He presented his first financial accounts to the Halifax Watch Committee on 28 September 1903 where the cost of the Constabulary per week averaged £164.1s.7d. The Police were paid weekly at this time. Within weeks Richardson persuaded the Watch Committee to purchase a Black Maria, a horse and a secure trailer fitted with <b>lockable</b> cubicles for transporting prisoners to and from the court in Halifax to Leeds prison. He insisted the design was adjusted so that it could rapidly become an ambulance should the need arise. In 1905 he attended a meeting in Bradford of the Chief Constables Association. An official photograph by the CCA shows him, his father and his brother among 40 attendees. A similar meeting of Chief Constables in the Association took place in Brighton, Sussex, in 1906, which he attended. In August 1905 after a recommendation from the Chief Constables report of the time, the Halifax force was increased by six additional constables.|$|E
