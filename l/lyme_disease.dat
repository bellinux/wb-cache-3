5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, <b>lyme</b> <b>disease,</b> leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although <b>lyme</b> <b>disease</b> can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
40|$|Tick bites are common, and an {{estimated}} 1 in 15 individuals bitten by a tick consult their general practitioner. In 2009, there were 93, 000 consultations for tick bites in the Netherlands, a threefold increase compared with 1994. About 10 % of ticks in the Netherlands are infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes <b>Lyme's</b> <b>disease,</b> but the prevalence of infected ticks may be higher in certain areas. The risk of <b>Lyme's</b> <b>disease</b> is small if the tick is removed within 24 hours. Erythema migrans, the classical first stage of <b>Lyme's</b> <b>disease,</b> is treated with antibiotics depending on the clinical symptoms. A skin reaction that develops within a few days, that is smaller than 5 cm, and which disappears rapidly is a hypersensitivity reaction that is not caused by <b>Lyme's</b> <b>disease.</b> Serological investigations are only necessary if skin signs are unclear but tests are only sensitive enough to prove/disprove infection after 6 weeks. Post-exposure prophylaxis is not necessary after every tick bite but can be given if the tick has been attached for longer than 24 hours.

40|$|Abstract: Lyme Borreliosis, or <b>Lyme’s</b> <b>disease,</b> {{manifests itself}} in {{numerous}} skin conditions. Therapeutic intervention should be initiated {{as soon as a}} clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans is made. The histopathology of some of the skin conditions associated with Lyme Borreliosis is characterised by structural changes to collagen, and sometimes also elastic fibres. These conditions include morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. More recently, further skin conditions have been identified by the new microscopic investigation technique of focus floating mi-croscopy: granuloma annulare, necrobiosis lipoidica, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, erythema annulare centrifugum, inter-stitial granulomatous dermatitis, cutaneous sarcoidosis and lymphocytic infiltration; these conditions also sometimes cause changes in the connective tissue. In the case of ligaments and tendons, collagen and elastic fibres predominate struc-turally. They are also the structures that are targeted by Borrelia. The resultant functional disorders have previously only rarely been associated with Borreliosis in clinical practice. Ligamentopathies and tendinopathies, spontaneous ruptures of tendons after slight strain, dislocation of vertebrae and an accumulation of prolapsed intervertebral discs as well as ossifi-cation of tendon insertions can be viewed in this light...|$|R
5|$|For an {{ecosystem}} to support ticks, it must satisfy two requirements: the population density of host {{species in the}} area must be high enough, and humidity must be high enough for ticks to remain hydrated. Due to their role in transmitting <b>Lyme</b> <b>disease,</b> ixodid ticks, particularly the North American I.scapularis, have been studied using geographic information systems to develop predictive models for ideal tick habitats. According to these studies, certain features of a given microclimate – such as sandy soil, hardwood trees, rivers, {{and the presence of}} deer – were determined to be good predictors of dense tick populations.|$|E

In the present study, we investigated B. venatorum infection in Ixodes persulcatus, an important tick vector capable of transmitting several tick-borne pathogens that cause babesiosis, encephalitis, tularemia, and <b>Lyme</b> <b>diseases.</b> DNA samples extracted from questing I. persulcatus ticks (n= 63) that had been collected in Selenge province of Mongolia in 2012 and 2013 were screened for B. venatorum using a nested PCR assay.

The 18 S rRNA sequences amplified from B. venatorum-positive DNA samples shared high identity scores (96. 1 – 99. 9 %) with known B. venatorum sequences derived from human and tick isolates. In phylogenetic analysis, the Mongolian 18 S rRNA sequences clustered with the previously characterized B. venatorum sequences. In addition to reporting B. venatorum in Mongolia for the first time, the present study identifies I. persulcatus as a potential vector of this zoonotic Babesia in Mongolia.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{serological}} survey for <b>Lyme</b> <b>diseases,</b> brucellosis, leptos-pirosis and toxoplasmosis and identify the risk variables related to these zoonoses in humans living in the rural area of Jataizinho, state of Parana, Brazil. A total of 63 rural properties were surveyed. Addi-tionally, 207 serum samples collected from these rural area inhabitants were tested for indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) and western blots (WB) were performed to detect Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato); a tamponated acidified antigen test (AAT) and 2 -mercaptoethanol (2 -ME) were used to detect antibodies of Brucella abortus; the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was carried out to detect antibodies anti-Leptospira spp. and IFI was used to find antibodies of Toxoplasma gondii. Two of the samples (0. 96 %) were reactive for Lyme borreliosis, three (1. 4 %) for brucellosis, 25 (12. 1 %) for leptospirosis and 143 (69. 1 %) for toxoplasmosis. Although the town of Jataizinho has a human development index (IDH) that was considered to be average (0. 733) in the state of Parana, the low so-cial, economic and cultural conditions of the population from small rural properties have resulted in lack of basic information on animal health and direct or indirect contact with the various species of domestic animals, wildlife and ticks have probably contributed to the prevalence levels found.

40|$|<b>Lymes</b> <b>disease</b> (LD) {{caused by}} {{bacteria}} in the Borrelia genus is the most commonly known vector borne disease on the northern hemisphere. There are at least 10 human pathogenic Borrelia species known to date, five {{of which have been}} identified in Norwegian ticks. Diagnosis of LD is routinely done by serological tests such as ELISA. However, this method of diagnosis is not well suited to distinguish between a wide range of LD symptoms and the disease causing bacterial species. Serological tests are dependent on an immune response, which may not always occur. Furthermore the immune response is a slow process, typically occurring 6 weeks after infection. A direct method of detection based on DNA typing would potentially allow earlier detection of bacterial infection as well as identify the actual disease causing Borrelia species. Currently there is no direct testing method commercially available, and the Borrelia bacteria have proven difficult to work with. In the scientific community, there is controversy as to which is the most optimal sample material for bacterial DNA isolation, as well as which method of detection is the most suitable to apply. In this thesis the development of a direct detection method for the Borrelia bacteria by the hbb gene for a histone-like protein in human plasma and serum samples with real-time PCR (qPCR) was attempted. 	 Blood samples from medical patients who had tested positive for LD with ELISA antibody detection was used for isolation of Borrelia bacteria. The hbb-gene used for primer and probe design is highly conserved between species of Borrelia bacteria. A sufficient extraction method and qPCR optimisation was considered essential for Borrelia detection. Borrelia was not detected in any of the samples tested. Both the DNA extraction and the qPCR assay applied for the testing needs to be further optimised. If we had succeeded in isolating bacterial DNA from blood samples, we would have proceeded to develop a melting curve qPCR analysis to distinguish between different strains of the disease causing bacteria...|$|R
