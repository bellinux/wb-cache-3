40|$|Contact: + 91 - 9968758413 / 9540067484 In {{last decade}} the rapid advancements in {{forensic}} science {{have changed the}} way of criminal investigation. We have witnessed so many rapid development and changes of new scientific methods and technology, which led’s to the unique features & applications of it and become the trend or part of popular culture. This study {{is based on the}} asserted ability to determine the percentage of documents in which <b>latent</b> <b>palm</b> prints or part is present. For this study, 160 samples were collected from Uttar Pradesh, North India in April 2013 and were distributed into four groups for intensification by different methods. It was noted from the intensification that the documents were having the <b>latent</b> <b>palm</b> prints, when treated with battery of powders. The obtained intensificated prints with black powder were 97. 5 %, Iodine Fuming 92. 5 %, Silver Nitrate 85 % and with Ninhydrin 95 %., which indicates the presence of latent prints along with writings on documents. All developed prints were clear and having identical information about an individual...|$|R

50|$|Hamir Deo was {{succeeded by}} Raja Padam Singh, who ruled Pichor during The {{greater part of}} Aurangzeb's reign. Padam Singh had two sons. Hindupati and Prithvipati. Hindupati was a reputed scholar and poet. He wrote a {{religions}} tract called Tattva-Bodha which is still extant. Hindupati was succeeded by his son Pahar Singh. During 1767, Pahar Singh had joined forces with Jawahar Singh or expelling the Maratha troops from the Bhind area and in the latter's expedition to Ajmer and Pushkar. However, about the year 1783-84 Pahar Singh had accepteda feudatory status under Mahadji Sindhia. Chhattar Singh the successor of Pahar Singh was treacherously deprived of Pichor by Daulat Rao Sindhia. His wife's blood stained <b>palm</b> <b>impression</b> in the citadel at Pichor still commemorates her exile from that ancient fortress.|$|R

[...] She {{recalled}} that Krasinski and Wilson enjoyed filming the scene, and that the whole cast was laughing during it, necessitating many takes. The scene was first intended for the season's twenty-second episode, [...] "Women's Appreciation", before it was moved to [...] "Product Recall" [...] due to time constraints.|$|R
40|$|Background: In present study, {{we tried}} to {{determine}} significant palmar dermatoglyphic parameters in case of essential hypertensive’s in age group between 20 - 50 years and whether the parameters {{can be used for}} screening purpose i. e., early detection of hypertension. Method: With the use of modified Purvis Smith method, Black duplicating ink (Kores, Bombay) was smeared on both hands one by one and prints will be taken by rolling the hands from wrist creases to finger tips on the roller covered with bond paper. While crystal bond paper, applied firmly over a wooden pad, was used for recording the inked epidermal ridge patterns. Rolled finger prints were recorded after applying uniform pressure on white bond paper from ulnar to radial side. Complete <b>palm</b> <b>impression,</b> including the hollow or the palm was obtained over paper. Thus one set of finger prints and palm prints was obtained. The prints obtained were immediately examined with hand-lens. Result: Right hand and left hand of the both male and female study group showed more number of arches than controls. Right hand and left hand of the both male and female study group showed more number of Radial loops than controls. The right hand and left hand of both male and female control group showed more number of ulnar loops than study group. The right hand and left hand of the male control group showed more number of Whorls than study, while in females, the right hand study group showed more number of whorls than control group and the left hand study group showed less number of Whorls as compared to control group. Conclusion: The present study indicates that there are some genetic factors which are involved in the causation of essential hypertension and it is possible to certain extent to predict from dermatoglyphics individual’s chance of acquiring essential hypertension. Like clinical history, examination and investigations, the dermatoglyphics will play an important role revealing the genetic susceptibility to essential hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Another cartoon {{relating}} to the dispute between the United States and Great Britain over the northern boundary of American territory in Oregon. Opinion was sharply divided between support for a compromise claim of territory {{as far north as}} the forty-ninth parallel, and those who went for the more expansive 4. 40 boundary. Palmer has two Irish immigrants disputing the issue. Wearing overalls, suspenders, boots, and stovepipe hats, the characters stand outside the Bowery Theater. (The Bowery section of New York City was known for its concentration of working-class Irish.) The man on the left says, "Ike! say the 49 th & let's settle it amercably. " The other responds, "No Sir-ree I goes for the hull of Oregon or none [...] I do & don't do nor-thin else. " In the background, a woman sells apples and what look like nuts at a table.

40|$|The {{evidential value}} of palmprints in law {{enforcement}} {{is clear from the}} following statistic: 25 % of all crime scenes contain only latent palmprints [1] and 30 % of the latents recovered from crime scenes are of palms [2]. In forensic applications, the palmprint image resolution is 500 pixels per inch (ppi) [5] and the matching is based on friction ridges, flexion creases and minutiae points. Palmprint recognition has recently become popular for person authentication in commercial applications (e. g., access control). But, these applications utilize low resolution (∼ 100 ppi) images to keep the sensor cost and processing requirements low. The feature extraction and matching techniques used in these low resolution systems cannot be adopted for forensic applications since they do not (i) address latent palmprint matching, and (ii) do not use friction ridge and minutiae information. We propose a palmprint matching system utilizing a variety of palmar features (friction ridges, minutiae, flexion creases and palmar texture) present in 500 ppi images. Our system is able to match either a full or partial/latent input image to a database of full palmprint images. Since there is no public domain 500 ppi palmprint database, our results are based on an in-house database of 100 unique <b>palms</b> with 10 <b>impressions</b> per <b>palm.</b> We are able to achieve a genuine matching accuracy of 98. 9 % at an FAR of 0. 01 % for full-to-full palmprint matching.
