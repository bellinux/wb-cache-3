40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{accelerate}} {{and expand the}} application of bio-energy, two kinds of microalgal bio-oils, prepared via co-liquefaction of Chlorella and Spirulina under sub- and supercritical ethanol conditions, were used as partial substitutes for the engine oil CD SAE 15 W- 40. The friction and wear behaviors of the oils were tested on a four-ball tribometer, referring to the ASTM D 4172 standard conditions. The micro-morphology, profiles, roughness and chemical valences of typical elements on the rubbed surfaces were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), surface profiler and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. The results showed that both of the bio-oils had good lubrication properties. The suitable weight content of the bio-oils in the engine oil was 10 %. The lubrication properties of the Bio-Oil (BOsup) prepared in supercritical ethanol were {{a little better than}} those of the Bio-Oil (BOsub) prepared in subcritical ethanol. The lubricating mechanisms were ascribed to the combined actions of various lubricating films, including boundary lubrication, and deposited films and tribological chemical reaction films. The stronger tribological chemical effects of BOsup from higher contents of N-containing compounds contributed to its better lubrication properties than those of BOsub.

40|$|Introduction: The digital sheath {{is located}} in the palmar (plantar) face of the distal limb. It {{consists}} of a synovium, divided into intimate and vascularised supportive layers, and ligaments that strengthen the tendon sheath in its palmar (plantar) face. The synovium surrounds the digital flexor tendons during their passage within the sheath. The synovium fluid, produced by the filtering of the blood and by the intima cells, allows <b>lubrification</b> within the sheath. Lameness, originating from digital sheath pathology is not rare, and it is important, for any equine practitioner, to know its normal morphology. The aim {{of this study is to}} precise the morphology of the digital sheath, particularly its synovium because the literature is not unanimous. Methods: The digitals tips of 7 "sound" horses were collected. Samples were taken within the 3 annular ligaments (Proximal, Digital Proximal, Digital Distal). The digital flexor tendons were sampled with the visceral sheath of the synovial membrane at the level of the proximal sesamoïd bones and just proximal to the medium scutum. All these samples were embedded in tissue-tek and freezed for cryosectioning. The proximal and distal recessus of the synovial membrane were also sampled, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with haematoxylin/eosin. One sample of the synovial membrane was taken for electronic microscopy and embedded in? Results: Annular ligaments are composed of dense connective tissue but are transversal strengthening of the fascia rather than true ligaments. The digital flexor tendons showed the typical organisation of the collagen network. Type III fibrocytes were observed within the deep digital flexor tendon. The synovial membrane showed two layers: an intima (with visceral and parietal sheath) with fibroblast-like cells and macrophagic cells, and a sub-intima composed of fibrous tissue that was sometime so thickened that it was difficult to cut! The recessus contained large synovial fringe with adipose tissue.

The system requirements of this market are heating temperatures of 65 °C, at ambient temperatures descending until - 12 °C. To provide higher base performance ratings, the choice of the thermodynamic system is a two stage heat pump with economizer exchanger. This type of heat pump has improved performances over a large range of application. For heat output adjustment it can be switched to different heating modes (single stage and two stage). For the two stage cycle, the <b>lubrification</b> of the compressors is a major aspect to be studied. A new online measurement method is applied to evaluate the oil quantity which migrates through the cycle. The absorption spectre of the refrigerant - oil mixture is analysed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and oil quantity can be extracted with high precision. (The analysis method has still to be refined). The infrared spectometers also allow to control the composition of the refrigerant mixture. A single capture of the spectre needs about 30 seconds. The measurements have to be referred to a regularly updated background spectre, which requests to vacuumize and clean the measurement cell. The oil migration is simultaneously measured with a high precision densitymeter. The output signal allows a real time follow of the oil quantity and the transmitter will give reliable results after calibration over the application range. Any change of the refrigerant composition cannot be captured by the densitymeter. The resulting density shift would therefore not be attributed correctly to the amount of oil. For the analysis of oil distribution in the whole heat pump, the measurement method to determine the oil level in the compressor crankcase, and the observation of the oil retention in the evaporator are also discussed in this project. The heat pump design has been made, based on simulations of the thermodynamic cycle and using existing parts in the laboratory, such as the evaporator and the condenser.

The study is completed with the performance evaluation of cutting oils in terms of tool life (or wear). The comparison of additives performances in form tapping is also accomplished by the means of average tapping torque. Secondly, a physicochemical analysis (AES, XPS) is carried out with the purpose of detecting the nature of the additives reaction products with the surface (chips, tools, workpieces). A correlation between the results of additives performance evaluation by the mechanical tests and their surface reaction products is highlighted. Some complementary analyses, such as analysis of thermal behavior of additives (TGAIIR, DSC), observation of thin section of chip by TEM as well as modeling of friction in presence of gaseous sulphur additive in the Environmentally Controlled Tribometer (ECT) are realized.

It seems logical that these devices could be applied for similar measurements {{at the level of}} the vaginal wall. One such device (DermaLab skin probe; Cortex Technology, Hadsund, Denmark) has already been used for that purpose. The aspiration device, has a diameter of 2 cm and a height of 1. 5 cm. The probe suctions at a preset vacuum pressure the vaginal wall into an opening of a 10 mm diameter (=aperture). During this process it measures the actual pressure (stress) and vaginal wall displacement (strain). In Epstein’s study (1),a single location was measured, i. e. on the left lateral vaginal wall, 2 cm above the hymenal ring. That device was not designed for intravaginal use, so that we searched for an alternative. Also, a 10 mm aperture may cause aspiration of compliant vaginal tissue into the probe, causing uninterpretable recordings. Last, prolapse is a site specific condition so that one may need site specific measurements. Herein we tested a prototype device, derived from the Cutometer MPA 580 (Courage and Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany). This device which is designed for intravaginal use, has a length of 20 cm and the largest diameter of the device is 3 cm. It’s prototypes have either a 6 or 8 mm aperture. Study design, materials and methods In total 45 consecutive patients, referred for pelvic floor ultrasound with a variety of pelvic floor problems, first underwent clinical assessment using the POP-Q classification. This was followed by a first elasticity measurement (aperture: 6 mm), whereafter the pelvic floor ultrasound was done, followed again by a second measurement (aperture: 8 mm). First outcome variable was the ability to introduce the probe for measurement. If it failed, the reason for it was noted. If successful, a typical vaginal elasticity measurement consisted of a single cycle with an aspiration pressure of 300 mbar, an aspiration pressure comparable to dermal measurements. Both suction and relaxation time consist of 5 sec after an initial 10 sec pretime without aspiration. The measurements were taken at four places: two on the anterior vaginal wall, at point Aa and 5 cm above the hymenal ring (=Aa- 2 cm), and two on the posterior wall, at point Ap and 5 cm above the hymenal ring (=Ap- 2 cm). The Cutometer MPA 580 software displays a series of plots and parameters (=recording), among which R 0 : firmness of the vaginal wall; R 2 : overall elasticity and R 7 : ratio of elastic recovery to the total deformation, which are representative for the entire measurement. After measurement, the recording was judged to be interpretable or not, based on its quality. If not, up to three attempts were made to obtain a better recording. In its absence, the entire measurement for this location was classified as failed. Descriptive statistics and factor analysis were done using, JMP® 7 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 2007). Factor analysis allows to determine which experimental conditions affect the measurements in a significant way and which experimental conditions could be considered as irrelevant. Results Introduction failure: of the 45 patients (range 28 - 83 yrs) enrolled, in 11 patients (24. 4 %) the probe could not be inserted either because of pain or discomfort (n= 8) or because of vaginal bleeding that particular day (n= 3). Though at first glance invasiveness of elasticity measurement is no different from that of transvaginal ultrasound, the need for measurements without <b>lubrification</b> gel in an atrophic vagina of a patient without prolapse is difficult (failure rate in ≤grade I resp. grade II+ prolapse: 15. 5 % vs. 0 %: p 0. 003). Once the elasticity measurement probe could be introduced, the second insertion, after the pelvic floor ultrasound was always successful. Measurement failure and interpretable results: This left us with 34 patients, and up to 4 * 34 = 136 measurements with the 6 mm resp. the same for the 8 mm device. Elasticity measurements typically took less than 5 min. The usability of the recordings with each of the apertures are displayed in table 1. The overall usability rate of recordings was (165 / 272; 60. 66 %), but that with the 6 mm aperture device were more frequently usable than those with the 8 mm. status: publishe...|$|E
