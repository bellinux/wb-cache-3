5|$|Upgrades on {{the southernmost}} {{part of the}} <b>line</b> <b>will</b> take place during 2014 that will shorten journey times. The single track bridge between Sæter and Ljabru over Nordstrandveien will be {{demolished}} and replaced with a new double track bridge. In addition, two curves on the <b>line</b> <b>will</b> be straightened out.|$|E
5|$|From here, {{a general}} {{thinning}} of a squall <b>line</b> <b>will</b> occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{will begin}} Link light rail service along the Redmond {{portion of the}} SR520 {{corridor}} in 2023, {{with the opening of}} the East Link Extension. Approved by voters in 2008, the <b>line</b> <b>will</b> connect Overlake Transit Center at Northeast 40th Street and Overlake Village station at 152nd Avenue Northeast to Seattle and Downtown Bellevue, crossing Lake Washington on the I-90 floating bridge. In 2024, the <b>line</b> <b>will</b> be extended along SR520 to Downtown Redmond, as part of Sound Transit 3. The rebuilt floating bridge was also designed to accommodate a future light rail extension, requiring supplemental pontoons and new approaches.|$|E
50|$|In October 2007, {{the portion}} of the old Line 68 between Blancarde Chave. and E.-Pierre (near the {{entrance}} to the tunnel) will reopen, and two <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> be created. <b>Line</b> 1 <b>will</b> link E.-Pierre and Les Caillols, and <b>line</b> 2 <b>will</b> go from Euroméditerranée to La Blancarde, where a transfer between the two <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> be created.|$|R
5|$|The new <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> {{mean that}} {{more than two million}} {{inhabitants}} of Buenos Aires (accounting for about 70% of the city centre's population) will live within 400 metres of a metro station. The new <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> run between 56 new stations.|$|R
50|$|The city's {{government}} {{plans to}} build eight lines of urban-suburban metro with 262 km length and 154 stations (including 18 interchanges) total. 4 <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> run west-east and 3 <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> run north-south. There will be a circle line as well.|$|R
5|$|The 43-kilometre, 31 station fully {{underground}} Thomson-East Coast <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> {{connect the}} northern region of Singapore to the south, running {{parallel to the}} existing North South Line passing through Woodlands, Sin Ming, Upper Thomson and Marina Bay before turning east and running through Tanjong Rhu, Siglap, Marine Parade and Bedok. The <b>line</b> <b>will</b> commence operation in five stages, with the first three stages starting from Woodlands North to Gardens by the Bay commencing operations between 2019 and 2021 respectively, Stage 4 from Tanjong Rhu to Bayshore in 2023 and Stage 5 from Bedok South to Sungei Bedok in 2024. The northern terminus of Woodlands North {{is also expected to}} interchange with the Singapore-Johor rail link to provide access to Johor Bahru and the future Johor Bahru Rapid Transit System. The Land Transport Authority announced on 11 August 2017 that the Thomson-East Coast <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> be the first cashless MRT line.|$|E

5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission <b>line</b> <b>will</b> be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
50|$|In Phase I of the project, a 17.9 km, Y-shaped {{network will}} be built, with 14 stations. Both <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> {{terminate}} at a station at place de Barcelone; <b>Line</b> D <b>will</b> run to Gobaâ and <b>Line</b> E <b>will</b> run to Bougatfa. These lines should begin service in December 2015.|$|R

5|$|At Second Avenue on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, a large {{open space}} was built above for the four-track IND Second Avenue Line. The Second Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> be built under this space, if a {{transfer}} station is ever built.|$|E
5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines will enter the Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E
5|$|The 50-kilometre Cross Island <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> {{span the}} island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The {{addition}} of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current East West Line, and will {{play an important role}} in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line. This <b>line</b> <b>will</b> even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> be tram <b>lines.</b> <b>Line</b> 6 <b>will</b> {{run from}} Albrook to Ciudad de la Salud. Line 7 through the Casco Antiguo district and line 8 from Don Bosco to Villa Zaita.|$|R

5|$|The <b>line</b> <b>will</b> {{operate as}} M3 and M4. The former will run a full circle, while M4 will only {{operate on the}} eastern half from Copenhagen Central Station (København H) via Østerport to Nørrebro. This {{solution}} is temporary, once the metro network has been extended to Nordhavn, the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch. Later, when the Sydhavn extension has been completed, the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus. Trains will operate both ways through the circle. The <b>line</b> <b>will</b> have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv. The line is estimated to carry 240,000daily passengers, bringing the metro's total daily ridership to 460,000.|$|E
5|$|The second phase, between 125th and 96th Streets, was {{allocated}} $535 {{million in}} the MTA's 2015–2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation. Three new stations will be constructed at 125th Street, 116th Street, and 106th Street, with the existing tunnel at 116th Street being rebuilt to accommodate the new station there. A transfer to the Lexington Avenue Line and an intermodal connection with Metro-North Railroad would be available at the 125th Street station. While the main line would turn west onto 125th Street with tail tracks to Fifth Avenue, tail tracks would continue north on the spur via Second Avenue to 129th Street. North of 120th Street, the <b>line</b> <b>will</b> be constructed {{through the use of}} TBMs. South of 120th Street, the <b>line</b> <b>will</b> utilize the 99th–105th and 110th–120th Streets tunnel sections built during the 1970s, with a cut-and-cover tunnel connecting the segments between 105th and 110th Streets.|$|E
5|$|There are 40 {{stations}} in the District of Columbia, 15 in Prince George's County, 11 in Montgomery County, 11 in Arlington County, 11 in Fairfax County, and three in the City of Alexandria. The {{second phase of the}} Silver <b>Line</b> <b>will</b> add 6 new stations—three more in Fairfax County and three in Loudoun County, Virginia—in 2019 or 2020.|$|E

30|$|According to {{the results}} shown in Fig.  3, some {{transmission}} <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> be overloaded when a single line is the contingency before expansion planning. After transmission network planning, 8 more transmission <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> be constructed, which strengthens {{the structure of the}} power grid and improves the transmission capacity of the power system, making the system satisfy N- 1 security constraints.|$|R
50|$|Four <b>lines</b> <b>will</b> be {{built in}} five phases, to total 160 km with 69 stations.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the high-speed Gardermoen Line from Oslo, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, to Eidsvoll, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional high-speed lines west and southeast of Oslo. The Asker and Follo Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel faster and more reliably to Drammen and Ski, leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains, and commuter trains making frequent stops. Construction of the Follo <b>Line</b> <b>will,</b> at the earliest, be completed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell <b>line</b> <b>will</b> reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
5|$|Phases 3 and 4 {{will extend}} the line south from 63rd Street to Houston Street and Hanover Square, respectively. As part of Phase 3, a {{connection}} to the IND 63rd Street Line would be built, allowing for non-revenue moves into Queens. This connection will be constructed through underground drilling and blasting. Bellmouths already exist for this connection east of the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. This section, {{like the rest of the}} <b>line,</b> <b>will</b> mainly consist of a two-track line. However, between 21st Street and 9th Street, two additional tracks will be constructed on either side of the main alignment to allow for the storage of eight trains. This location was selected due to the sufficient depth of the area.|$|E

5|$|The 44-kilometre, 36 station fully {{underground}} Downtown <b>Line,</b> <b>will</b> {{connect the}} northwestern and eastern regions of Singapore {{to the new}} downtown at Marina Bay {{in the south and}} to the CBD. Similar to the Circle Line, three-car trainsets will run on the Downtown Line with line capacity projected for 500,000 commuters daily. The Downtown Line is slated to be completed in three stages. Stage 1 from Bugis to Chinatown began operations on 22 December 2013. Stage 2 from Bukit Panjang to Rochor began operations on 27 December 2015. Stage 3 from Fort Canning to Expo commenced operations on 21 October 2017 and Stage 3e from Expo to Sungei Bedok will begin operations in 2024 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Burial Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision {{to conduct an}} archaeological survey of the rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} <b>line</b> <b>will</b> be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting an archaeological survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{is expected}} to lose bus service in 2019, due to construction at Convention Place station; the tunnel would become served exclusively by light rail trains after that point. International District/Chinatown station will become the transfer point between the north–south Central Link light rail line and east–west East Link light rail line when the latter opens in 2023, connecting Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Redmond. The new <b>line</b> <b>will</b> include {{the construction of a}} turnback track within the station, as well as reconfiguration of other tracks.|$|E
