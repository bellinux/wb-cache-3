50|$|The hill zone {{includes}} {{areas of}} human habitation, and in managing these, a {{diverse range of}} animals suited to these environments can live freely. Furthermore, the large amounts of rain in the Minami-Alps and surrounding regions transform the topography, thereby supporting habitats for several animals in the forest. Species endemic to the alpine vegetation region include: Saxifraga cernua, Pinus pumila and Lepisorus clathratus; the <b>checkered</b> <b>skipper</b> and Sympistis heliophila.|$|R

25|$|Saudi Arabian dress {{strictly}} {{follows the}} principles of hijab (the Islamic principle of modesty, especially in dress). The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's desert climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a thawb), with a keffiyeh (a <b>large</b> <b>checkered</b> square of cotton {{held in place by}} an agal) or a ghutra (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an agal) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair cloak (bisht) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black abaya or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.|$|R
50|$|At one point, Markin sold Checker Cab Manufacturing to E.L. Cord, but {{bought it}} back again in 1936. Markin and Cord were friends, and after Cord bought up {{interest}} in Checker, he retained Markin as company head. Meanwhile, the <b>large,</b> heavy <b>Checker</b> Model T, introduced in 1932, featured an 8-cylinder Lycoming engine, {{the same one}} that powered the classic Cords at the time. Checker had used Lycoming 6-cylinder engines since introduction of the Checker Model G in 1927. Prior to that, most Checkers had been powered by 4-cylinder Buda engines.|$|R

40|$|A design {{methodology}} for on-line testing analog linear fully differential (FD) circuits {{is presented in}} this work. The test strategy is based on concurrently monitoring via an analog checker the common mode (Chi) at the inputs of all amplifiers, The totally self-checking (TSC) goal is achieved for linear FD implementations provided that the checker CM threshold is small enough {{with respect to the}} specified margins of erroneous behavior in the circuit outputs. The {{design methodology}} is illustrated for a switched-capacitor biquadratic filter and the self-checking properties evaluated for a hard/soft-fault model. A <b>large</b> <b>checker</b> threshold of 100 mV of CM is chosen since the filter implementation does not minimize nonidealities (e. g., amplifier offsets or clock feedthrough) which result in significant CM components. The circuit outputs are accepted to deviate within a 10 % band. With the implemented checker, the TSC goal is not achieved for some faults in narrow regions of the frequency band. For the worst case, a hard fault which results in a 31 % deviation is undetected in only a narrow band of approximately 310 Hz. The circuit can be made TSC with a checker threshold of 40 mV and an accepted output deviation of 15 %. This is, however, more demanding on the checker (which currently takes less than 3 % of the total area and about 7. 6 % of the total power) and requires an improved filter implementation to reduce CM components. Our solution consists of relaxing a bit the TSC property of the functional block and applying a periodical off-line test to make the checker strongly code disjoint (SCD). This is easy to implement since an off-line test is also required for the checker. The checker outputs a double-rail error indication which ensures compatibility with digital checkers and makes the design of self-checking mixed signal circuits straightforward. The circuit-level mixed-signal approach is extended to the board level by means of the IEEE Std. 1149. 1 digital test bus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} memory checking, where a user wants to maintain a large database on a remote server but has only limited local storage. The user wants to use the small (but trusted and secret) local storage to detect faults in the large (but public and untrusted) remote storage. A memory checker receives from the user store and retrieve operations to the <b>large</b> database. The <b>checker</b> makes its own requests to the (untrusted) remote storage and receives answers to these requests. It then uses these responses, together with its small private and reliable local memory, to ascertain that all requests were answered correctly, or to report faults in the remote storage (the public memory). A fruitful line of research investigates the complexity of memory checking {{in terms of the}} number of queries the checker issues per user request (query complexity) and the size of the reliable local memory (space complexity).

50|$|Several {{species of}} puffers inhabit {{the waters of}} the IRL. In {{addition}} to S. testudineus, three other Florida puffer species belong to the genus Sphoeroides are found in the IRL. These include: the northern puffer, S. maculatus; the southern puffer, S. nephelus; and the bandtail puffer, S. spengleri. The northern puffer is olive-gray with many black spots and 6-7 vertical gray areas on the side (Robins & Ray 1986). It has a black bar between the eyes and prickles on the skin of the tail. S. maculatus grows to a maximum length of 36 cm, slightly <b>larger</b> than the <b>checkered</b> puffer. The southern puffer is similar to S. maculatus, but lacks the black spots on the sides and dorsal surface. Instead, pale tan rings or semicircles cover this area, and larger dark spots are variable on the sides. Dark slashes are sometimes present on {{the lower half of the}} cheek, and prickles are found on the posterior ventral surface near or at the anus. The bandtail puffer is usually dark brown above, with pale sides and white underneath. A row of large brownish black spots extends from the chin to the caudal-fin base on the lower sides, separate from the dark dorsal color. Many tan, fleshy tabs are present near the rear of the body. At only 18 cm, the reported maximum size for S. spengleri is much less than that of the checkered puffer.|$|R
50|$|Trailer camps were {{established}} {{to handle the}} sudden influx of workers and other housing facilities were pressed to the limit.It had always been reported that the number may have been closer to 16,500. That is the figure the Mellon-Stuart firm mentioned in a wartime letter.In all some 1,000 structures were erected about the time 1942 had run its course. In addition to barracks facilities for both officers and men the camp included several theaters and gymnasiums, three obstacle courses, chapels, fire stations, warehouses, dayrooms, post exchanges, a 100-bed hospital, mess halls, latrines, a rifle range, motor pool quarters, etc. In short, these facilities could support a temporary town of 90,000 persons at any given time.Additionally, the base had its own sewage treatment plant and waste disposal facilities. There were 18 miles of sewer lines, hundreds of fire hydrants, 25 miles of paved roads, 22 miles of water lines, and over 100 miles of electric lines. Two 250,000-gallon water tanks (painted in a <b>large</b> red-and white <b>checker</b> pattern) {{at the southern end}} of the encampment supplied water for the area for many years after the war ended. They were among the many facilities which were to have a lasting value to the area and to be in part responsible for the housing development which started in the 1950s.Originally it was estimated that the camp project would cost a few million dollars, but a total in excess of $19,000,000 was said to have been spent in the overall construction. The final cost never was announced officially.|$|R
