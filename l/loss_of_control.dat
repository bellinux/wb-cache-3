40|$|Objective: HIV {{controllers}} (HICs) spontaneously maintain HIV {{viral replication}} at low level without antiretroviral therapy (ART), {{a small number}} of whom will eventually lose this ability to control HIV viremia. The objective was to identify factors associated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> virological <b>control.</b> Methods: HICs were identified in COHERE on the basis of ≥ 5 consecutive viral loads (VL) ≤ 500 copies/mL over ≥ 1 year whilst ART-naive, with the last VL ≤ 500 copies/mL measured ≥ 5 years after HIV diagnosis. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> virological <b>control</b> was defined as 2 consecutive VL > 2000 copies/mL. Duration <b>of</b> HIV <b>control</b> was described using cumulative incidence method, considering <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> virological <b>control,</b> ART initiation and death during virological control as competing outcomes. Factors associated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> virological <b>control</b> were identified using Cox models. CD 4 and CD 8 dynamics were described using mixed-effect linear models. Results: We identified 1067 HICs; 86 lost virological control, 293 initiated ART, and 13 died during virological control. Six years after confirmation of HIC status, the probability <b>of</b> losing virological <b>control,</b> initiating ART and dying were 13 %, 37 %, and 2 %. Current lower CD 4 /CD 8 ratio and a history of transient viral rebounds were associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> losing virological <b>control.</b> CD 4 declined and CD 8 increased before <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> virological <b>control,</b> and before viral rebounds. Discussion: Expansion of CD 8 and decline of CD 4 during HIV control may result from repeated low-level viremia. Our findings suggest that in addition to superinfection, other mechanisms, such as low grade viral replication, can lead to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> virological <b>control</b> in HICs. 0 SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case.

Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must try to follow the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve at speed could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E

5|$|The {{blockade}} of the South caused the Southern economy to collapse during the war.

The standard of living fell even as large-scale printing of paper money caused inflation and distrust of the currency. By 1864 the internal food distribution had broken down, leaving cities without enough food and causing food riots across the Confederacy. The Union victory at the Second Battle of Fort Fisher in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port, virtually ending blockade running and hastening {{the end of the}} war.|$|E
