500|$|Paul McCartney finally stated, in his Wingspan {{documentary}} in May 2001, {{that the}} sacking of Pete Best {{had nothing to}} do with his ability as a drummer. Explaining why one particular member of his subsequent band, Wings, [...] "didn't last long" [...] in that group McCartney said: [...] "It's like in the Beatles, we had Pete Best, who was a really good drummer, but there just was something, he wasn't quite <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> we had like a sense of humour in common and he was nearly in with it all, but it's a fine line, you know, as to what is exactly in and what is nearly in. So he 'left' the band and we were looking for someone who would fit." [...] He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested [...] "changing their drummer" [...] the Beatles responded: [...] "Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs," [...] but also that [...] "Pete had never quite been <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We were the wacky trio and Pete was perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were." ...|$|E

500|$|Nordby {{said most}} of the {{attention}} was devoted to Jennifer's face and that [...] "very quickly in combination" [...] with special effects and makeup, MPC thought up a five-station system for what Jennifer goes through. Nordby stated:Stage one is beautiful Jennifer and then two and three were strictly makeup where her eyes become more recessed and she would start to look plain <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> And stage four was some custom dentures that KNB made for her, and then visual effects in stage four was mainly facial warping and recessing her eyes some more and having a pinning effect to her irises {{and a variety of other}} musculature deforms, just bringing her cheek bones down more. And stage five was the full on, as crazy as it gets, which you don't really see until near the end.|$|E
500|$|Just {{before the}} Rose set sail, things were {{complicated}} {{again when the}} Crown decided to place a minder on board named John Knepp [...] "to look after the King's interest". Knepp {{seems to have been}} a purser. In the English Navy, the purser acted as a sort of Company Store, tempting sailors far from shore with whiskey, tobacco and other desirables by offering them credit against their wages, (collected through the captain). [...] It was a lucrative post and required an investment to procure, hence it usually went to young Naval clerks and scions who could afford the capital outlay. It seems like a terrible idea to place a purser on a voyage like that of the Rose, on a shoestring budget, with the men receiving no wages and collectively buying and sharing food together. [...] (Knepp brought great quantities of fancy cheese and brandy, with predictable results). But either way, the purser was dependent on good relations with the captain, yet Knepp seems to have looked down on Phips and decided to be forward in introducing himself to the crew of HMS Rose while Phips was absent in London. The reception was rather less than friendly: [...] "... then most of them began to curse the ship and wished she had been afire before they saw her and that they had better have hired a ship of merchants..."The crew were a salty bunch to say the least, a [...] "rum lot" [...] as Peter Earle calls them, and this final last-minute bait-and-switch, after the previous addition of Randolph, seems to have nearly put them over the edge. Everything we know about the crew comes from a detailed journal of the trip to Boston was kept by Knepp and he has rightly been called a [...] "hostile observer" [...] but it is more important to note that he was often ignorant of the complex, dual nature of the voyage, as well as basic colonial politics, if not some important elements of human nature. [...] Distant historians must grope for any available source to shed light on events of the past, and so history tends to be swayed heavily by the writers. Phips was never a writer and so much of his story comes from others, with Knepp's Journal at the top of this pile. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> Knepp does not seem to have understood the role Phips was intended to play, either in support of Randolph, or as a possible decoy and cleanup for the Falcon & Bonetta. In Knepp's first interaction, he says that he is seeking signatures between the crew and the King though the July 13 agreement (see image) would more accurately be portrayed as between Phips and the crew, as the first mate protests. [...] Knepp's job seemed to be to seek additional signatures from the crew, which is easily done when Phips returns to the ship, with Randolph acting as a witness. Next Knepp complained to Phips about the firing of the ships cannons to set the watch. By the time the ship set sail the next day, Phips and Knepp were distinctly at odds, as Knepp records when asked for a cabin or berth and was told he would have to make do sleeping on a trunk. This was an unfortunate turn of events for both of them, as well as the historian who would prefer to have Knepp at the Captain's table recording the dinner conversation between Randolph, his brother, and Phips. Class friction surely played a strong role in the conflict between Knepp and Phips. Knepp consistently presents himself as a victim and there are many times he is bullied and badly mistreated, but it also seems that he must have set himself above, and thought of himself as being of a higher class than Phips. The articles of agreement testify to the trust that the king and Narborough placed in Phips, and the crew seemed willing to do as Phips commanded, but Knepp acts as if he is not beholden to Phips. Knepp's journal is addressed to Narborough (and Haddock) and it reads like a sycophant's strong gambit for a future promotion. He presents Phips as the trope of a tarpaulin captain—every sailor his comrade, questionable literacy level—and so it is probably safe to infer that Knepp was of the gentleman class and likely some years younger than Phips, perhaps in his mid-twenties. [...] Knepp is excellent at taking coordinates and seems trained in piloting, but does not exhibit the a breadth of experience or knowledge of the rigging. [...] Though he records every perceived misstep by Phips, his careful plotting of the journey also shows the great ability Phips possessed as a sailor, crossing the Atlantic in half the time of another ship that they meet, and making first landfall at Cape Ann.|$|E
