The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
60|$|The fact was, as he well knew, {{that the}} little fort could not hold out long, and he grieved {{over the fate of}} his knights; but time was everything, and the fate of the whole isle {{depended}} upon the white cross being still on that point of land when the tardy Sicilian fleet should set sail. He was one who would ask no one to run into perils that he would not share, and he was bent on throwing himself into St. Elmo, and being rather buried under the ruins than to leave the Mussulmans free a moment sooner than could be helped to attack the Borgo and Castle of St. Angelo. But the whole Chapter of Knights entreated him to abstain, and so many volunteered for this desperate service, that the only difficulty was to choose among them. Indeed, La Cerda had done the garrison injustice; no one's heart was failing but his own; and the next day there was a respite, for a cannon shot from St. Angelo falling into the enemy's camp, shattered a stone, a splinter of which struck down the Piali Pasha. He was thought dead, and the camp and fleet were in confusion, which enabled the Grand Master to send off his nephew, the Chevalier de la Valette Cornusson, to Messina to entreat the Viceroy of Sicily to hasten to their relief; to give him a chart of the entrance of the harbour, and a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals,</b> and to desire in especial that two ships belonging to the Order, and filled with the knights who had hurried from distant lands too late for the beginning of the siege, might come to him at once. To this the Viceroy returned a promise that at latest the fleet should sail on the 15th of June, adding an exhortation to him at all sacrifices to maintain St. Elmo. This reply the Grand Master transmitted to the garrison, and it nerved them to fight even with more patience and self-sacrifice. A desperate sally was led by the Chevalier de Medran, who fought his way into the trenches where the Turkish cannon were planted, and at first drove all before him; but the Janissaries rallied and forced back the Christians out of the trenches. Unfortunately there was a high wind, which drove the smoke of the artillery down on the counter-scarp (the slope of masonry facing the rampart), and while it was thus hidden from the Christians, the Turks succeeded in effecting a lodgment there, fortifying themselves with trees and sacks of earth and wool. When the smoke cleared off, the knights were dismayed to see the horse-tail ensigns of the Janissaries so near them, and cannon already prepared to batter the ravelin, or outwork protecting the gateway.|$|E

Here {{we show that}} S 1 P signaling is critical for neural and vascular development. Sphingosine kinase-null mice exhibited a deficiency of S 1 P which severely disturbed neurogenesis, including neural tube closure, and angiogenesis and caused embryonic lethality. A dramatic increase in apoptosis {{and a decrease in}} mitosis were seen in the developing nervous system. S 1 P 1 receptor-null mice also showed severe defects in neurogenesis, indicating that the mechanism by which S 1 P promotes neurogenesis is, in part, signaling from the S 1 P 1 receptor. Thus, S 1 P joins a growing <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, which regulate the functionally intertwined pathways of angiogenesis and neurogenesis.

Results: We developed CellFateScout that uses the method of Latent Variables to turn differential high-throughput expression data and a functional network into a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> active <b>signaling</b> pathways.

It is likely that identification of the full catalog of pathways associated with cilia {{will be necessary to}} fully understand their role in regulation <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> and the implications for diseases associated with their dysfunction, ciliopathies. Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) is one such ciliopathy which is characterized by a spectrum of phenotypes. These include neural defects such as impaired cognitive development, centrally mediated hyperphagia and peripheral sensory defects. Here we investigate potential defects in a signaling pathway associated with neuronal function, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) <b>signaling.</b> Upon loss <b>of</b> BBS 4 expression in cultured cells, we observed decreased phosphorylation and activation by BDNF of its target receptor, TrkB. Assessment of ciliary localization revealed that, TrkB localized to the axonemes or basal bodies of cilia only in the presence of BDNF. Axonemal localization, specifically, was abrogated with loss of BBS 4. Finally, we present evidence that loss of the ciliary axoneme through depletion of KIF 3 A impedes activation of TrkB.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to animal-based mutant phenotype assays, recent biochemical and quantitative genetic studies have identified hundreds of potential regulators <b>of</b> known <b>signaling</b> pathways. We discuss {{the discrepancy between}} previous models and new data, put forward a different signaling conceptual framework incorporating time-dependent quantitative contributions, and suggest how this new framework can impact our study of human disease. Cell biology and biochemistry have provided insights into the mechanistic understanding of the nature, location, and kinetics of the protein interactions underlying signal transduction. The identity of proteins that transduce signals within cells originates, in part, from forward genetic screens in model organisms in addition to biochemical techniques. For example, in the fruit fly Drosophila, arguably the most successful genetic screens were the early large screens isolating genes that, when mutated, were associated with embryonic lethality and striking changes in cuticle morphology (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980). The outcome of these screens was that genes with similar visible morphological mutant phenotypes were subsequently found {{to be involved in}} the same signaling pathway. Later screens using mosaic techniques, overexpression, and sensitized genetic backgrounds and concurrent biochemical approaches completed the current <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> components.

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{recently}} demonstrated that modulation {{of the gap}} junction protein, connexin 43, can affect the response of osteoblasts to fibroblast growth factor 2 in a protein kinase C-delta-dependent manner. Others {{have shown that the}} C-terminal tail of connexin 43 serves as a docking platform for signaling complexes. It is unknown whether protein kinase C-delta can physically interact with connexin 43. Results In the present study, we investigate by immunofluorescent co-detection and biochemical examination the interaction between Cx 43 and protein kinase C-delta. We establish that protein kinase C-delta physically interacts with connexin 43 during fibroblast growth factor 2 signaling, and that protein kinase C delta preferentially co-precipitates phosphorylated connexin 43. Further, we show by pull down assay that protein kinase C-delta associates with the C-terminal tail of connexin 43. Conclusions Connexin 43 can serve as a direct docking platform for the recruitment of protein kinase C-delta in order to affect fibroblast growth factor 2 signaling in osteoblasts. These data expand the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> molecules that assemble on the connexin 43 C-terminal tail and provide a critical context to understand how gap junctions modify signal transduction cascades in order to impact cell function. </p...|$|R
