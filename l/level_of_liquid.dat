2500|$|It is {{possible}} to apply a criticism similar to Nietzsche's criticism of Kant's [...] "thing in itself" [...] to qualia: Qualia are unobservable in others and unquantifiable in us. We cannot possibly be sure, when discussing individual qualia, that we are even discussing the same phenomena. Thus, any discussion of them is of indeterminate value, as descriptions of qualia are necessarily of indeterminate accuracy. Qualia {{can be compared to}} [...] "things in themselves" [...] in that they have no publicly demonstrable properties; this, along with the impossibility of being sure that we are communicating about the same qualia, makes them of indeterminate value and definition in any philosophy in which proof relies upon precise definition. On the other hand, qualia could be considered akin to Kantian phenomena since they are held to be seemings of appearances. Revonsuo, however, considers that, within neurophysiological inquiry, a definition {{at the level of the}} fields may become possible (just as we can define a television picture at the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal pixels).|$|E
50|$|Simple {{sight glasses}} {{may be just}} a plastic or glass tube {{connected}} {{to the bottom of}} the tank at one end and the top of the tank at the other. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the sight glass will be the same as the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the tank. Today, however, sophisticated float switches have replaced sight glasses in many such applications.|$|E

5000|$|Both working flair and {{exhibition}} flair {{can be seen}} in competitions, depending on the rules and regulations of each event. The important distinction between working flair {{and exhibition}} flair {{is not so much the}} <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the bottles (though that is a criterion) but the speed in which the bottle is thrown and/or the drink is made. Working flair usually incorporates a [...] "flat" [...] throw, which is when the bottle is released into the air without flipping. This gives an illusion of the bottle floating, but reduces the chances of liquid spilling. This also opens the bartender to be able to use similar routines, regardless of what bottle they grab, as the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> is not a factor. The accepted definition of working flair is [...] "flair that does not noticeably slow service", usually involving bottles filled to various levels (as in a real work situation) that are quickly manipulated and then poured. Exhibition flair almost always involves bottles that are often pre-set with less than 2 ounces (60ml) specifically for flipping. Exhibition flair often involves longer sequences and routines, multiple objects, and performances choreographed to music.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very common}} {{application}} is in sump pumps and condensate pumps where the switch detects the rising <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the sump or tank and energizes an electrical pump which then pumps liquid {{out until the}} level of the liquid has been substantially reduced, at which point the pump is switched off again. Float switches are often adjustable and can include substantial hysteresis. That is, the switch's [...] "turn on" [...] point may be much higher than the [...] "shut off" [...] point. This minimizes the on-off cycling of the associated pump.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{inherent}} flexibility <b>of</b> a <b>liquid</b> container {{is usually}} {{treated as a}} problem since achieving a perfectly rigid container is practical impossibility. On the other hand container flexibility {{may be used as}} design parameter in control of free surface oscillations. Intentional container flexibility has been employed in this research to suppress excessive <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> sloshing. This paper outlines numerical predictions for simulation <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> sloshing in a flexible container and its design alternatives while maintaining effective control...|$|R
40|$|Supercooling <b>of</b> a <b>liquid</b> {{prior to}} the {{nucleation}} of a solid and the subsequent rapid growth are necessary conditions for producing novel microstructures including metastable phases which are not formed by conventional solidification processes. Since containerless techniques, such as levitation and free fall of a sample, are capable of achieving a significant supercooling <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquids,</b> they are under consideration as possible techniques for material processing on earth and in space...|$|R
50|$|Condensate pumps usually run {{intermittently}} {{and have}} a tank in which condensate can accumulate. Eventually, the accumulating liquid raises a float switch energizing the pump. The pump then runs until the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the tank is substantially lowered. Some pumps contain a two-stage switch. As liquid rises to the trigger point of the first stage, the pump is activated. If the liquid continues to rise (perhaps because the pump has failed or its discharge is blocked), the second stage will be triggered. This stage may switch off the HVAC equipment (preventing the production of further condensate), trigger an alarm, or both.|$|E
50|$|The process {{produces}} primary treated blackwater, {{with much}} of the solid organic material removed from the effluent. Because liquid effluent is discharged almost immediately on entering the digester, little dissolved oxygen is consumed by the wastewater through the filtration stage. However, oxygen demand is leached into the wastewater flow through the filter as worms digest retained solids. This oxygen demand can be removed with secondary treatment vermifilter reactors. Primary treatment vermifilters provide a similar <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> effluent treatment to a septic tank, but in less time because digestion of solids by worms takes place rapidly in the aerobic environment.|$|E
50|$|This was {{developed}} in the desire for a simpler method. The bed is connected to a wide-diameter u-tube containing a liquid such as kerosene. On pressurizing the space between the u-tube and the bed, the liquid is forced down. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> then acts as a measure of both pressure and volume flow. The liquid level rises as air leaks out through the bed. The time taken for the liquid level to pass between two pre-set marks on the tube is measured by stop-watch. The mean pressure and mean flowrate can be derived from the dimensions of the tube and the density of the liquid.|$|E

50|$|Seeking {{to explain}} the phenomenon, Ross McDowall from India's Ministry of Science and Technology {{travelled}} to a temple in New Delhi and made an offering of milk containing a food colouring. As the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> in the spoon dropped, the scientists hypothesised that after the milk disappeared from the spoon, it coated the statue beneath where the spoon was placed. With this result, the scientists offered capillary action as an explanation; the surface tension of the milk was pulling the liquid {{up and out of}} the spoon, before gravity caused it to run down the front of the statue. Prabir Ghosh was one of the people to demonstrate how the Hindus were coaxed into believing the miracle.|$|E
50|$|Tyvek {{coveralls}} are one-piece garments, usually white, commonly worn by mechanics, {{oil industry}} workers, painters, insulation installers, and laboratory and cleanroom workers where a disposable, one-time use coverall is needed. They {{are also used}} for some light HAZMAT applications, such as asbestos and radiation work but do not provide the protection of a full hazmat suit. Tychem is a sub-brand of Tyvek rated for a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> protection, especially from chemicals. DuPont makes Tyvek clothing in different styles from laboratory coats and aprons to complete head-to-toe coveralls with hoods and booties. The latter was notably used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force as emergency limited CBRN gear during the Fukushima nuclear incident.|$|E
5000|$|The skin being removed, the larger, external, layers (leaves) of onion bulbs {{are used}} as containers, so called [...] "shirts" [...] (Old Turk. [...] "dolama(n)" [...] for {{a special kind of}} Ottoman robe) for the meat stuffing. The {{remaining}} part of onion is also used, mixed with the meat and fried on oil for a couple of minutes, to obtain the base of the stuffing. To extract the separate [...] "shirts", the entire bulbs are cut on the top and then boiled until soft enough to be pried off, layer by layer. In order to prevent a further softening and crumbling, the bulbs should be blanched. The [...] "shirts" [...] are removed from the bulbs by slow and gentle finger pressure. Filled [...] "shirts" [...] ("dolme") are boiled slowly at a low heat in broth. The <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> should be sufficient to cover the dolmas entirely.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates several dynamic stochastic {{models of}} a bank's management {{problem of the}} term structures of its assets and liabilities. A bank can either eliminate most of its interest risk with appropriate options, or it can utilize its expertise in its core business and seek extraordinary profits. This research concerns a bank with the latter goal. In this model, the bank seeks to maximize the expected present value of dividend issued subject to the Federal Reserve's regulatory constraint and liquidity constraint. With this model, we find that if the available deposits are not too high and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> assets is high enough, then it is optimal for a bank to accept all of the available deposits. However, if the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> assets is too low, then a bank should not issue a dividend or to accept any deposits. The properties are still valid even if the bank is not risk neutral. ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{liquid water}} path also {{contributes}} to important cloud properties. As the value <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> water path increases, so does the albedo of the cloud. This increase in albedo is seen most quickly {{at the lower end}} <b>of</b> the <b>liquid</b> water path spectrum, that is, the smaller the amount of total water, the quicker the albedo increases. The radiative absorption of clouds is also dependent on the liquid water path. An increase <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> water path leads to an increase in absorption. Again, the largest increase is seen with lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquid</b> water path. [...] These connections are due to the proportionality between the liquid water path and the optical depth of the cloud.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{radiography}} {{by use of}} (1) a field-portable {{x-ray tube}} that emits low-energy x rays and (2) an electronic imaging x-ray detector {{has been found to}} be an effective technique for detecting liquid nitrogen inside voids in thermal-insulation panels. The technique was conceived as a means of investigating cryopumping (including cryoingestion) as a potential cause of loss of thermal insulation foam from space-shuttle external fuel tanks. The technique could just as well be used to investigate cryopumping and cryoingestion in other settings. In images formed by use of low-energy x-rays, one can clearly distinguish between voids filled with liquid nitrogen and those filled with gaseous nitrogen or other gases. Conventional film radiography is of some value, but yields only non-real-time still images that do not show time dependences <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> in voids. In contrast, the present digital radiographic technique yields a succession of images in real time at a rate of about 10 frames per second. The digitized images can be saved for subsequent analysis to extract data on time dependencies <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquids</b> and, hence, <b>of</b> flow paths and rates of filling and draining. The succession of images also amounts to a real-time motion picture that can be used as a guide to adjustment of test conditions...|$|R
