40|$|The role of <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media</b> {{has become}} more {{important}} as {{the size of the}} Chinese community in New Zealand has increased rapidly in recent years. The function of <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media</b> could be like a bridge connecting the Chinese community and the mainstream society. This was an exploratory study which examined the current situation of <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media</b> to determine such issues as to whether they are the main source of information for the Chinese community, what if any difficulties they are facing and how they may develop in the future. A general research was conducted for the <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media</b> in Auckland, which covers brief introductions for some local Chinese newspapers, radio, websites, and the sole Chinese television company-World TV. Meanwhile, the researcher collected 102 questionnaires and conducted 10 in-depth interviews from the local Chinese residents and the staff working in <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media</b> companies. The findings of research suggest that most local Chinese residents utilize Chinese language media as a tool to collect daily information either from local society or their original countries. The <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media</b> not only provides information for the local community, but also has social value as a means for self-representation of the Chinese community in New Zealand and better adaptation to the mainstream society. On the other hand, the funding shortage as well as the tough competition became the obstacles for the future development for the <b>local</b> Chinese <b>media.</b> The results of this research may point to what the government’s role should be...|$|R

That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives.

His ability against both fast and slow bowling earned high praise, including from his captain Bill Lawry. When the Australians arrived in South Africa in early 1970, following their victory over India, Lawry told the <b>local</b> <b>media</b> that Chappell was the best all-round batsman in the world. His appraisal looked misguided when Chappell managed just 92 runs (at 11.5 average), with a top score of 34, as Australia lost 0–4.|$|E
