Later that month he did the same for Greymouth. The work was soon completed and the party {{returned to}} Nelson in April 1861.|$|E

5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one <b>last</b> <b>visit</b> to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the woods of Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5|$|Komet {{returned}} to Nauru following the unsuccessful attempt to mine Rabaul, and arrived {{off the island}} at 05:45 {{on the morning of}} 27December. After issuing a warning for those on shore to not use radio and signalling her intent to destroy the phosphate loading plant, she opened fire at 06:40. The bombardment lasted for about an hour, during which time the raider wrecked the loading plant, oil tanks, boats, buildings and mooring buoys. Following this attack, she sailed to the south-east and Nauru broadcast news of the attack to Australia. This was the <b>last</b> <b>visit</b> of German ships to Nauru during the war, and Komet transferred her activities to the Indian Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her <b>last</b> <b>visit</b> to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|These revelations {{make the}} {{painting}} difficult to date. Velázquez's painting technique offers no assistance, although its {{strong emphasis on}} colour and tone suggest that the work dates from his mature period. The best estimates of its origin put its completion in the late 1640s or early 1650s, either in Spain or during Velázquez's <b>last</b> <b>visit</b> to Italy. If this is the case, then the breadth of handling and the dissolution of form {{can be seen to}} mark the beginning of the artist's final period. The conscientious modelling and strong tonal contrasts of his earlier work are here replaced by a restraint and subtlety which would culminate in his late masterpiece, Las Meninas.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the fourth}} time in as many years that Cardiff City had played at Wembley Stadium. They played at the stadium twice during the 2007–08 FA Cup; they beat Barnsley 1–0 in the semi-final before losing 1–0 to Portsmouth in the final. Their last match at the stadium was the 2010 Championship {{play-off}} Final against Blackpool, which they lost 3–2. The final represented the first time Liverpool had visited the new Wembley Stadium; their previous appearances in the final in 2001, 2003 and 2005 had been played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff while Wembley was being rebuilt. Their <b>last</b> <b>visit</b> to Wembley was in 1996 when they reached the final of the FA Cup, match they lost 1–0 to Manchester United at the old Wembley Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{viewed the}} {{partially}} finished results at Kenilworth in 1572, but the complete effect of Leicester's work was only apparent during the queen's <b>last</b> <b>visit</b> in 1575. Leicester was keen to impress Elizabeth {{in a final}} attempt to convince her to marry him, and no expense was spared. Elizabeth brought an entourage of thirty-one barons and four hundred staff for the royal visit that lasted an exceptional nineteen days; twenty horsemen a day arrived at the castle to communicate royal messages. Leicester entertained the Queen {{and much of the}} neighbouring region with pageants, fireworks, bear baiting, mystery plays, hunting and lavish banquets. The cost was reputed to have amounted to many thousand pounds, almost bankrupting Leicester, though it probably did not exceed £1,700 in reality. The event was considered a huge success and formed the longest stay at such a property during any of Elizabeth's tours, yet the queen did not decide to marry Leicester.|$|E
5|$|When {{accessing}} {{a previously}} visited region, the player {{appears in the}} location of their <b>last</b> <b>visit.</b> Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically saved when players enter the Historia Crux, {{as well as at}} key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of accessing stores at save points like in XIII, the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game data log provides a bestiary and incidental information about the world of Final Fantasy XIII-2. When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not repeatable. The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game.|$|E

40|$|Microfinance {{projects}} are a proven approach for economic development, but {{an indicator of}} future success is that these projects involve a number of community partners, both in the U. S. {{and on the ground}} in the locale where the project will take place. As part of a series of microfinance projects in Sierra Leone, a pleasing partnership has developed between the Rotary Club of Indianapolis and Right Sharing of World Resources, which has personnel on the ground in Sierra Leone, one of three countries that it currently focuses on. 1 - 3 Although established in 1967, Right Sharing remains a small organization as compared with other NGOs and has not had the time or expertise to update its website or to take advantage of the power of social media for outreach and public relations. The presenters agreed to develop recommendations for a total redesign of Right Sharing’s website and a social media marketing strategy. After a thorough analysis of Right Sharing’s website, we inspected some 70 NGO websites to identify current trends in layout, design and navigation flow, including the websites of large, well-established international organizations such as Care and smaller organizations with more targeted missions. 4 - 7 Various screenshots of websites we considered to be impactful, that incorporated best practices and usability principles and that seemed to contain a “call to action” to potential donors, volunteers and supporters were grouped into a variety of collages for easy comparison. A preliminary new information architecture was developed to assist users in transitioning from one section of the website to another with more logical categories and a better organization of information under each category. One challenge is to integrate Right Sharing’s substantial material about past projects, including images and audio, while still presenting the freshest and most compelling content about current and future initiatives. 1.
