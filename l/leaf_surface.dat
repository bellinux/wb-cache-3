5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface,</b> serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include amylase, esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tiny sac fungus Phyllachora banksiae {{subspecies}} westraliensis {{has been}} described from the leaves of B.speciosa, its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1–3mm in diameter on the upper <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes discoloured orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25–0.75 by 0.25–1mm appear in {{the centre of the}} spots.|$|E
25|$|Butterworts {{are usually}} {{only able to}} trap small insects and those with large wing surfaces. They can also digest pollen which lands on their <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> The {{secretory}} system can only function a single time, so that a particular area of the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> can only be used to digest insects once.|$|E

30|$|The spot-gun method uses a very {{coarse droplet}} {{spectrum}} (500 + VMD) and the helicopter’s downwash {{to distribute the}} spray droplets down through the canopy. The large droplets minimise drift and other off-target impacts while the downwash provides the coverage and even distribution necessary for treatment efficacy. As expected, with a coarse droplet spectrum, there is less material {{at the base of}} the canopy compared to the middle and the top (Figures  1 and 2). Unexpectedly, the distributions of dye on the adaxial and abaxial <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> were similar throughout the canopy profile, resulting in better coverage on the abaxial <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{at the base of the}} inner canopy. The high coverage of dye on the abaxial <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> was possible due to a helicopter downwash effect, which moved the leaves and exposed both sides of the <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> to the spray.|$|R

25|$|As {{is typical}} in the genus, the upper lamina {{surface of the}} summer leaves is densely covered by peduncular (stalked) mucilagenous glands and sessile (flat) {{digestive}} glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells {{on top of a}} single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilagenous secretion which forms visible droplets across the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews.

25|$|The five {{to eight}} fleshy, light-green to reddish, {{elliptic}} to lanceolate leaves form a ground-hugging rosette up to 6cm (2.5in) in diameter. The upper surface of the leaves are sticky from the mucilage secreted by stalked glands covering the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> Small insects alighting upon this surface are caught by the mucilage, upon which sessile glands embedded in the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> (except for the central vein) secrete digestive enzymes to digest the prey. The leaves of this species are able to further aid digestion by growing such that the leaf edge rolls toward the center, bringing additional glands {{into contact with the}} prey. Most plants are reddish-green in full sun, though some plant will turn completely red while a smaller percentage will remain completely green.|$|E

Insects that have made it this far lose any chance of escape. It is also studded with digestive glands, which secrete digestive enzymes into the digestive fluid.|$|E
25|$|Trees {{also reduce}} {{pollution}} by actively removing {{it from the}} atmosphere. Leaf stomata, the pores on the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface,</b> take in polluting gases which are then absorbed by water inside the leaf. Some species of trees {{are more susceptible to}} the uptake of pollution, which can negatively affect plant growth. Ideally, trees should be selected that take in higher quantities of polluting gases and are resistant to the negative affects they can cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{the genus}} Pinguicula, the {{mucilage}} glands are quite short (sessile), and the leaf, while shiny (giving the genus its common name of 'butterwort'), {{does not appear}} carnivorous. However, this belies {{the fact that the}} leaf is an extremely effective trap of small flying insects (such as fungus gnats), and its surface responds to prey by relatively rapid growth. This thigmotropic growth may involve rolling of the leaf blade (to prevent rain from splashing the prey off the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface)</b> or dishing of the surface under the prey to form a shallow digestive pit.|$|E

25|$|Pitfall traps {{are derived}} from rolled leaves, which evolved several {{independent}} times through convergent evolution. The vascular tissues of Sarracenia {{is a case in}} point. The keel along the front of the trap contains a mixture of leftward- and rightward-facing vascular bundles, as would be predicted from the fusion of the edges of an adaxial (stem-facing) <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> Flypapers also show a simple evolutionary gradient from sticky, non-carnivorous leaves, through passive flypapers to active forms. Molecular data show the Dionaea–Aldrovanda clade is closely related to Drosera, and evolved from active flypaper traps into snap traps.|$|E
25|$|The plant {{develops}} a woody, vertical rootstock {{of up to}} 4cm in diameter, at the surface usually covered by the remains of old leaves. The leaves are sessile or decurrent at their base with spiny wings, and alternate set along the stems. The lowest leaves are usually 7–30cm long and 4–16cm wide, pinnately dissected and the sections of the larger leaves may be pinnately parted themselves, and have a dentate or serrate margin, all tipped with spines. The midvein and sideveins are prominent, whitish, sometimes tinged purple. The <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> may be covered in spiderweb-like hairs, that tend to wither away quickly.|$|E
25|$|Biannual and {{perennial}} plants produce a stout taproot {{of up to}} 8cm in diameter and 60cm long. Young plants consist of a rosette of leaves, which may be variegated, once-pinnately spiny-lobed, to 30cm long, and having short, fleshy stalks. The stems can be simple or carry many branches, and carry spiny wings along their lengths. The wavy leaves with prominent veins are pinnately divided and are alternately set along the stems. The leaf margin has prominent pale green or yellow veins and large teeth which are topped by fierce spines. The <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> may initially be covered in soft, felty hairs, which quickly clear away, most slowly on the veins.|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{success and}} {{population}} growth of an herbivorous mite are limited by activities of phytoseiid predators. However, occurrences on upper versus lower <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> are sometimes mismatched between these prey and predators. The mismatch potentially mitigates predation risk for the prey species. We assessed factors that affect mite distributions on <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces,</b> testing whether {{the presence of the}} phytoseiid mite Phytoseius nipponicus alters the leaf-surface distribution and reproductive success of the herbivorous false spider mite Brevipalpus obovatus. The host plant was Viburnum erosum var. punctatum (Adoxaceae). Leaves were set in natural (TRUE) and reversed (upside down; INVERTED) orientations using experimental devices. Both surfaces were accessible to mites. We detected lower and abaxial leaf-surface preferences in P. nipponicus. In contrast, upper and adaxial surfaces were preferred by B. obovatus. Thus, prey and predatory mites accumulated on different sides of leaves. Presence of the predator also indirectly decreased egg production in B. obovatus. Brevipalpus obovatus females actively avoided <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> with elevated predator numbers; these females shifted their distributions and changed oviposition sites to <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> with fewer predators. In consequence, B. obovatus eggs on the upper sides of leaves were less frequently preyed upon than were those on lower sides. We suggest that upper leaf-surface exploitation in this particular herbivorous mite species mitigates predation risk from phytoseiid mites, which prefer lower <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{working on}} fitting <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{for use with}} virtual plant models (Room et al. 1996) we {{encountered}} the unsatisfactory situation of receiving a smooth surface model that is bounded by a piecewise linear curve. To smooth the boundary, we fit a parametric piecewise cubic curve through the boundary data points and extend the surface to the new boundary curve. This method will aid us in the representation of <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> with arbitrary boundaries in future...|$|R
25|$|The green {{lacewing}} eggs are oval and secured {{to the plant}} by long slender stalks. They are pale green when first laid but become gray later. The larvae are about one millimetre long when they first hatch. They are brown and resemble small alligators, crawling actively around in search of prey. They have a pair of pincer-like mandibles on their head with which they grasp their prey, sometimes lifting the victim off the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> to prevent its escape. The larvae inject enzymes into the bodies of their victims which digest the internal organs, after which they suck out the liquidated body fluids. The larvae grow to about eight millimetres long before they spin circular cocoons and pupate.|$|E
25|$|Various {{physical}} and physiological forces like light intensity, humidity, temperature, wind speeds etc. {{are thought to}} have influenced evolution of leaf shape and size. It is observed that high trees rarely have large leaves, owing to the obstruction they generate for winds. This obstruction can eventually lead to the tearing of leaves, if they are large. Similarly, trees that grow in temperate or taiga regions have pointed leaves, presumably to prevent nucleation of ice onto the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> and reduce water loss due to transpiration. Herbivory, not only by large mammals, but also small insects has been implicated as a driving force in leaf evolution, an example being plants of the genus Aciphylla, that are commonly found in New Zealand. The now-extinct moas (birds) fed upon these plants, and the spines on the leaves probably discouraged the moas from feeding on them. Other members of Aciphylla that did not co-exist with the moas were spineless.|$|E
500|$|The apothecia of Coccomyces dentatus are {{distributed}} in bleached spots that are bounded {{by a black}} lines inside the outer cell layer of the leaf (intraepidermal). The black lines—often referred to as zone lines—are {{the result of an}} antagonistic interactions between individuals of different genotypes that colonize the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface.</b> Apothecia are usually accompanied by pycnidia (asexual fruit bodies) measuring 0.5–1.0mm in diameter. The apothecia are black, and shiny, with four to six sides. They have a star-shaped pattern of grooves formed by lighter colored cells. When the spores are mature, these open (dehisce) by triangular [...] "teeth" [...] to expose the dull yellow hymenium (spore-bearing surface).|$|E
40|$|An {{established}} synchronous solid surface fluorimetry (S-SSF) {{was utilized}} for in situ study the photolysis processes of anthracene (An) and pyrene (Py) adsorbed on the <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> of Kandelia obovata seedlings (Ko) and Aegiceras corniculata (L.) Blanco seedlings (Ac). Experimental results {{demonstrated that the}} photolysis of An and Py adsorbed on the <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> of two mangrove species under the laboratory conditions, followed first-order kinetics with their photolysis rates {{in the order of}} Ac. Ko. In addition, with the same amount of substances, the photolysis rate of An adsorbed on the same mangrove <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> was much faster than the adsorbed Py. In order to investigate further, the photolysis processes of An and Py in water were also studied for comparison. And the photolysis of An and Py in water also followed first-order kinetics. Moreover, for the same initial amount, the photolysis rate of the PAH in water was faster than that adsorbed on the <b>leaf</b> <b>surfaces</b> of two mangrove species. Therefore, photochemical behaviors of PAHs were dependent not only on their molecular structures but also the physical-chemical properties of the substrates on which they are adsorbed...|$|R

500|$|Particularly {{since the}} mid-1960s {{there have been}} {{advances}} in understanding of the physics of plant physiological processes such as transpiration (the transport of water within plant tissues), [...] the temperature dependence of rates of water evaporation from the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> and the molecular diffusion of water vapour and carbon dioxide through stomatal apertures. These developments, coupled with new methods for measuring the size of stomatal apertures, {{and the rate of}} photosynthesis have enabled precise description of the rates of gas exchange between plants and the atmosphere. Innovations in statistical analysis by Ronald Fisher, Frank Yates and others at Rothamsted Experimental Station facilitated rational experimental design and data analysis in botanical research. The discovery and identification of the auxin plant hormones by Kenneth V. Thimann in 1948 enabled regulation of plant growth by externally applied chemicals. Frederick Campion Steward pioneered techniques of micropropagation and plant tissue culture controlled by plant hormones. The synthetic auxin 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or 2,4-D {{was one of the first}} commercial synthetic herbicides.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{all members}} of the family Lentibulariaceae, {{butterwort}}s are carnivorous. In order to catch and digest insects, the leaf of a butterwort uses two specialized glands which are scattered across the <b>leaf</b> <b>surface</b> (usually only on the upper surface, with the exception of P. gigantea and P. longifolia ssp. longifolia). One is termed a peduncular gland, and consists of a few secretory cells on top of a single stalk cell.
