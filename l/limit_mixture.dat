40|$|At low gravity, when {{buoyancy}} {{effects are}} small, flame-balls can be generated. These are stationary spherical structures whose existence appears {{to require a}} near-limit mixture, a small Lewis number and heat losses from radiation. It is our goal to combine computational modeling with existing experimental and theoretical studies (NASA) of these structures so that an improved understanding of flammability limits and near-limit phenomena will occur. The question of flammability limits is of fundamental importance and has long been examined. It is of great practical importance to predict, from first principles, a <b>limit</b> <b>mixture</b> strength that agrees with experimental values for the configuration at hand. Flame-balls provide an excellent configuration in which convective losses can be eliminated and the resulting stable solutions are produced from a diffusive, reactive and radiative balance. Although analytical modeling provides convincing evidence that the key physical ingredients of flame-balls have been identified, quantitative confirmation can only come from detailed numerical simulations. Our goal is to predict theoretically the mass fractions of the species and the temperature as functions of the independent coordinate r...|$|E

40|$|Four {{different}} existing {{methods to}} calculate the upper explosion <b>limit</b> of methane-air <b>mixtures</b> at initial pressures up to 10 bar and initial temperatures up to 200 °C are evaluated by comparison with existing experimental data. Planar freely propagating flames are calculated with {{the inclusion of a}} radiation heat loss term in the energy conservation equation to numerically obtain explosion limits. Three different reaction mechanisms are used in these calculations. At atmospheric pressure, the results of these calculations are satisfactory. At elevated pressures, however, large differences are found, both between the numerical and experimental results, as between the different reaction mechanisms. Sensitivity analysis and reaction path analysis is used to study the differences between the reaction mechanisms. The spherically expanding flame calculations only show a marginal improvement compared with the planar flame calculations. On the other hand, the application of a limiting burning velocity with a pressure dependence Su,lim ~ p- 1 / 2 is found to give good agreement with the experimental data, whereas the application of a limiting flame temperature is found to underestimate the pressure dependence of the upper explosion limit.
