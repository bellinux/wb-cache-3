5|$|Thomee (1986) mapped {{the habitat}} {{occupied}} by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The snails occupied {{an area of}} 53.7m2 {{at the base of}} the Falls, with most snails found in an area of 11.4m2. More intense studies from 2002 to 2004 have further defined the occupied habitat. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a <b>ledge</b> beginning at 4m from the eastern edge of the Falls and extending to 16m from the Falls. In addition, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis can be found on the middle <b>ledge</b> 4m above the primary <b>ledge</b> and in the talus as far as 3m downslope from the primary <b>ledge.</b>|$|E
5|$|A rock {{formation}} {{known as}} the Campbell's <b>Ledge</b> Black Shale occurs {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Creek. This rock formation contains shale and coal. The <b>ledge</b> on the northern bank of the creek was in the early 1900s noted to contain a large mass (up to a million tons) of sandy till.|$|E

50|$|The Nelson-Kennedy {{region has}} always been a popular {{vacation}} spot and eventually came under state protection. In 1940, the state purchased land at Nelson <b>Ledges,</b> and in 1948, it bought 101 acre of the area known as Kennedy <b>Ledges.</b> The state of Ohio created Nelson-Kennedy <b>Ledges</b> State Park in 1949 to preserve the area.|$|R
5|$|Although Catt's house Juniper <b>Ledge</b> {{is within}} Briarcliff Manor's postal boundaries, the {{property}} is located within the municipal boundaries of {{the nearby town of}} New Castle.

5|$|South <b>Ledge</b> {{falls within}} the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by the mainland of Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. Although in the Special Agreement and in their final submissions Malaysia and Singapore had asked the Court to decide which state had sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South <b>Ledge,</b> the Court had not been mandated to delimit {{the extent of the}} territorial waters of the two states in the area in question. Therefore, it simply held that South <b>Ledge,</b> as a low-tide elevation, belongs to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located.|$|E
5|$|Cyril, an eleven-year-old with a nasty {{penchant for}} making trouble, comes {{to stay at}} the Place for three months.

After he is caught kicking Lad in plain sight, the Master loses his temper and scolds him. Cyril goes into a rage and runs away in a snowstorm. He gets lost and falls off a high cliff, landing on a small <b>ledge.</b> Lad finds him there, but has to jump down to the <b>ledge</b> to save the boy from a bobcat. Now trapped with the boy, Lad keeps him warm until a rescue party arrives.|$|E

60|$|<b>Ledges</b> {{of earth}} on steep hill-sides.--Little {{horizontal}} <b>ledges,</b> one above another, {{have been observed}} on steep grassy slopes {{in many parts of}} the world. The formation has been attributed to animals travelling repeatedly along the slope in the same horizontal lines while grazing, and that they do thus move and use the <b>ledges</b> is certain; but Professor Henslow (a most careful observer) told Sir J. Hooker that he was convinced that this was not the sole cause of their formation. Sir J. Hooker saw such <b>ledges</b> on the Himalayan and Atlas ranges, where there were no domesticated animals and not many wild ones; but these latter would, it is probable, use the <b>ledges</b> at night while grazing like our domesticated animals. A friend observed for me the <b>ledges</b> on the Alps of Switzerland, and states that they ran at 3 or 4 ft. one above the other, and were about a foot in breadth. They had been deeply pitted by the feet of grazing cows. Similar <b>ledges</b> were observed by the same friend on our Chalk downs, and on an old talus of chalk-fragments (thrown out of a quarry) which had become clothed with turf.|$|R

5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South <b>Ledge,</b> the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South <b>Ledge</b> belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other state}} {{highways}} in Michigan, M-100 is {{maintained by the}} Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 16,626vehicles travelled along the highway {{in the city of}} Grand <b>Ledge</b> and 5,419vehicles used the highway daily between Potterville and Grand <b>Ledge,</b> the highest and lowest counts respectively. No section of M-100 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|M-43 {{then turns}} east with M-50, and they briefly run {{together}} before M-50 diverges to the southeast. Now {{known as the}} Grand <b>Ledge</b> Highway, M-43 continues its easterly path across northern Eaton County before dipping south briefly to travel around {{the south side of}} Grand <b>Ledge.</b> Just south of town, M-43 has a junction with M-100 and then follows Saginaw Highway. The highway then has a junction with I-96/I-69 in Delta Township before continuing into Lansing, merged with BL I-69.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Ledges</b> {{landscape}} {{is unique to}} central Iowa because of massive cliffs of sandstone contributing to the substantial relief of the Des Moines River Valley with its deep and narrow tributaries.

50|$|Nelson-Kennedy <b>Ledges</b> {{is popular}} for picnicking and hiking. The rock {{formations}} at the 167 acre Nelson-Kennedy <b>Ledges</b> have become trademarks of the park. The sandstone cliff formations {{resulted from the}} forces of erosion - wind, water freezing and thawing - that wore away at the softer rock layers. As these soft layers eroded, large blocks of rock called slump blocks fell away leaving more resistant layers to form <b>ledges</b> above. Within the park are angled rock formations 50 to 60 ft high with ground fissures as deep as 60 ft.|$|R

5|$|On 23 May 2008, the Court {{ruled that}} Pedra Branca is under Singapore's sovereignty, while Middle Rocks belongs to Malaysia. As regards South <b>Ledge,</b> the Court {{noted that it}} falls within the {{apparently}} overlapping territorial waters generated by mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As it is a maritime feature visible only at low tide, {{it belongs to the}} state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South <b>Ledge.</b>|$|E

5|$|Geologists and the {{official}} Ricketts Glen State Park web page classify the falls at Ricketts Glen State Park into two types. Wedding-cake falls descend {{in a series of}} small steps. Within the park, this type of falls usually flows over thin layers of Huntley Mountain Formation sandstone. In bridal-veil falls, the second type, water falls over a <b>ledge</b> and drops vertically into a plunge pool in the stream bed below. Within the park, this type of falls flows over Catskill Formation rocks or the red shale and sandstone of the Huntley Formation. In the park, the harder caprock which forms the <b>ledge</b> from which the bridal-veil falls drops is gray sandstone. The softer red shale below is eroded away by water, sand and gravel to form the plunge pool. Brown's book Pennsylvania waterfalls: a guide for hikers and photographers uses four types to classify waterfalls: falls, cascade, slide, and chute.|$|E

5|$|In early 1980, Singapore lodged {{a formal}} protest with Malaysia in {{response}} to a map published by Malaysia in 1979 claiming Pedra Branca.

In 1993, Singapore also claimed the nearby islets Middle Rocks and South <b>Ledge.</b> In 1998 the two countries agreed on the text of a Special Agreement that was needed to submit the dispute to the ICJ. The Special Agreement was signed in February 2003, and the ICJ formally notified of the Agreement in July that year. The hearing before the ICJ was held over three weeks in November 2007 under the name Sovereignty over Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South <b>Ledge</b> (Malaysia v. Singapore).|$|E
