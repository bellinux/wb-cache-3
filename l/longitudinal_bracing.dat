40|$|Few roof {{structures}} remain unscathed {{from the}} 12 th and early 13 th centuries. The relatively {{large amount of}} well-preserved early roof structures in churches in Sweden {{is used as a}} point of departure to structurally define medieval Romanesque roof structures and to make comparisons within North-Western Europe. Investigations of actual roof structures along with study of written sources provide the basis for the study. The structures are defined and compared according to load-carrying system, included parts, centre distances, slope of roof, connection with wall, joints, outer roofing and decorations. We found many structural similarities and the structures seemingly belong to the same building historical context while also showing regional differences. The early medieval roof structures of North-Western Europe can generally and concisely be described as common rafter roofs with tie beams, without <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bracing</b> systems and having strut beams and collar beams in different combinations to support the rafters...|$|E
40|$|Churches in Sweden {{began to}} be built when Christianity was {{introduced}} at {{about the end of}} the first millennium. The churches gradually became important buildings generally located in the centre of a community. These early churches are now virtually the only buildings preserved in Sweden from medieval times. In the attics of the churches, a unique collection of timber roof trusses from the twelfth century and onward can be found. The church buildings usually have gabled roofs with gables of masonry. They can either have a nave, choir and apse, only a nave and choir, or be hall churches. The roof structures carry their load from wall to wall, crosswise to the longitudinal direction of the building, without use of a separate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bracing</b> system. Longitudinal stability is achieved by the board covering and sometimes by diagonal beams between the rafters. The roof structure of the early Romanesque churches was clearly visible. Later, roof structures were concealed by ceilings. With the entry of Gothic architecture, many churches became vaulted. The structural load-carrying principles used evolved during medieval times. The early structures had tie beams connecting opposite sides of the roof at the base of them. When churches became vaulted, other approaches to supporting the horizontal thrust were developed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Doubly {{symmetric}} I-section columns {{are often}} utilised in portal frame construction. The sheeting (or cladding) is carried by sheeting rails {{connected to the}} outer flange of these columns. Although it is common practice to include the sheeting rails in the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bracing</b> system, by connecting the sheeting rail to the cross-bracing, designers must be wary because the connection between column and sheeting rail will not prevent twisting of the columns cross-section. It has been shown ([11], [12], [17]), that by including this eccentric restraint into the bracing of the column, that a torsional-flexural buckling mode of failure can occur when the column is subjected to axial load only. It was seen that this phenomenon is provided for in BS 5950 [18], but is not present in many other design codes of practice, {{in spite of this}} phenomenon being relatively well known. In some cases the compression resistance of a column can be significantly reduced when compared to that of a flexural buckled configuration. Previous work performed by Helwig and Yura [15] proposed specific column to sheeting rail connections which would allow for the sheeting rails to be used as elastic torsional braces and effectively rigid lateral braces. However, it is the objective of this investigation to determine if it is possible to include the eccentric sheeting rails into the bracing system, even when using a relatively simple cleat connection with only two bolts onto the sheeting rail. The objective of the research was investigated by conducting experimental tests coupled with a series of detailed finite element analyses. The purpose of the experimental set-up was to investigate the behaviour of a column laterally supported on one flange by a continuous sheeting rail and to compare it to the behaviour of a column laterally supported on both flanges by means of fly-braces (“kneebraces”). The behaviour of the columns, as determined by the experimental tests, was validated by the finite element analyses. The evident conclusion that can be drawn is that, for the case of a continuous sheeting rail, connected to column simply by two bolts and a cleat, that sufficient torsional restraint is provided to the column to prevent torsional-flexural buckling from being critical. This result is helpful, as it means that the buckling capacity of a column can be increased four-fold by enforcing the second flexural buckling mode instead of the first mode through utilising a continuous sheeting rail connected to a cross-bracing system as <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bracing</b> on the columns. This can be achieved without the need to provide any specific detailing to the column to sheeting rail connection. It is however, recommended that further experimental work be conducted on varying lengths of column in order to further validate the results of this work...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the damage {{regionalization}} and localization in the suspension Tsing Ma Bridge deck using modal data. The steel bridge deck is a continuous structure between anchorages through welding connections of 96 deck units, each generally 18 m long, 41 m wide and 7. 5 m high. The deck section adopts a double-deck box with truss stiffening and non-structural edge fairing. Covered with orthotropic deck plates, two 7. 2 m deep longitudinal trusses spaced at 26 m centres support the carriageways to provide bending stiffness. Vierendeel cross-frames, 4. 5 m apart, are supported on <b>longitudinal</b> diagonally <b>braced</b> trusses to carry the railways, and longitudinal central vents are provided in {{the upper and lower}} deck to enhance stability. Plane diagonal bracing spans the upper and lower vents and acts with the orthotropic plates to provide lateral stiffness. As about ten thousand of structural members are involved in the bridge deck, it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a specific damaged member from a one-stage identification scheme by taking all structural members as design variables. In this study, a two-stage identification method is proposed and implemented using simulation data for damage detection of the Tsing Ma Bridge deck...|$|R
50|$|Omo sebua, or chief's houses, are {{situated}} in {{the centre of the}} village and are built on massive ironwood piles and have towering roofs. The piles rest on large stone slabs and diagonal beams of the similar dimension and material providing <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>bracing,</b> enhancing flexibility and stability in earthquakes. The warring culture built them to intimidate with size and the houses are virtually impregnable to attack with only a small trap door above a narrow staircase for access. The steeply pitched roofs reach heights of 16 metres (50 feet); gables project dramatically at both the front and rear, providing both shade and shelter from tropical rains, and giving the building a hooded, towering appearance. With structural members slotted together rather than nailed or bound, the structures have a proven earthquake resistance.|$|R
