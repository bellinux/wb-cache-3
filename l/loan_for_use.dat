40|$|In the European Union, {{since the}} mid- 90 s {{with the new}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) the term {{agriculture}} was joined to that of multifunctionality, {{as stated in the}} second pillar of the CAP, because the agricultural sector was placed in front of new challenges, attributing to the development policies of this sector a role of backbone for the economy of all rural areas with low capacity to achieve economic diversification. Actually, with the multifunctionality, the agricultural sector is no longer considered, only, the one which produces food goods, but also it has new and different functions, including those of preserving the environment and the rural landscape and to support the socio-economic development of rural areas, also through the creation of employment opportunities. In particular, among the different aspects provided by the multifunctional role of agriculture, the social function is the one that has spread and established itself more and more, especially in recent years in Sicily, where, as social, it means the ability of the farm to generate services to a population considered at risk of social exclusion. In this regard, all the initiatives for agricultural purposes that are pursued, mainly in the south of Italy and especially in Sicily, in those lands confiscated from organized crime (the so-called Mafia) are believed to be very interesting. In fact, just thanks to the Italian Law n. 109 / 1996 it is permitted to particular legal entities (cooperatives, associations, non-profit, etc.) the use, with social purposes, of all the assets and properties confiscated from organized crime, among which there are included also the agricultural lands that, otherwise, would remain inevitably abandoned 1. Instead, thanks to the application of this Law, these legal entities can exercise an agricultural activity aimed, in addition to food production regularly put on the market, also to offer employment in the agricultural sector. In this context, in Sicily, is well-known the activity of the social company (cooperative) "Placido Rizzotto - Libera Terra". It was founded in 2001 within the project "Libera Terra" 2, promoted by the "Libera" 3 and the Prefect of Palermo and, through a contract of <b>loan</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> it got into management and now it cultivates over 150 hectares of land confiscated from the Mafia that fall in some municipalities of the Province of Palermo.

In particular {{it focuses on}} topics covering the yen carry trade, the Great Hanshin Earthquake in Kobe, and the Great East Japan Earthquake. The first chapter looks at {{the relationship between the}} yen carry trade and loan balances in Japan. While it finds evidence that the carry trade does influence outstanding <b>loans</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> overseas taken out from domestically licensed banks; it finds little evidence that the carry trade is having an influence on loan balances at foreign banks operating in Japan. The second chapter looks at the long term impact of the Great Hanshin Earthquake on Kobe. It finds that, contrary to previous works on the subject, the earthquake has had a persistent negative impact on the region which has resulted in a 12 % decline in GDP per capita 13 years after the disaster. The final chapter looks at the impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake on luxury automobile purchases in the Tohoku region. It finds that while sales of luxury automobiles in some areas are higher than they would have been had the disaster not struck, the share of sales in luxury automobiles has actually fallen. This indicates that residents may be swapping away from luxury goods purchases {{in the wake of the}} disaster...|$|R
