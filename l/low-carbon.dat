5|$|On June 5, 2016, NASA and DARPA {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} series of new X-planes over the next 10 years. One of the planes will reportedly be a supersonic vehicle that burns <b>low-carbon</b> biofuels and generates quiet sonic booms.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cost}} of solar {{electricity}} has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems has grown into the millions and utility-scale solar power stations with hundreds of megawatts are being built. Solar PV is rapidly becoming an inexpensive, <b>low-carbon</b> technology to harness renewable energy from the Sun. The current largest photovoltaic power station {{in the world is}} the 850MW Longyangxia Dam Solar Park, in Qinghai, China.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2009, California Air Resources Board (CARB) {{approved}} the specific rules and carbon intensity reference {{values for the}} California <b>Low-Carbon</b> Fuel Standard (LCFS) that take effect January 1, 2011. CARB's rulemaking included ILUC. For some biofuels, CARB identified land use changes as {{a significant source of}} additional GHG emissions. It established one standard for gasoline and alternative fuels, and a second for diesel fuel and its replacements.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{auctioning}} permits provides {{the government with}} revenues. These revenues {{could be used to}} fund <b>low-carbon</b> investment, and also fund cuts in distortionary taxes. Auctioning permits can therefore be more efficient and equitable than allocating permits (Hepburn, 2006, pp.236–237). Ross Garnaut states that full auctioning will provide greater transparency and accountability and lower implementation and transaction costs as governments retain control over the permit revenue.|$|E
5|$|The carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis, {{also known}} as the {{environmental}} constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model (CNBM), states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment. This hypothesis predicts the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio in plants determines which secondary metabolites will be synthesized. For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in <b>low-carbon</b> environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.|$|E
5|$|While {{working in}} the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo's {{interest}} in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models {{as well as from}} ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients' production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and <b>low-carbon</b> steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) era clothing.|$|E
5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of <b>low-carbon</b> wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{puddled iron}} {{armature}} designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced. <b>Low-carbon</b> corrosion-resistant {{stainless steel bars}} that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium, an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves. To prevent the ray and arm making contact, the ray was realigned by several degrees. The lighting was again replaced—night-time illumination subsequently came from metal-halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue, showing off various details. Access to the pedestal, which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s, was renovated to create a wide opening framed {{by a set of}} monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation. A modern elevator was installed, allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal. An emergency elevator was installed within the statue, reaching up {{to the level of the}} shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Wrought iron: During the Han dynasty, new iron {{smelting}} processes led to {{the manufacture}} of new wrought iron implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube seed drill and iron plough. In addition to accidental lumps of <b>low-carbon</b> wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo.

5|$|Johor Bahru {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} cities in Malaysia after Kuala Lumpur. It is the main commercial centre for Johor and is located in the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle. Tertiary-based industry dominates the economy with thousands of Singaporeans and Indonesians and other international tourists visiting the city. It is the centre of financial services, commerce and retail, arts and culture, hospitality, urban tourism, plastic manufacturing, electrical and electronics and food processing. The city has a very close economic relationship with Singapore as many Singaporeans frequently visit for shopping, entertainment, and dining which increase the city income with the stronger Singapore dollar; some Singaporeans have also chosen to live in the city. Due to this, Johor Bahru's retail scene was continuously developed {{to meet the needs of}} its consumers. The main shopping districts are located within the city, with a number of large shopping malls located in the suburbs. A large numbers of the city's residents work in Singapore, where the salaries are higher than in Malaysia. The presence of Singaporean and Chinese-owned companies were also significant, with China being the fifth largest investor in Iskandar Malaysia after Singapore, the United States, Spain and Japan as of September 2014. In 2014, the sudden change of weekend rest days to Friday and Saturday from Saturday and Sunday by the Sultan of Johor had a relatively small impact to the city economy, with business especially affected. However, it boosted the tourism industry as the holidays would be able to start earlier on Sunday, attracting more tourists from Singapore. Johor Bahru is the location of numerous conferences, congress and trade fairs, such as the Eastern Regional Organisation for Planning and Housing and the World Islamic Economic Forum. The city is the first in Malaysia to practise a <b>low-carbon</b> economy.|$|E

25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} <b>low-carbon</b> iron within a substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a <b>low-carbon</b> steel core, with the hardness and wear resistance of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|E

25|$|Assessments often {{suggest that}} GHG {{emissions}} {{can be reduced}} using a portfolio of <b>low-carbon</b> technologies. At the core of most proposals is the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through reducing energy waste and switching to <b>low-carbon</b> power sources of energy. As the cost of reducing GHG emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors, {{such as in the}} transportation sector, the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy.|$|E
25|$|The Energy Technologies Institute, {{expected}} to begin operating in 2008, is to 'accelerate the development of secure, reliable and cost-effective <b>low-carbon</b> energy technologies towards commercial deployment'.|$|E
25|$|Researchers in Switzerland {{believe that}} this vision is achievable, despite a {{projected}} 65% increase in economic growth by 2050, by using new <b>low-carbon</b> technologies and techniques.|$|E
25|$|To create lasting {{climate change}} mitigation, the {{replacement}} of high carbon emission intensity power sources, such as conventional fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas—with <b>low-carbon</b> power sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with {{the vast majority of}} our energy demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources. Both hydroelectricity and nuclear power together provide the majority of the generated <b>low-carbon</b> power fraction of global total power consumption.|$|E
25|$|Carbon Tracker's {{subsequent}} research {{investigated the}} implications of lower demand and <b>low-carbon</b> scenarios for the different fossil fuels of fossil fuels against lower demand, price and carbon emissions scenarios.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate and}} energy {{policy is a}} choice between {{democracy}} and autocracy. The choice is one between patronage-based oil-and-gas oligarchies on the one hand, and adaptive and innovative <b>low-carbon</b> economy on the other.|$|E
25|$|These {{processes}} are {{most commonly used}} on <b>low-carbon,</b> low-alloy steels, however they are also used on medium and high-carbon steels. Common applications include spindles, cams, gears, dies, hydraulic piston rods, and powdered metal components.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear power, with a 10.6% {{share of}} world {{electricity}} production as of 2013, {{is second only}} to hydroelectricity as the largest source of <b>low-carbon</b> power. Over 400 reactors generate electricity in 31 countries.|$|E
25|$|Soft <b>low-carbon</b> steel bits are inexpensive, but do {{not hold}} an edge well and require {{frequent}} sharpening. They are used only for drilling wood; even working with hardwoods rather than softwoods can noticeably shorten their lifespan.|$|E
25|$|With {{significant}} amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share of <b>low-carbon</b> electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.|$|E
25|$|Cyaniding is a {{case-hardening}} {{process that}} is fast and efficient; it is mainly used on <b>low-carbon</b> steels. The part is heated to 871-954°C (1600-1750°F) in a bath of sodium cyanide and then is quenched and rinsed, in water or oil, to remove any residual cyanide.|$|E

25|$|Bits {{made from}} {{high-carbon}} steel are more durable than <b>low-carbon</b> steel bits {{due to the}} properties conferred by hardening and tempering the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by frictional heating while drilling) they lose their temper, resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits {{can be used on}} wood or metal.|$|E
25|$|The main {{barriers}} to the widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and <b>low-carbon</b> energy strategies are political rather than technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political inaction, unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.|$|E
25|$|It {{is claimed}} that they {{will lead to a}} 'post-industrial revolution', or a <b>low-carbon</b> economy, in the European Union, as well as {{increased}} competition in the energy markets, improved security of supply, and improved employment prospects.
