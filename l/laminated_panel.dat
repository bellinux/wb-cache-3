40|$|Different angle {{brackets}} for anchoring solid wooden panels were tested {{to learn about}} their response and basic mechanical properties on the acting load in two perpendicular directions. Namely, previous tests showed two distinct cases of panel deformation. In one case the panel mainly rotates around its compressed corner. In the other case the panel slips along foundation and deforms into parallelogram shape. Based on this knowledge, the tests were designed to simulate these two cases of deformation. The two tests were named »up-lift test« and »slip test«. The tests were carried out on cross laminated and unidirectional laminated wooden panels segments anchored by BMF and WÜRTH {{angle brackets}}. To obtain reliable mechanical characteristics three different loading protocols were applied. Loading protocols to simulate realistic loads on angle brackets were monotonous, according to standard EN 26891, and cyclic or semi-cyclic according to standard prEN 12512. The tests showed that the length of nails has greater influence on the results that their number.

40|$|A primary {{motivation}} {{for this research}} comes from {{the need to improve}} the ability of polymer-matrix composites to withstand lightning strikes. In particular, we are concerned with lightning strike damage in composite wind turbine blades. The direct effects of lightning strike on polymer-matrix composites often include rapid temperature rise, melting or burning at the lightning attachment points, and mechanical damage due to lightning-induced magnetic force and acoustic shock wave. The lightning strike damage accumulation problem is essentially multiphysic. The lightning plasma channel discharges an electric current up to 200 kA, inducing a severe heat flux at the surface of the composite structure, as well as generating Joule heating through the composite structure. The resulting electro-thermo-mechanical response of the composite structure may include matrix degradation and decomposition, delamination, and fiber breakage and sublimation, thus leading to catastrophic failure. The existing studies related to the lightning strike damage in composites ignored the lightning channel radius expansion during the initial lightning discharge and lacked adequate treatment of material phase transitions. These assumptions significantly simplify the mathematical treatment of the problem and affect the predictive capabilities of the models. Another common feature of these limited studies is that they all focused on carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix (CFRP) composites, which are electrically conductive. In the present thesis, the thermal responses and thermal ablations in a non-conductive glass-fiber-reinforced polymer-matrix (GFRP) composite wind turbine blade and in a conductive CFRP composite wind turbine blade are studied, respectively. In the case of non-conductive GFRP composite wind turbine blade, prior to the thermal response and thermal ablation analysis, a finite element analysis is performed to calculate the electric field due to lightning stepped leader to estimate the dielectric breakdown of the non-conductive composite wind turbine blade. The estimation of dielectric breakdown is used to determine whether Joule heating needs {{to be included in the}} problem formulation. To predict the thermal response and thermal ablation in the composite structure due to lightning strike, a physics-based model describing surface interaction between the lightning channel and the composite structure has been developed. The model consists of: (i) spatial and temporal evolution of the lightning channel as a function of the electric current waveform; (ii) temporary and spatially non-uniform heat flux and current density (in the case of electrically conductive CFRP composite or if dielectric breakdown occurs in the case of non-conductive GFRP composite) generated at the composite structure; and (iii) nonlinear transient heat transfer problem formulation for layered anisotropic composites that includes the moving boundary of the expanding lightning channel and the phase transition moving boundary associated with instantaneous material removal due to sublimation. The model has been employed to investigate the thermal responses and thermal ablations in a GFRP composite <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> used in a Sandia 100 -meter all-glass baseline wind turbine blade (SNL 100 - 00) and a typical CFRP composite <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> subjected to lightning strike. The temperature-dependent directional material properties for both the GFRP and CFRP composites have been determined in this thesis using a micromechanics approach based on the experimental data for fibers and resin. An integrated Matlab-ABAQUS numerical procedure features the aforementioned aspects (i), (ii), and (iii) of the developed model. The obtained results include the evolution of temperature fields in the composite <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> and the progressive shape change of the composite <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> due to thermal ablation. The predictions of thermal ablation in the CFRP composite <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> are validated by reported experimental results...|$|E

A projectile of hemispherical {{head with a}} diameter of 36. 5 mm was used to impact the fibre metal <b>laminate</b> <b>panels.</b> Three types of woven fibre fabrics (Basalt, S 2 -glass and Kevlar- 29) were used to reinforce the aluminum sheets.

40|$|A {{progressive}} failure methodology is developed and demonstrated {{to simulate the}} initiation and material degradation of a <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> due to intralaminar and interlaminar failures. Initiation of intralaminar failure can be by a matrix-cracking mode, a fiber-matrix shear mode, and a fiber failure mode. Subsequent material degradation is modeled using damage parameters for each mode to selectively reduce lamina material properties. The interlaminar failure mechanism such as delamination is simulated by positioning interface elements between adjacent sublaminates. A nonlinear constitutive law is postulated for the interface element that accounts for a multi-axial stress criteria to detect the initiation of delamination, a mixed-mode fracture criteria for delamination progression, and a damage parameter to prevent restoration of a previous cohesive state. The methodology is validated using experimental data available {{in the literature on}} the response and failure of quasi-isotropic panels with centrally located circular cutouts loaded into the postbuckling regime.

Here, we consider laminated plates made of such a material, with spherical reinforcement tailored by layer. The moduli for this material lie within relatively narrow bounds. Two separate moduli estimates are considered: a “two-step” approach in which fibers are embedded in a homogenized particulate matrix, and the Kanaun–Jeulin (Kanaun, S. K., Jeulin, D., 2001.

40|$|The High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) {{will have}} to be {{designed}} to withstand high aerodynamic load at supersonic speeds (panel flutter) and high acoustic load (acoustic or sonic fatigue) due to fluctuating boundary layer or jet engine acoustic pressure. The thermal deflection of the skin panels will also alter the vehicle's configuration, thus it may affect the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle and lead to poor performance. Shape memory alloys (SMA) have an unique ability to recover large strains completely when the alloy is heated above the characteristic transformation (austenite finish T(sub f)) temperature. The recovery stress and elastic modulus are both temperature dependent, and the recovery stress also depends on the initial strain. An innovative concept is to utilize the recovery stress by embedding the initially strained SMA wire in a graphite/epoxy composite <b>laminated</b> <b>panel.</b> The SMA wires are thus restrained and large inplane forces are induced in the panel at elevated temeperatures.

40|$|Fibre-reinforced {{composites}} {{are used}} in many engineering structures with cylindrical panels being a typical component. Buckling {{is one of the}} important modes of failure of such a panel. The work presented in this paper deals with optimizing the orientation of plies in a simply supported composite cylindrical panel so as to achieve maximum buckling load. The panel is assumed to be composed of a repeated sublaminate construction. In this type of construction the basic sublaminate has a smaller number of plies, for example, 8, 6, 4 or 2, and the full panel is obtained by repeating the basic sublaminate. Such a construction is used to avoid manufacturing errors and to produce damagetolerant panels resulting from maximum splicing of plies. The buckling loads have been found using an energy method, and optimization of ply orientations in the basic sublaminate is achieved by using the ranking technique proposed by Tsai. The following configurations are considered in the paper: (i) solid <b>laminated</b> <b>panel,</b> (ii) sandwich panel, and (iii) stiffened panel. The sandwich or stiffened panel may have sinusoidally corrugated sheet, hat-type corrugated sheet or regular grid as core or stiffener respectively. The computer program developed was first checked for accuracy by comparing with results available in the literature for isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical panels. Then it was used to optimize the ply orientation in the sublaminate for any specified geometry, material, loading and boundary conditions.

In this study, the gluability of Bambusa balcooa and Bambusa vulgaris, two locally grown bamboo species of Bangladesh was assessed. As the culm wall thickness of bamboos decreases from bottom to top, a culm portion of up to 5. 4 m and 3. 6 m were used from the base of B. balcooa and B. vulgaris, respectively, to get rectangular strips of uniform thickness. The color of the B. vulgaris strips was yellowish brown and that of B. balcooa was reddish brown. The strips were treated in borax-boric, bleaching and carbonization for extending the service life of the laminates. The preservative treatments changed the color of the strips. Borax–boric acid treated strips were reddish brown. When bleached with hydrogen peroxide, the color of the strips turned into whitish yellow. Carbonization produced dark brownish strips having coffee flavor. Chemical constituents for untreated and treated strips were determined. B. vulgaris was more acidic than B. balcooa.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Raw {{material}} costs and limited material availability and quality have created significant {{interest in and}} opportunities {{for the application of}} nondestructive evaluation techniques to improve wood processing technologies. The incentives come from the desire to 1) manufacture the highest valued product, 2) conserve the amount of raw material used, 3) use lower priced and often, lower quality raw materials, and 4) meet future demands for wood products in an economy with stark contrasts of a declining wood supply and increasing pressure from environmental concerns. Developing appropriate non-destructive evaluation techniques requires research and development of new concepts and extending the usability of known principles. Dielectrics is one such technique that offers a number of potential applications in areas such as moisture detection, drying and re-drying, grading and sorting, defect detection, curing and gluing of engineered products, repairing and patching of <b>laminated</b> <b>panel</b> products, monitoring of adhesive curing, and manufacturing of aligned fiber products. The objective of this research was to fill the void in knowledge that existed about the dielectric properties of typical features found on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) wood. Features investigated included clearwood, various sizes of loose and tight knots, knot holes, pitch pockets, pitch streaks, and blue stain. The dielectric constant and loss tangent were analyzed on a global (whole-feature) basis under a range of excitation frequencies and moisture content conditions typically found in wood processing. This research required the development of specialized instrumentation, because measuring the dielectric properties of wood over a broad full range of moisture and excitation frequency conditions is particularly challenging. Results suggested that there are optimal combinations of moisture and excitation frequencies suitable for applications where it is necessary to distinguish between certain wood features. Simple classifications of features measured at such optimal working conditions are presented in addition to global data on the expected dielectric properties of each feature. These results form a fundamental basis for the development of future stand-alone, dielectric-based applications or applications using dielectric-based in conjunction with and other sensing methods...|$|E

This report {{presents}} {{results from}} {{a study on the}} response of singly curved fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) sandwich and <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> subjected to localised blast loads. The aim of the project was to investigate and compare the blast mitigation potential of each panel type and the influence of curvature on the response. Three radii of curvature were examined for both panel types, namely infinite (flat), 1000 mm and 500 mm. The FRP <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> were designed to consist of 1 - 5 layers of Eglass fibre reinforced epoxy sheets. The FRP sandwich panels consisted of a PVC foam core with 6 layers of FRP sheets on either side. Vacuum infusion, with the aid of three moulds, was used to manufacture the panels. The average thicknesses and areal densities of the FRP sandwich and <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> were 18. 7 mm and 4. 9 mm; and 862 - 8 g/ 1 m 2 and 8458 -g/m 2 respectively. Three point quasi-static flexural tests were conducted on FRP sandwich and laminate specimens where the localised compression failure beneath the central loading bar was evident on both types of structures. The presence of the core reduced the damage observed on the back face of the FRP sandwich specimens. Blast tests were conducted on a horizontal ballistic pendulum at the Blast Impact and Survivability Research Unit (BISRU), University of Cape Town. Localised blasts were generated by detonating circular cylinder PE 4 plastic explosives, placed at a constant standoff distance of 10 mm. The charge mass ranged from 10 g to 32. 5 g across all the panels. The failure modes of the blast loaded panels were identified by a post-test inspection. The failure mode initiation charts for the F RP sandwich panels revealed that failure modes were initially observed on the front face sheet and core material with slight appearance of delamination on the back face sheet. Increasing the charge mass resulted in the rupture of the front face sheet and penetration of the core. Additional failure of the back face sheet was also evident as the charge mass increased. The failure mode initiation charts of the FRP <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> exhibited less severe failure modes across a greater charge mass range that eventually lead to complete fibre rupture at higher charge masses. Delamination of the front face sheet of the flat FRP sandwich panels was initially observed in the centre of the panel and spread into the exterior region for increasing charge mass. The failure of the core material initially reduced the delaminated area of the back face sheet, however once the rupture of the front face sheet occurred, the delaminated area of the front face sheet reduced and the delaminated area of the back face sheet increased. This was similar for the curved FRP sandwich panels except that the delaminated area was predominately parallel to the axis of curvature prior to rupture and perpendicular to the axis of curvature subsequent to rupture. Delamination in the flat FRP <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> was initially observed in the centre of the panel and along the clamped boundary. Increasing charge mass resulted in the delaminated region spreading across the panel. As with the FRP sandwich panels, the delaminated area of the curved FRP <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> was initially observed parallel to the axis of curvature prior to rupture. Debonding of the FRP sandwich panels was initially observed at both of the front and back interfaces. For the front interface, the debonded lengths were observed in the centre and in exterior test area of the panel, but only in exterior test area for the back interface. With the rupture of the front face sheet, the debonded length of the front interface decreased and the back interface increased and spread across the entire test area. The blast rupture threshold of the two panel types were compared in terms of largest charge mass resisted. For each radii category, the FRP <b>laminate</b> <b>panels</b> outperformed the FRP sandwich panels, namely by 5 g for the flat panels (25 g vs 20 g) and 9 g for the 1000 mm curved panels (27. 5 g vs 18. 5 g).
