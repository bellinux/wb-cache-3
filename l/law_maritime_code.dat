40|$|In {{response}} to the increasing maritime litigations that come along with {{the rapid growth of}} foreign trade in recent years, China opportunely adopted its <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code</b> and the Special Rules. This is certainly a significant progress in Chinese maritime legislation because for a long time neither a practical, substantive <b>law</b> for <b>maritime</b> disputes nor an appropriate procedural law for admiralty litigation was available in China. The Chinese courts had to deal with maritime disputes mainly by seeking reference from the general principles of relevant international practices. To improve this situation, the adoption of the Chinese <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code</b> and the Special Rules is undoubtedly long awaited by both Chinese legal regime and the international <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> society. Nevertheless, as China's maritime legislation is still in its early stage, the imperfection in its drafting, the inadequacy of its judicial consideration and the inconsistency between its admiralty practices are virtually inevitable. In a comparative sense, in order to further improve the <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> regime, China might well draw some beneficial references from the experience of the admiralty practice in some other legal systems. This thesis commences with a brief historical review of <b>maritime</b> lien <b>laws.</b> It then proceeds to evaluate the Chinese substantive <b>laws</b> relating to <b>maritime</b> liens. Finally, the thesis attempts to address the procedural issues in the enforcement of maritime liens...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{in-depth}} {{analysis of a}} seemingly uncomplicated legal relationship. The relationship between two very significant acts - the Obligatory Relations Act and the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code,</b> out of which the Obligatory Relations Act certainly falls {{under the category of}} general and the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code</b> of special acts. The complexity {{stems from the fact that}} the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code</b> although, in essence, determined by international agreements, is likewise relevant for establishing whether a provision of the Obligatory Relations Act, although unregulated either by the <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code</b> or binding international agreements, is acceptable for application in maritime contracts. In other words, it is a matter of the application of a provision of the Obligatory Relations Act to maritime contracts “in an appropriate manner”...|$|R
5000|$|The most flourishing age of Trani was the 11th century, when {{it became}} an episcopal see in place of Canosa, {{destroyed}} by the Saracens. Its port, well placed for the Crusades, then developed greatly, becoming the most important on the Adriatic Sea. In the year 1063 Trani issued the Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris, which is [...] "the oldest surviving <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> <b>code</b> of the Latin West". There was also Jewish community in Trani, which was {{under the protection of}} the king until it was given to the Archbishop Samarus during the reign of Henry VI {{at the end of the}} 12th century. In that period many great families from the main Italian Maritime Republics (Amalfi, Pisa, Ragusa and Venice) established themselves in Trani. Trani, in turn, maintained a consul in Venice from 12th century. The presence of other consulates in many northern Europe centres, even in England and Netherlands, shows Trani's trading and political importance in the Middle Ages. Emperor Frederick II built a massive castle in Trani. Under his rule, in the early 13th century, the city reached its highest point of wealth and prosperity.|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{presence}} of sailors and sea-merchants {{in the major}} port cities of the late antique and early Byzantine periods made them an important and influential subculture. This paper looks at the range of perceptions of the maritime community that exist in late Roman and early Byzantine sources. Various secular and ecclesiastical attitudes are discussed and compared with relevant sections of the civil and <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> <b>codes.</b> When sailors, seamerchants, and other mariners are mentioned by their contemporaries, they are {{more often than not}} portrayed in an unfavourable light. The legislation suggests that the negative perception of these men does have some basis in reality, yet the traditional view of these men as unsavoury and dishonest characters needs to be questioned. This paper asks why the ancient sources perceived sailors and sea-merchants {{in the way that they}} did. It discusses the social stigma attached to these men, the potential moral threat that they posed, their superstitious nature, and their socially disruptive and subversive behaviour. This paper highlights the reasons why modern scholars have tended to overlook the {{presence of}} the maritime community and their sociological importance in major port cities of this period. It argues that the maritime crowd had an integral role in the shaping of the economy, society, and even the church during this period. 29 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In 23 September 2009 the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, shortly the Rotterdam Rules, was signed. Its {{success is}} yet a mystery because only three states have {{ratified}} the Rules. This is mainly {{due to the}} growing liabilities of the carrier side and higher limitation of liability. The new definition maritime performing party has raised questions and criticism, too. The definition of a maritime performing party develops the third party protection to a wider scope than before. This article will enlighten the actual impact of the maritime performing party to the Finnish <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code.</b> How do the Rotterdam Rules change {{the position of a}} non-contractual third party? What changes will the rules on maritime performing party bring to Finnish <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> as part of the Nordic maritime legislation? There are three existing conventions on carriage of goods by sea. The Hague Rules do not cover the issue of a sub-carrier at all but the Hague-Visby Rules added an article that allows agents and servants of the carrier to enjoy the benefits of the contract of carriage if the shipper claims damages directly from a sub-carrier. The Hamburg Rules took third party protection a bit further by including independent contractors to the sphere of the protection of third parties. The same result can be attained through a so called Himalaya clause that means a contract clause benefitting a third party. The Rotterdam Rules define a maritime performing party as any sub-carrier performing the carrier’s duties in port area or at sea. The definition expands the scope of the sub-carrier’s that can be covered and it would include sea carriers, stevedores, terminal operators, agents, lightering companies, freight forwarders, and all modes of inland carriers when used exclusively in the port area. The Finnish <b>maritime</b> <b>code</b> resembles the Hamburg Rules concerning the protection of third parties; a shipper can bring a direct action against a third party that is protected with the carrier’s defences and limits of liability. Under the Finnish <b>maritime</b> <b>code</b> the third parties can be sea carriers and stevedores. If the Rotterdam Rules were implemented in Finland, the coverage of the <b>maritime</b> <b>code</b> would be clearer and wider...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{transition}} from the High to the Late Middle Ages, and coinciding with the renewal of commercial shipping activity along the Atlantic and Baltic coasts or Europe, a new <b>maritime</b> <b>law</b> based on established customs began to envolve on this part of the continent, a law created by the very people who paticipated in this seafaring activity. This collection of rules, which became the common law of the people who navigated those coasts, was partially set down in written form, resulting in the legal text known as the Rôles d'Oléron, a work which became so widely distributed that from the mid 13 th century up to 1681 it came to be applied from the Baltic coasts to the Straits of Gibraltar by all those who werw concerned with shipping. Furthermore, in addition to this <b>maritime</b> <b>code,</b> which together with esblished maritime customs constituted the common law of those seafarers, each of the kingdoms and each of the coastal towns formulated at the same time their own particular <b>maritime</b> <b>laws,</b> thus completing the legal framework for the principal shipping activities that were carried out along the northern and western coasts of Europe...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} going to do a {{comparative}} study of the Nordic <b>Maritime</b> <b>Codes,</b> Chinese <b>Maritime</b> <b>Code</b> and Rotterdam Rules (United Nations Convention on Contract for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea) with respect to carrier’s obligations and liabilities imposed hereupon. The backgrounds for this study are the ambitious goals and controversial future of the Rotterdam Rules, the significant roles that the Nordic countries and China have played in international carriage of goods by sea, and the important position of the carrier’s mandatory obligations and liabilities in this field. Through the comparative study, this thesis tries to disclose the similarities and differences between these legal regimes, to see what changes will be brought to the Nordic/Chinese <b>maritime</b> <b>laws</b> and what impact may be led to their shipping industries if they finally accept the Rotterdam Rules. Based on these backgrounds, the detail contents discussed in this thesis include: (1) the legislative history and scope of application; (2) period of carrier’s responsibility; (3) carrier’s obligations; (4) carrier’s liability for physical loss of or damage to the goods; (5) carrier’s liability for delay in delivery; (6) carrier’s liabilities for deviation, deck cargo and live animals. Each of the NMCs, CMC and the Rotterdam Rules is respectively discussed in detail under each part. By comparing the regional solutions and the new international Convention, {{at the end of this}} thesis the possible future of the Rotterdam Rules is discussed from Nordic and Chinese perspectives of views...|$|R
