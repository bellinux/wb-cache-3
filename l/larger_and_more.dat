5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is closely}} related to the much <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> recent tyrannosaurid Tyrannosaurus rex. Like most tyrannosaurids, Daspletosaurus was a multi-tonne bipedal {{predator}} equipped with dozens of large, sharp teeth. Daspletosaurus had the small forelimbs typical of tyrannosaurids, although they were proportionately longer than in other genera.|$|E
5|$|During the Pliocene, <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> {{advanced}} cetaceans appeared. Megalodon apparently further refined its hunting {{strategies to}} cope with these large whales. Numerous fossilized flipper bones (i.e., segments of the pectoral fins) and caudal vertebrae of large whales from the Pliocene have been found with megalodon bite marks, which suggests that megalodon would immobilize a large whale by ripping apart or biting off its fins before killing and feeding on it.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{architectural}} features incorporated throughout the castle included: corbelled battlemented wallheads on the towers; turrets set above {{first or second}} storey level; a large elongated aperture provided light in the first floor hall; and shot holes in the southwest tower.

5|$|There are two subspecies, {{which are}} highly similar and of dubious validity. The {{nominate}} subspecies S. n. nigrescens occurs on the Pacific coastal region from British Columbia to northern California, while S. n. halseii, described by Giraud in 1841, occupies the inland parts of its range. S. n. halseii birds are slightly <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> gray in their upperparts.|$|E

Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed the beetles in humans, who share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E

Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E
5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, {{it is evident that}} the site experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, most of the major structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
