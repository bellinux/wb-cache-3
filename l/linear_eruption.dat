40|$|Cutaneous {{larva migrans}} (CLM) {{is a rare}} serpiginous {{cutaneous}} eruption caused by accidental penetration and migration in the skin with infective larvae of nematode that normally {{do not have the}} human as their host. Although CLM has a worldwide distribution, the infection is most frequent in warmer climates. More recently, they have been increasingly imported from the tropics or subtropics by travelers. We experienced two patients who had pruritic serpiginous <b>linear</b> <b>eruption</b> in their skin for a few weeks after traveling to the endemic areas (Brazil and Thailand, respectively). After the treatment with albendazole, the skin lesions resolved with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. We report herein two cases of cutaneous larva migrans successfully treated with albendazole...|$|E
40|$|Lichens striatus (LS) is an acquired, {{self-limiting}} inflammatory dermatosis {{that follows}} the lines of Blaschko. The etiology of the eruption is unknown, but several theories have been proposed with focus on environmental factors, viral infection, cutaneous injury, hypersensitivity, and genetic predisposition. We describe a 19 -year-old woman who developed a unilateral <b>linear</b> <b>eruption</b> 17 months after allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Histopathology revealed features, which were consistent with LS. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, our patient is the first case describing the appearance of LS occurring after allogenic stem cell transplantation. We speculate that this condition represents an unusual form of localized, chronic graftversus-host disease. (Ann Dermatol 24 (1) 87 ∼ 89, 2012) -Keywords...|$|E

40|$|Naevoid {{psoriasis}} is {{a controversial}} entity and {{has often been}} used synonymously with psoriasiform inflammatory linear verrcous epidermal naevus (ILVEN) by some workers. Two patients having a <b>linear</b> psoriasiform <b>eruption</b> of 3 and 10 years duration respectively are reported. The winter aggravation of the lesions, the characteristic histology and favourable response to treatment led to the diagnosis of linear psoriasis. These features distinguished it from psoriasiform ILVEN which is a close differential diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Sporotrichosis is a {{subacute}} {{or chronic}} granulomatous mycosis caused by fungus of the Sporothrix schenckii complex. It {{is considered to}} be a rare condition in most parts of the world. It mostly causes cutaneous infection but can also cause multisystemic disease. Unlike most deep cutaneous mycoses which have a primary pulmonary focus, it is usually caused by direct inoculation of the fungus into the skin causing a classical <b>linear,</b> lymphocutaneous nodular <b>eruption.</b> However, atypical presentations of the condition can occur especially in immunosuppressed individuals. We report the case of a severely immunosuppressed female who presented with disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis which was initially diagnosed and treated as disseminated cutaneous Kaposi’s sarcoma...|$|R
40|$|Large {{magnitude}} explosive eruptions are {{the result}} of the rapid and large-scale transport of silicic magma stored in the Earth's crust, but the mechanics of erupting teratonnes of silicic magma remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the combined effect of local crustal extension and magma chamber overpressure can sustain <b>linear</b> dyke-fed explosive <b>eruptions</b> with mass fluxes in excess of 10 ^ 10 kg/s from shallow-seated (4 – 6 km depth) chambers during moderate extensional stresses. Early eruption column collapse is facilitated with eruption duration of the order of few days with an intensity of at least one order of magnitude greater than the largest eruptions in the 20 th century. The conditions explored in this study are one way in which high mass eruption rates can be achieved to feed large explosive eruptions. Our results corroborate geological and volcanological evidences from volcano-tectonic complexes such as the Sierra Madre Occidental (Mexico) and the Taupo Volcanic Zone (New Zealand) ...|$|R
40|$|Conditions {{required}} to support buoyant convective plumes are investigated for explosive volcanic eruptions from circular and linear vents on Earth, Venus, and Mars. Vent geometry (linear versus circular) plays {{a significant role}} in the ability of an explosive eruption to sustain a buoyant plume. On Earth, linear and circular vent eruptions are both capable of driving buoyant plumes to equivalent maximum rise heights, however, linear vent plumes are more sensitive to vent size. For analogous mass <b>eruption</b> rates, <b>linear</b> vent plumes surpass circular vent plumes in entrainment efficiency approximately when L(sub o) > 3 r(sub o) owing to the larger entrainment area relative to the control volume. Relative to circular vents, linear vents on Venus favor column collapse and the formation of pyroclastic flows because the range of conditions {{required to}} establish and sustain buoyancy is narrow. When buoyancy can be sustained, however, maximum plume heights exceed those from circular vents. For current atmospheric conditions on Mars, <b>linear</b> vent <b>eruptions</b> are capable of injecting volcanic material slightly higher than analogous circular vent eruptions. However, both geometries are more likely to produce pyroclastic fountains, as opposed to convective plumes, owing to the low density atmosphere. Due to the atmospheric density profile and water content on Earth, explosive eruptions enjoy favorable conditions for producing sustained buoyant columns, while pyroclastic flows would be relatively more prevalent on Venus and Mars. These results have implications for the injection and dispersal of particulates into the planetary atmosphere and the ability to interpret the geologic record of planetary volcanism...|$|R
40|$|Uturuncu is a {{dormant volcano}} in the Altiplano of SW Bolivia. A present day ~ 70 km {{diameter}} interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} (InSAR) anomaly roughly centred on Uturuncu’s edifice {{is believed to be}} a result of magma intrusion into an active crustal pluton. Past activity at the volcano, spanning 0. 89 to 0. 27 Ma, is exclusively effusive and almost all lavas and domes are dacitic with phenocrysts of plagioclase, orthopyroxene, biotite, ilmenite and Ti-magnetite plus or minus quartz, and microlites of plagioclase and orthopyroxene set in rhyolitic groundmass glass. Plagioclase-hosted melt inclusions (MI) are rhyolitic with major element compositions that are similar to groundmass glasses. H 2 O concentrations plotted versus incompatible elements for individual samples describe a trend typical of near-isobaric, volatile-saturated crystallisation. At 870 °C, the average magma temperature calculated from Fe–Ti oxides, the average H 2 O of 3. 2 ± 0. 7 wt% and CO 2 typically 0. 5 Ma compared to those < 0. 5 Ma. High microlite contents of domes indicate that effusion rates were probably slowest in dome-forming <b>eruptions.</b> <b>Linear</b> trends in WR major and trace element chemistries, highly variable, bimodal mineral compositions, and the presence of mafic enclaves in lavas demonstrate that intrusion of more mafic magmas into the evolving, shallow plutonic mush also occurred further amplifying local temperature fluctuations. Crystallisation and resorption of accessory phases, particularly ilmenite and apatite, can be detected in MI and groundmass glass trace element covariation trends, which are oblique to WRs. Marked variability of Ba, Sr and La in MI can be attributed to temperature-controlled, localised crystallisation of plagioclase, orthopyroxene and biotite within the evolving mush...|$|R
