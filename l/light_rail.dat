5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) brought <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> planning to the Seattle region. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or underground <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line through Roosevelt with a station in the neighborhood. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, only funding <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> from the University District to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{regional}} transit authority (RTA) {{was formed to}} plan and construct a <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system for the Seattle area. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1995, regional voters passed a $3.9 billion plan to build <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> under the RTA in 1996. The downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> use and was built with tracks that would {{be incorporated into the}} initial system. The RTA, later renamed Sound Transit, approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line in 1999. Ownership of the tunnel, including its stations, was transferred to Sound Transit in 2000 but returned two years later to King County Metro under a joint-operations agreement.|$|E
5|$|Metro is {{a public}} {{transportation}} network consisting of <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> and bus rapid transit services covering the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> portion of the network, managed by Metro Transit, has 37 <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> stations in operation across two lines: the Blue Line, running from downtown Minneapolis to the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, and the Green Line, connecting downtown Minneapolis with downtown Saint Paul. In 2016, the Blue and Green lines respectively provided approximately 10.3 million and 12.7 million rides {{for a total of}} 23 million rides across both lines. By ridership, it is the ninth-largest <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{is expected}} to lose bus service in 2019, due to construction at Convention Place station; the tunnel would become served exclusively by <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> trains after that point. International District/Chinatown station will become the transfer point between the north–south Central Link <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line and east–west East Link <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line when the latter opens in 2023, connecting Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Redmond. The new line will include {{the construction of a}} turnback track within the station, as well as reconfiguration of other tracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} opened on July 18, 2009, {{on the first}} day of Central Link service from Downtown Seattle to Tukwila International Boulevard station.

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This would allow the <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

5|$|Fares for Metro <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> {{service are}} the same as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> to Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> to use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the {{formation}} of a regional transit authority (RTA) spurred the planning of a modern <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system for Seattle. In 1995, the transit authority proposed a regional <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system to be built by 2010, including an at-grade or underground <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> line through the University District with a station near The Ave. The RTA proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, citing its $6.7 billion price. A smaller, $3.9 billion plan was approved in November 1996, with the University District as its northern terminus; an extension north to Northgate via Roosevelt was deferred until additional funding could be secured.|$|E

5|$|International District/Chinatown station {{consists}} of two side platforms situated under street level in an open-air structure and adjoining public plaza. It opened on September 15, 1990, as International District station, and was used exclusively by buses until a two-year renovation from 2005 to 2007 to accommodate <b>light</b> <b>rail.</b> Link <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> service to International District/Chinatown station began on July 18, 2009. Trains and buses serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> trains is six minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. In 2023, the station will become the merge point between Central Link and the East Link Extension, which will continue east towards Bellevue and Redmond.|$|E
5|$|Link <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> {{service from}} Downtown Seattle to Tukwila International Boulevard station began on July 18, 2009, {{accompanied}} by a temporary shuttle bus to bring passengers to the airport from Tukwila. SeaTac/Airport station opened to regular service on December 19, 2009, during a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by 500 people, including U.S. Representative Jim McDermott of Seattle, Sound Transit Board Chair Greg Nickels and Port of Seattle Commissioner John Creighton. Initial ridership counts in January 2010 showed that the station increased <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> ridership by 2,000 passengers during its first month of service, coinciding with the holiday travel system. SeaTac/Airport station would serve as the southern terminus of the Link <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> system until the opening of Angle Lake station on September 24, 2016.|$|E

5|$|PortLINK is {{the most}} complex of the proposals, as it {{involves}} making decisions {{on the future of}} the Outer Harbor and Grange railway lines. The report proposes several different options for these lines. They could be electrified but remain as heavy rail, or they could be converted to <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> - with potential spurlines added to West Lakes and Semaphore. <b>Light</b> <b>rail</b> options for the Grange railway line include converting the entire line to <b>light</b> <b>rail,</b> diverting it to West Lakes and closing the section beyond Albert Park station, or replacing it with new on-street routes to Grange and West Lakes. The PortLINK routes are very similar to a group of <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> extensions to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore that were announced in the 2008 South Australian Budget but then scrapped in the 2012 budget.|$|E
