The Spirit was {{introduced}} in the Mexican market for 1990, one year after its début in the U.S. and Canada. The 1990-1991 Mexican versions were equipped with the U.S. market Plymouth Acclaim tail lights. The initial 1990-model Spirits used a version of the 2.5L engine operating on leaded gasoline, equipped with a carburetor, a tubular exhaust header, and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler's U.S.-market <b>Lean</b> <b>Burn</b> emission control systems of the late-1970s.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gasoline}} engine is a , 1.0 litre, ECA series 3-cylinder unit providing <b>lean</b> <b>burn</b> operation with an air-to-fuel ratio that can reach 25.8 to 1. The engine utilizes lightweight aluminum, magnesium, and plastic to minimize weight. The electrical motor assist adds another [...] {{and a maximum}} of 36 pound-feet (49 Nm) of torque when called on, with the aim to boost performance {{to the level of}} a typical 1.5 L petrol engine. It also acts as a generator during deceleration and braking to recharge the vehicle's batteries, and as the Insight's starter motor. (This improves fuel efficiency and extends the lifetime and fade resistance of the brakes, without adding unsprung weight). When the car is not moving, for example at a stop light, the engine shuts off. Power steering is electric, reducing accessory drag.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{gasoline}} and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} engines, diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition (spark plugs). An engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures (compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines); the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder, starting a few degrees {{before top dead center}} (TDC) and continuing during the combustion event. The high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix (burn or oxidize), heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal/pressure difference into mechanical work, i.e., to move the piston. [...] Engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature. Diesel engines are <b>lean</b> <b>burn</b> engines, burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction. [...] They thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio (just enough air to react with the fuel). As Professor Harvey of the University of Toronto notes, [...] "due to the absence of throttling , and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture, diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines", generally; Harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of Schipper et al. and the estimates of >20% lower fuel use and (given differences in energy content between fuel types) >15% lower energy use. Gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines, and external combustion engine, both can also be designed to take diesel fuel.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the numerical {{study of a}} diesel direct injection heavy duty truck engine converted to hydrogen. The engine has a power turbine connected through a clutch and a continuously variable transmission to the crankshaft. The power turbine may be disconnected and by-passed when it is inefficient or inconvenient to use. The conversion is obtained by replacing the Diesel injector with a hydrogen injector and the glow plug with a jet ignition device. The hydrogen engine operates different modes of combustion depending on the relative phasing of the main injection and the jet ignition. The engine generally operates mostly in Diesel-like mode, with the most part of the main injection following the suitable creation in cylinder conditions by jet ignition. For medium-low loads, better efficienciy is obtained with the gasoline-like mode jet igniting the premixed homogeneous mixture at top dead centre. It&# 039;s permitted at higher loads or at very low loads for the excessive peak pressure or the mixture too <b>lean</b> to <b>burn</b> rapidly. The hydrogen engine has better efficiency than Diesel outputs and fuel conversion.

40|$|Traffic related NOx and {{particle}} emission remain a significant concern {{particularly in the}} urban environment. Electrification offers a medium to long term solution, but there remains a need to significantly reduce internal combustion engine emissions in the short and medium term, and potentially {{in the long term}} for long range inter city transportation. Late injection low temperature combustion (LTC) has the potential to achieve ultra-low emissions levels in a compression ignition engine by increasing the <b>lean</b> pre-mixed <b>burn</b> fraction. However, significant quantities of diluent are normally required to achieve the required delay in ignition and pre-mixing to achieve LTC. This results in high boost requirements, increased pumping work and the complexity of the air handling system and potentially adversely impacting fuel economy. In this paper, results from a single cylinder light duty research engine are presented using a novel ramped combustion chamber focused at mid to high engine loads. The ramped combustion chamber improves mixing and enables more retarded injection timings than those possible on conventional bowl designs. This combustion strategy has enabled LTC conditions to be achieved at lower dilution rates, typically 20 - 30 % at loads up to 15 bar IMEP. CFD analysis of the air-fuel interaction indicates the ramped bowl effectively deflects fuel away from the squish region enabling very late injection timings. One dimensional analysis of the engine system was used to investigate the potential of late exhaust valve opening in improving work recovery, resulting in improved fuel consumption over the baseline LTC valve timing...|$|R

Third, for a given parameter selection we create detailed tracking graphs representing the complete evolution of all features in a combustion simulation over several hundred time steps. Finally, we discuss a user interface that correlates the tracking information with interactive rendering of the segmented isosurfaces enabling an in-depth analysis of the temporal behavior. We demonstrate our approach by analyzing three numerical simulations of lean hydrogen flames subject to different levels of turbulence. Due to their unstable nature, <b>lean</b> flames <b>burn</b> in cells separated by locally extinguished regions.

40|$|Future {{requirements}} for emission reduction from combustion engines in ground vehicles might {{be met by}} using the HCCI combustion concept. In this concept {{a more or less}} homogenous air fuel mixture is compressed to auto ignition. This gives good fuel consumption compared to a normal SI engine and its ability to <b>burn</b> <b>lean</b> mixtures at low temperatures has a positive impact on exhaust emissions. However, there are challenges associated with this concept, for instance its limited operating range and combustion control. The objective of this work is to investigate a hybrid concept, based on a combination of HCCI combustion of n-heptane and SI combustion of hydrogen. The basic idea is to initiate HCCI combustion with a spark ignited stratified lean hydrogen mixture. To verify that the combustion sequence consists of flame front combustion followed by HCCI combustion, photographs of OH chemiluminescence from the combustion were taken. This was made in a single cylinder engine with optical access through a quartz window in the piston. The performance of the hybrid combustion was compared to that of pure HCCI combustion. Chemiluminescence images show an expanding flame front initiated by the spark plug. It is shown that the flame front propagation through the hydrogen charge can be used to expand the operating range of HCCI combustion, especially towards lower loads. The hybrid combustion concept gives greater scope for controlling the combustion than the pure HCCI concept.
