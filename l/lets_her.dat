5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden, but the story differs in several ways. Published by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1864, the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked on a desert island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried {{and they have a}} new child. For the sake of his wife's happiness, he never <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> know that he is alive. The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns {{on the day of the}} wedding. Rather than announce himself, he attempts to leave and dies in the process, his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her. The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John's true death at the climax. The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly, making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed.|$|E
