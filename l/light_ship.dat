5|$|Pliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was {{in command}} of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had {{meanwhile}} decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his <b>light</b> <b>ship</b> to the rescue of Rectina's party.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a <b>light</b> <b>ship</b> to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
25|$|In March 1942, Matapedia was {{reassigned to}} the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). She {{remained}} with this escort {{force for the}} majority of the war. In June 1943, with the establishment of escort groups within WLEF, Matapedia was assigned to group W-5. On 8 September 1943, she was rammed amidships by the freighter SS Scorton in foggy conditions near the Sambro <b>Light</b> <b>Ship</b> at the entrance to Halifax Harbour. The damage was significant and Matapedia would not return to service until 1944.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to stem the losses to Allied {{merchant}} shipping along the Atlantic coast, Vice Admiral Adolphus Andrews, Commander of the Eastern Sea Frontier, established a roving ASW patrol. Jones, Lieutenant Commander Hugh Black in command, departed New York 22 February for this duty. While passing the swept channel off Ambrose <b>Light</b> <b>Ship,</b> Jones made a possible submarine contact and attacked immediately. For 5 hours, Jones ran 12 attack patterns, dropping some 57 depth charges. Oil slicks appeared during the last six attacks, but no other debris was detected. Having expended all her charges, Jones returned to New York to rearm. Subsequent investigation failed to reveal any conclusive evidence of a sunken submarine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1832 {{the first}} {{lightship}} on the Great Lakes was placed at Waugoshance Shoal. That wooden <b>light</b> <b>ship</b> was the Lois McLain.

2500|$|The German fleet {{continued}} {{in a similar}} deployment to that which it had used during the day, a single column [...] in line ahead. At 2125 Scheer ordered his fleet to a course of 142 degrees. [...] SMS Westfalen was slow in responding, so Scheer issued an adjusted course of 137 degrees at 2146. Westfalen misinterpreted the signal and thus turned to 156 degrees, finally turning to 133 degrees as instructed at 2232. [...] At 2300 the course to head directly for the Horns Reef <b>light</b> <b>ship</b> was [...] set at 130 degrees and Westfalen had complied by 2320.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 May U-20 {{stopped a}} {{merchant}} schooner, the Earl of Lathom, off the Old Head of Kinsale, examined her papers, then ordered her crew to leave before sinking the schooner with gunfire. On 6 May, U-20 fired a torpedo at Cayo Romano from Cuba, a British steamer flying a neutral flag, off Fastnet Rock narrowly missing {{by a few}} feet. At 22:30 on 5 May, the Royal Navy sent an uncoded warning to all ships [...] – [...] "Submarines active off the south coast of Ireland" [...] – and at midnight an addition was made to the regular nightly warnings, [...] "submarine off Fastnet". On 6 May U-20 sank the 6,000 ton steamer Candidate. It then failed to get off {{a shot at the}} 16,000 ton liner Arabic, because although she kept a straight course the liner was too fast, but then sank another 6,000 ton British cargo ship flying no flag, Centurion, all in the region of the Coningbeg <b>light</b> <b>ship.</b> The specific mention of a submarine was dropped from the midnight broadcast on 6–7 May as news of the new sinkings had not yet reached the navy at Queenstown, and it was correctly assumed that there was no longer a submarine at Fastnet.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1917, the 6th Flotilla was {{transferred}} to Flanders to reinforce the German torpedo boat forces based in the Belgian ports. The Flotilla set out from Helgoland for Flanders on 22 January, but decoding of German radio signals by Room 40 warned the British of the German intentions, and the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers sent to intercept the German torpedo boats. The British set six light cruisers, two flotilla leaders and sixteen destroyers to intercept the eleven German ships, deploying them in several groups {{to make sure that}} all possible routes were covered. At about 03:45 hr CET (02:45 hr GMT) on the night of 22/23 January, the 6th Flotilla encountered three British light cruisers ( [...] , [...] and [...] ) east of the North Hinder <b>light</b> <b>ship.</b> V69, leader of the German flotilla, attempted a torpedo attack against the British cruisers, but was hit by British shells, jamming her rudder, which caused V69 to collide with , badly damaging both ships, although both survived. The flotilla managed to break contact under the cover of smoke screens, but S50 lost contact with the rest of the Flotilla. Her captain decided to proceed independently to Zeebrugge, but ran into four British destroyers ( [...] , , [...] and [...] ) off the Schouwen Bank shortly after 05:00 CET. In an exchange of gunfire, S50 hit Simoom several times and was herself hit by British shells before torpedoing and badly damaging Simoom. The remaining British ships still blocked S50s course to Zeebrugge, and S50 retired to the east and returned to Germany. Simoom was scuttled by [...] later that day.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lighter</b> <b>ships</b> {{were used}} for various functions, {{including}} acting as scouts, and relaying signals between the flagship {{and the rest of}} the fleet. This was necessary because from the flagship, only a small part of the line would be in clear sight.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific Fleet also {{includes}} coastal combatants such as corvettes, patrol ships, mine warfare <b>ships,</b> <b>light</b> amphibious <b>ships,</b> and support vessels. There are also naval aviation and coastal troops and naval infantry components.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 {{the company}} built two <b>light</b> <b>ships,</b> which were sisters: Nahkiainen was used until 1976 and Ärangsgrund was later {{converted}} into cargo ship that operated until the 1980s.

C., where he remain'd until lately, when he escap'd among the exchang'd by assuming the name of a dead soldier, and coming up via Wilmington with the rest. Was about sixteen months in Salisbury.|$|E
60|$|We worked on; but {{the water}} {{increasing}} in the hold, {{it was apparent that}} the ship would founder; and though the storm began to abate a little, yet as it was not possible she could swim till we might run into a port, so the master continued firing guns for help; and a <b>light</b> <b>ship,</b> who had rid it out just a-head of us, ventured a boat out to help us. It was with the utmost hazard the boat came near us, but it was impossible for us to get on board, or for the boat to lie near the ship's side, till at last the men rowing very heartily, and venturing their lives to save ours, our men cast them a rope over the stern with a buoy to it, and then veered it out a great length, which they, after great labour and hazard, took hold of, and we hauled them close under our stern, and got all into their boat. It was to no purpose for them or us, after we were in the boat, to think of reaching to their own ship; so all agreed to let her drive, and only to pull her in towards shore as much as we could; and our master promised them, that if the boat was staved upon shore he would make it good to their master: so partly rowing and partly driving, our boat went away to the northward, sloping towards the shore almost as far as Winterton Ness.|$|E

2500|$|The Spectacle Reef Light {{was built}} during a forty-year period—between 1870 and 1910—when {{engineers}} {{began to build}} lights on isolated islands, reefs, and shoals that were significant navigational hazards.
