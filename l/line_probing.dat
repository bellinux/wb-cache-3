This riboswitch unlike previously characterized AdoCbl riboswitches is thought to inhibit transcription termination as transcription terminator helices have been identified downstream of the riboswitch.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{conformal}} field theories with extended W W -symmetry algebras have dual descriptions {{in terms}} of weakly coupled higher spin gravity in AdS 3 at large central charge. Observables that can be computed and compared in the two descriptions include Rényi and entanglement entropies, and correlation functions of local operators. We develop techniques for computing these, {{in a manner that}} sheds light on when and why one can expect agreement between such quantities {{on each side of the}} duality. We set up the computation of excited state Rényi entropies in the bulk {{in terms of}} Chern-Simons connections, and show how this directly parallels the CFT computation of correlation functions. More generally, we consider the vacuum conformal block for general operators with Δ ∼ c. When two of the operators obey Δ c ≪ 1 /c≪ 1, we show by explicit computation that the vacuum conformal block is computed by a bulk Wilson <b>line</b> <b>probing</b> an asymptotically AdS 3 background with higher spin fields excited, the latter emerging as the effective bulk description of the excited state produced by the heavy operators.

40|$|Suppose {{that for}} a set H of n unknown hyperplanes in the Euclidean d-dimensional space, a <b>line</b> <b>probe</b> is {{available}} which reports the set of intersection points of a query line with the hyperplanes. Under this model, this paper investigates the complexity to find a generic line for H and further to determine the hyperplanes in H. This problem arises in factoring the u-resultant to solve systems of polynomials (e. g., Renegar [12]). We prove that d+ 1 <b>line</b> <b>probes</b> are sufficient to determine H. Algorithmically, the time complexity to find a generic line and reconstruct H from O(dn) probed points of intersection is important. It is shown that a generic line can be computed in O(dn log n) time after d <b>line</b> <b>probes,</b> and by an additional d <b>line</b> <b>probes,</b> all the hyperplanes in H are reconstructed in O(dn log n) time.

A malfunction can lead to disruption of network services, loss of data and network congestion. To avoid these, the network needs to be managed and maintained effectively. This is where network management and monitoring is imperative. Network monitoring and management uses specifically chosen network monitoring tools to overcome network problems. A set of tools will be used to produce a visual display of a network. They will be used to demonstrate that alerts generated by a monitoring tool can be used to show the visual and geographical locations of where the network problem has occurred. These tools can be used to troubleshoot the network to determine the source of the problem. The chosen tool PolyMon and the developed tool NetMaCon work by monitoring a network from a centralized location. Their functionalities have been analyzed and explained in detail.

40|$|We analyze {{extensive}} data on NGC 1377 {{from the}} Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). Within {{the category of}} nascent starbursts that we previously selected as having infrared-to-radio continuum ratios in large excess of the average and containing hot dust, NGC 1377 has the largest infrared excess yet measured. Optical imaging reveals a morphological distortion suggestive of a recent accretion event. Infrared spectroscopy reveals a compact and opaque source dominated by a hot, self-absorbed continuum (20 in the 10 m silicate band). We provide phys-ical evidence against nonstellar activity being the heating source. H ii regions are detected through the single [Ne ii] <b>line,</b> <b>probing</b> 85 % of ionizing photons are suppressed by dust. The only other detected emission features are molecular hydrogen lines, arguably excitedmainly by shocks, besides photodissociation regions, and weak aromatic bands. The new observations support our interpretation {{in terms of an}} extremely young starburst (< 1 Myr). More generally, galaxies deficient in radio synchrotron emission are likely observed within a few Myr of the onset of a starburst and after a long quiescence, prior to the replenishment of the interstellar medium with cosmic rays. The similar infrared-radio properties of NGC 1377 and some infrared-luminous galaxies suggest that NGC 1377 constitutes an archetype that will be useful to better understand starburst evolution.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the combinatorial complexity of an algorithm {{to determine the}} geometry and the topology related to an arrangement of hyperplanes in multi-dimensional Euclidean space from the “probing” on the arrangement. The “probing” by a flat means the operation from which we can obtain {{the intersection of the}} flat and the arrangement. For a finite set H of hyperplanes in Ed, we obtain the worst-case number of fixed direction line probes and that of flat probes to determine a generic line of H and H itself. We also mention the bound for the computational complexity of these algorithms based on the efficient <b>line</b> <b>probing</b> algorithm which uses the dual transform to compute a generic line of H. We also consider the problem to approximate arrangements by extending the point probing model, which have connections with computational learning theory such as learning a network of threshold functions, and introduce the vertical probing model and the level probing model. It is shown that the former is closely related to the finger probing for a polyhedron and that the latter depends on the dual graph of the arrangement. The probing for an arrangement can be used to obtain the solution for a given system of algebraic equations by decomposing the μ-resultant into linear factors. It also has interesting applications in robotics such as a motion planning using an ultrasonic device that can detect the distances to obstacles along a specified direction...|$|E
