25|$|To begin communication, the {{bus master}} configures the clock, using a {{frequency}} {{supported by the}} slave device, typically up to a few MHz. The master then selects the slave device with a <b>logic</b> <b>level</b> 0 on the select line. If a waiting period is required, such as for an analog-to-digital conversion, the master must wait for at least {{that period of time}} before issuing clock cycles.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, {{comparators}} can also be classified as open drain or push–pull. Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for <b>logic</b> <b>level</b> high, open drain comparators {{can also be used to}} connect multiple comparators on to a single bus. Push pull output does not need a pull up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} an I2L circuit {{is the common}} emitter open {{collector}} inverter. Typically, an inverter consists of an NPN transistor with the emitter connected to ground and the base biased with a forward current. The input is supplied to the base as either a current sink (low <b>logic</b> <b>level)</b> or as a high-z floating condition (high <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> The output of an inverter is at the collector. Likewise, it is either a current sink (low <b>logic</b> <b>level)</b> or a high-z floating condition (high <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b>|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the {{asymmetric}} input <b>logic</b> <b>levels</b> make PMOS circuits {{susceptible to}} noise.|$|R
50|$|To {{understand}} how the inverter operates, {{it is necessary to}} understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high <b>logic</b> <b>level),</b> the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to sink current (low <b>logic</b> <b>level).</b> Because the output of the inverter can sink current but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem).|$|E
50|$|Nearly all digital {{circuits}} use a consistent <b>logic</b> <b>level</b> for all internal signals. That level, however, varies from one system to another. Interconnecting any two logic families often required special {{techniques such as}} additional pull-up resistors or purpose-built interface circuits known as level shifters. A level shifter connects one digital circuit that uses one <b>logic</b> <b>level</b> to another digital circuit that uses another <b>logic</b> <b>level.</b> Often two level shifters are used, one at each system: A line driver converts from internal logic levels to standard interface line levels; a line receiver converts from interface levels to internal voltage levels.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the voltage}} levels {{are higher than}} <b>logic</b> <b>levels</b> {{typically}} used by integrated circuits, special intervening driver circuits are required to translate <b>logic</b> <b>levels.</b> These also protect the device's internal circuitry from short circuits or transients that may appear on the RS-232 interface, and provide sufficient current {{to comply with the}} slew rate requirements for data transmission.|$|R

5000|$|If all inputs A and B and C are at 0 volts (<b>logic</b> <b>level</b> 0), {{current flowing}} through R will pull the output voltage down until the diodes clamp the output. Since these diodes {{are treated as}} ideal, the output is clamped to 0 volts, which is <b>logic</b> <b>level</b> 0. If any input {{switches}} to a positive voltage (logic 1), current flowing through the now forward-biased diode will pull the output voltage up, providing a positive voltage at the output, a logic 1. Any positive voltage will represent a logic 1 state; the summing of currents through multiple diodes {{does not change the}} <b>logic</b> <b>level.</b> The other diodes are reverse biased and conduct no current.|$|E

[...] In Yourke's design, the two <b>logic</b> reference <b>levels</b> differed by 3 volts. Consequently, two complementary versions were used: an NPN version and a PNP version.

50|$|LVDS is a {{differential}} signaling system, {{meaning that}} it transmits information as {{the difference between the}} voltages on a pair of wires; the two wire voltages are compared at the receiver. In a typical implementation, the transmitter injects a constant current of 3.5 mA into the wires, with the direction of current determining the digital <b>logic</b> <b>level.</b> The current passes through a termination resistor of about 100 to 120 ohms (matched to the cable's characteristic impedance to reduce reflections) at the receiving end, and then returns in the opposite direction via the other wire. From Ohm's law, the voltage difference across the resistor is therefore about 350 mV. The receiver senses the polarity of this voltage to determine the <b>logic</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Read bit lines often swing only a {{fraction}} of the way to Vdd or Vss. A sense amplifier converts this small-swing signal into a full <b>logic</b> <b>level.</b> Small swing signals are faster because the bit line has little drive but a great deal of parasitic capacitance.|$|E
