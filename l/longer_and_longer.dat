However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>longer.</b> Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.|$|E

25|$|Meyer {{continued}} {{writing to}} the end chronologically, not worrying about the backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>longer,</b> so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, {{she realized that she}} wanted to explore many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters {{by the time she was}} finished. In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She has said she was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing the work. She finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003.|$|E

500|$|From the 1930s, Jinnah {{suffered}} from tuberculosis; only {{his sister and}} a few others close to him were aware of his condition. Jinnah believed public knowledge of his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that [...] "you must have read in the papers how during my tours... I suffered, which was not because there was anything wrong with me, but the irregularities [...] and over-strain told upon my health". Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition.

2500|$|Fuelwood and {{charcoal}} {{collection has}} been {{classified as a}} key driver for deforestation as {{it is used to}} account for 95% the population’s energy needs.

2500|$|With the {{publication}} in 1878 of Human, All Too Human (a book of aphorisms ranging from metaphysics to morality to religion to gender studies), {{a new style}} of Nietzsche's work became clear, highly influenced by Afrikan Spir's Thought and Reality and reacting against the pessimistic philosophy of Wagner and Schopenhauer. Nietzsche's friendship with Deussen and Rohde cooled as well. In 1879, after a significant decline in health, Nietzsche had to resign his position at Basel. (Since his childhood, various disruptive illnesses had plagued him, including moments of shortsightedness that left him nearly blind, migraine headaches, and violent indigestion. The 1868 riding accident and diseases in 1870 may have aggravated these persistent conditions, which continued to affect him through his years at Basel, forcing him to take <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> holidays until regular work became impractical.) ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of FAT32, long seek and scan times became more apparent, particularly on very large volumes.

Displaying this line took <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> as the number of clusters increased. FAT32 therefore introduced a special file system information sector where the previously computed amount of free space is preserved over power cycles, so that the free space counter needs to be recalculated only when a removable FAT32 formatted medium gets ejected without first unmounting it or if the system is switched off without properly shutting down the operating system, a problem mostly visible with pre-ATX-style PCs, on plain DOS systems and some battery-powered consumer products.|$|E

2500|$|At the far extreme is severe {{water stress}} which can have {{detrimental}} effects {{on both the}} vine and on potential wine quality. To conserve water, a vine will try to conserve water by limiting its loss through transpiration. The plant hormone abscisic acid triggers the stomata {{on the underside of}} the plant leaf to stay close in order to reduce the amount of water that is evaporated. While conserving water this also has the consequences of limiting the intake of carbon dioxide needed to sustain photosynthesis. If the vine is continually stressed it will keeps it stomata closed for <b>longer</b> <b>and</b> <b>longer</b> periods of time which can eventually cause photosynthesis to stop all together. When a vine has been so deprived of water it can exceed what is known as its permanent wilting point. At this point, the vine can become permanently damaged beyond recovery even if later watered. Viticulturists will carefully watch the plant for signs of severe water stress. Some of the symptoms include: ...|$|E
