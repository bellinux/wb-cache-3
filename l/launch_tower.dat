25|$|A {{launch pad}} is a fixed {{structure}} designed to dispatch airborne vehicles. It generally {{consists of a}} <b>launch</b> <b>tower</b> and flame trench. It is surrounded by equipment used to erect, fuel, and maintain launch vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The Saturn V carried all Apollo lunar {{missions}}. All Saturn V missions {{were launched}} from Launch Complex 39 at the John F. Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After the rocket cleared the <b>launch</b> <b>tower,</b> flight control transferred to Johnson Space Center's Mission Control in Houston, Texas.|$|E
25|$|After {{clearing}} the <b>launch</b> <b>tower,</b> a flight program {{stored in the}} launch vehicle digital computer (LVDC) commanded a roll of the vehicle to orient {{it so that the}} subsequent pitch maneuver pointed the vehicle in the desired azimuth. The roll and pitch commands were controlled by the stored program, and were not affected by navigation measurements. Until the end of the S-IC burn, guidance commands were functions only of time.|$|E
50|$|Aerobees were {{launched}} from 53 m tall <b>launch</b> <b>towers</b> {{to provide the}} necessary stability until the rockets gained enough speed for their fins {{to be effective in}} controlling attitude. <b>Launch</b> <b>towers</b> were built at the White Sands Missile Range, Churchill Rocket Research Range, Wallops Flight Facility, and aboard the research vessel USS Norton Sound. The Aerobee could take a 68 kg payload to an altitude of 130 km.|$|R

25|$|Preparations for {{a mission}} started {{a month in}} advance with the {{selection}} of the primary and back-up astronaut; they would practice together for the mission. For three days prior to launch, the astronaut went through a special diet to minimize his need for defecating during the flight. On the morning of the trip he typically ate a steak breakfast. After having sensors applied to his body and being dressed in the pressure suit, he started breathing pure oxygen to prepare him for the atmosphere of the spacecraft. He arrived at the launch pad, took the elevator up the <b>launch</b> <b>tower</b> and entered the spacecraft two hours before launch. Once the astronaut was secured inside, the hatch was bolted, the launch area evacuated and the mobile tower rolled back. After this, the launch vehicle was filled with liquid oxygen. The entire procedure of preparing for launch and launching the spacecraft followed a time table called the countdown. It started a day in advance with a pre-count, in which all systems of the launch vehicle and spacecraft were checked. After that followed a 15-hour hold, during which pyrotechnics were installed. Then came the main countdown which for orbital flights started 6½ hours before launch (T – 390 min), counted backwards to launch (T = 0) and then forward until orbital insertion (T + 5 min).|$|E
2500|$|Skycoaster: Lagoon's Skycoaster opened {{during the}} 1995 season. Lagoon {{was one of}} the first {{amusement}} parks in the United States to add the Skycoaster to its collection of rides. This was also the first of the five rides that would be included in the X-Venture Zone. The <b>launch</b> <b>tower</b> is [...] tall and the main arch is [...] tall. The flyers, up to 3 at a time, are raised up to a height of [...] When they are instructed to do so, one of the flyers pulls the rip cord and then the flyers drop rapidly, reaching speeds up to [...] and experiencing sensations similar to hang gliding and skydiving.|$|E
2500|$|SlotZilla at Fremont Street Experience is a 12-story, slot machine-inspired zip line attraction. SlotZilla offers [...] "flyers" [...] {{two levels}} of lines, the lower [...] "Zipline" [...] (77 feet up) and upper [...] "Zoomline" [...] (114 feet up). The lower lines travel halfway down the Fremont Street Experience {{pedestrian}} mall. The upper lines go {{the entire length of}} the mall (1,750 feet). Guests on the upper [...] "Zoomline" [...] travel prone, or [...] "superhero-style." [...] SlotZilla cost $17 million to construct and features a <b>launch</b> <b>tower</b> with over-sized dice, a martini glass, a pink flamingo, simulated video reels, a giant arm and two 37-foot-tall showgirls.|$|E
50|$|Parrish Medical Center is a public, not-for-profit, 210-bed {{acute care}} {{hospital}} in Titusville, Florida, {{within sight of}} the <b>launch</b> <b>towers</b> of Kennedy Space Center. It was founded by Jess Parrish in 1958.|$|R
50|$|A supply tower also usually {{includes}} an elevator which allows maintenance and crew access. Immediately before ignition of the rocket's motors, all {{connections between the}} tower and the craft are severed, and the bridges over which these connections pass often quickly swing away to prevent damage to the structure or vehicle. In contrast with <b>launch</b> <b>towers,</b> service structure towers do not guide rockets as they lift off.|$|R

He then constructed a similar but smaller second machine, which he attempted to fly both as a kite and by towing it behind a horse, also without much success.|$|R

With Mulan's help, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po pose as concubines, {{and are able to}} enter the palace. With the help of Shang, they defeat Shan Yu's men; as Shang prevents Shan Yu from assassinating the Emperor, Mulan lures the Hun leader onto the roof where she engages him in single combat. Meanwhile, acting on Mulan's instructions and signal, Mushu fires a huge skyrocket at Shan Yu. The rocket strikes and propels him into a fireworks <b>launching</b> <b>tower,</b> where he dies in the resulting explosion.|$|R
