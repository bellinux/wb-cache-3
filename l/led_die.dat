50|$|The {{physical}} layout of an opto-isolator depends {{primarily on the}} desired isolation voltage. Devices rated {{for less than a}} few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction. The sensor die is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin dual in-line package). The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the <b>LED</b> <b>die.</b> The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared. The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired breakdown voltage. For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75 kV and transients of 1 kV/μs, the clear polyimide sheet in the Avago ASSR-300 series is only 0.08 mm thick. Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet and the configuration of bonding wires that connect the dies with external pins. Real in-circuit isolation voltage is further reduced by creepage over the PCB and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25 mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3 mm/kV for coated conductors.|$|E

To stabilize the photometric characteristics of pc-WLEDs, much effort {{has been made to}} manage the heat dissipation of the <b>LED</b> <b>dies.</b> The thermal problems of the phosphor parts, a critical reliability concern for pc-WLEDs, have recently attracted academic interest. This study proposed a practical approach for measuring phosphor temperature in an operating pc-WLED using a noncontact, instant detection method to remotely monitor the emission spectrum. Conventionally, an infrared camera or thermocouples have been used to measure temperature. An IR camera requires good calibration on the emissivity and is usually blocked by the lens or other components covered on the phosphors. Moreover, a thermocouple requires time to reach the thermal equivalence between the detector and the sample under testing, and this approach is destructive when used for inner detection. Our approach has advantages over the conventional methods because it is noninvasive, noncontact, and instant, and inner detection. The approach is also independent of the peak wavelength of pumping lights, the concentration and thickness of phosphor, and correlated color temperatures...|$|R

40|$|A new microelectronic {{package was}} {{designed}} for a high-power light-emitting diode (LED). The objective was to build a package that enables the LED to operate with currents as high as 2 Amps. An innovative thin-film interface has been developed to electrically connect the cathode of the <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> to a 22 AWG Cu wire. This thin-film interface is wirebondable and solderable, and consists of three layers: Au, Ni 93 /V 7, and Si. Four 1 mil Au wirebonds, supporting 2 A of maximum current, connect the Au thin-film to the <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> cathode. Sn 96 Ag 4 solder is used for connecting the Ni 93 /V 7 thin-film to the 22 AWG Cu wire.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} high {{efficiency}} phosphor converting (white) Light Emitting Diode (pcLED) 1 -Watt package through an increase in package extraction efficiency. A transparent/translucent monolithic phosphor is proposed to replace the powdered phosphor to reduce the scattering caused by phosphor particles. Additionally, a multi-layer thin film selectively reflecting filter is proposed between blue <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> and phosphor layer to recover inward yellow emission. At the end of the project we expect to recycle approximately 50 % of the unrecovered backward light in current package construction, and develop a pcLED device with 80 lm/W{sub e} using our technology improvements and commercially available chip/package source. The success of the project will benefit luminous efficacy of white LEDs by increasing package extraction efficiency. In most phosphor-converting white LEDs, the white color is obtained by combining a blue <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> (or chip) with a powdered phosphor layer. The phosphor partially absorbs the blue light from the <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> and converts it into a broad green-yellow emission. The mixture of the transmitted blue light and green-yellow light emerging gives white light. There are two major drawbacks for current pcLEDs in terms of package extraction efficiency. The first is light scattering caused by phosphor particles. When the blue photons from the chip strike the phosphor particles, some blue light will be scattered by phosphor particles. Converted yellow emission photons are also scattered. A portion of scattered light is in the backward direction toward the die. The amount of this backward light varies and depends in part on the particle size of phosphors. The other drawback is that yellow emission from phosphor powders is isotropic. Although some backward light can be recovered by the reflector in current LED packages, there is still a portion of backward light that will be absorbed inside the package and further converted to heat. Heat generated in the package may cause a deterioration of encapsulant materials, affecting the performance of both the <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> and phosphor, leading to a decrease in the luminous efficacy over lifetime. Recent studies from research groups at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that, under the condition to obtain a white light, about 40 % of the light is transmitted outward of the phosphor layer and 60 % of the light is reflected inward. 1, 2 It is claimed that using scattered photon extraction (SPE) technique, luminous efficacy is increased by 60 %. In this project, a transparent/translucent monolithic phosphor was used to replace the powdered phosphor layer. In the normal pcLED package, the powdered phosphor is mixed with silicone either to be deposited on the top of <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> forming a chip level conversion (CLC) white LED or to be casted in the package forming a volume conversion white LED. In the monolithic phosphors there are no phosphor powder/silicone interfaces so it can reduce the light scattering caused by phosphor particles. Additionally, a multi-layer thin film selectively reflecting filter is inserted in the white LED package between the blue <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> and phosphor layer. It will selectively transmit the blue light from the <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> and reflect the phosphor's yellow inward emission outward. The two technologies try to recover backward light to the outward direction in the pcLED package thereby improving the package extraction efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA novel {{method to}} {{stabilize}} the correlated color temperature in pcW-LEDs from their initial turn-on state to thermal equilibrium is proposed and demonstrated. Under the normal operation condition, it can stabilize the CCT of a pcW-LED by the positive matching of the blue LED peak wavelength to the phosphor excitation spectrum. When the operating temperature unavoidably becomes higher in the <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> quickly after the initial turn-on, the phosphor conversion efficiency degrades and the LED blue light performs red shift. With the positive matching, the red shift actually helps enhance the excitation efficiency of the phosphor to compensate the thermal quenching and efficiency degradation. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} blue light to the yellow light can keep almost constant, as well as the CCTs. In the experiments, the CCT variation could be as small as from 7 K to 83 K in different cases. Finally, we introduce a new factor, the so-called guide number, which is used to count the total change of the enhancement in equivalent excitation efficiency and the relative reduction of the phosphor light emission. The guide number essentially helps in designing the matching blue <b>LED</b> <b>die</b> and phosphor pair for good CCT stabilization...|$|E
40|$|Integration of LEDs on {{flexible}} foil substrates is {{of interest}} for flexible lighting applications and for backlights for flexible displays. Such a large area lighting device {{can be made by}} integrating a matrix of closely spaced LEDs on a flexible foil substrate. Preferably, these LEDs are integrated unpackaged, i. e. as bare dies, as this reduces footprint, thickness and cost. As substrates, low cost materials like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) should preferably be used. However, the use of these materials also imposes limitations. Especially, their low thermal stability limits the maximum temperatures during the processing and the thermal dissipation of the LED during operation will pose constraints on the thermal design. This paper describes the results of research on possibilities for integrating bare <b>die</b> <b>LEDs</b> with such low cost flexible PET foils. Bonding of <b>LED</b> <b>dies</b> on PET substrates with copper circuitry using conductive adhesives was performed. Both anisotropic conducting adhesives and isotropic conducting adhesives were investigated. An experimental comparison is made between the different techniques based on temperature/humidity reliability and flexural stability of the bonded LEDs. Additionally, finite element (FE) thermal modeling results of adhesively bonded LED-on-foil configurations are presented. The role of the different materials and the effect of their geometries on the temperature distribution in the simulated devices are discussed. The results are compared to experimentally observed temperature distributions using infrared thermal imaging in LED on PET foil reference devices.
