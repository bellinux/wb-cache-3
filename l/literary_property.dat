25|$|Australian {{copyright}} law {{has historically been}} influenced by British {{copyright law}} and International copyright agreements. In turn Australian copyright law has influenced copyright law in Britain and the Commonwealth. Australian copyright law originates in British copyright law which was established by the British parliament through the Australian Courts Act 1828. The British Statute of Anne 1709, which awarded copyright protection to books, acted as a blueprint for the extension of copyright to new types of subject matter in the 18th and 19th Century. When copyright law was introduced into Australia in 1928 British copyright law had been extended beyond <b>literary</b> <b>property</b> to include engravings and sculptures. Over {{the course of the}} 19th century it was extended to other works, including paintings, drawings and photographs.|$|E

[...] Stimulated by anger at offensive publicity concerning the social activities of Warren's family, it suggested a new legal concept that has had lasting influence. Building on diverse analogies in the law of defamation, of <b>literary</b> <b>property,</b> and of eavesdropping, Brandeis argued that the central, if unarticulated, interest protected in these fields was an interest in personal integrity, [...] "the right to be let alone," [...] {{that ought to be}} secured against invasion except for some compelling reason of public welfare. Brandeis saw emotions as a positive expression of human nature, and so desired privacy protection for them as protection against repression of the human spirit.|$|E

2500|$|After the Coup of May 28, 1926, Gomes da Costa {{signed a}} decree on July 5 that would secure {{freedom of thought}} [...] "independent from bonds and censorship", even though it insisted on prohibiting {{offences}} to the republic's institutions or any behaviour that would disturb public order. The Press Law of the new military executive repeated almost word-for-word the assurances of article 13 from the previous Press Law, allowing criticism and discussion of legislative bills, political and religious doctrines, acts of government, and so forth, {{as long as the}} goal was to [...] "enlighten and prepare the (public) opinion for the necessary reforms(...)". On July 29, however, prior censorship was re-instated. The Estado Novo never took a definite stance on the censorship, avoiding even discussion of the subject the few times the issue was raised in the Parliament. If only the signed legislation is taken into account, one might suppose the regime was quite lenient. On May 27, 1927 the <b>Literary</b> <b>Property</b> Law was reformed, which in its letter guaranteed censorship-free publication.

60|$|Freedom of Contract {{is an idea}} no {{one outside}} a debating society dreams of realizing in the state.

We protect women who are physically and economically weak in this manner, not so much for their own good as the good of the race. The state already puts <b>literary</b> <b>property</b> into a class apart by limiting its duration. At a certain point, which varies in different circumstances, copyright expires. It is possible for an author, whose fame comes late, to be present as a row of dainty volumes in half the comfortable homes in the world, while his grandchildren beg their bread.

6000|$|In 1761 the booksellers were {{afflicted by}} a new alarm. Foreign pirates and {{domestic}} hawkers were doing them mischief enough. But in that year the government struck a blow at the very principle of <b>literary</b> <b>property.</b> The King's Council conferred upon the descendants of La Fontaine the exclusive privilege of publishing their ancestor's works. That is to say, the Council took away without compensation from La Fontaine's publishers a copyright for which they had paid in hard cash. The whole corporation naturally rose in arms, and in due time the lieutenant of police was obliged to take the whole matter into serious consideration--whether {{the maintenance of the}} guild of publishers was expedient; whether the royal privilege of publishing a book should be regarded as conferring a definite and unassailable right of property in the publication; whether the tacit permission to publish what it would have been thought unbecoming to authorise expressly by royal sanction, should not be granted liberally or even universally; and whether the old restriction of the booksellers to one quarter of the town ought to remain in force any longer. M. de Sartine invited Diderot to write him a memorandum on the subject, and was disappointed to find Diderot staunchly {{on the side of the}} booksellers (1767). He makes no secret, indeed, that for his own part he would like to see the whole apparatus of restraint abolished, but meanwhile he is strong for doing all that a system of regulation, as opposed to a system of freedom, can do to make the publication of books a source of prosperity to the bookseller, and of cheap acquisition to the book-buyer. Above all things, Diderot is vehemently in favour of the recognition of <b>literary</b> <b>property,</b> and against such infringement of it as had been ventured upon in the case of La Fontaine. He had no reason to be especially friendly to booksellers, but for one thing, he saw that to nullify or to tamper with copyright was in effect to prevent an author from having any commodity to sell, and so to do him the most serious injury possible. And for another thing, Diderot had equity and common sense enough to see that no high-flown nonsense about the dignity of letters and the spiritual power could touch the fact that a book is a piece of marketable ware, and that the men who deal in such wares have as much claim to be protected in their contracts as those who deal in any other wares.[242] ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{this to be}} said in defence of men {{of letters}} on the {{business}} side, that literature is still an infant industry with us, and, so far from having been protected by our laws, it was exposed for ninety years after {{the foundation of the}} republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods. It is true that we now have the international copyright law at last, and we can at least begin to forget our shame; but <b>literary</b> <b>property</b> has only forty-two years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can. This may be right enough in itself; but I think, then, that all property should be defended by civil suit, and should become public after forty-two years of private tenure. The Constitution guarantees us all equality before the law, but the law-makers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our literary industry. So long as this remains the case, we cannot expect the best business talent to go into literature, and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men.|$|E
6000|$|In 1832, Thackeray came of age, and {{inherited}} his fortune,--as {{to which}} various {{stories have been}} told. It seems to have amounted to about five hundred a year, and to have passed through {{his hands in a}} year or two, interest and principal. It has been told of him that it was all taken away from him at cards, but such was not the truth. Some went in an Indian bank in which he invested it. A portion was lost at cards. But with some of it,--the larger part as I think,--he endeavoured, in concert with his stepfather, to float a newspaper, which failed. There seem to have been two newspapers in which he was so concerned, The National Standard and The Constitutional. On the latter he was engaged with his stepfather, and in carrying that on he lost the last of his money. The National Standard had been running for some weeks when Thackeray joined it, and lost his money in it. It ran only for little more than twelve months, and then, the money having gone, the periodical came to an end. I know no road to fortune more tempting to a young man, or one that with more certainty leads to ruin. Thackeray, who in a way more or less correct, often refers in his writings, if not to the incidents, at any rate to the remembrances of his own life, tells us much of the story of this newspaper in Lovel the Widower. [...] "They are welcome," [...] says the bachelor, [...] "to make merry at my charges in respect of a certain bargain which I made on coming to London, and in which, had I been Moses Primrose purchasing green spectacles, I could scarcely have been more taken in. My Jenkinson was an old college acquaintance, whom I was idiot enough to imagine a respectable man. The fellow had a very smooth tongue and sleek sanctified exterior. He was rather a popular preacher, and used to cry a good deal in the pulpit. He and a queer wine merchant and bill discounter, Sherrick by name, had somehow got possession of that neat little literary paper, The Museum, which perhaps you remember, and this eligible <b>literary</b> <b>property</b> my friend Honeyman, with his wheedling tongue, induced me to purchase." [...] Here is the history of Thackeray's money, told by himself plainly enough, but with no intention on his part of narrating an incident in his own life to the public. But the drollery of the circumstances, his own mingled folly and young ambition, struck him as being worth narration, and the more forcibly as he remembered all {{the ins and outs of}} his own reflections at the time,--how he had meant to enchant the world, and make his fortune. There was literary capital in it of which he could make use after so many years. Then he tells us of this ambition, and of the folly of it; and at the same time puts forward the excuses to be made for it. [...] "I daresay I gave myself airs as editor of that confounded Museum, and proposed to educate the public taste, to diffuse morality and sound literature throughout the nation, and to pocket a liberal salary in return for my services. I daresay I printed my own sonnets, my own tragedy, my own verses.... I daresay I wrote satirical articles.... I daresay I made a gaby of myself to the world. Pray, my good friend, hast thou never done likewise? If thou hast never been a fool, be sure thou wilt never be a wise man." [...] Thackeray was quite aware of his early weaknesses, and in the maturity of life knew well that he had not been precociously wise. He delighted so to tell his friends, and he delighted also to tell the public, not meaning that any but an inner circle should know that he was speaking of himself. But the story now is plain to all who can read.[1] ...|$|E

The first steps in this new direction included a series of management changes which placed experienced executives {{from the world of}} television {{at the helm of the}} company. On 4 December 2002, Chief Executive Nick Tamblyn announced his immediate resignation. Waheed Alli was initially appointed as Non-Executive Deputy Chairman. Just a few months later, in April 2003, he stepped up to the position of Chairman. Alli remains Chairman to this day, although he now also holds the position of CEO.|$|R
40|$|Locating {{the object}} of {{literary}} criticism involves determining an authentic base serving as a text, a proper construal of which yields the <b>literary</b> <b>properties</b> of the work. It is argued that both {{the determination of the}} authentic text and its construal depend on the determination of an identity model for the work, in terms of some conception of literature. The actual construal of the text is accomplished through the adoption of a semantic attitude related to a construal model. Since literature is a) part of the institution of art; and has b) language as its medium, the natural language construal model, qualified in certain ways by a), which itself dictates choice of the replicatable, unchanging particular identity model, is to be adopted in preference to the codal and technical language construal models. Partial determination of the work-yielding properties of the authentic text and an analysis of these properties given by a proper construal is achieved by isolating the graphic, phonic, semantic and relational structures as covering the range of <b>literary</b> <b>properties.</b> The discussion therefore centres on each structure in turn. The complicated semantic structure is dealt with through introduction of the notion of surface and embedded descriptions, the latter largely yielding the world of the work; and by an examination of characteristic manifestations of meaning in literature: symbol, metaphor and deviance. The complexity of construal is brought out both in the discussion of the semantic structure and quite generally in relation to all the structures of the work. The notion of the work, its structures, properties and nature are clarified through the technique of basic philosophical analysis employed in this work. <p...|$|R
