Luego, se procede a analizar la posibilidad de contemporaneidad entre los quiebres encontrados y las crisis que tales países sufrieron en los últimos 40 años.

40|$|Many useful genes {{have been}} {{identified}} in wild forms and distant relatives of important staples but they are often not used in conventional plant breeding. At the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Colombia, scientists have been looking at new ways of transferring important traits that occur in wild forms of Phaseolus vulgaris in to domestic varieties of the bean. The two major pests of stored dried beans in Africa and <b>Latin</b> <b>America</b> are the Mexican bean weevil (Zabrotes subfasciatus) and the bean weevil (Acanthoscelides obtectus). By screening thousands of accessions of wild P. vulgaris, CIAT entomologists identified some that were resistant to Mexican bean weevil, others resistant to bean weevil, and two that were resistant to both insects. Among Mexican bean weevils that died in resistant seed, studies conducted in cooperation with the University of Wisconsin pointed to a single cause of death: the protein arcelin, which the insect apparently cannot digest well. (Tie protein's name is based on the town of Arcelia in Mexico where wild bean accessions containing this gene were collected.) Since the biosynthesis of arcelin in resistant genotypes is a simply inherited trait, researchers were able to breed resistance to Z. subfasciatus into experimental lines of domesticated beans. These lines are now being tested in Africa and <b>Latin</b> <b>America.</b> Biotechnology Research <b>Unit</b> CIAT AA 6713 - Cali, COLOMBIAMany useful genes {{have been identified}} in wild forms and distant relatives of important staples but they are often not used in conventional plant breeding.
