Playing the final match with torn ligaments in his right ring finger, Kahn conceded the first goal by fumbling a rebounded shot from Rivaldo to the feet of striker Ronaldo in the 67th minute. Once the game was over with Brazil as the new champion, he stood alone and disappointed in his goal; nevertheless he refused to blame his injury for his mistake.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{surveillance}} equipment and whether covert recording {{amounts to a}} search {{has been a significant}} issue for New Zealand courts. In Tararo v R (2010) the Supreme Court held that an undercover police officer video recording a drug transaction was not a search due to the <b>low</b> <b>expectation</b> of privacy. Covert surveillance of public areas will generally not be search due to the <b>low</b> <b>expectation</b> of privacy. In contrast, surveillance of private property will likely be a search due to the high privacy interests. The Search and Surveillance Act 2012 now provides clear statutory guidance for when covert police surveillance can lawfully occur.|$|R

Since 1997, the team has played their home games at the Liacouras Center, which has a capacity of 10,206. In their previous season, an Atlantic 10 Preseason Poll predicted that Temple Owls would finish fifth in the conference, tied with Duquesne. Despite the <b>low</b> <b>expectations,</b> the Owls were tied with Xavier atop the Atlantic 10 standings with a 14–2 conference record, and won their third straight Atlantic 10 tournament title. The team drew a five seed in the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where they lost to 12 seed Cornell in the first round, 78–65, and finished with a record of 29–6.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} reference-dependent assessment of subjective beliefs in which loss-averse people optimally choose the expectation as the reference point to balance the current felicity from the optimistic anticipation and the future disappointment from the realisation. The choice of over-optimism or over-pessimism depends on the real chance of success and optimistic decision makers prefer receiving early information. In the portfolio choice problem, pessimistic investors tend to trade conservatively, however, they might trade aggressively if they are sophisticated enough to recognise the biases since <b>low</b> <b>expectation</b> can reduce their fear of loss...|$|R

The 2014–15 season began with raised expectations from Longhorns fans and media, especially with the signing of top-ranked Dallas-area center Myles Turner. The Horns were ranked as high as No. 6 in the AP and coaches polls, yet only managed to finish sixth in the Big 12 in a very competitive season of conference play. The 20–14 Longhorns' loss to Butler in the opening round of the NCAA Tournament marked the final game coached by Barnes at the University.

In his three seasons as a starter, he had completed less than 54% of his passes with a career passer rating of 73.4. While generally regarded as a solid quarterback, Manning had been unable to achieve the same level of success as fellow 2004 draftees Philip Rivers (for whom he was traded) and Ben Roethlisberger, the latter of whom had already won a Super Bowl (Super Bowl XL). By the 2007 season, many sports writers were starting to question if Eli would ever live up to the expectations that accompanied being selected with the first overall pick in a draft.|$|E
