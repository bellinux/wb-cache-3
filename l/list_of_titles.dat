25|$|In June 1946 the Allied Kommandatura {{confirmed}} Zhukov's {{order of}} September 1945. Otto Winzer, {{then head of}} the public education department in the Soviet-appointed new magistrate for all four Allied sectors of Berlin, ordered on 6June 1946 all libraries to be closed in order to separate out all books of Nazi weltanschauung, of revanchist and monarchy-glorifying opinion. Winzer's department set up a specified black <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> to be separated out. However, in the Library No.I, like all over the western sectors this black list circulated by the magistrate was not followed since it was considered as subsuming too many titles of other leaning as National Socialistic or militarist.|$|E

25|$|Towards 500 a Scythian monk, {{known as}} Dionysius Exiguus, {{who had come}} to Rome after the death of Pope Gelasius (496), and who was well skilled in both Latin and Greek, {{undertook}} to bring out a more exact translation of the canons of the Greek councils. In a second effort he collected papal decretals from Siricius (384-89) to Anastasius II (496-98), inclusive, anterior therefore, to Pope Symmachus (514-23). By order of Pope Hormisdas (514-23), Dionysius made a third collection, in which he included the original text of all the canons of the Greek councils, together with a Latin version of the same; but the preface alone has survived. Finally, he combined the first and second in one collection, which thus united the canons of the councils and the papal decretals; it is in this shape that the work of Dionysius has reached us. This collection opens with a table or <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles,</b> each of which is afterwards repeated before the respective canons; then come the first fifty canons of the Apostles, the canons of the Greek councils, the canons of Carthage (419), and the canons of preceding African synods under Aurelius, which had been read and inserted in the Council of Carthage. This first part of the collection is closed by a letter of Pope Boniface I, read at the same council, letters of Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople to the African Fathers, and a letter of Pope Celestine I. The second part of the collection opens likewise with a preface, {{in the shape of a}} letter to the priest Julian, and a table of titles; then follow one decretal of Siricius, twenty-one of Innocent I, one of Zozimus, four of Boniface I, three of Celestine I, seven of pope Leo I, one of Gelasius I and one of Anastasius II. The additions met with in Voel and Justel are taken from inferior manuscripts.|$|E

500|$|As Campbell {{began to}} hit his stride {{as editor of}} Astounding, the first boom in science fiction {{magazine}} publishing took off, starting with Marvel Science Stories appearance in 1938. [...] This was an attempt by publishers Abraham and Martin Goodman to expand their <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>titles</b> into science fiction and fantasy. [...] They were known for [...] "weird menace" [...] magazines, a genre incorporating [...] "sex and sadism" [...] into story lines that placed women in danger, usually because of a threat {{that appeared to be}} supernatural but was ultimately revealed to be the work of a human villain. [...] For Marvel Science Stories, the Goodmans asked their authors to include more sex in their stories than was usual in the sf field; reader reaction was strongly negative to the spicier stories, but the Goodmans kept the magazine going until early 1941, and eventually revived it in 1950 for a few more issues when another sf magazine boom began. [...] A companion magazine, Dynamic Science Stories, appeared in February 1939; it was intended to carry longer stories but only lasted two issues.|$|E
