500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> rain check. I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s that interesting awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|E

40|$|The mosaic is {{relatively}} old form of art. The computer as an artistic device {{is relatively}} new. The recent {{combination of these}} two disciplines has furthered {{the evolution of the}} mosaic as an art form. The main goal of this thesis is to continue this evolution by extending the image mosaic into the third dimension, that of time, by melding the image mosaic with the discipline of the filmmaking. Specifically, this thesis provides a detailed background of the mosaic art form, then extends the image mosaic by adding the dimension of time. This results in a new mosaic form, the Temporal Image Mosaic(TIM). Respecting the artistic nature of this thesis, the use of the Temporal Image Mosaic in an artistic setting is demonstrated {{in the form of a}} short motion picture. i Acknowledgments I would like to take this opportunity to thank my advisors. Thank you, James, for your grateful help over the coarse of this thesis, and especially for <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> break when I needed it.

6000|$|But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> {{illustration}} of what I mean {{by these two}} kinds of finality that Art may have, and show that in essence they are but two halves of the same thing. The term [...] "a work of Art" [...] will not be denied, I think, to that early novel of M. Anatole France, [...] "Le Lys Rouge." [...] Now, that novel has positive finality, since the spiritual conclusion from its premises strikes one as true. But neither will the term [...] "a work of Art" [...] be denied to the same writer's four [...] "Bergeret" [...] volumes, whose negative finality consists only in the temperamental atmosphere wherein they are soaked. Now, if the theme of [...] "Le Lys Rouge" [...] had been treated by Tolstoy, Meredith, or Turgenev, we should have had spiritual conclusions from the same factual premises so different from M. France's as prunes from prisms, and yet, being the work of equally great artists, they would, doubtless, have struck us as equally true. Is not, then, the positive finality of [...] "Le Lys Rouge," [...] though {{expressed in terms of}} a different craftsmanship, the same, in essence, as the negative finality of the [...] "Bergeret" [...] volumes? Are not both, in fact, merely flower of author true to himself? So long as the scent, colour, form of that flower is strong and fine enough to affect the senses of our spirit, then all the rest, surely, is academic--I would say, immaterial.|$|R

[...] "If you will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> dozen of your monkeys to the Emerald City, {{and keep them}} until after Ozma's birthday, I'll break the enchantment of the six Giant Soldiers and return them to their natural forms." ...|$|E

If he could not give it me, I would not scruple to borrow so much elsewhere." [...] And Frank bethought him of all Miss Dunstable's offers.|$|E

6000|$|America is {{an eager}} nation. She {{has always been}} in a hurry. If I had {{to point out the}} capital defect in the {{attractive}} temperament of the American people, I should say it was a passion for short cuts. That has been, in my indifferent judgment, the very natural, the inevitable weakness in America's spiritual development. The material possibilities, the opportunities for growth and change, the vast spaces, the climate, the continual influxions of new blood and new habits, the endless shifts of life and environment, all these factors have been against that deep brooding over things, that close and long scrutiny into the deeper springs of life, out of which the sincerest and most lasting forms of art emerge; nearly all the conditions of American existence during the last fifty years have been against the settled life and atmosphere which influence men to the re-creation in art form of that which has sunk deep into their souls. Those who have seen the paintings of the Italian artist Segantini will understand what I mean. There have been many painters of mountains, but none whom I know of save he who has reproduced the very spirit of those great snowy spaces. He spent his life among them till they soaked into his nerves, into the very blood of him. All else he gave up, to see and feel them so that he might reproduce them in his art. Or <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> instance from America. That enchanting work of art [...] "Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn," [...] by the great Mark Twain. What reproduction of atmosphere and life; what scent of the river, and old-time country life, it gives off! How the author must have been soaked in it to have produced those books! ...|$|R
