5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus {{would have had a}} good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In this study, the {{disparity}} between <b>the</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral and medial digit in cows with a Rusterholz sole ulcer compared to non-affected cows was investigated. Material and methods: In total, 100 hind feet were collected from slaughtered cows. Twenty-five feet had a pre-ulcerative lesion at the typical site, 26 had an ulcer 1. 5 cm². Twenty-five normal feet were used as controls. <b>The</b> <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metatarsal condyles and phalanges (Ph) were measured on plantarodorsal radiographs and three different overall <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digits were generated. The software program SPSS was used for analysis. Results: <b>The</b> mean <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> Ph 1 and Ph 2 and the three mean overall <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral digit were greater than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medial digit while <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Ph 3 was longer on the medial digit.

Conclusion and clinical relevance: These results corroborate <b>the</b> <b>length</b> asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bovine digits but further studies are needed to evaluate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> asymmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digits on <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> sole ulcers...|$|R
