40|$|Community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> involve {{community}} driven {{collection and}} analysis of information that enable warning messages to help a community to react to a hazard and reduce the resulting loss or harm. Most early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are designed at the national or global level. Local communities’ capacity to predict weather conditions using indigenous knowledge has been demonstrated in studies focusing on climate change and agriculture in some African countries. This review was motivated by successes made in non-disease specific community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{with a view to}} identify opportunities for developing similar systems for malaria. This article reviewed the existing community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> documented in literature. The types of disasters that are addressed by these systems and the methodologies utilised {{in the development of the}} systems were identified. The review showed that most of the documented community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> focus on natural disasters such as floods, drought, and landslides. Community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for human diseases are very few, even though such systems exist at national and regional and global levels. There is a clear gap in terms of community-based malaria early <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> The methodologies for the development of the community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> reviewed mainly derive from the four elements of early warning systems; namely risk knowledge, monitoring, warning communication and response capability.

40|$|Abstract—The {{main goal}} of a {{disaster}} <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> is preventing loss of properties by providing suitable information to people who can be affected by disaster events.

To deal with the challenges, {{in this paper we}} propose a new design of a reliable and personalized disaster <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> to support city-wide mobile users. The proposed disaster <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> has three main components, namely, personality-aware location prediction, geo-social connectivity aware message generation, and failure-resilient geo-aware dissemination.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-exhausting overview of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for emerging foodborne hazards that are {{operating in the}} various places in the world. Special attention is given to endpoint-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. ECDC, ISIS and GPHIN) and hazard-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. FVO, RASFF and OIE) and their merit to successfully identify a food safety problem in an early stage is discussed. Besides these early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{which are based on}} monitoring of either disease symptoms or hazards, also early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and/or activities that intend to predict the occurrence of a food safety hazard in its very beginning of development or before that are described. Examples are trend analysis, horizon scanning, early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for mycotoxins in maize and/or wheat and information exchange networks (e. g. OIE and GIEWS). Furthermore, recent initiatives that aim to develop predictive early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> based on the holistic principle are discussed. The assumption of the researchers applying this principle is that developments outside the food production chain that are either directly or indirectly related {{to the development of a}} particular food safety hazard may also provide valuable information to predict the development of this hazard...|$|R
40|$|Effective drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are an {{integral}} part of efforts worldwide to improve drought preparedness. Timely and reliable data and information must be the cornerstone of effective drought policies and plans. In pursuit of the goal of improving the effectiveness of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> participants of the experts meeting were asked to address three fundamental questions: 1. What is your assessment of the current status of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> 2. What are the shortcomings, limitations, and needs for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> 3. How can drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> be improved to better support drought preparedness and mitigation efforts at the local, national, and international level? Participants identified the primary users of data and information derived from drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> as a first step in evaluating the status of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> Users were diverse, including government agencies, farmers, extension services, insurance companies, media, donors, NGOs, and the general public. Leadership for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> is provided principally by meteorological or agricultural services. In general, where meteorological services were the lead agency, the information tended to be more meteorologically based. In contrast, leadership for drought early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> that were more agriculturally based tended to take a more multidisciplinary or integrated approach to monitoring. An integrated approach is considered preferable because information from all elements of the hydrologic system must be considered to obtain a comprehensive assessment of climate and water supply conditions. Although forecasting and monitoring are considered critical components of all early <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> there appeared to be little evidence of the beneficial use of that information by farmers. It was noted that few countries currently have a national drought policy in place. Australia is an exception and progress in South Africa and the United States was noted. It was apparent that other countries were moving in the direction of a national drought policy. In some instances, subnational policies were in existence. Comprehensive early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> should be the foundation on which national drought policies and plans are constructed. Although many countries have some type of drought early <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> in place, these systems are not comprehensive and have very limited financial and human resource inputs...|$|R
