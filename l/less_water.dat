5|$|The United States Geological Survey {{monitors}} {{the flow of}} Big Butte Creek at three different stream gauges: two on the South Fork, {{and one on the}} main stem. Both South Fork gauges were shut down in 1991, but the gauge located near the mouth of Big Butte Creek continues to operate. The main stem often discharges <b>less</b> <b>water</b> than the South Fork alone in the summer months because of numerous diversions.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain <b>less</b> <b>water</b> ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E
5|$|Emerald, Pandour, and Drake {{then pushed}} up the river, {{sometimes}} in <b>less</b> <b>water</b> than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived {{close to the}} forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching {{under the cover of}} the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The Assyrians {{were the}} first to use camels as beasts of burden for their {{military}} campaigns. Camels were of greater use than donkeys because they can carry five times the load and yet require <b>less</b> <b>watering.</b> Camels were not domesticated until shortly before 1000 BC, {{on the eve of the}} Neo-Assyrian Empire.|$|R
50|$|These {{consisted}} of two RC-A series controllers in one unit which operated in sequence, with the capability of switching off the lower controller on a given day. Zones requiring <b>less</b> <b>watering</b> would thus be assigned to the lower unit. The 12th station on the upper unit was replaced with a tripper mechanism to start the lower unit.|$|R
50|$|The cactus is {{considered}} easy and relatively fast growing in warmer climates around the world. The plants {{do have some}} basic requirements; an average minimum winter temperature of 12 °C (53.6 °F); and good drainage with <b>less</b> <b>watering</b> in winter. Excess water in cool periods may lead to rot. Golden Barrels are hardy to about 15 °F (−8 °C) for brief periods.|$|R
5|$|Oberon {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula: a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the relatively high density of Oberon and other Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn indicates that it may have been relatively water-poor.

5|$|The {{end of the}} Pleistocene ice {{ages and}} the start of the Holocene began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer {{semi-arid}} conditions similar to that of today. With <b>less</b> <b>water</b> to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also {{plays a major role in}} excavating the larger canyons.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{inclined}} planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism. He {{was at the time}} the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined plane at Wellisford, again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much <b>less</b> <b>water</b> than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions {{has led to the}} promotion of gardens requiring <b>less</b> <b>watering</b> (xeriscaping). For example, in California, the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates. Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|R

5|$|A {{controversy}} has erupted {{since the late}} 20thcentury over the four lower Snake River dams, with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries—the Clearwater River, the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River—and spawn in much higher numbers. However, removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest. Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams, removing the four dams would create {{a hole in the}} energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable. Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer, as submerged riffles, rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams. Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River. However, aside from restoring salmon runs, dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable, that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads, and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water. Irrigators in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow <b>less</b> <b>water</b> into the Snake River during low flow {{in order to create a}} current in the four lower reservoirs, and recreation and tourism would likely benefit.|$|E
5|$|Alma caused {{significant}} {{crop damage}} in western Cuba; it destroyed 13,400acres (5,400hectares) of bananas and 18,090acres (7,320hectares) of corn fields. There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use <b>less</b> <b>water.</b> There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage. Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro, after the food and supply shortages.|$|E

5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during the night. They are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. They drink <b>less</b> <b>water,</b> as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E

25|$|Since 1994, {{there is}} a {{significant}} move towards using <b>less</b> <b>water</b> for flushing flush toilets. This has resulted in the emergence of low flush toilet designs and local or national standards on water consumption for flushing. In addition, some people modify their existing high flush toilet to use <b>less</b> <b>water</b> by placing a brick or water bottle into the toilet's water tank. Other modifications are often done on the water system itself (such as by using greywater), or a system that pollutes the water less; hence more efficient use of the water is accomplished.|$|E

25|$|The {{ratio of}} sugars, acids and {{phenolics}} to {{water is a}} key determination of how well a wine can age. The <b>less</b> <b>water</b> in the grapes prior to harvest, the more likely the resulting wine will have some aging potential. Grape variety, climate, vintage and viticultural practice come into play here. Grape varieties with thicker skins, from a dry growing season where little irrigation was used and yields were kept low will have <b>less</b> <b>water</b> and a higher ratio of sugar, acids and phenolics. The process of making Eisweins, where water {{is removed from the}} grape during pressing as frozen ice crystals, has a similar effect of decreasing the amount of water and increasing aging potential.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} water used by {{conventional}} flush toilets usually makes up {{a significant portion of}} personal daily water usage. However, modern low flush toilet designs allow the use of much <b>less</b> <b>water</b> per flush. Dual flush toilets allow the user to select between a flush for urine or feces, saving a significant {{amount of water}} over conventional units. The flush handle on these toilets is pushed up for one kind of flush and down for the other. In some places, users are encouraged not to flush after urination. Flush toilets can be plumbed to use greywater (previously used for washing dishes, laundry and bathing) rather than potable water (drinking water). Some modern toilets pressurize the water in the tank, which initiates flushing action with <b>less</b> <b>water</b> usage.|$|E
