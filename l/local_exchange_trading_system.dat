50|$|A <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>System</b> (LETS) is {{comprised}} of local members that want to trade goods and services with other members in the group. These LETS use a unique local currency on which all trade is based upon. Those who are in LETS believe that they benefit both the members and the local community due to the organized nature of these LETS. The five core traits of a LETS include “cost of service, consent, disclosure, equivalence to the regional currency, and interest-free.” Member transactions through a LETS {{do not have to}} be solely monetary. A purchase can be repaid through a service performed for the other member involved in the transaction.|$|E

Much of what he proposed and tried to implement in the 1930s and 40's has been reinvented in more recent times {{in the form of}} the mutual credit, LETS (<b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system),</b> and clearing circles that have been proliferating around the world. But there is yet something incomplete about these. Today's initiatives could benefit from the deeper understanding and structural proposals that Riegel shares with us in his works.|$|E

Fugger later built the first iteration of this system, RipplePay.com. Concurrently, in May 2011, Jed McCaleb began developing a digital currency system in which transactions were verified by consensus among members of the network, rather than by the mining process used by Bitcoin. In August 2012, Jed McCaleb hired Chris Larsen and they approached Ryan Fugger with their digital currency idea. After discussions with McCaleb and long-standing members of the Ripple community, Fugger handed over the reins. In September 2012, Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb co-founded the corporation OpenCoin.|$|E

50|$|A <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> (also local {{employment}} and trading system or local energy transfer system; abbreviated to LETS or LETSystem) is a locally initiated, democratically organised, not-for-profit community enterprise {{that provides a}} community information service and record transactions of members exchanging goods and services by using the currency of locally created LETS Credits. LETS networks use interest-free local credit so direct swaps {{do not need to}} be made. For instance, a member may earn credit by doing childcare for one person and spend it later on carpentry with another person in the same network. In LETS, unlike other local currencies, no scrip is issued, but rather transactions are recorded in a central location open to all members. As credit is issued by the network members, for the benefit of the members themselves, LETS are considered mutual credit systems.|$|E

5000|$|The {{co-operative}} society Jord Arbejde Kapital {{was founded}} in Denmark during the Great Depression in 1931. The society issued a popular local currency which was subsequently outlawed by the Danish government in 1933. In 1934 it founded an interest-free savings and loan system and a <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>System.</b> Though both systems were forced to close, {{the savings and loan}} system re-emerged in 1944. The experience of JAK-banking in Denmark inspired a group in Sweden to develop a non-profit organisation named Jord Arbete Kapital - Riksförening för Ekonomisk Frigörelse (National Association for Economic Emancipation) in 1965. This pioneers' group developed a mathematical system based on Saving Points, designated the [...] "balanced saving system". The association grew slowly at first. In 1997, a legislative amendment required the association to receive a banking license from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority in order to continue operating as a financial institution, which was granted in that year. The bank's deposits are insured by the government.|$|E

50|$|The system {{known as}} the Cape Town Talent Exchange began in February 2003 in Cape Town by Ashoka fellow Tim Jenkin. The {{abstract}} unit of currency (unit of account/value) was called the Talent although there were no physical bills or coins made. The purpose was to bring the advantages of a trading network to destitute persons who were unable to get credit or loans by using traditional national currencies, as well as assist marginalized communities such as Khayelitsha within the city of Cape Town to become self-sustaining. The initial design was as a local moneyless not-for-profit exchange which was similar in most respects to what is termed a <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>system</b> (LETS) which record members trading goods and services using a locally created currency called LETS Credits. But the exchange evolved into a more complex system which took advantage of Internet technology to reduce the costs of administering the system and allowed its promoters to extend it to other places, including areas outside of the borders of South Africa. The software permitted the exchange in one city to link up with similar exchanges in other cities to form a global network.|$|E

From comparative research based on interviews with coordinators of six systems the motivation for involvement, the nature of the local money, and the relationship to business and state regulation are explored. The internal coherence of the systems and the relevance of the 'local' is assessed. Contextualized by debates on the nature of economics, where the notion of embeddedness of economic life in social relations is gaining ground, the concept of an active 're-embedding' is introduced in order to explore the significance of local exchange trading systems. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} of Islamic microfinance is significant in contributing towards the alleviation {{of poverty and}} also promoting development of a nation. This is because Islamic microfinance {{has the ability to}} nurture its clients from being a recipient of zakat (obligatory contribution) to eventually becoming a zakat payer in the future. From the capital assistance provided to clients, Islamic microfinance institutions monitor its clients’ growth from start-up all the way to success. The emergence of technology had made life much simpler in the past few years. Also, with the interaction between members of the community, benefits of establishing this community via Islamic microfinance institutions would be expanded, rather than acting as capital provider alone. This can be made possible with the introduction of community currency, which is a medium to exchange goods and services within a community, where this community is defined to be a group with a common bond, such as members of a locality or an association, and it is not restricted geographically. The current study looks into the usage of community currency worldwide. The benefits of community currency usage are hence investigated. Finally with the findings gathered and discussions made throughout the research journey, the current study proposes a community currency framework which could serve as an alternative economy in a Malaysian context. The study examines secondary data, such as reports, documentaries and booklets to understand how community currency is being a success {{in other parts of the}} world. The study had also identified one type of community currency that can suit the environment of Islamic microfinance institutions, which is the <b>Local</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>System</b> (LETS) mechanism...|$|E

50|$|Much of {{the film}} {{presents}} the filmmaker's understanding of modern money creation in a fractional-reserve banking system. New money enters the economy through the indebtedness of borrowers, thus not only obligating the public to the money-issuing private banks but also creating an endless and self-escalating debt that is to eventually outgrow all other forms of wealth generation. The film claims that this ever-increasing gravitation of money to banks is capable of impoverishing any nation. The film finishes by identifying some alternatives to modern banking, such as the nationalization of banks and payment of dividends to the public, establishing <b>local</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>trading</b> <b>systems,</b> or government printing of money.|$|R
