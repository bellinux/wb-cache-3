5|$|It was {{not until}} after 1832 and the {{introduction}} of the Scottish Reform Act 1832 that control of Scottish politics was taken from the hands of landowners and a small number of merchants. The Friends of the People Society in the 1790s was opposed by those <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> politicians. After the Act came into effect, the constituencies were changed, and this raised the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,000.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{government}} confiscated {{portions of}} land {{owned by the}} <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> {{in order to raise}} revenue for these projects, an act which caused dissension and loss of loyalty amongst leading members of Song society but did not stop the Song's defensive preparations. Financial matters were made worse by the fact that many wealthy, land-owning families—some of which had officials working for the government—used their social connections with those in office in order to obtain tax-exempt status.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of Gray's Inn continued to decline after the English Restoration, and by 1719 only 22 students were joining the Inn a year.

In 1615, 13 students joined the Inn for every student called to the Bar, but by 1713 the ratio had become 2.3 new members to every 1 call.|$|E

50|$|Many of Europe's major elites {{also found}} {{advantages}} in formal, overseas expansion: large financial and industrial monopolies wanted imperial support {{to protect their}} overseas investments against competition and domestic political tensions abroad, bureaucrats sought government offices, military officers desired promotion, and the traditional but waning <b>landed</b> <b>gentries</b> sought increased profits for their investments, formal titles, and high office.

At the time, such open moors were closed to all; they were strongly identified with the game-keeping interests of <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> who used them only 12 days a year. The Peak District National Park became the United Kingdom's first national park on 17 April 1951. The first long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom was the Pennine Way, which opened in 1965 and starts at the Nags Head Inn, in Grindsbook Booth, part of Edale village.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, {{he and his father}} moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the Rodes family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in Burke's <b>Landed</b> <b>Gentry.</b> He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself through his own labors.|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} 1815 – 1945, the German <b>land</b> <b>gentry</b> {{took part in}} the process of {{industrialization}} of Polish lands on the territory of Prussia and the German Reich, the lands of which (those located east of the Oder and the Lusatian Nysa, except for the Kaliningrad Oblast) became part of Poland in the year 1945. These lands formed the following Prussian provinces: Brandenburg – i. e. part of the Frankfurt district (Brandenburg), Pomerania (Pommern), Poznań (Posen), East Prussia (Ostpreussen), West Prussia (Westpreussen or Pommerellen) and Silesia (Schlesien). Their total area was nearly 162, 000 km 2 and {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century they constituted as much as 46, 4 % of the territory of Prussia (about 30 % of the territory of the German Reich). The turning point that came in 1815 is connected to the fact that after the Congress of Vienna the government of Prussia made preparations to reform the system of ownership of country lands in order to make it more capitalist (Silesia and West Pomerania). The Prussian kings offered a great incentive to the <b>land</b> <b>gentry</b> (Junkers), as those members of <b>land</b> <b>gentry</b> who chose to seek mineral deposits on their lands (coal, ore, sulfur) and invested in the mining and processing of these minerals (mainly for military purposes), would be granted the privilege to add the title “von” to their name. A similar policy was implemented already at the beginning of 18 th century by the Habsburg dynasty in Silesia. There is no denying the fact that hundreds of German land owners added to the industrialization of Polish lands in the period of partitions. Some of them earned themselves a permanent place in the Polish and German historiography: Gwido Henckel von Donnersmarck (1830 – 1916) from Świerklaniec; Hans Heinrich the 15 th Hochberg, the duke von Pless (1861 – 1938) from Pszczyna; Albert I duke of Thurn and Taxis (1867 – 1952) from Krotoszyn; Hugo, the baron of Wattmann (1876 – 1946) from Lubaczów; Franz von Winkler (1803 – 1851) from Miechowice; Franz, the count von Ballerstrem (1834 – 1910) from Pławniowice; Nikolas, the count von Ballerstrem (1900 – 1965) from Pławniowice; Friedrich von Schlaffgotsch (1883 – 1947) from Cieplice; Christian Kraft Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Oeringen von Ujest (1848 – 1926) from Ujazd (the Strzelce Opolskie district); Karol Stefan (1860 – 1933) and Karol Olbracht (1888 – 1951) Habsburg from Żywiec. The members of German <b>land</b> <b>gentry</b> very rarely became industrialists. They usually did not run the companies themselves, neither those they owned, nor those they co-owned (as shareholders). The participation of German <b>land</b> <b>gentry</b> in the industrialization of lands that currently constitute a part of Poland was mostly seen in the 19 th and 20 th century in the Upper Silesia (heavy industry), which, in 1945, wholly became part of Poland by virtue of the decisions made by the victorious countries during the Potsdam Conference. In 1945, Silesian factories and mines were nationalized and their owners left the Polish lands as a result of decisions made on the international level...|$|R
5000|$|In {{these early}} days, the spirits were used mostly as medicines.

50|$|Demographic {{changes and}} {{structural}} {{shifts in the}} economy, however, threatened {{the primacy of the}} agrarian oligarchies. Under the Old Republic (1889-1930), the growth of the urban middle sectors, though retarded by dependency and entrenched oligarchy, was eventually strong enough to propel itself to the forefront of Brazilian political life. In time, growing trade, commerce, and industry in São Paulo undermined the domination of the republic's politics by the <b>landed</b> <b>gentries</b> of that state (dominated by the coffee industry) and Minas Gerais, dominated by dairy interests, known then by observers as the politics of café com leite; 'coffee with milk'.|$|R
5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and <b>landed</b> <b>gentry.</b> He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The biggest {{group were}} the Bamonns, who were {{converts}} from the priestly Brahmin class. All Brahmin sub-castes {{such as the}} Goud Saraswat Brahmins, Padyes, and Daivadnyas, especially the goldsmiths and a few merchants, were lumped into the Christian caste of Bamonn. The descendants of Goud Saraswat converts comprised the majority of this caste. The Bamonns were further divided into other castes according to rank. In Mangalore, they were sub-divided into Sirudhegars (the highest class), Alhdhengars, Cutdhnangars, Dhivodegars, Nathnolegars, Sashragars, Puruvargars, and Maidhegars. These names are taken from the villages to which they once belonged. This group constituted the <b>landed</b> <b>gentry.</b> In accordance with traditional Hindu law that allowed a Brahmin to practice any occupation except cultivation, the Bamonns refrained from cultivating their lands, and leased them to tenants.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 50percent of midshipmen {{were the}} sons of {{professional}} men, which included {{the sons of}} naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the Age of Sail, such as the Saumarez, Hood, and Parker families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the peerage and <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> formed the next largest group, about 27percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, {{and they had a}} considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later William IV, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785. The rest were from commercial or working class backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.|$|E

Under Getúlio Vargas, ushered into power by {{the middle class and}} agrarian oligarchies of peripheral states resentful of the coffee oligarchs, Brazil moved toward a more centralized state structure that has served to regularize and modernize state governments, moving toward more universal suffrage and secret ballots, gradually freeing Brazilian politics from the grips of coronelismo.|$|R

5|$|With {{the end of}} Playford's tenure, the LCL {{had brought}} younger, more {{progressive}} members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms that the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, Robin Millhouse. Abortion was partially legalised, and planning for the Festival Centre began. The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the <b>landed</b> <b>gentry,</b> were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; {{what had once been}} a united party was now factionalised—four distinct groups across the political spectrum appeared within the party. The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment. During the term in opposition, Des Corcoran became Dunstan's deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{a family}} of the Lincolnshire <b>landed</b> <b>gentry,</b> Boucherett became {{involved}} in local politics in Lincolnshire, and (owing mainly to his marriage) with artistic and mercantile circles in London. He {{was the chairman of}} the Grimsby Haven Company, which oversaw the reopening and expansion of Grimsby's first dock. He was a friend of the artist Sir Thomas Lawrence and the proprietor of Willingham, Lincolnshire, where he constructed his country seat, Willingham House, in 1790. For his investment in the Haven Company, he received the support of Lord Yarborough, one of its main investors and a principal land-owner in Grimsby; owing largely to Lord Yarborough's patronage, Boucherett was returned as the Member of Parliament for that borough at the 1796 election. He was not a frequent voter, but used his position to further the interests of his corporation. Nonetheless, the company met with financial difficulties after it opened the Harbour in 1800. In 1803, Boucherett resigned his seat in favour of Yarborough's heir and pursued a quieter political life. He died in a carriage accident in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{consider}} India's {{modern age}} {{to have begun}} sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company {{set the stage for}} changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in Europe. However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule. Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> as a feudal safeguard against future unrest. In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that, {{by the early}} 18th Century, the type of dog known as the 'Setter' had come into its own right. It is also clear the Irish had begun {{actively}} breeding their own type. For example, the de Freyne family of French Park began keeping detailed stud records in 1793. Other prominent <b>landed</b> Irish <b>gentry</b> also {{known to have been}} breeding setter lines at the same time include Lord Clancarty, Lord Dillon, and the Marquis of Waterford.|$|R
5000|$|James Thomson's long poem The Seasons {{provided}} an influential new model using Miltonic blank verse {{in place of}} the couplet. But it appeals to a class-specific social ideology by placing the <b>landed</b> <b>gentry's</b> authority on a level with the order of nature. The fierce snowstorm in [...] "Winter", for example, is awe-inspiring but only dangerous for the generalized rustic shepherd struggling through it rather than reading about it, and the sympathy engendered through the former only serves to reaffirm the sensibility and political righteousness of the gentry. Thus, the importance and inevitability of submitting to the authority of nature is connected to the importance of maintaining social order, which the landed classes can do from their relatively safe position in the schema of the poem. In later editions of The Seasons, Thomson becomes increasingly explicit about his political message, using the language of the sublime in nature to flatter Whig politicians, a move based in the dedication or compliment to a patron common to topographical poetry in the early 18th century. The prospect-view was central in the early 18th century to the landed estates' relationship with poetry. It suggested that the natural scene corresponded with political dominance, and the presentation of a disinterested but shared value, a non-threatening aesthetic one, socially legitimized this dominance.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in 1265, a {{small number}} of <b>landed</b> aristocrats and <b>gentry</b> had the right to vote for members of the Parliament of England and Knights of the Shire.

5|$|Rhodes {{spent the}} next few months in London, seeking out {{supporters}} for his cause in the West End, the City and, occasionally, the rural estates of the <b>landed</b> <b>gentry.</b> These efforts yielded the public backing of the prominent imperialist Harry Johnston, Alexander Livingstone Bruce (who sat {{on the board of the}} East Africa Company), and Lord Balfour of Burleigh, among others. Along with Grey's active involvement and Lord Salisbury's continuing favour, the weight of this opinion seemed to be reaping dividends for Rhodes by June 1889. The amalgamation with the London syndicate was complete, and Whitehall appeared to have dropped its reservations regarding the Rudd Concession's validity. Opposition to the charter in parliament and elsewhere had been for the most part silenced, and, with the help of Rhodes's press contacts, prominently William Thomas Stead, editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, opinion in the media was starting to back the idea of a chartered company for south-central Africa. But in June 1889, just as the Colonial Office looked poised to grant the royal charter, Lobengula's letter repudiating the Rudd Concession, written two months previously, arrived in London.|$|E
5|$|The temple has {{historically}} {{been associated with the}} nearby pearling and fishing town of Chilaw, as well as the <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> of the surrounding villages who provided the resources to maintain the temple. Proximity to the trading routes and to the port provided an opportunity for transmission of ideas and people from India to Sri Lanka. The Pattuva has many temples dedicated to the higher echelons of Hindu or Buddhist deities, and to village guardian deities such Ayyanar or Ayyanayake, Viramunda, Kadavara and Bandara. Anthropologist Rohan Bastin speculates that the main Siva temple was once a minor shrine dedicated to village guardian deity Munisvaran that was transformed into a major Siva temple due to royal patronage. The temple was already an established temple by the 11th century CE, as it had issued coins by then. The temple began under the patronage of Pattuva chiefs and was probably constructed during {{the early part of the}} 10th century CE. A ferry transported traders, pilgrims and chroniclers such as Ibn Battuta from Tenavaram temple, Tevan Thurai to the Chera and Chola kingdoms of Tamilakam, stopping at Puttalam of the Jaffna kingdom and sailing the Gulf of Mannar during the 14th century CE.|$|E
5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the <b>landed</b> <b>gentry</b> to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
50|$|José also {{presented}} in Sin the contrasting inequity between {{the wealthy and}} the poverty-stricken, making the book {{an assault on the}} unending control of wealth, resources, and social capital by Filipino aristocrats.

Due to his refusal to accept the discriminations of the caste system, Chittaprosad never used his Brahminical surname during his life.
