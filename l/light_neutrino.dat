We perform a general analysis without restricting the study to any particular region of the parameter space, although interesting limits associated with inverse and extended seesawlike models are discussed in more detail. It turns out that the heavy neutrinos can dominate the process only in those limits. For the inverse seesaw limit, we find a very constrained allowed region of the parameter space, with heavy neutrino masses around 5 GeV. The extended seesaw case allows for a larger region, but in general, a hierarchical spectrum of heavy neutrinos with masses above and below ∼ 100 MeV is required.
