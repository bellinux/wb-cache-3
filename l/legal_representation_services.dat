40|$|During the 1990 s, Australian Legal Aid Commissions {{introduced}} {{a range of}} new legal aid services designed to address unmet needs while minimising the cost of legal aid. These services departed from the traditional models of legal aid services {{in the form of}} legal advice, minor assistance or full <b>legal</b> <b>representation.</b> They included <b>services</b> offered on a group basis, one-off representation by duty lawyers, and self-help kits designed to guide clients through a particular transaction or area of law. Many of these new services were premised on the client undertaking {{a large part of the}} work associated with court proceedings themselves. Since they were neither means- nor merit-tested, they provided greater access to legal advice and information to a wider range of consumers. However, the number of people receiving (means- and merit-tested) grants of aid for full <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> was simultaneously decreasing. This paper reports on the results of our independent evaluation of a range of these new legal aid services, highlighting common themes arising from our case studies and lessons that can be learned by other legal aid providers and policy makers.

40|$|At present, forty-four {{of fifty}} states, plus the District of Columbia, license public {{insurance}} adjusters to assist policyholders {{in the settlement}} of claims for property loss under insurance contracts. In the six states that do not license public adjusters, however, state authorities may at any time conclude that the profession as a whole, by its very nature, constitutes the unauthorized practice of law (UPL). Arkansas flatly prohibits public adjusting on this basis. By restricting public adjusting activities {{to members of the}} bar, policyholders are obliged to pay higher fees for <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> where the <b>services</b> of a non-attorney adjuster would be sufficient, if not preferable. In addition to being unwise policy, such prohibitions also run afoul of current trends in UPL regulation and, arguably, the United States Constitution and federal antitrust laws.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. An {{employee}} is usually entitled to representation in a disciplinary hearing. The question arises whether this <b>representation</b> includes <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> {{or whether it}} is limited to representation by union representatives or a fellow employee? An employee's right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> will in most cases be determined by a collective agreement, the employment contract or a disciplinary code. Over the years the Courts have indicated that they are not prepared to grant an absolute right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in disciplinary enquiries. Yet in some cases the courts found <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> to be a sine qua non for a fair hearing and an intrinsic part of natural justice. It seems that the conclusion that can be drawn from this research is that <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> might soon become a requirement for a fair disciplinary hearing in serious and complex matters. This research looks at numerous decisions both in die public and private sector before and after 1994. The right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> is also discussed in the light of a fair hearing. The various advantages and disadvantages of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> are briefly examined. It is argued that all employees should be granted <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in complex and serious matters where the {{employee is}} likely to be dismissed. It is thus said that all presiding officers should be granted a discretion to allow <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in serious and complex matters. Master...|$|R

I find that, {{for a variety of}} model specifications, there is no significant positive effect of having better-ranked <b>legal</b> <b>representation.</b> After conducting a sensitivity analysis, I conclude that better-ranked <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> might {{have a positive effect on}} litigation outcomes, but only if better-ranked lawyers receive cases that are substantially more difficult to win. However, if better-ranked lawyers receive substantially more difficult cases, this suggests consumers of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> are sophisticated enough to dispense with legal rankings...|$|R

40|$|Objective basing on the {{research}} {{and analysis of the}} legislation historical legal sources and other materials to study the process of formation and development of the institution of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in Russia before 1917. 	Methods the theoretical basis of research is the works of Russian scientists on various aspects of formation development and functioning of the institution of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in Russia from ancient times till 1917. The methodological basis of {{the research}} is general scientific methods historical formallogical system and general logical methods analysis synthesis induction and deduction synthesis analogy abstraction. Historicallegal formallegal logicallegal comparative legal methods were applied in the study. The author used the retrospective approach {{to the study of the}} issues of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in Russia. 	Results basing on analysis of normative legal acts regulating relations in the sphere of judicial representation and various doctrinal sources the author has examined the process of the formation and development of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution in Russia before 1917 raised the question of providing legal assistance in prerevolutionary Russia. An analogy is drawn between the prerevolutionary legal regulation of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution and the modern legislation regulating this legal institution. The conclusion is made about the inadequacy of prerevolutionary legislation regulating relations in the sphere of judicial representation as well as the modern legal regulation of relations in this sphere. It is established that the judicial reform of 1864 improved regulation in this sphere but still did not solve all the problems in this area. 	The relevance of the study is due to the topicality and the constitutional importance of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> for the entire Russian society the need to examine the origins of this legal phenomenon as well as the fact that the institution of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> has a constitutionalguaranteeing value not only in relation to the judicial protection of individual rights and freedoms of a person and citizen but also from the point of view of ensuring the effective exercise of justice. In this respect the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution is a means of guaranteeing the constitutional principles of justice and a means of providing the adversarial character of the court trial. 	Scientific novelty the article considers the origin and development of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution in Russia the development of this institution before 1917. The conclusion is made about the imperfection of the 1864 judicial reform in terms of reforming the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution. For the first time using retrospective approach a parallel is drawn between the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution that existed in Russia before 1917 and the modern judicial representation. 	Practical significance the main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in research and teaching in addressing issues about the formation and development of the <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> institution in Russia. 	nbs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Legal</b> <b>representation</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in criminal sentencing decisions. China has recently stipulated a mandatory <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> clause for all offenders facing capital charges in its Criminal Procedural Law (1996). This study uses data generated from criminal court case documents involving three serious violent crimes: murder, intentional assault, and robbery. All these crimes carry a maximum of sentence of death. The study examines whether and under what conditions <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> has an effect on criminal sentencing decisions in China. While the overall multi-regression model did not find that having a <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> significantly reduces the criminal sentence, a further analysis of the types of criminal defense reveals that sentencing decisions are significantly correlated with the type of defense, and in particular, the courtâ€™s appraisal of the defense. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

40|$|LLM (Labour Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This study {{focuses on}} the impact of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in general as well as on CCMA {{proceedings}} involving unfair dismissals relating to conduction on capacity. The study also touches on the common law position before the enactment of Labour Relations Act 28 of 1956 and Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995. Rule 25 of CCMA rules which makes provision that <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> at CCMA arbitration proceedings relating to fairness of dismissal and party has alleged that the reason for dismissal relates to the employees conduct on capacity, the party is not entitled to be represented by a legal practitioner. The dissertation analyses the effect of this provision on the Constitutional rights to <b>legal</b> <b>representations</b> well as rights relating to fair procedure. Refusal of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> in certain instances is justified in the right of legislative requirements on obligation placed particularly on the arbitrator legislative measures which, justifies refusal of <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> at CCMA that cannot be imposed without giving consideration to the Constitution. The study will highlight the South African case on position with regards to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> at CCMA. A literature study will be done using current and researched sources such as textbooks, law journals, and legislation, case law, conferences papers and internet sources.

40|$|THRE RIGHT TO <b>LEGAL</b> <b>REPRESENTATION</b> DURING ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGSThe {{question}} {{whether a person}} is entitled to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> is normally posed during disciplinary proceedings, but is also relevant to other types of administrative proceedings. No absolute right to <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> exists beyond a court of law. The Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 has confirmed the common law position, to wit that an administrative organ has a discretion to allow <b>legal</b> <b>representation,</b> should the circumstances warrant it. This discretion should exercised properly, as held in Hamata v Chairperson, Peninsula Technikon Internal Disciplinary Committee 2002 5 SA 449 (SCA). The submission is that this discretion cannot be excluded either by means of contract or statute, should the Act apply. The definition of administrative action in the Act does not include proceedings before a domestic tribunal and the possibility exists that the discretion to consider allowing <b>legal</b> <b>representation</b> can be contractually excluded. It is argued that disciplinary proceedings affecting an employee should be distinguished from proceedings where a non-employee is involved. Employees should enjoy protection similar to that afforded by the Act. Article in Afrikaan...|$|R
