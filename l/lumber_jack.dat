5000|$|The Walker family's {{flagship}} business, the Red River Lumber Company (RRLC), {{was formed}} in 1884. It built and operated mills in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Northern California. RRLC was also the [...] "home" [...] of legendary character Paul Bunyan. Stories about Bunyan, a mythical <b>lumber</b> <b>jack,</b> were created by RRLC's publicist using local <b>lumber</b> <b>jack</b> stories. Bunyan eventually became synonymous with RRLC products. Walker's sons took control of RRLC soon after the first mill in California was built in 1912. Walker built several company towns during this time including Akeley, Minnesota, and Westwood, California.|$|E

This low pay compared to the millions that the owners of the boom and some of the mills brought about some hard feelings among the workers of the Susquehanna Boom. The workers of the boom, the <b>lumber</b> <b>jacks,</b> and the sawmill workers banded together in 1872 went on strike that summer.|$|R

50|$|Lack of {{participation}} had several causes. First, the subscription fee of five shillings was likely {{too high for}} the majority of the area inhabitants. Second, it is unlikely that there were enough working men who could be attracted to such an organization. <b>Lumber</b> <b>jacks</b> were largely French speaking and used French language institutions. For anglophones, the Carpenters’ and Joiners’ Society had largely the same purpose. Third, fund raising events were generally failures. Finally, and most critical, there was no newspaper support or advertising. The continuity of the BMI through to BMIA was broken between 1850 and 1852.|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} in heart rate (HRV) at rest and during deep breathing (6 cycles a minute) of 88 professional <b>lumber</b> <b>jacks</b> was studied {{using a computer}} technique. The traditional indexes of HRV (CV, CVS, MEAN) were calculated and the spectral components of the HRV were also computed. There {{was a significant difference}} (p less than 0. 001) between the HRV indexes during the deep breathing test in those with the shortest (CV = 10. 1 +/- 1. 1) and those with the longest (CV V 6. 2 +/- 0. 4) exposures to vibration. The values of the HRV indexes decreased with age, but multiple regression analysis showed that the total exposure time to vibration had an independent negative association with the HRV. There were significant differences in all the frequency bands (frequency related power, FRP) of the heart rate between those with the longest and those with the shortest exposures. The HRV during a deep breathing test is associated with the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and is decreased in autonomic neuropathies. Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to the vibration caused by a chain saw has a negative effect on the parasympathetic activity and thus causes autonomic dysfunction...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not a {{deer yard}}," [...] replied Pat. [...] "A deer yard {{is a place}} where the deer tramp out paths in the snow and spend the winter. It is made where they get both shelter and food. When the first deep snow comes they collect in such a place and start the paths while {{browsing}} for food. Then as the snow gets deeper they follow the same paths because it is easier going, and make new paths only when they have to to reach new food supplies. By continually using these paths they keep them open and manage to pick up a living browsing on twigs and pawing down to the ground moss. By the time the heaviest snows come they can't very well get out if they want to, especially when there is a crust like this. You see some of those paths are two to three feet deep. The more plentiful the feed and the smaller the herd the smaller the yard. Before there were any laws to protect deer and moose they used to be slaughtered in the yards by trappers and <b>lumber</b> <b>jacks</b> because it is no trick at all for a man on snow-shoes to run them down. Once get them frightened so that they break out of the yard and they can be run down in no time. There's a deal of poaching goes on now when a yard is discovered near a lumber camp. It's just plain murder and nothing less. I've known a whole family of moose, bull, cow, yearling and calf, to be wiped out in one day by a bloody-minded game-hog. Didn't even waste a shot on the calf, but ran it down and cut its throat. Red Pete, the brute Walt helped to put in the pen the first year he came up here, used to make a business of locating deer yards and keeping lumber camps supplied with fresh meat all winter. The poor critters haven't even a running chance for their lives." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by Owlchemy Labs. The developer's previous works included 2011's Snuggle Truck and 2012's <b>Jack</b> <b>Lumber.</b> Dyscourse was first conceived at an [...] "IndieCabin" [...] retreat with Owlchemy Labs founder Alex Schwartz, CTO Devin Reimer, and artist Carrie Witt. A Kickstarter campaign was launched on November 6, 2013 with a minimum funding goal of $40,000. The Kickstarter ended on December 6 successfully, raising $44,134 from 1,816 backers. The developer described the game as [...] "Lord of the Flies plus a choose-your-own-adventure book, {{with a dash of}} Lost, and a sprinkle of The Walking Dead (minus the zombies), crafted with the humour and style Owlchemy Labs is known for." [...] In addition to The Walking Dead, the game's influences include the tabletop role-playing game Werewolf: The Apocalypse and the video game The Oregon Trail. Taking between 60 and 80 minutes to complete, the game contains about 80,000 words of text, with a typical playthrough seeing around fifteen percent of these.|$|R
