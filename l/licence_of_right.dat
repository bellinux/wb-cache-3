5000|$|A <b>Licence</b> <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> {{is not a}} {{compulsory}} license to use the patented invention. A patent may, {{at the request of}} the patent owner, be endorsed LOR in the UK and/or Germany. The request is made by the patent owner to the German Patent Office or UK Intellectual Property Office. As a [...] "reward" [...] for doing so, the annual renewal fees for the patent are reduced by 50%. Any person wishing to obtain a license may approach the patent owner and agree terms for the license, and only if unable to agree is it necessary to apply to the appropriate national patent office or court to have the terms settled. The terms of the license, in particular the royalties to be paid for using the invention, are normally on the basis of willing licensee/willing licensor informed by actual licensing practice and where they exist, licenses entered into voluntarily by the patentee.|$|E
