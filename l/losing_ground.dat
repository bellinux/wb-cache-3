From March 2003, Holden no longer held {{the number one}} sales position in Australia, <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to Toyota.|$|E
5|$|Robert Kubica {{was quickly}} <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> {{on the two}} Ferraris and Hamilton. Alonso passed Rosberg for seventh, and quickly closed in on Heidfeld, but stayed behind him until he pitted on Lap 16. Alonso {{attempted}} to get past on Lapfive, but ran wide, giving the position back to the German. Hamilton also pitted on Lap 16, with Massa pitting on Lap 19 and Räikkönen on Lap 21.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by Corey Nakatani, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to the Kentucky Derby point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E

5|$|Domestically, Benfica {{began the}} league {{campaign}} with five points in four games, <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> {{in the league}} race. They improved in subsequent games, but dropped points two more times, including at the official opening of the new Estádio da Luz. January was a difficult month for Benfica as they lost the Derby de Lisboa with Sporting, and on 25 January witnessed the death of club player—Miklós Fehér—in {{the middle of a}} game. In February and March, the team fluctuated between winning and losing streaks, including knocking out Rosenborg and losing to Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the compound forms for completed past actions, Portuguese also retains a synthetic pluperfect: so, ele tinha falado and ele havia falado ("he had spoken") can also be expressed as ele falara. However, the simple (one-word) pluperfect is <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to the compound forms. While pluperfect forms like falara are generally understood, their use is limited mostly to some regions of Portugal and to written language. In Brazilian Portuguese they are used nearly exclusively in the printed language, though even in that environment the -ra synthetic pluperfect has been <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to the compound form using tinha in the last decades.|$|E

50|$|The rule {{of these}} three Sikh chieftains started when Afghan, Pashtun Amir Ahmad Shah Abdali 1747-1772, began to <b>lose</b> <b>ground</b> inside his own base and decided to give Lahore to a sardar named Lehna Singh Majithia.|$|R

25|$|Since the airstrikes started, ISIL {{has been}} <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> in both Iraq and Syria. There have been {{multiple}} accounts of civilian deaths from the airstrikes.

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the decade, however, it was clear that British Railways were in trouble, {{particularly}} in the freight haulage business to which they were <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to road and air traffic (the latter thanks to a postwar glut of available transport aircraft). The government ordered a review.|$|E
50|$|The {{language}} {{was on the}} decline in the early 20th century, as it was being replaced by Amharic. During Operation Solomon, most of its remaining speakers were airlifted to Israel, where it continues to <b>lose</b> <b>ground</b> to Hebrew.|$|R

5000|$|As a result, Sarbacher was {{reportedly}} [...] "placed on ice for a year", receiving no assignments from the delegation. He was then {{defeated in the}} general election by William J. Green, Jr., as Meehan's machine continued to <b>lose</b> <b>ground</b> to the Democrats.|$|R
25|$|At 7:30 am {{the next}} morning BDMLR members, along with Port Authority officials, started observing the whale again.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the day, the YPA {{still held}} many of its {{positions}} but was rapidly <b>losing</b> <b>ground.</b> YPA was beginning to experience problems with desertions — many Slovenian members of the YPA quit their units or simply changed sides - and both the troops on the ground and the leadership in Belgrade appeared to have little idea of what to do next.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 European Parliament {{election}} the UdC won 6.5% of {{the vote}} and five of its candidates were elected to the European Parliament, including De Mita and Magdi Allam. In the 2010 regional elections the UdC chose to form alliances both with the centre-right and the centre-left (or stood alone) in different regions, depending on local conditions, <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> everywhere but in those southern regions where it was in alliance with the centre-right.|$|E

50|$|Standard Croatian and Bosnian {{are based}} on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Bosnian Serbs, Ekavian for most of Serbia).

60|$|Agam. Thus far {{the promise}} of the day is fair. Æneas rather <b>loses</b> <b>ground</b> than gains. I saw him over-laboured, taking breath, And leaning on his spear, behold our trenches, Like a fierce lion looking up to toils, Which yet he durst not leap.|$|R
25|$|By the Late Bronze Age, Hittite {{had started}} <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to its close {{relative}} Luwian. It appears {{that in the}} 13th century BC, Luwian was the most widely spoken language in the Hittite capital of Hattusa. After {{the collapse of the}} Hittite Empire {{as a part of the}} more general Late Bronze Age collapse, Luwian emerged in the Early Iron Age as the main language of the so-called Syro-Hittite states in southwestern Anatolia and northern Syria.|$|E
25|$|Later, the Great Depression, {{combined}} with LaSalle's stalling sales' numbers, caused Cadillac to rethink its companion make. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had eliminated the Marquette and the Viking in 1930, their second model year. Cadillac also saw sales of its cars <b>losing</b> <b>ground,</b> as confirmed Cadillac buyers tried to trim pennies by buying the less expensive LaSalle. LaSalle sales also were falling, {{from a high}} of 22,691 models in 1929 to a low of 3,290 in 1932.|$|E
25|$|The {{negotiations}} {{were long and}} difficult. While the Russians were <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to the Poles, who took Kiev in May 1920, the Lithuanians sought to delay the talks. On May 22, 1920, the Lithuanian delegation even threatened {{to withdraw from the}} peace talks. However, as the situation changed and Russia successfully counterattacked, the Lithuanians were pressured into signing the treaty on July 12. After some debate over whether the treaty was sincere, and whether the Soviets had assumed any real liability, the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania ratified it on August 8, 1920.|$|E
25|$|Sea Devil reloaded and {{continued}} to move closer to Japan. On 17September and 18September, mountainous seas inhibited hunting. On 21September, the submarine commenced running along the 100fathom (183m) curve, but the strong Kuroshio Current there caused her to <b>lose</b> <b>ground</b> and forced her to shift her course.|$|R
50|$|Alonso {{began to}} <b>lose</b> <b>ground,</b> and {{was passed by}} Heidfeld. He stayed behind the BMW for the {{remainder}} of the race.

25|$|The {{success of}} Dees at their Memphis radio station, {{combined}} with his TV appearances and hit music, motivated station owner RKO General to offer Rick the morning radio show in Los Angeles at 93KHJ AM. Dees helped their ratings, but AM music radio was rapidly <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to FM. When KHJ switched to country music, Dees left KHJ, taking a morning position at KIIS-FM in July 1981. In a short time, he turned KIIS-FM into the #1 revenue-generating {{radio station in}} America, with an asset value approaching half a billion dollars.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{substantial}} {{economic reforms}} (Malaysian New Economic Policy) were enacted {{to address the}} economic imbalance. In the 1980s and 1990s, more affirmative action was also implemented to create a Malay class of entrepreneurs. Public opposition to such policies appeared to wither away after the rioting of May 1969, with parties running {{on a platform of}} reducing Bumiputra privileges <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> in Parliamentary elections. However, {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, debate was revived when several government politicians made controversial statements on the nature of Malay privileges as set out by Article 153.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, Cambodia's {{relations}} with North Vietnam and with South Vietnam, {{as well as}} the rupture with Washington, reflected Sihanouk's efforts to adjust to geopolitical realities in Southeast Asia and to keep his country out of the escalating war in neighboring South Vietnam. In the early-to-mid-1960s, this effort required a tilt toward Hanoi because the government in Saigon tottered on the brink of anarchy. In the cities, the administration of Ngo Dinh Diem and the military regimes that succeeded it had become increasingly ineffectual and unstable, while in the countryside the government forces were steadily <b>losing</b> <b>ground</b> to the Hanoi-backed insurgents.|$|E
50|$|More than 150 years ago, Union College {{was one of}} the Big Four {{along with}} Harvard, Yale and Princeton. Student {{attrition}} due to the Civil War and a scandal over college finances led to a decline at Union that caused it to <b>lose</b> <b>ground</b> and drop from the Big Four.|$|R
