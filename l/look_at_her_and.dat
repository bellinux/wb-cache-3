25|$|Timekeeper {{announced}} that guests were {{just in time}} for a meeting between H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided to take a closer <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> tried to grab her. Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.|$|E

[...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that has something to say, continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don't even have to read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired to the bedroom. When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld".

500|$|In another article, Jocelyn Vena from MTV News {{thought that}} the video was [...] "the perfect homage" [...] to the singer's Sex book and her Erotica (1992) days, {{describing}} it as [...] "crunchy, sexy and edgy".

Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter noted references to the music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989).

She added that the references to her old work, as well as the half-nude men indicated that [...] "it isn't just the girls 'who wanna have some fun'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{experience}} saw {{a change}} in the dog, with Frank later writing, [...] "She wasn't that tame, obedient dog anymore, she was a skinny animal that kept herself alive through cunning and instinct." [...] Because of the remoteness of the work camp, she was at a reduced risk from the local population who Frank feared would eat her. Frank credited Judy with saving his life during his time spent there, [...] "She saved my life in so many ways. The greatest way of all was giving me a reason to live. All I had to do was <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> into those weary, bloodshot eyes and I would ask myself: What would happen to her if I died? I had to keep going. Even if it meant waiting for a miracle." [...] A radarman named Tom Scott later wrote that Frank and Judy shared an unusual bond, with Frank able to send the dog into the jungle with a click and recall her with a whistle. On one occasion, Frank found Judy attempting to bury an elephant's leg bone.|$|E

[...] Co-executive producer Charles Floyd Johnson commented, [...] "When you get actors who really listen and respond organically {{in the moment}} to what they're hearing, sometimes magic happens. They really seemed to get that immediately, and that doesn't always happen." ...|$|E

It's bleak because I can't — many of us can't hear her sweet voice — but it's great because she did live, and she was ours. I mean African-Americans and white Americans and Asians, Spanish-speaking — she belonged to us and that's a great thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel brought her {{in to talk}} about a role in the 1978 film Goin' South, then asked her for cocaine and grilled her about whether her orgasms in Behind the Green Door were real; she was angered to the point where she stormed out of the interview. She was going to be cast in the film Hardcore, {{opposite}} George C. Scott, but the casting director took one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> said she was too wholesome to be cast as a porn queen. [...] "The Hardcore people wanted a woman with orange hair who chews gum, swings a big purse, and wears stiletto heels. That's such a cliche," [...] Chambers said years later. Season Hubley was cast instead.|$|E

2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl {{is walking}} and the guys <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} {{that came out of}} my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. [...] Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.|$|E
