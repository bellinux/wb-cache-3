It appears that the Colonel had pretty well {{come to the end}} of his tether--he is by no means as well off as he used to be--and in his {{customary}} lordly way he told a financial agent to get from any one whatever he could over a fixed limit. It was, as a matter of necessity, a <b>low</b> <b>limit.</b> I warned Mr. Lorimer that though there was a prospect of fair milling ore we had found very little so far, but he's a remarkably keen old fellow, and had been talking to the miners, especially the unfortunate one who had been holding out against the Colonel's attempts to squeeze him off his claim. Mr. Lorimer agreed with him to let it lapse and re-record it. So I went with him and his agent to sign the agreement, and felt half-ashamed when Colonel Carrington came in. Of course, I had no need to. He always treated me with a contemptuous indifference that was galling, and a man must earn his bread. Still, I had taken his pay, and it hurt me to see him beaten down upon his knees.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>low</b> mass <b>limit</b> of Langevin dynamics for a charged Brownian particle {{driven by the}} magnetic Lorentz force. In the <b>low</b> mass <b>limit,</b> velocity variables relaxing quickly are coarse-grained out to yield effective dynamics for position variables. Without Lorentz force, the <b>low</b> mass <b>limit</b> {{is equivalent to the}} high friction limit. Both cases share the same Langevin equation that is obtained by setting the mass to zero in the original Langevin equation. The equivalence breaks down {{in the presence of the}} Lorentz force. The <b>low</b> mass <b>limit</b> turns out to be singular. The system in the <b>low</b> mass <b>limit</b> is different from the system with zero mass. The <b>low</b> mass <b>limit</b> is also different from the large friction limit. We derive the effective equations of motion in the <b>low</b> mass <b>limit.</b> The resulting stochastic differential equation involves a nonwhite noise whose correlation matrix has antisymmetric components. We demonstrate the importance of the nonwhite noise by investigating the heat dissipation by the Brownian particle. Comment: 5 page...|$|R

5000|$|An aquastat is {{a device}} used in {{hydronic}} heating systems for controlling water temperature. To prevent the boiler from firing too often, aquastats {{have a high}} limit temperature and a <b>low</b> <b>limit.</b> If the thermostat is calling for heat, the boiler will fire until the high limit is reached, then shut off (even if the thermostat is still calling for heat). The boiler will re-fire if the boiler water temperature drops below a range around the high limit. The high limit exists {{for the sake of}} efficiency and safety. The boiler will also fire (regardless of thermostat state) when the boiler water temperature goes below a range around the <b>low</b> <b>limit,</b> ensuring that the boiler water temperature remains above a certain point. The <b>low</b> <b>limit</b> is intended for tankless domestic hot water---it ensures that boiler water is always warm enough to heat the domestic hot water. Many aquastats also have a differential ("diff") control which determines the size of the range around the [...] "low" [...] and/or [...] "high" [...] controls.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SAPS is also the <b>low</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure). Therefore, we can say that the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SAPS is not the <b>lowest</b> speed <b>limit</b> of SuperDARN observation.|$|R
