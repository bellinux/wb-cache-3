Proposed revisions by the Task Group were presented in documents labeled CTG 3. 1 and CTG 3. 2. The Task Group has made a considerable revision effort, both with regard to layout and reduction in the volume of provisions, and also with regard to technical content. A major change is the proposed combination {{into one of the}} two currently separate sections on moment magnification for the nonsway and sway cases. This change simplifies the presentation and make the provisions easier to comprehend. The stiffness provisions would seem to have become more complex, on the other hand. It is further proposed to adopt a moment magnifier expression of an earlier code version. Other revision proposals concern effects of sustained <b>loading,</b> <b>safety</b> aspects through the stiffness reduction factors, and lower slenderness limits. In the present report, a review is made of, and comments are provided to, major items in the revision proposal. The rationality of some of the proposed changes are questioned...|$|E

50|$|Factors {{of safety}} (FoS), {{also known as}} (and used interchangeably with) safety factor (SF), is a term {{describing}} the load carrying capacity of a system beyond the expected or actual loads. Essentially, the factor of safety is how much stronger the system is than it usually needs to be for an intended <b>load.</b> <b>Safety</b> factors are often calculated using detailed analysis because comprehensive testing is impractical on many projects, such as bridges and buildings, but the structure's ability to carry load must be determined to a reasonable accuracy.|$|R
40|$|Most of the sub-structures of new railway river bridges in {{the state}} of Odisha are built with solid mass {{concrete}} gravity piers and abutments. These piers do not have steel reinforcement to bear the load as it does not subject to any tensile stress under regular type of <b>loading.</b> <b>Safety</b> of these piers is of major concern during high magnitude earthquake as frequent occurrence of such earthquakes is observed in India in recent times. Failure of pier may result in loss of functionality of Railway Bridge leading to the cut down of rail communication line for an indefinite amount of time and a huge loss to the society. This study aims to assess the vulnerability of the solid gravity bridge piers which forms the important component of railway bridges as the load transfer between substructure and superstructure takes through them. In the present study seven existing piers from the state of Odisha are evaluated using free vibration analysis and nonlinear static (pushover) analysis. Free-vibration analysis of the bridge pier shows that the mass participation of fundamental mode is always below 50 %. Also, the cumulative mass participation for first six mode is found to be less than 80 % for all the selected bridge pier. This indicates the significant contribution of higher modes. The pushover analysis indicates the brittle mode of failure of all the bridge piers at ultimate load. This is due to poor energy dissipation capacity of the mass concrete used for building these structures...|$|E
40|$|Use of socket {{prostheses}} Currently, {{for individuals}} with limb loss, the conventional method of attaching a prosthetic limb relies on a socket that fits over the residual limb. However, {{there are a number}} of issues concerning the use of a socket (e. g., blisters, irritation, and discomfort) that result in dissatisfaction with socket prostheses, and these lead ultimately a significant decrease in quality of life. Bone-anchored prosthesis Alternatively, the concept of attaching artificial limbs directly to the skeletal system has been developed (bone anchored prostheses), as it alleviates many of the issues surrounding the conventional socket interface. Bone anchored prostheses rely on two critical components: the implant, and the percutaneous abutment or adapter, which forms the connection for the external prosthetic system (Figure 1). To date, an implant that screws into the long bone of the residual limb has been the most common intervention. However, more recently, press-fit implants have been introduced and their use is increasing. Several other devices are currently at various stages of development, particularly in Europe and the United States. Benefits of bone-anchored prostheses Several key studies have demonstrated that bone-anchored prostheses have major clinical benefits when compared to socket prostheses (e. g., quality of life, prosthetic use, body image, hip range of motion, sitting comfort, ease of donning and doffing, osseoperception (proprioception), walking ability) and acceptable safety, in terms of implant stability and infection. Additionally, this method of attachment allows amputees to participate in a wide range of daily activities for a substantially longer duration. Overall, the system has demonstrated a significant enhancement to quality of life. Challenges of direct skeletal attachment However, due to the direct skeletal attachment, serious injury and damage can occur through excessive loading events such as during a fall (e. g., component damage, peri-prosthetic fracture, hip dislocation, and femoral head fracture). These incidents are costly (e. g., replacement of components) and could require further surgical interventions. Currently, these risks are limiting the acceptance of bone-anchored technology and the substantial improvement to quality of life that this treatment offers. An in-depth investigation into these risks highlighted a clear need to re-design and improve the componentry in the system (Figure 2), to improve the overall safety during excessive loading events. Aim and purposes The ultimate aim of this doctoral research is to improve the <b>loading</b> <b>safety</b> of bone-anchored prostheses, to reduce the incidence of injury and damage through the design of load restricting components, enabling individuals fitted with the system to partake in everyday activities, with increased security and self-assurance. The safety component will be designed to release or ‘fail’ external to the limb, in a way that protects the internal bone-implant interface, thus removing the need for restorative surgery and potential damage to the bone. This requires detailed knowledge of the loads typically experienced by the limb and an understanding of potential overload situations that might occur. Hence, a comprehensive review of the loading literature surrounding bone anchored prostheses will be conducted as part of this project, with the potential for additional experimental studies of the loads during normal activities to fill in gaps in the literature. This information will be pivotal in determining the specifications for the properties of the safety component, and the bone-implant system. The project will follow the Stanford Biodesign process for the development of the safety component...|$|E

40|$|Wind loads {{are very}} {{important}} {{in the design of}} tall buildings as often the load combinations containing the wind load govern the design. As for reliability, however, because of the higher inherent uncertainty in the wind load in comparison to the gravity <b>load,</b> <b>safety</b> indices decrease as the ratio of wind load to gravity <b>load</b> increases. The <b>safety</b> indices in RC columns depend on the nominal wind to gravity load ratios. Due to the interaction between bending moment and axial force, a single ratio cannot be defined, because the eccentricity is not similar for wind and gravity loads. In this paper, the ratio of wind to gravity loads is considered separately for axial force and bending moments. Unlike conventional approach, here it is assumed that the wind and gravity loads&# 039; eccentricities are not equal, and the final load eccentricity used in either the design or the reliability analysis is a function of applied loads. The results demonstrate that the sensitivity of RC columns&# 039; safety indices to bending moment ratios is higher than that of axial force ratios. Furthermore, the variation of RC columns&# 039; safety indices with a low rebar percentage is very different from RC columns with high rebar percentages...|$|R

Both oral dosage forms receive considerable {{interest in the}} recent years as commercially available pharmaceutical products and as small scale personalized extemporaneous preparations. Areas covered: In this review, technological issues such as viscosity of the casting liquid, mechanical properties of the film, upscaling and the stability of the casting solution and produced films will be discussed. Furthermore, patient-related problems like appearance, mucosal irritation, taste, drug <b>load,</b> <b>safety</b> and biopharmaceutics are described. Current knowledge and directions for solutions are summarized. Expert opinion: The viscosity of the casting solution is a key factor for producing suitable films. This parameter is amongst others dependent on the polymer and active pharmaceutical ingredient, and the further excipients that are used. For optimal patient compliance, an acceptable taste and palatability are desirable. Safe and inert excipients should be used and appropriate packaging should be provided to produced films. Absorption through the oral mucosa will vary for each active compound, formulation and patient, which gives rise to pharmacokinetic questions. Finally, the European Pharmacopoeia needs to specify methods, requirement and definitions for oromucosal film preparations based on bio-relevant data...|$|R
