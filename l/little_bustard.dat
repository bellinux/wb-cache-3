40|$|International audienceHunting {{is one of}} {{the human}} {{activities}} that directly affect wildlife and has received increasing attention given its socioeconomic dimensions. Most studies have been conducted on coastal and wetland areas and showed that hunting activity can greatly affect bird behaviour and distribution. Hunting-free reserves for game species are zones where birds find an area of reduced disturbance. We evaluated the effect of hunting activities on the behaviour and use of hunting-free areas of lapwings Vanellus vanellus, golden plovers Pluvialis apricaria and <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> Tetrax tetrax in agricultural areas. We compared the habitat use and behaviour of birds on days before, during and after hunting took place. All three studied species showed strong behavioural responses to hunting activities. Hunting activity increased flight probability and time spent vigilant (higher on hunting days than just before and after a hunting day), to the detriment of resting. We also found distributional (use of hunting-free reserve) responses to hunting activities, with hunting-free reserves being used more frequently during hunting days. Thus, reserves can mitigate the disturbance caused by hunting activities, benefiting threatened species in agricultural areas. Increasing the size or number of huntingfree areas might be an important management and conservation tool to reduce the impacts of hunting activities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn lekking species, female {{choice of}} {{particular}} males for mating {{is based on}} male characters that {{are not related to}} immediate gains such as access to resources. This is, however, unclear in exploded-lekking species, as male territories may contain resources for females; it is thus the degree to which males regulate female access to these resources to obtain matings that should distinguish lekking from nonlekking species. We investigated the relationship between resources for females, male distribution and male attractiveness in <b>little</b> <b>bustards.</b> One parameter determining resource quality for females was invertebrate availability: females laid eggs in grassland fields (grass, alfalfa and ryegrass) with significantly higher invertebrate biomass than others of similar cover but nests were in areas that did not have higher invertebrate biomass, at a scale of 1 km 2. Males set up territories and females laid eggs in areas that had a high proportion of alfalfa, but not high mean invertebrate biomass. Thus males set up territories at resources potentially used by females, but that appeared not to be critical for breeding. In addition, females did not use the amount of resources defended as a criterion for mate choice, as male attractiveness was not related to various territorial resources. Locating the lek in areas attractive to females might be a way of increasing the probability of encounter between the sexes...|$|R
50|$|An {{adult male}} is brown above, barred with blackish colouration, and white below, {{with a long}} grey neck and head. His breast and lower neck sides are {{chestnut}} {{and there is a}} golden wash to the back and the extent of these bright colours tending to increase as the male ages. In the breeding season, the male has long white neck bristles, which measure up to 12 - 15 cm in length, continually growing from the third to the sixth year of life. In flight, the long wings are predominantly white with brown showing along the edges of the lower primary and secondary feathers and a dark brown streak along the upper-edge of the wing. The breast and neck of the female are buff, with brown and pale colouration over the rest of the plumage rendering it well camouflaged in open habitats. Immature birds resemble the female. The eastern subspecies (O. t. dybowskii) is more extensively grey in colour in both sexes, with more extensive barring on the back. The great bustard has long legs, a long neck and a heavy, barrel-chested body. It is fairly typical of the family in its overall shape and habitat preferences. Three other bustard species overlap in range with this species: the Macqueen's (Chlamydotis macqueenii), houbara (Chlamydotis undulata) and <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> (Tetrax tetrax). However, none of these attains the plumage coloration nor approach the body sizes of this species. Thus, the great bustard is essentially unmistakable.|$|R

40|$|Afforestation often causes direct habitat {{losses for}} {{farmland}} birds of conservation concern, {{but it is}} uncertain whether negative effects also extend significantly into adjacent open land. Information is thus required on how these species react to wooded edges, and how their responses are affected by edge and landscape characteristics. These issues were examined in Mediterranean arable farmland, using bird counts at 0, 100, 200, 300 and > 300 m from oak, pine and eucalyptus edges, embedded in landscapes with variable amounts and spatial configurations of forest plantations. Bird diversity declined away from edges, including that of woodland, farmland and ground-nesting birds. Positive edge responses were also found for overall and woodland bird abundances, and for five of the nine most widespread and abundant species (Galerida larks, stonechat, linnet, goldfinch and corn bunting). Strong negative edge effects were only recorded for steppe birds, with reduced abundances near edges of calandra larks and short-toed larks, but not of <b>little</b> <b>bustards</b> and tawny pipits. Edge contrast affected the magnitude of edge effects, with a tendency for stronger responses to old and tall eucalyptus plantations (hard edges) than to young and short oak plantations (soft edges). There were also species-specific interactions between edge and fragmentation effects, with positive edge responses tending to be strongest in less fragmented landscapes, whereas steppe birds tended to increase faster away from edges and to reach the highest species richness and abundances in large arable patches. Results suggest that forest plantations may increase overall bird diversity and abundance in adjacent farmland, at the expenses of steppe birds of conservation concern. Clustering forest plantations in a few large patches and thus reducing the density of wooded edges at the landscape-scale might reduce such negative impacts. <br/...|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} several {{hypotheses}} proposed as to why males cluster into leks. The hotshot hypothesis is the only model that attributes males as {{the driving force behind}} aggregation.

Other males form leks around these hotshots as a way to lure females away from the hotshot. A manipulative experiment using the <b>little</b> <b>bustard,</b> Tetrax tetrax, was done to test the various lek evolution models. The experiment involved varying the size and sex ratio of leks using decoys.

40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1978 and 1979 and completes {{a period of}} 30 years of {{observations}} by a contingent of resident and visiting ornithologists in the Rhône delta and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. It presents not only observations of rare species or unusual numbers of birds, but also indicates the results of several long term monitoring programmes concerning in particular, waterfowl and allied species. A climatological report summarizes the most important meteorological phenomena of the two years, the most striking of which were the very wet spring of 1978 and the dry summer of 1979. The winter of 1978 - 1979 must surely be remembered in northern and central Europe {{as one of the}} most severe this century. In the Mediterranean, however, it was much less severe and, fortunately, had none of the disastrous effects of the previous hard winters of 1956 and 1962 - 1963. "La Crau", a unique stony desert area and former delta of the River Durance, is suffering seriously from the spread of industry and from agricultural reclamation. Some of the first census work to be carried out here shows just how important the area is for breeding Stone Curlews, <b>Little</b> <b>Bustards</b> and Pin-tailed Sandgrouse in particular. The sandgrouse population is an isolated one, the species occurring elsewhere in Europe only in parts of Spain. Observations of sea birds are not carried out systematically and more thorough sea-watching would probably show that many of the species mentioned here are regularly wintering in the "Golfe du Lion". Unusually high numbers of Black-necked Grebes appear each autumn in the saline "Etang de Lavalduc" (up to 4, 500), which makes it an internationally important site for this species. Whilst the herons as a group maintain their numbers, several notable changes have taken place in recent years. The reed-nesting Grey Heron continues to increase whilst the Purple clearly shows the opposite trend. The Cattle Egret, occuring only as an accidentai visitor less than 15 years ago, appears now to have reached the peak of colonisation with the numbers of breeding pairs levelling off. Autumn roost counts show the total of individuals at close to 2, 000. The first indications of roughly how many Bitterns breed in the Camargue are given whilst the second only record of White Storks breeding in the delta involved one semi-captive male and a wild female carrying a ring. This was a chick transplanted from Morocco to a nest in Alsace as part of a reintroduction programme in 1975. The flamingos again had two successful breeding seasons and the summer population for the south coast of France peaked at over 35, 000 birds both years. Particularly interesting data are being gatbered from the sightings of "Darvic-ringed" birds, 1858 of which have thus been marked over the past three years. 24 % of these have already been read outside France. Amongst the Anseriiformes, the wintering Bewick's Swan population was the highest yet recorded with a maximum of 85 in January 1979. During this same period four species of geese were present with Greylags and Bean's bath reaching one hundred or more individuals. Counts of Shelducks have shawn how important the salines are bath as a breeding area and winter quarters, and a ringing programme has thrown some light on their movements. For other ducks the overall wintering population has been quite high with a peak of 122, 000 in January 1979. In general the number of diving ducks was below average but this was compensated for by several of the surface feeders being present in large numbers, in particular Teal, Gadwall and Shoveler. The list of raptor observations is as impressive as ever and includes a second estimate of the breeding Marsh Harrier population with results slightly superior to those obtained ten years earlier. The eighth complete census of breeding Lara-limicoles was carried out in the brackish and salt water zone of the greater Camargue area. All species are maintaining their numbers and attention is drawn to the increasing populations of Mediterranean and Slender-billed Gulls. Nearctic waders already observed in the delta included sightings of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and Wilson's Phalarope whilst the Pectoral was only the second reported. Eagle Owls in "Les Alpilles" appear to be increasing with 30 pairs recorded. Passerines have not been ignored entirely; the continued increase of breeding Stonechats is encouraging whilst the successful nesting of a pair of Red-billed Quelea in the Camargue adds an exotic flavour to this repor...|$|R
40|$|This bird {{report for}} the Camargue, Crau and Alpilles (Rhône delta, S. France), covers the years 1980 and 1981. It has been {{compiled}} partly from observations communicated by visiting n aturalists but particularly from resident ornithologists, attached to the « Fondation Tour du Valat », the « Centre d'Écologie de Camargue » (C. N. R. S.), the « Réserve Nationale de Camargue » (S. N. P. N.) and the « Centre de Recherches Ornithologiques de Provence » (C. R. O. P.). As with the previous reports only the results of censuses and unusual observations are given. As a baseline, readers are advised to consult the recently published guide to the birds of the Camargue by Blondel and Isenmann (1981) in which are mentioned all 337 species recorded {{in the area to}} date. The climatological report shows a cold spell in December 1980, with subzero temperatures recorded on 18 days. Total rainfall in autumn and winter was below, but in spring and summer higher, than normal. 1981 was even more unusual, with 25 nights of frost in January, low rainfall, long hours of sunlight and much northerly wind. In contrast, the winter ended (March) mild and wet. April was mild and dry, May cold and wet. The variable summer and autumn weather was characterised by a dry spell (excepting September) with no rain in October/November. December was mild and wet. A first complete census of wintering cormorants revealed 4000 in 1980 and 6000 in 1981 against a formerly estimated maximum of about 2000. This increase has meant that the delta {{has become one of the}} most important wintering are as for the species in western Europe. The Grey Heron population continues to increase with 438 nests in 1980 and 515 in 1981 (table I). In contrast, Purple Herons have decreased in number in the delta over the last decade, probably as a result of a reduction in the available breeding habitat. Large colonies still exist just outside the delta, and the region continues to be the most important breeding area for Purple Herons in France. The population of Cattle Egrets, after being stable from 1977 to 1979 (table II), increased by 48 % in 1980 before decreasing in 1981. This drop was undoubtedly attributable to the cold winter. A nest of Little Bittern was found in 1981 and there is a summer record of a Reef Heron in 1980. A pair of White Storks again bred, raising 3 young in both years. The adult pair are sedentary whilst the young migrate in autumn. Flamingos again bred in large numbers, with 7500 prs. in 1980 and 9500 prs. in 1981, although this latter figure was reduced to 8170 prs. by heavy rains. These raised 3730 and 4000 chicks respectively. The colour-ringing programme continued and a further 1358 chicks were marked during the two years, bringing the total of individu ally recognisable birds to 3316. Of these, 1724 (52 %) have since been identified throughout the West Mediterranean, whilst the total number of sightings exceeds 11000. Both Greylag Goose and Gannet have been attracted to the Flamingo colony, the latter bird staying for three months, displaying and occupying a nest cone and accompanying the flamingos up to 14 kms inland. Bewick's Swans continue to be winter visitors with 52 in 1979 - 1980 and 82 in 1980 - 1981, with a record high of 23 juveniles. The breeding population of Shelduck, a species extending its range in the south of France, was censused in 1980, with 350 chicks (42 families) in the Salins-de-Giraud and 700 (86 families) in the Salins-d'Aigues-Mortes. A further 111 were colour-ringed as part of a study on the movements of the West Mediterranean population which has now been shown to moult in the same area as the North West European population, in North West Germany, a distance of 1200 kms north of the Camargue. Winter counts have revealed peaks of 1354 birds in 1980 and 1035 in 1981, in each case representing over 80 % of the total number recorded in the south of France. For other species of ducks the peak 1980 - 1981 winter count was of 143000 in November. Instead of increasing in December, as is usually the case, the cold spell of early December resulted in a decrease of 25 % mostly caused by a high hunting mortality within the delta. Amongst the major changes in numbers compared to former winters has been a decrease of Pintail and Tufted Ducks and an increase of Shoveler and Gadwall. Diving ducks (Tufted and Pochard) are gradually decreasing in the Camargue because there are more attractive areas further north, whilst some of the surface-feeders tend to increase, Mallard and Teal together regularly forming 50 - 60 % of the total Anatidae. Amongst the seaducks, a concentration of 1000 Scoters, mostly or solely Velvets, was quite exceptional. The area is one of the most remarkable in Europe for raptors at all seasons. Booted Eagles were again regularly recorded in 1980 and a Sea Eagle appeared in both years. Wintering Marsh Harriers are at a remarkably high density with 280 counted at 3 roosts, probably only about half of the total in the area. There were two observations of Eleonora's Falcon in 1981. The average number of wintering coots bas recently decreased from about 25000 (1964 - 1968) to 20000 in 1980 - 1981. Sample censuses of the breeding population indicate a relatively law density of 3. 7 nests per 10 ha. ln the Crau, the wintering <b>Little</b> <b>Bustards</b> have been estimated at 1000 - 1100, which corresponds with the breeding population of about 500 prs. The third record of a Pectoral Sandpiper was a bird shot in September 1979. There is a second winter record of a Great Skua in 1981 and a remarkable observation of 22 Long-tailed Skuas together in the Gulf of Beauduc in May 1980. A pair of Mediterranean Gulls successfully bred in both 1980 and 1981 whilst the Slender-billed Gull was not found breeding either year. The former of these two species occurs in large numbers outside the breeding season with maximum counts of 250 in March 1980 and 700 in September 1981. Two pairs of Black Terns nested in 1980, the first breeding record since 1931. Whiskered Terns bred in 1981 (120 prs.). This species was formerly abundant in the area but bad not been recorded breeding since 1974. The Long-eared Owl, which forms winter roosts of up to 20 birds, was found breeding in 1980 for only the fifth time. There are several spring records of Red-rumped Swallows whilst those of the common Swallow in December may indicate a possible attempt at wintering. Richard's Pipit was recorded for the first time in October 1981 with a second record one month later, whilst the May 1980 record of a Red-throated Pipit was only the sixth in the past 30 years. The Stonechat seems now to be well re-established as a breeding species and there is a possible return of the Penduline Tit with one nest found in each of the two years...|$|R
40|$|This ornithological report {{covering}} the years 1982 and 1983 follows on {{from a series}} begun in 1950. lt deals mainly {{with the results of}} the long-term monitoring of several bird communities in the Camargue and lists a few species which are accidentai in the area. The baseline for inclusion of unusual observations is provided by the Guide des Oiseaux de Camargue (Blondel et Isenmann, 1981) which gives the status and phenology of the 337 species recorded in the Camargue, the Crau and the Alpilles. Now that a rare birds committee has been established in France only those observations accepted by this committee will in future be published here. The present report, however, was written before the committee had given a verdict on sorne of the observations submitted. The meteorological report shows that 1982 was a dry year with a mild winter and a hot summer. The autumn was mild and characterised by a freak storm from the S. E. on the 7 - 8 November 1983 was also a dry year; the spring was dominated by frequent and strong S. E. winds and the summer was hot. Cormorants have been censused for the 3 rd and 4 th consecutive winters and their numbers have peaked at between 4 000 and 6 000 (Fig. 1). The recent increase in numbers can perhaps be related to the increase of the breeding populations of Denmark and Rolland, since ringed birds from Rolland have been sighted in the Camargue. Reed-nesting herons are censuse d annually by aerial photography over the major part of the south coast of Franoe. The Grey heron continues to increase in number and to extend its range (Table l). Purple heron numbers have increased since 1981, but unlike the Grey, the major colonies of this species are not situated within the Camargue proper but to the East and West of the two main arms of the river. Tree-nesting herons have also been censused annually since 1968. Their numbers are given in Table II, from which {{it can be seen that}} the Cattle egret population has practically stopped increasing and now fluctuates at around 400 pairs. Both Little and Cattle egrets have also been censused at the winter roosts (Table III). Breeding Bitterns we re also censused and 5 4 « boom ing) males were located in the greater Camargue area in 1983; the number found in the Camargue proper (24) being the same as in 1982. Both years produced record numbers of flamingos breeding in the delta : 10500 pairs raised 6825 chicks in 1982 and 14400 pairs raised 7200 chicks in 1983, the latter being the only colony established throughout the western Mediterranean. The ringing programme started in 1977 was continued and 652 and 720 chicks respectively were marked the two years. These birds are individually recogniseable in the field and there have now been over 19000 contacts from a total of 4688 colour-ringed flamingos (56 % of the sample). Sightings are from the Western Mediterranean in particular, but with a few birds in Senegal, Mauritania and Libya. Following the strong S. E. winds of early November 1982, small groups of flamingos were sighted well inland in France. One ringed bird is known to have returned to the Camargue after being seen on the River Isère (Drôme), 185 km up the Rhône valley. In spite of the large numbers of flamingos in the Camargue these two springs the problem of these birds feeding in the rice-paddies has not worsened. On the contrary, the scaring campaings have paid off and no subsequent damage was reported by the farmers (even though the area under rice cultivation has increased). The wintering Bewick's Swan population peaked at 55 - 60 in 1981 - 82 and 68 in 1982 - 83, rather lower than the peaks of 85 and 82 individuals recorded in the past. Over the past six years the number of Shelducks recorded along the south coast of France prior to breeding has been around 1400 individuals. About 500 pairs breed in the area, mainly in the salines of the Camargue and Petite Camargue. The colour-ringing programme was continued and a further 69 birds were marked, bringing the total of individually recogniseable Shelducks ringed since 1978 to 316. Sightings of these birds on the « Grosser Knechtsand » have shown that birds from the south of France join the vast majority of birds from North Western Europe for the annual moult in the German Waddenzee (see Table IV). Following the cold spell in N. Europe in winter 1981 - 82, a record number of 2060 Shelducks were counted in S. France, most of these (1876) being in the Camargue and Petite Camargue. Results of the monthly winter censuses of other Anatidae species, carried out by the C. N. R. S. since 1964 - 65, are summarised in Table V and VI, prepared and commented upon by A. Tamisier. During the winter of 1982 - 83 total duck numbers peaked at only 100000. This is lower than usual and may be attributed to two factors mainly : the S. E. storm of early November and the gradual loss of good habitat (disturbance by hunting and fishing has increased). In order to emphasize the importance of disturbance-free areas the numbers of ducks recorded on the St Seren marsh located in the centre of the Tour du Valat Reserve are given in Table VII. Regarding the larger raptors there has been no change in the status of the Egyptian vulture and Eagle owl in the Alpilles, but the two pairs of Bonelli's eagles have had very poor breeding seasons with only 2 young raised in two years. In the Camargue there has been no detectable change in the Marsh harrier population, an estimated 84 occupied nest sites being located in 1982. In the Crau the winte ring population of <b>Little</b> <b>bustards</b> has remained relatively stable over the past ten years at around 1000 individuals (max. 1283 in Dec. 1982. Amongst the waders on passage unusually high numbers of Marsh sandpipers, up to 15 - 16 together, have been recorde deach autumn. a Terek sandpiper was shot locally in Sept. 1983 and there are two further May records of Wilson's phalarope, a species now observed almost annually. The 1982 census of breeding laro-limicolae revealed 26 pairs of Slenderbilled gulls but these failed to raise any chicks. In 1983, however, a similar number of pairs raised 60 young, by far the most successful season on record for this species. Mediterranean gulls also had two good seasons with a record 13 pairs in 1982 and 14 young raised in 1983 by 5 - 6 pairs (incomplete census). Whiskered terns, on the other hand, did not breed in 1982 and failed in their attempt in 1983 (200 + pairs). Amongst the passerines a Desert wheatear was recorded in the Crau in February 1983. This bird, the second recorded from the Crau in 3 years, has been accepted by the rareties committee. Finally, an event which has either been overlooked in the past or is a new development, is the importance of a Carrion crow roost near Le Sambuc where 950 were recorded in December 198...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{smallest}} Palearctic bustard, the <b>little</b> <b>bustard</b> is still pheasant-sized at 42 - 45 cm long with a 90 - 110 cm wingspan and a weight of 830 g.
