25|$|Throughout human history, {{intentional}} {{application of}} poison {{has been used}} as a method of murder, pest-control, suicide, and execution. As a method of execution, poison has been ingested, as the ancient Athenians did (see Socrates), inhaled, as with carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide (see gas chamber), or injected (see lethal injection). Poison's <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> can be combined with its allegedly magical powers; an example is the Chinese gu poison. Poison was also employed in gunpowder warfare. For example, the 14th-century Chinese text of the Huolongjing written by Jiao Yu outlined the use of a poisonous gunpowder mixture to fill cast iron grenade bombs.|$|E
25|$|This complex apparatus, {{including}} the barbs on the sting, {{is thought to}} have evolved specifically in response to predation by vertebrates, as the barbs do not usually function (and the sting apparatus does not detach) unless the sting is embedded in fleshy tissue. While the sting can also penetrate the membranes between joints in the exoskeleton of other insects (and is used in fights between queens), in the case of Apis cerana japonica, defense against larger insects such as predatory wasps (e.g. Asian giant hornet) is usually performed by surrounding the intruder with a mass of defending worker bees, which vibrate their muscles vigorously to raise the temperature of the intruder to a lethal level ("balling"). Previously, heat alone was thought to be responsible for killing intruding wasps, but recent experiments have demonstrated the increased temperature in combination with increased carbon dioxide levels within the ball produce the <b>lethal</b> <b>effect.</b> This phenomenon is also used to kill a queen perceived as intruding or defective, an action known to beekeepers as 'balling the queen', named for the ball of bees formed.|$|E
25|$|The jō, {{like its}} larger sibling the Bō, {{was never an}} {{effective}} killing-weapon on the battlefield {{in comparison to the}} sword, spear, glaive and bow. Although the jō and most other staves could be used to <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> when thrust at vital points of the body, when faced with a fully armored opponent those vital points would in most cases be covered by armour-plating. As a result, there were very few ryu that were dedicated to the staff-arts in the warring era with other more effective weapons were available, but there are several ryu that include jō techniques in its system. One example is the jō-tradition found in the koryū art Tendō-ryū Naginatajutsu, founded in 1582. In Tendō-ryū, which uses the Naginata as the primary weapon, there are techniques with the jō that simulates a scenario where the naginata has been cut in two and the wielder has to defend himself with the staff-portion only. With the onset of peace with the start of the Edo-period (1603–1867), the conflicts with heavy armored warriors became a thing of the past. In this era, the jō art would come into its own against non-armored samurai, rōnin, bandits, and other opponents. It was extensively used to police the local clan domains.|$|E

25|$|Capt. Millett, Company E, {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity {{above and beyond}} the call of duty in action. While personally leading his company in an attack against a strongly held position he noted that the 1st Platoon was pinned down by small-arms, automatic, and antitank fire. Capt. Millett ordered the 3d Platoon forward, placed himself at the head of the 2 platoons, and, with fixed bayonet, led the assault up the fire-swept hill. In the fierce charge Capt. Millett bayoneted 2 enemy soldiers and boldly continued on, throwing grenades, clubbing and bayoneting the enemy, while urging his men forward by shouting encouragement. Despite vicious opposing fire, the whirlwind hand-to-hand assault carried to the crest of the hill. His dauntless leadership and personal courage so inspired his men that they stormed into the hostile position and used their bayonets with such <b>lethal</b> <b>effect</b> that the enemy fled in wild disorder. During this fierce onslaught Capt. Millett was wounded by grenade fragments but refused evacuation until the objective was taken and firmly secured. The superb leadership, conspicuous courage, and consummate devotion to duty demonstrated by Capt. Millett were directly responsible for the successful accomplishment of a hazardous mission and reflect the highest credit on himself and the heroic traditions of the military service.|$|E
500|$|Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air {{in an air}} separation unit using the methods of liquefaction of gases and fractional distillation. Helium is sourced from natural gas fields which have high concentrations of helium in the natural gas, using cryogenic gas separation techniques, and radon is usually isolated from the radioactive decay of dissolved radium, thorium, or uranium compounds (since those compounds give off alpha particles).

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Rybicki et al.

Nevertheless, sub <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> of terbutryn on grazers cannot be excluded. Different studies reported sub <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> of terbutryn and other triazine herbicides, e.g., on physiological or behavioural endpoints in vertebrates and invertebrates at very low concentrations [57, 63].

Iron, copper, cysteine, ascorbic acid, and versene counteracted the <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> of alpha toxin in mice, while magnesium, manganese, zinc, and citrate did not. Iron also counteracted the <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> of diphtheria toxin in guinea pigs. After incubation of endotoxin with iron, its <b>lethal</b> <b>effects</b> and tissue-necrotizing actions in rabbits were counteracted. However, the pyrogenic properties of the toxin were not affected. The solubilities of perfringens alpha toxin and diphtheria toxin were markedly reduced after incubation with detoxifying metals, and resolubilization of these toxins with chelators resulted in partial restoration of toxicity. Addition of versene to detoxified endotoxin also resulted in partial recovery of lethal effectiveness. The inactivation of bacterial toxins by iron under in vitro conditions is not specific to this metal, is a reversible process, and {{may be due to}} desolubilization, reduction, or to competition by the metal for sites on the toxin normally bound by other cations in vivo. Although no evidence is presented in this paper to support the view that there is a relationship between the inactivation of endotoxin and the storage iron in the reticuloendothelial system of shocked animals, the observation of an in vitro inactivation of endotoxin by inorganic iron warrants consideration of such a mechanism...|$|R
