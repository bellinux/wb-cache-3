5|$|The {{effect of}} declining {{interest}} rates, combined with excess liquidity continually {{provided by the}} ECB, {{made it easier for}} banks within the countries in which interest rates fell the most, and their linked sovereigns, to borrow significant amounts (above the 3% of GDP budget deficit imposed on the eurozone initially) and significantly inflate their public and private debt levels. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, governments in these countries found it necessary to bail out or nationalise their privately held banks to prevent systemic failure of the banking system when underlying hard or financial asset values were found to be grossly inflated and sometimes so near worthless there was no <b>liquid</b> <b>market</b> for them. This further increased the already high levels of public debt to a level the markets began to consider unsustainable, via increasing government bond interest rates, producing the ongoing European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{secondary}} {{mortgage market}} is the market where a network of lenders sell, and investors buy, existing mortgages or MBS.

2500|$|Like most fantasy sports games, {{the core}} {{elements}} of RotoHog's flagship stock exchange game involve building {{a team and}} setting a line-up to earning points. To this traditional core game, RotoHog adds a <b>liquid</b> <b>market</b> for players that all team managers use to trade players. Players can be traded at almost any time and player prices reflect up-to-the minute supply and demand. [...] This trading system removes {{many of the problems}} with unfair trades or collusion between managers that can occur in traditional fantasy games.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to measure how often naked short selling occurs. Fails to deliver are not necessarily indicative of naked shorting, and can result from both [...] "long" [...] transactions (stock purchases) and short sales. [...] Naked shorting can be invisible in a <b>liquid</b> <b>market,</b> {{as long as the}} short sale is eventually delivered to the buyer. However, if the covers are impossible to find, the trades fail. Fail reports are published regularly by the SEC, and a sudden {{rise in the number of}} fails-to-deliver will alert the SEC to the possibility of naked short selling. In some recent cases, it was claimed that the daily activity was larger than all of the available shares, which would normally be unlikely.|$|E

5000|$|Liquidity - The {{liquidity}} of {{a market}} affects the performance of scalping. Each product within the market receives different spread, due to popularity differentials. The more liquid the markets and the products are, the tighter the spreads are. Some scalpers like to trade in a more <b>liquid</b> <b>market</b> since they can move in and out of large positions easily without adverse market impact. Other scalpers like to trade in less liquid markets, which typically have significantly larger bid-ask spreads. Whereas a scalper in a highly <b>liquid</b> <b>market</b> (for example, a market maintaining a one-penny spread) may take 10,000 shares to make a 3 cent gain ($300), a scalper in an illiquid market (for example, a market with a 25 cent spread) may take 500 shares for a 60 cent gain ($300). While there is theoretically more profit potential in a <b>liquid</b> <b>market,</b> it is also a [...] "poker game" [...] with many more professional players which can {{make it more difficult to}} anticipate future price action.|$|E

5000|$|A recent {{development}} in theory explains various mechanisms {{which led to}} enhanced initial effects of a flight-to-quality pattern.

50|$|In {{the futures}} markets, {{there is no}} {{assurance}} that a <b>liquid</b> <b>market</b> may exist for offsetting a commodity contract at all times. Some future contracts and specific delivery months tend to have increasingly more trading activity and have higher liquidity than others.

40|$|This paper uses cluster analysis, {{a multivariate}} {{statistical}} technique to classify emerging stock markets that have similarities into different groups. A {{number of key}} market data such as number listed companies, market capitalization, trading volume, turnover ratio, percentage change in price index, price-earnings (P/E) ratio, and market value-to-book value ratio are used. Analyses showed {{that the most important}} factors in grouping are market capitalization, trading volume, and turnover ratio. In addition to that, investable emerging markets and developed markets are clustered to see whether the same distinction is still valid in terms of market data. Analyses revealed that this distinction disappeared when the market data were taken into account. Based on these results, it is more appropriate to classify stock markets as large, medium or small markets; <b>liquid</b> <b>markets,</b> moderately <b>liquid</b> <b>markets</b> or illiquid markets as opposed to developed or emerging markets.
