40|$|Keywords: Language <b>Learning</b> <b>Strategies,</b> Academic Major English is a {{compulsory}} subject {{in high school}} in Indonesia. Therefore, high school students should know and manage their <b>strategies</b> in <b>learning</b> English. For students in senior high school, their strategies should be suitable with their major because different major may influence the strategies applied. This present study is aimed at investigating the <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> of science and social students of SMA Brawijaya Smart School and the correlation between the academic major and language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies.</b> The approach used is quantitative study. The participants of this study were 113 students consisting of 71 science and 42 social students. The survey comprised an individual background questionnaire and Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL) adopted from Oxford (1990). This study reveals that the students moderately employs the six categories of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> in their <b>learning</b> process. This finding can be measured by the overall language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> which fall into medium level. The result shows that metacognitive strategies are the most frequently used by the students whereas affective strategies are the lowest frequently used. Although there are differences in the mean score for the overall language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> used by science and social students, the T- test result shows that there is no significant difference in language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> applied by science and social students. In addition, Chi-square result shows that there is no significant correlation between different academic major and the choice of language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies.</b> In conclusion, science students apply language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> more than social student and the strategies mostly applied from overall language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> is metacognitive strategies. Also, there is no significant correlation between academic major and language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies.</b> Hence, in choosing the efficient strategies it is suggested that the learners apply appropriate language <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> based on student 2 ̆ 7 s respective goals...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{is one of}} the English {{skills that}} must be {{mastered}} by Senior High School students, but they seem not interested in writing. English learners need to master writing skill because they are required to produce written works for example a report, descriptive, narrative, argumentative, biography essays and others in the class or assignments. Unfortunately, many students get difficulties in writing, and the studentsÂ’ learning outcomes have not been satisfying. Consequently, they cannot write a good paragraph especially in analytical exposition. In relation to this, <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> are needed to help students understand the material easily. This research is concerned with the kinds of the <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> used by students, the reasons why do the students prefer to use their <b>learning</b> <b>strategies,</b> and the problems that the studentsÂ’ face in using their <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> at Social Department of SMA Negeri 1 Turen. This research used a descriptive quantitative research design because this research aimed to give the description about the <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> used by the students in writing activities. The subjects of this study were 38 students of XI Social 3 at SMA Negeri 1 Turen. To collect the data of this study, the researcher used a Likert Scale, documentation and interview. The result of this study showed that the XI grade of Social DepartmentÂ’s students used the various <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> to support and improve their learning process especially in learning analytical exposition. Those <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> were memory strategies, cognitive strategies, compensation strategies, metacognitive strategies, affective strategies and social strategies. Furthermore, their reasons in using <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> were: (1) <b>Learning</b> <b>strategies</b> increased the studentsÂ’ learning discipline; (2) <b>Learning</b> <b>strategies</b> helped the students achieve their goal; (3) <b>Learning</b> <b>strategies</b> helped the students know their strength and weakness; (4) <b>Learning</b> <b>strategies</b> helped the students improve their problem-solving skill.

Goal orientation questionnaire (Button, Mathieu and Zajac, 1996) and <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> questionnaire (Pintrich and Degroot, 1990) and academic stress questionnaire (Gadzella, 1991) were used as the research instrument. Finding show that there was a positive meaningful relationship between learning goal orientation with <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> (cognitive and met cognitive) and academic stress. Also there was negative meaningful correlation between performance goal orientation and <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> (cognitive and Meta cognitive). These finding also reveals that <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> (cognitive and Meta cognitive) have negative meaningful correlation with academic stress.

40|$|In my {{assignment}} I {{tried to}} {{present on the}} one hand the characteristics of stress and its relation to test anxiety {{and on the other hand}} <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and their effectiveness. The main theme of research are the relations between <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and test anxiety. Therefore I tried to find statistically important differences between them. Apart from the main issue, the relations between <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and test anxiety, we were also interested in the differences in the use of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and test anxiety by gender and age of the students. The section study was empirical. For this study we did not have to make any experiments, it was based on descriptive method. The study was therefore descriptive and non-experimental. With the questionnaire I determined the main <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> of the students and their level of test anxiety. The questionnaire required from the students an indication of " 1 " to " 5 ", with " 1 " indicating the minimum agreement with the statement and " 5 " indicating the highest agreement with the statement. The sample included boys and girls in sixth and ninth grade. <b>Learning</b> <b>strategies</b> are divided into eight groups and are analyzed according to the types of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> of the students. I made the analysis with the help of the SPSS program for data processing and I compared the differences with t-test for independent samples. I determined the correlation coefficient and identified the differences with the χ ² test. Analysis of the questionnaires shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between the effectiveness of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and test anxiety. This correlation is negative. Students, who use more effective <b>learning</b> <b>strategies,</b> show lower test anxiety and students, who use less efficient <b>learning</b> <b>strategies,</b> show higher test anxiety. The differences in test anxiety and the differences in the use of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> between gender could not be proved. The differences between the test anxiety between the classes are statistically insignificant and the differences in the use of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> between the classes are statistically significant. We proved that sixth grade students use more effective <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> as the ninth grade students. To conclude, the age of the student has much greater impact on the use of <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and the level of shown test anxiety as does the gender. Also, we have proved that there are statistically significant differences in the shown test anxiety among students with more efficient than among students with less effective <b>learning</b> <b>strategies.</b> Students, teachers and parents must be able to identify test anxiety and be aware of the fact that it can be reduced. We also want to bring the use of more effective <b>learning</b> <b>strategies</b> and the awareness of their importance to the scools. ...|$|R
