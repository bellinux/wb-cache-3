Another important research centre is the Paul Scherrer Institute. Notable inventions include <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD), diazepam (Valium), the scanning tunnelling microscope (Nobel prize) and Velcro. Some technologies enabled the exploration of new worlds such as the pressurised balloon of Auguste Piccard and the Bathyscaphe which permitted Jacques Piccard to reach the deepest point of the world's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Ken Quesada (Kevin Dunn) {{immediately}} {{sets up a}} {{press conference}} and assigns Martin responsibility over the briefing session for the following day. Rustin continues the investigation at a bar that evening and asks two prostitutes—Anette (Charleigh Harmon) and Lucy (Alyshia Ochse)—about any disappearances, but to no avail. By the next morning, there were several breakthroughs in the investigation: the body had been successfully identified as 28-year-old Dora Lange; an autopsy revealed she had been strangled, tortured, and possibly raped; and early toxicology reports found traces of <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> and methamphetamine in her bloodstream. Martin, Rustin, and Quesada brief their colleagues with the new evidence.|$|E

The aerosol spray would be of a chemical producing reactions {{similar to those of}} <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid,</b> or LSD. Nothing came of this plot, because the chemical in question was unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Many {{secondary}} metabolites from endophyte-plant interactions {{have also}} been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions. The toxic properties of ergot alkaloids also make them useful {{in the treatment of}} headaches and throughout the process of giving birth by inducing contractions and stemming hemorrhages. Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of ergot toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. Ergotamine has also been used to synthesize <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide because of its chemical similarity to <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid.</b> The generally chemically-based defense properties of endophytic fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and streptomycin and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s, Woodward {{synthesized}} many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid,</b> reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward {{opened up a}} new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.|$|E
25|$|The multiple-step {{synthesis}} of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis. Total {{synthesis of}} complex natural compounds increased in complexity to glucose and terpineol. For example, cholesterol-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives. Since {{the start of}} the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> and vitamin B12.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced {{hallucinations}} {{are caused}} by the consumption of psychoactive substances such as deliriants, psychedelics, and certain stimulants, which are known to cause visual and auditory hallucinations. Some psychedelics such as <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide and psilocybin can cause hallucinations that range from a spectrum of mild to severe. Some of these drugs {{can be used in}} psychotherapy to treat mental disorders, addiction, anxiety, and secondary to advanced stage cancers.|$|E
25|$|League for Spiritual Discovery (LSD) was {{a spiritual}} {{organization}} {{inspired by the}} works of Timothy Leary, and strove for legal use of <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD) {{for the purpose of}} meditation, insight, and spiritual understanding. It was in existence during the mid-to-late 1960s, and eventually closed by Leary. The New York Center for the League of Spiritual Discovery, in existence for around a year, was co-founded by Timothy Leary and Nina Graboi in 1966. The center was the first LSD-based meditation center in Manhattan.|$|E
25|$|HyperCard {{was created}} by Bill Atkinson {{following}} an <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD) trip. Work for it began in March 1985 {{under the name of}} WildCard (hence its creator code of 'WILD'). In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on HyperTalk and the name was changed to HyperCard for trademark reasons. It was initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the MacWorld Conference & Expo in Boston, Massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity.|$|E
25|$|Stanislav Grof, on {{the other}} hand, {{operates}} with a cartography consisting of three kinds of territories: {{the realm of the}} sensory barrier and the personal unconscious (described by psychoanalysis), the perinatal or birth-related realm (organizing principles for the psyche), and the transpersonal realm. According to this view proper engagement with the first two realms sets the stage for an ascent to the third, transpersonal, realm. His early therapy, and research, was carried out with the aid of psychedelic substances such as <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline, dipropyl-tryptamine (DPT), and methylene-dioxy-amphetamine (MDA). Later, when LSD was prohibited, Grof developed other methods of therapy, such as holotropic breathwork.|$|E

"It's All Too Much" [...] {{reflects}} George Harrison's {{experimentation with}} the hallucinogenic drug <b>Lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide, {{commonly known as}} LSD or [...] "acid". Author Robert Rodriguez describes the track as [...] "gloriously celebratory", with a lyric that conveys [...] "his acid revelations in a childlike way". Rather than the song being purely drug-related, Harrison states in his 1980 autobiography, I, Me, Mine, that the [...] "realisations" [...] brought about by his LSD experiences were also applicable to meditation.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] in {{the early}} part of 1966, the year in which his songwriting matured in terms of subject matter and productivity. As a {{secondary}} composer to John Lennon and Paul McCartney in the Beatles, Harrison began to establish his own musical identity through his absorption in Indian culture, as well as the perspective he gained through his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD). According to author Gary Tillery, the song resulted from a [...] "creative surge" [...] that Harrison experienced at the start of 1966. During the same period, the Beatles had been afforded an unusually long time free of professional commitments due to their decision to turn down A Talent for Loving as their third film for United Artists. Harrison used this time to study the Indian sitar and, like Lennon, to explore philosophical issues in his songwriting while preparing to record the band's next album, Revolver.|$|E
500|$|While Roby and Schreiber {{assert that}} Hendrix first used LSD {{when he met}} Linda Keith in late 1966, {{according}} to the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek, the earliest that Hendrix {{is known to have}} taken it was in June 1967, while attending the Monterey Pop Festival. According to Hendrix biographer Charles Cross, the subject of drugs came up one evening in 1966 at Keith's New York apartment; when one of Keith's friends offered Hendrix acid, a street name for <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide, Hendrix asked for LSD instead, showing what Cross described as [...] "his naivete and his complete inexperience with psychedelics". Before that, Hendrix had only sporadically used drugs, with his experimentation limited to cannabis, hashish, amphetamines and occasionally cocaine. After 1967, he regularly smoked cannabis and hashish, and used LSD and amphetamines, particularly while touring. According to Cross, by {{the time of his death}} in September 1970, [...] "few stars were as closely associated with the drug culture as Jimi".|$|E
500|$|Some {{species such}} as the fly agaric and {{psilocybin}} mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These {{are the focus of}} academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric. The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The ergot fungi whose sclerotia appear as [...] "black grain" [...] in rye and other cereals are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway. The hallucinations caused by ergotism, with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft.

2500|$|Some of {{the strangest}} urban legends told are those about <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD), a potent {{psychedelic}} drug that gained popularity in several countries in the 1960s and 1970s, and experienced a brief resurgence {{in the mid to}} late 1990s before declining from 2000 onward. [...] The drug's relation to the 1960s counterculture was likely {{part of the reason for}} such legends.|$|E
2500|$|The term, which derives {{its name}} from <b>lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD), is {{sometimes}} deployed as a synonym of [...] "psychedelic rock", {{but it may also}} refer to a more musically intense subgenre or sibling to the psychedelic rock style. Acid rock distinguishes itself from other psychedelic styles by having a harder, louder, or heavier sound. Developing mainly from the American West Coast, acid rock did not focus on novelty recording effects or whimsicality as much as subsequent British psychedelia. Rather, American groups emphasized the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience.|$|E
2500|$|Along with Beatles bandmate John Lennon {{and their}} wives, George Harrison first took the hallucinogenic drug <b>Lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD) in April 1965, when a dentist friend {{slipped it into}} their after-dinner coffee. The {{heightened}} perception induced by the hallucinogen inspired both musicians in their subsequent work with the Beatles, notably on the albums Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and led directly to a shared interest in Eastern philosophical concepts and meditation. Harrison later said of the profound change he felt {{as a result of}} first taking the drug: [...] "I had such an overwhelming feeling of well-being, that there was a God, and I could see him in every blade of grass. It was like gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours. It changed me, {{and there was no way}} back to what I was before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that ergotism could explain cases of bewitchment has {{been subject to}} debate and has been criticized by several scholars. Within a year of Caporael's article, historians Spanos and Gottlieb argued against the idea in the same journal. In Spanos and Gottlieb's rebuttal to Caporael's article, they concluded that there are several flaws in the explanation. For example, they argued that, if the food supply was contaminated, the symptoms would have occurred by household, not individual. However, historian Leon Harrier said that even if supplies were properly cooked, residents suffering from stomach ulcers had a risk of absorbing the toxin through the stomach lining, offering a direct route to the bloodstream. Being similar to <b>Lysergic</b> <b>acid</b> diethylamide (LSD), ergot would not survive in the acidic environment of a typical human's stomach, especially in properly cooked food. [...] But if some but not all residents were malnourished and suffering from bleeding stomach ulcers, only they could be affected by ingesting contaminated grains, leaving the majority unaffected, explaining why ergotism was not previously recognized. [...] Harrier argued that the numbers could have been larger, possibly including the entire town, but due to the trials on bewitchment and heresy, {{and the fear of}} being accused and subsequently executed, few could come forward while suffering from legitimate medical conditions.|$|E
