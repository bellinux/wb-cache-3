5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or the <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has}} been ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> other hardware.|$|E
