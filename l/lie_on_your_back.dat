60|$|In {{the night}} the eyes are partly closed or retire into the head. Other senses take the lead. The walker is guided as well by the sense of smell. Every plant and field and forest emits its odor now, swamp-pink in the meadow and tansy in the road; {{and there is the}} {{peculiar}} dry scent of corn which has begun to show its tassels. The senses both of hearing and smelling are more alert. We hear the tinkling of rills which we never detected before. From time to time, high up on the sides of hills, you pass through a stratum of warm air. A blast which has come up from the sultry plains of noon. It tells of the day, of sunny noon-tide hours and banks, of the laborer wiping his brow and the bee humming amid flowers. It is an air in which work has been done,--which men have breathed. It circulates about from wood-side to hill-side like a dog that has lost its master, now that the sun is gone. The rocks retain all night the warmth of the sun which they have absorbed. And so does the sand. If you dig a few inches into it you find a warm bed. You <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> on a rock in a pasture on the top of some bare hill at midnight, and speculate on the height of the starry canopy. The stars are the jewels of the night, and perchance surpass anything which day has to show. A companion with whom I was sailing one very windy but bright moonlight night, when the stars were few and faint, thought that a man could get along with them,--though he was considerably reduced in his circumstances,--that they were a kind of bread and cheese that never failed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To discuss {{artificial}} insemination <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> {{after the surgery}} time and to obtain ideal pregnancy outcome. Methods: Thisstudy retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing for pure {{artificial insemination}} in in Renji Hospital,Shanghai Jiao Tong University School, during 2012 - 2013. According to different patients after artificial insemination lie low time into three groups，D 30 min group: 102 cases, D 45 min groups: 120 cases, D 60 min groups: 86 cases, comparison of three groups of ages,basal FSH, surgery date intrauterine membrane thickness, statistical analysis of three groups of clinical pregnancy rate, early abortion rate and live-birth rate {{if there is a}} difference. Results: Three groups of ages, basal FSH, surgery date intrauterine membrane thickness were of no statistical difference. D 30 min group, the clinical pregnancy rate was 19. 6 %, early abortion rate was 5 %, the live birth rate was 18. 6 %. D 45 min groups, the clinical pregnancy rate was 19. 2 %, the early abortion rate was 4. 3 %, the live birth rate was 18. 3 %. D 60 min groups,the clinical pregnancy rate was 19. 8 %, the early abortion rate was 0 %,the live birth rate was 19. 8 %. P > 0. 05, found no statistical differences. Conclusion: Patients lie long does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate since the implementation of artificial insemination postoperatively. Lying down for 30 minutes enables the patients to achieve ideal artificial insemination pregnancy effect.  </p...|$|E

5000|$|Ween {{embarked}} on a brief West Coast tour {{at the beginning of}} 2011. The first show of the tour, January 24 at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver, British Columbia, was a turning point in Ween's history. It was noticeable from the start that something was off with Freeman, who played the tambourine off-beat on the first song, [...] "Fiesta". His vocals were off-key throughout the night, and he appeared to be heavily intoxicated. Eventually, Freeman lay down on stage {{while the rest of the}} band played an instrumental, jam version of the Carpenters song [...] "Superstar". As Freeman began tuning his guitar in preparation for [...] "Birthday Boy", Melchiondo and Dreiwitz walked off the stage, while Coleman and McClelland switched instruments. After [...] "Birthday Boy" [...] was finished, Coleman and McClelland left Freeman to play the final four songs by himself and horribly off-key. Despite this disaster, the band performed in Seattle, Washington, the following night with no issues. Freeman later wrote a song about the Vancouver incident, [...] "Covert Discretion", which appeared as the opening track to self-titled debut album, by his new band, called Freeman, in 2014. That same year, he commented, [...] "You don't blow it <b>on</b> stage, <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> screaming nonsense in front of 5,000 people and not try to change something. Chances are when you're doing something like that, you've got to do something differently." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Vincent Di Maio, a {{forensic}} pathologist and gunshot wound expert, testified that Martin's gunshot wound {{was consistent with}} Zimmerman's story that Martin {{was on top of}} him and leaning over him when he was shot. The gunshot evidence indicated that Martin's clothing was from two to four inches from his body when he was shot, Di Maio said, [...] "If you lean over someone, you notice the clothing tends to fall away from the chest, if instead you're <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and someone shoots you, the clothing is going to be against your chest." [...] Di Maio said he had examined photographs and the autopsy and toxicology reports and concluded that the evidence was consistent with Zimmerman's statements to police. Di Maio testified the path of the bullet ran from Martin's left side through part of his heart and into a portion of the right lung. Di Maio stated, [...] "The medical evidence...is consistent with his Zimmerman's statement." [...] Di Maio also testified that Zimmerman had at least six injuries from the struggle: two head lacerations, two wounds to his temples and wounds on his nose and forehead. Di Maio said those injuries were consistent with Zimmerman having his head banged into a sidewalk, and that such injuries can be dangerous. Di Maio stated it's possible to receive trauma without visible wounds, testifying that, [...] "You can get severe trauma to the head without external injuries, actually." [...] Di Maio said Zimmerman's nose may have been fractured, which was consistent with Zimmerman being punched in the nose.|$|R
40|$|These oral {{appliances}} {{hold your}} tongue in place {{so that your}} airway stays open while you sleep. They look like the mouth guards used by athletes to protect their teeth. Oral appliances are placed into your mouth at night, {{before you go to}} bed. The appliance is worn for the entire time you are sleeping. (There is no need to wear it during the day.) How do oral appliances work? Oral appliances work by pushing or pulling your lower jaw forward. By doing this, your tongue is in a position that does not block your airway. This reduces the risk that the airway may vibrate (heard as a snoring sound) or your tongue may obstruct your airway during sleep. If this device is helping you, the sound of snoring should be gone entirely or lessened. How effective are oral appliances? As with all treatments, not everyone gets the same benefit from oral appliances. For some, the obstructive sleep apnea and snoring go away completely, while for other people, other forms of treatment are needed. Oral appliances are more likely to work if you have mild or moderate sleep apnea. If your sleep apnea gets better when you lie on your side (compared to when you <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back)</b> and if you are not overweight, you {{are also more likely to}} benefit from this appliance. If you have central sleep apnea (a less common condition than obstructive sleep apnea), then oral appliances are unlikely to be helpful. Until you have been properly fitted for an oral appliance and tried it, no one can know how well it will work for you. Oral appliances are devices that can be used to treat mild or moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea, as well a...|$|E
6000|$|... 4. Consider, What {{conviction}} of thy goodness can {{the actions that}} flow from such a spirit give unto observers? None at all; yea, a spirit of unquietness under sufferings, and that seeketh to be revenged of those that do, for thy faith and the profession thereof, persecute thee, is so far off of giving conviction to beholders that thou art right, that it plainly tells them that thou art wrong. Even Julian the apostate, when he had cast away whatever he could of Christ, had this remaining with him--that a Christian ought to take with patience what affliction fell upon him for his Master's sake; and would hit them in the teeth with an unbecoming behavior, that complained or that sought redress of them that had abused them for their faith and godly profession. What will men say if you shrink and winch, and take your sufferings unquietly, but that if you yourselves were uppermost, you would persecute also? Much more have they ground to say so, when you will fight <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>backs.</b> Be quiet, then, and if thine enemy strike thee on one check, turn to him the other; and if he also revile and curse thee, down upon thy knees and pray for him. This {{is the way to}} convince thy observers that thou art a godly man. Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do, {{was one of those things}} that convinced the centurion that Jesus was a righteous man; for he stood by the cross to watch and see how Jesus carried it in these his sufferings, as well as to see execution done (Matt 27:54; Luke 23:34-47).|$|R
5000|$|The Sit-Up: [...] "The sit-up event {{measures}} the endurance of the abdominal and hip-flexor muscles. On the command [...] "get set," [...] assume {{the starting position}} by <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> with <b>your</b> knees bent at a 45- degree angle. Your feet may be together or up to 12 inches apart. Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized. The heel is {{the only part of}} your foot that must stay in contact with the ground. Your fingers must be interlocked behind your head and the <b>backs</b> of <b>your</b> hands must touch the ground. Your arms and elbows need not touch the ground. On the command [...] "go," [...] begin raising your upper body forward to, or beyond, the vertical position. The vertical position means that the base of your neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and raise <b>your</b> buttocks off the ground to raise your upper body, or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|R

They’re lucky, shipping out in 23 days. I think we’ll ship very soon, but first we have to be classified. You see hon, they now classify us as pilot, navigator, or bombardier in Basic Training, instead of after college, as Ace will. All men who came in after October 15 are under this new plan. There is a slim change that we might ship out and be classified after college. I got a letter from Bobby. I’m awfully sorry to hear that Ricky has a cold, make him get better for me, sweetheart. He sure is a cute little fellow. I’d like a picture of him, Bobby and ace. How’s Ken. I miss him like the devil. He’s powerful cute too. I think I have a pretty swell family, all in all.

60|$|It {{was a funny}} bath. We {{could not}} sink. One could stretch himself at full length on his back, with his arms on his breast, {{and all of his}} body above a line drawn {{from the corner of his}} jaw past the middle of his side, the middle of his leg and through his ancle bone, would remain out of water. He could lift his head clear out, if he chose. No {{position}} can be retained long; you lose your balance and whirl over, first <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and then <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face, and so <b>on.</b> You can <b>lie</b> comfortably, <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back,</b> with <b>your</b> head out, and your legs out from your knees down, by steadying yourself with your hands. You can sit, with your knees drawn up to your chin and your arms clasped around them, but you are bound to turn over presently, because you are top-heavy in that position. You can stand up straight in water that is over your head, and from the middle of your breast upward you will not be wet. But you can not remain so. The water will soon float your feet to the surface. You can not swim <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> and make any progress of any consequence, because your feet stick away above the surface, and there is nothing to propel yourself with but your heels. If you swim <b>on</b> <b>your</b> face, you kick up the water like a stern-wheel boat. You make no headway. A horse is so top-heavy that he can neither swim nor stand up in the Dead Sea. He turns over on his side at once. Some of us bathed for more than an hour, and then came out coated with salt till we shone like icicles. We scrubbed it off with a coarse towel and rode off with a splendid brand-new smell, though it was one which was not any more disagreeable than those we have been for several weeks enjoying. It was the variegated villainy and novelty of it that charmed us. Salt crystals glitter in the sun about the shores of the lake. In places they coat the ground like a brilliant crust of ice.|$|R
