5|$|In 2010, {{thousands}} of people were inadvertently exposed to lead containing soil / ore from informal gold mining with the northern state of Zamfara. While estimates vary, it is though that upwards of 400 children died of acute <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> making this perhaps the largest <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> fatality epidemic ever encountered. As of 2016, efforts to manage the exposure are ongoing.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> shares {{symptoms}} {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral gastroenteritis in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|The main tool in {{diagnosing}} {{and assessing}} {{the severity of}} <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> is laboratory analysis of the blood lead level (BLL).|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning,</b> severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E

5|$|In most cases, <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> is {{preventable}} {{by avoiding}} exposure to lead.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. <b>Lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The {{results of this}} study from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones from some of the crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning,</b> killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E

5|$|The {{critically}} endangered California condor {{has also}} been affected by <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning.</b> As scavengers, condors eat carcasses of game that have been shot but not retrieved, and with them the fragments from lead bullets; this increases their lead levels. Among condors around the Grand Canyon, <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> due to eating lead shot is the most frequently diagnosed cause of death. In an effort to protect this species, in areas designated as the California condor's range the use of projectiles containing lead has been banned to hunt deer, feral pigs, elk, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, ground squirrels, and other non-game wildlife. Also, conservation programs exist which routinely capture condors, check their blood lead levels, and treat cases of poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{treatment for}} California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back to the zoo to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> at the zoo as of March 2010.|$|E
5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> became {{common in}} the work setting. The {{introduction}} of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E

5|$|After antiquity, {{mention of}} <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> was absent from medical {{literature}} {{until the end}} of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized dust and fumes containing lead compounds as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that were known to afflict miners, smelter workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of <b>lead</b> <b>poisoning</b> in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain.
