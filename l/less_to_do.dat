5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the game itself and more with {{being a part of}} the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers and won two awards at the 2010 GDC Independent Games Festival. Reviewers praised the cooperative gameplay highly {{but said that}} the single-player was less fun because there was <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Many comparisons were made between Monaco and other media; the most common being the 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Reviewers liked the art style {{and said that the}} gameplay suited the minimalistic design.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from arcus, meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E

Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war. A derivative form of the California Sound was later classified as sunshine pop.|$|E
25|$|Training of {{the camel}} corps had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Egyptian camel drivers who were often {{familiar}} with camel care and control, being mainly {{concerned with the}} problems the Australian and British officers and NCOs, who had transferred from the Army Service Corps and other AIF units, had {{in dealing with the}} animals. During this time, {{one or more of these}} men were regularly sent to hospitals with camel bites. Of the Australians, 49 were eventually commissioned and six became company commanders, so the Anzac and Imperial/Australian Mounted Divisions had a strong national component in their supporting camel transport.|$|E

In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG.|$|E
25|$|Another example are {{historical}} role-playing sims such as 1880s Victorian London and The 1920s Berlin Project. While only {{encouraged to}} do so in 1880s Victorian London, visitors to the 1920s Berlin Project are required to dress accurately as part of the history based immersive experience. Sims may incorporate rules that have <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with thematic realism, and more to do with adhering to community guidelines. For instance, one rule that is commonly seen is the prohibition or restriction of underage avatars in role-playing sims that feature sexual content; these rules are separate from Linden Labs' sim restrictions, as they restrict underage characters played by adult players.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October 1856, freethinkers {{association}} De Dageraad ("The Dawn") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam by the editorial staff of the magazine, including Günst (publisher of De Dageraad) and the first chair Rudolf Charles d'Ablaing van Giessenburg (1826–1904). In total, 44 men joined the new society. There was no balloting, and partly due to d'Ablaing's sympathy towards feminism, it was during his chairmanship (1856–1865) that women were readily admitted. A similar association, De Lichtstraal ("The Lightbeam"), founded in 1855 by Goose Wijnand van der Voo in Rotterdam with 20 members and an identically named magazine, merged with De Dageraad in 1857. De Dageraad's character had less and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with freemasonry and, increasingly, focused on rationalism and the natural sciences.|$|E

To help interpret these interactions, we report the marginal effect of the socioeconomic/demographic variable separately for each country. In infancy, {{a greater number of}} selection effects, and larger ones, were found in the UK and the USA than in the Netherlands and Canada.

In early childhood, more and larger socioeconomic selection effects were found in the UK, the USA, and Canada than in the Netherlands and Norway.

25|$|The group's surf {{music was}} not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, {{previous}} surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did. Their early hits helped raise {{the profile of the}} state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. The California Sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness.

25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} {{was achieved}} in 1920, and early 20th century antifeminism was primarily focused on fighting this. Suffragists scoffed at antisuffragists. Anna Howard Shaw, {{president of the}} National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) from 1904 to 1915, presumed, perhaps unfairly, that the antisuffragists were merely working {{under the influence of}} male forces. Later historians tended to dismiss antisuffragists as subscribing to the model of domestic idealism, that a woman's place is in the home. This undermines and belittles the true power and numbers behind the antisuffrage movement, which was primarily led by women themselves. Arguments employed by antisuffragists {{at the turn of the}} century had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a woman's place in the home as much as it had to do with a woman's proper place in the public realm. In fact, leaders of the movement often encouraged other women to leave the home and participate in society. What they opposed was women participating in the political sphere.|$|E
25|$|John Maynard, born 1598, {{came over}} from England {{with his wife}} Elizabeth (Ashton) Maynard around 1635. Five generations later, Isaac Maynard was {{operating}} a mill in Marlborough. When he died in 1820 at age 41 his teenage son, Amory Maynard, took over the family business. The City of Boston bought Amory's water rights to Fort Meadow Pond in 1846. He partnered with William Knight to start up a woolen mill operation on the Assabet River. Amory and his wife Mary (Priest) Maynard had three sons: Lorenzo (1829-1904), William (1833-1906) and Harlan (1843-1861). Amory managed the mill from 1847-1885 (Knight retired in 1852). Lorenzo took over from 1885 to 1898. William had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the family business - he lived in Boston a while, then Maynard again, then off to Pasadena, California in 1885 for reasons of ill health (possibly tuberculosis). He recovered and moved back east to Worcester in 1888 {{for the remainder of}} his life. Harlan died at age 18.|$|E

25|$|On 19 August, the Amazigh {{towns of}} Nalut and Kabaw in the Nafusa Mountains {{announced}} {{a boycott of}} the House of Representatives, which they claimed was unconstitutional. The Nalut Municipal Council, along with Nalut's revolutionary brigades and civil society organisations called on Salem Ignan, the towns representative, {{to withdraw from the}} parliament, which they claimed had an obvious bias towards Haftar's Operation Dignity, as seen in {{the fact that it was}} based in Tobruk. The Kabaw town leadership claimed that they would not recognise any decisions made by the new parliament, and also that the towns representative, Ali Al-Asawi, did not, and had never, represented the town. Both towns in particular rejected the House's call for foreign intervention in Libya in response to the upsurge in violence. Despite the timing of the announcements, the boycotts were seen as having more to do with long standing Amazigh boycott of the parliament over the issue of Amazigh representation, and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the opposition to the parliament from Misrata and Islamist groups. It was immediately unclear whether the representatives from the towns would boycott the parliament.|$|E

500|$|A Marxist {{critique}} of Postan {{emerged from the}} 1950s onwards, captured in the academic journal Past & Present. This school of thought agreed that the agrarian economy was central to medieval England, but argued that agrarian issues had <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with demography than with the mode of production and feudal class relations. In this model the English economy entered {{the crisis of the}} early 14th century because of the struggles between landlords and peasant for resources and excessive extraction of rents by the nobility. Similar issues underpinned the Peasants Revolt of 1381 and later tax rebellions. Historians such as Frank Stenton developed the [...] "honour" [...] as a unit of economic analysis and a focus for understanding feudal relations in peasant communities; Rodney Hilton developed the idea of the rise of the gentry as a key feature for understanding the late medieval period.|$|E

She wore a costume {{that came to}} be known as the [...] "ACE-bandage" [...] costume; the body suit designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier was made of medical bandages. The Fifth Element was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million. The Fifth Element was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, [...] "Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and <b>less</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with dialogue". Jovovich was nominated for [...] "Favorite Female Newcomer" [...] at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and [...] "Best Fight" [...] at the MTV Movie Awards. The film inspired a video game and a planned Leeloo action figure, but the figure was never released due to licensing problems. In a 2003 interview, Jovovich said Leeloo was her favorite role.|$|E
