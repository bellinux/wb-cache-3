5000|$|Adaptive QoS routing is a cross-layer {{optimization}} {{adaptive routing}} mechanism. The cross-layer mechanism provides up-to-date local QoS {{information for the}} adaptive routing algorithm, by considering the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link performance. The multiple QoS requirements are satisfied by adaptively using forward error correction and multipath routing mechanisms, based on the current network status. The complete routing mechanism includes three parts: (1) a modified dynamic source routing algorithm that handles route discovery and the collection of QoS related parameters; (2) a local statistical computation and <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> function located in each node; and (3) an integrateddecision-making system to calculate the number of routing paths, coding parity length, and traffic distribution rates.|$|E
50|$|To {{implement}} {{an adaptive}} multipath routing scheme, three functions distributed {{in different parts}} of the network are needed. First, a modified dynamic source routing function is needed. It handles route discovery and collecting the local QoS-related information along the selectedroutes. Second, there is a local statistical computation and <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> function located in each node. This function is used to support the above routing function. It will manageand build the local routing information in each node, which includes a QoS-related table. The third function will be in charge of the final decision-making process. The adaptiverouting parameters are derived from the decision-making algorithm based on the QoS constraints. They are the number N of selected paths, parity length k of the FEC, code and the set {R} of the traffic distribution rates on each path. With these functions, adaptive multipath QoS routing is implemented.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Recently, overlay {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} to provide {{a significant portion of}} value-added applications, such as resilient overlay routing, content distribution, overlay multicasting. An important module of these overlay networks is to timely and efficiently monitor the overlay link (IP path) performance between each pair of overlay nodes. Although several work has been proposed to achieve scalable overlay <b>link</b> <b>monitoring,</b> they either use a centralized solution[1] or cannot provide accurate information [2]. A distributed overlay <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> technique called Monet is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed X-Set concept, each overlay node collaborates with a set of neighboring nodes (friend nodes) to determine the necessary overlay links to directly monitor. Whenever an overlay link performance query arrives, an overlay node can reply with accurate overlay link performance based on its local knowledge or by collaborating with its friend nodes. Monet can effectively reduce the overlay network monitoring overhead and deal with dynamic IP-layer path changes. Theoretical analysis and simulation results in terms of monitoring cost and querying overhead are also discussed in this paper. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The highly {{stochastic}} {{nature of}} wireless environments makes it desirable to <b>monitor</b> <b>link</b> loss rates in wireless sensor networks. In a wireless sensor network, <b>link</b> loss <b>monitoring</b> is particularly {{supported by the}} data aggregation communication paradigm of network traffic: the data collecting node can infer link loss rates on all links in the network by exploiting whether packets from various sensors are received, {{and there is no}} need to actively inject probing packets for inference purposes. In this paper, we present a low complexity algorithmic framework for <b>link</b> loss <b>monitoring</b> based on the recent modeling and computational methodology of factor graphs. The proposed algorithm iteratively updates the estimates of link losses upon receiving (or detecting the loss of) recently sent packets by the sensors. The algorithm exhibits good performance and scalability, and can be easily adapted to different statistical models of networking scenarios. In particular, due to its low complexity, the algorithm is particularly suitable as a long-term monitoring facility.

Someefficient solutions deploy robots based on active measurements. A robot/node in the network may use active <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> toassess the link quality towards its neighbors through the useof probe packets. Such probe packets are sent periodically at agiven rate, and so, the accuracy of the measurements depends onthe number and the frequency of exchanged packets.

Even so, active <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> is a technique widely used onmany network protocols. In this paper, we focus on an adaptivepositioning algorithm (APOLO) to self-deploy a network.

Moreover, it is possible to use surrogate data ratherthan real data to feed APOLO without impacting its performance...|$|E

In this pa-per we consider a simple wireless <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> method, {{which is based on}} counting positive and negative acknowledgments (ACKs and NACKs), and we investigate the class of adaptation policies that correspond to this method. The policy that maximizes the long-term throughput efficiency of a user is shown to be of threshold type. Due to inherent difficulties in realization of this policy, a suboptimal heuristic method to perform link adaptation is provided. Our results indicate a considerable improvement in link throughput under such adaptive techniques...|$|E

40|$|The {{monitoring}} and evaluation function provides for accountability {{and to some extent}} transparency and, therefore, governance. However, this function can only be effective if it is conceptually linked within development interventions and public policy. There is an explicit discussion of the middle-third tier (how to monitor and evaluate) as well as the bottom-third tier (data collection and storage, data processing and analysis, reporting results and findings, integrating results and findings into planning and implementation as well as overall decision making). Unfortunately, the top-third tier that <b>links</b> <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation within development interventions (the what) and public policy (the how) is implicit, if present. The discussions often point out that {{monitoring and}} evaluation is a management and decision-making tool but they omit or fail to link it to development interventions and public policy, leadership and governance. In this paper, we interrogate literature from a systems thinking perspective to derive a model that conceptually <b>links</b> the <b>monitoring</b> and evaluation function within development interventions and public policy. In doing so, we point out and link the five components (cultural, political, economic, social and environmental) and two processes (imminent and immanent) of development.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the design principles and the practical {{implementation of a}} routing management solution which takes into account statistical cross-layer Quality of Service information regarding {{the state of the}} network. <b>Link</b> <b>monitoring</b> and communication between neighboring nodes is realized by the routing management system, while the routing protocol deals with routing tables and packet forwarding. We propose two types of management entities: a) local management entity (LME) responsible for monitoring directly connected incoming links and detecting traffic changes and b) domain management entity (DME) which captures the global state of the network and informs routers to avoid congested areas. The goal is to offer physical layer information to the routing algorithm, i. e. the metrics will depend on the traffic load and the delay measured on individual links. By identifying congested areas and anomalies, we can ensure a situation-aware path selection, improving the global capacity of the network by determining optimal routes.

40|$|Changing network {{dynamics}} is {{a critical}} issue in many overlay networks especially in peer-topeer systems. Previously these network formations were approached in two ways. Firstly by implementing practical heuristics for cooperative peers, and later performing game theoretic analysis for selfish peers. Selfish Neighbor Selection (SNS) game theory is designed and implemented in overlay routing that unifies the aforementioned ways. SNS limits number of neighbors for each peer. This approach reduces <b>link</b> <b>monitoring</b> overhead in overlay networks from O(n 2) to O(n).
