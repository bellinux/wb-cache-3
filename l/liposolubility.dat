40|$|Vários complexos de ródio Rh 2 (L) 4 (L = acetato, propionato, butirato, trifluoroaceta-to e trifluoroacetamidato) ligam-se à albumina de soro humana (HSA) em relações mola-res de aproximadamente 8 : 1. Medidas de dicroísmo {{circular}} mostraram que os carboxila-tos mais lipossolúveis (butirato e trifluoroacetato) provocaram as maiores alterações na estrutura secundária da HSA. As constantes de Stern-Volmer para a supressão de fluo-rescência da HSA por esses complexos também foram maiores para os compostos mais lipofílicos. O amidato lipossolúvel, Rh 2 (tfc) 4, apresentou supressão intermediária e não provocou alterações estruturais. Isto mostra que é possível projetar metalofármacos anti-tumorais que se ligam a proteínas de transporte em grande quantidade, sem provocar al-terações estruturais importantes. Esses complexos tiveram também suas afinidades em relação à HSA determinadas por espectrofotometria, observando-se no caso dos alquil-carboxilatos uma correlação inversa com suas lipossolubilidades, o que sugere uma com-petição entre coordenação axial ao metal e interação hidrofóbica do ligante. A difusão dos complexos livres ou ligados à proteína para células de Ehrlich {{in vitro}} parece primordial-mente governada pelo caráter hidrofóbico do complexo. O complexo Rh 2 (tfc) 4 apresentou afinidade pela proteína (K = 214, 1), além de partição celular tanto em ausência (32, 1 %) como na presença (48, 6 %) de HSA. Desta forma, o composto HSA:Rh 2 (tfc) 4 teve sua a-ção antitumoral investigada em camundongos Balb-c portadores de ascite de Ehrlich, mostrando que a HSA pode ser um reservatório para o complexo de ródio. Various divalent rhodium complexes Rh 2 (L) 4 (L = acetate, propionate, butyrate, tri-fluoroacetate and trifluoroacetamidate) {{have been found}} to bind to non-defatted human serum albumin (HSA) at molar ratios about 8 : 1. The circular dichroism measurements showed that the more liposoluble carboxylates butyrate and trifluoroacetate caused the major alterations of the secondary structure of HSA. Stern-Volmer constants for the fluo-rescence quenching by these complexes were also higher for the lipophilic metal com-pounds. In the case of the rhodium carboxylates it was observed that their denaturating and quenching properties could be explained in terms of their liposolubilities: the higher their lipophilic characters, the higher their abilities to penetrate inside the protein frame-work leading to structural alterations, and the closer they could get to the Trp 214 residue causing fluorescence quenching. The liposoluble amidate complex Rh 2 (tfc) 4, presented an intermediate quenching and did not cause structural alterations in the protein, presumably not penetrating inside the peptidic backbone. This shows {{that it is possible to}} design new antitumor metal complexes which bind to a large extent to a transporter protein causing little structural damage. The affinities for human albumin of these five rhodium(II) comple-xes were determined by spectrophotometry.

The system aimed to address the limitations presented by conventional SEDDS as delivery carriers for drugs with poor water-solubility, low <b>liposolubility</b> and high dose. As an intermediate, SPC was first prepared based on the response surface design. The presence of amorphous scutellarin was demonstrated through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), while enhanced <b>liposolubility</b> was confirmed through comparison with scutellarin powder via an octanol/water distribution test. On {{the basis of the}} solubility study and ternary phase diagram, Super-SEDDS containing SPC of up to 200 % equilibrium solubility (Seq) was designed, which composed of ethyl oleate, Cremophor RH 40 and Transcutol HP with a ratio of 60 : 25 : 15 (w/w%). The subsequent in vitro lipolysis study and ex vivo intestinal absorption test indicated that Super-SEDDS enhanced the cumulative dissolution from 70 % to 100 % and improved the intestinal absorption from 0. 04 to 0. 12 µg/cm(2) compared with scutellarin powder. Furthermore, an in vivo study demonstrated that Super-SEDDS achieved the AUC 0 -t of scutellarin up to approximate 1. 7 -fold as scutellarin powder.

40|$|The obesity-induced kinetic {{changes have}} been studied only from twenty years, despite the {{frequency}} of such a pathological state; thus many work {{need to be done}} in this area. The tissular distribution of drugs may depend on the obesity-induced changes in the body composition taking into account the degree of drug <b>liposolubility.</b> Some other factors such as protein binding and regional blood flow may also be involved in tissular diffusion of drugs in obesity. Drug binding to albumin {{does not seem to be}} modified in obesity. On the contrary, the protein binding of some basic drugs is increased because of the rise of the plasma alpha 1 glycoprotein acid levels in obesity. Although the cardiac output and the total blood volume are increased in obese patients, the blood flow recalculated according to the adipose tissue weight, is less than in non obese subjects: this point could reduce the diffusion of some lipophilic drugs. More complex are the obesity induced changes in the hepatic clearance of drugs: some reactions such as oxydo-reduction and acetylation do not vary, some others such as sulfoconjugation or glucuronoconjugation are increased. The renal clearance is increased for drugs totally eliminated by glomerular filtration and for drugs which are both filtrated and secreted.

30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} to mention here sufentanil’s pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties and the regulated {{release of the}} sublingual formulation that contribute to Zalviso’s effectiveness.

30|$|We {{concluded}} that the following reasons might be involved. Firstly, the free MMC is cleared too rapidly, and thus, the low concentrations of drugs in the tumor tissues will result in suboptimal therapeutic effects[2]. On the contrary, the EPR effect and the sustained release of the nanoscaled drug delivery systems {{may result in a}} sufficient intracellular drug. Secondly, the nanoscaled drug delivery systems can help the loaded drug effectively enters the interior of cells by endocytosis. Lastly, the lipophilicity and <b>liposolubility</b> of SPC {{on the surface of the}} polymer-lipid hybrid NPs efficiently help the NPs transport from the surrounding water-soluble environment to the lipid-rich cell membrane and enter the internal environment of the cells, leading to the increased internalization and accumulation of drug inside the cells.

Moore. It has shown various pharmacological effects, such as antitumor activity, multidrug resistance reversal, and hepatic fibrosis resistance. In clinical applications, {{it has been used}} to treat hypertension, pneumosilicosis, and lung cancer. However, the poor water solubility of tetrandrine has limited its application. In this study, a newly emerging oral drug carrier of phospholipid complex loaded lipid nanocapsules was developed to improve the oral bioavailability of tetrandrine. Methods: The phospholipid complex was prepared with the solvent-evaporation method to enhance the <b>liposolubility</b> of tetrandrine. The formation of the phospholipid complex was confirmed with a solubility study, infrared spectroscopy, and a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The tetrandrine-phospholipid complex loaded lipid nanocapsules (TPC-LNCs) were prepared using the phase inversion method. Lyophilization was performed with mannitol (10 %) as a cryoprotectant. TPC-LNCs were characterized according to their particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, morphology by transmission electron microscopy, and crystallinity by DSC. In addition, the in vitro release of tetrandrine from TPC-LNCs was examined to potentially illustrate the in vivo release behavior. The in vivo bioavailability of TPC-LNCs was studied and compared to tetrandrine tablets in rats. Results: The <b>liposolubility</b> of tetrandrine in n-octanol improved from 8. 34 µg/mL to 35. 64 µg/mL in the tetrandrine-phospholipid complex. The prepared TPC-LNCs were spherical-shaped particles with a small size of 40 nm and a high encapsulation efficiency of 93. 9 %. DSC measurements revealed that the crystalline state was less ordered in lipid nanocapsules. The in vitro release study demonstrated a fast release of approximately 25 % in the first 1 hour, which was followed by a sustained release of 70 % over 12 hours. The relative bioavailability of TPC-LNCs compared to that of tablets was 208 %, indicating a significant improvement in the oral absorption of tetrandrine. Conclusion: The TPC-LNCs system developed in this study is a promising carrier that improves the oral bioavailability of tetrandrine in rats.

The spinal administration of an opioid drug does not guarantee selective action and segmental analgesia in the spine. Evidence from experimental studies in animals indicates that bioavailability in the spinal cord biophase is negatively correlated with <b>liposolubility,</b> and is higher for hydrophilic opioids, such as morphine, than lipophilic opioids, such as fentanyl, sufentanil and alfentanil. Epidural morphine sulphate has proven analgesic efficacy and superiority over systemically administered morphine for improving postoperative pain. However, pain relief after a single epidural injection of morphine could last less than 24 hours. Techniques used to administered and prolong opioid epidural analgesia, can be costly and inconvenient. Moreover, complications can arise from indwelling epidural catheterization, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants. Clinical trials have shown that epidural morphine in the form of extended-release liposome injections (EREM) gives good analgesia for a period of 48 hours, with no need for epidural catheterisation.

Results: Salicylate enhanced quinidine-induced tonic and phasic block of INa at a holding potential of − 100 mV but not at a holding potential of − 140 mV; this enhancement {{was accompanied by a}} shift of the h∞ curve in the presence of quinidine in a further hyperpolarized direction, although salicylate alone did not affect INa. Salicylate enhanced the tonic and phasic block of Vmax induced by quinidine, aprindine and disopyramide but had little effect on that induced by procainamide or mexiletine; the enhancing effects were related to the <b>liposolubility</b> of the drugs. Conclusions: Salicylate enhanced tonic and phasic block of Na+ channels induced by class 1 highly liposoluble antiarrhythmic agents.

Evidence from experimental studies in animals indicates that bioavailability in the spinal cord biophase is negatively correlated with <b>liposolubility,</b> and is higher for hydrophilic opioids, such as morphine, than lipophilic opioids, such as fentanyl, sufentanil and alfentanil. Epidural morphine sulphate has proven analgesic efficacy and superiority over systemically administered morphine for improving postoperative pain. However, pain relief after a single epidural injection of morphine could last less than 24 hours. Techniques used to administered and prolong opioid epidural analgesia, can be costly and inconvenient. Moreover, complications can arise from indwelling epidural catheterization, particularly in patients receiving anticoagulants. Clinical trials have shown that epidural morphine in the form of extended-release liposome injections (EREM) gives good analgesia for a period of 48 hours, with no need for epidural catheterisation. Intrathecal morphine produces intense analgesia for up to 24 hours with a single shot, and clinical recommendation is to choose the minimum effective dose and do not exceed 300 µg to prevent the delay respiratory depression. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{epidemiologic}} and interventional studies go to show that acute cerebral and cardiac events and chronic organ injury are significantly less frequent in treated compared to untreated elderly hypertensives. These observations clearly show that hypertension in the elderly must be treated. As to water-electrolyte metabolism, activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis as well as volemia are reduced in the elderly while extravascular liquid compartment and activity of the natriuretic atrial factor are both increased. In addition, there is reduction of the baroceptor reflexes accompanied by vasoconstriction and hypertrophy of the smooth muscles associated with increased intracellular calcium ion content. These pathophysiologic conditions appear to supply {{the rationale for the}} preference accorded to calcium channel blockers compared to other drugs usually employed in the management of younger hypertensives. Moreover, second generation dihydropyridines, thanks to their <b>liposolubility</b> and ties with calcium channel subunits, show rapid onset and long action that allows for a single daily dose and lowers the incidence of side effects. A {{large number of}} interventional trials employing calcium channel blockers have demonstrated the efficacy of these drugs for reducing arterial hypertension. However, these trials concern young hypertensives whereas {{there is a lack of}} similar studies in elderly subjects, were clinical trials are few and involve limited numbers of subjects. Results of multicentre studies, at present in progress, will permit to assess the efficacy and incidence of side effects of second generation calcium channel blockers in hypertension of the elderly...|$|E
40|$|The {{entry of}} an {{antibiotic}} into phagocytes {{is a prerequisite}} for its intracellular bioactivity against susceptible facultative or obligatory intracellular microorganisms. Brodimoprim is a dimethoxybenzylpyrimidine that has recently entered into clinical use, and its uptake into and elimination from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), together with its effects on normal phagocytic and antimicrobial mechanisms, have been investigated. Brodimoprim uptake by PMNs was determined by a velocity-gradient centrifugation technique under various experimental conditions and was expressed as the ratio of the intracellular to the extracellular drug concentration (C/E) in comparison with the C/E of trimethoprim, which was used as a control drug. After incubation with 7. 5 mg of brodimoprim per ml, PMNs accumulated brodimoprim (C/E, 74. 43 6 12. 35 at 30 min) more avidly than trimethoprim (C/E, 20. 97 6 6. 61 at 30 min). The cellular uptake of brodimoprim was not affected by temperature, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, or potassium fluoride and was increased with an increase in the pH of the medium. It was reduced in formaldehyde-killed PMNs. The efflux of brodimoprim was very rapid (46 % after 5 min). The <b>liposolubility</b> of brodimoprim was about three times that of trimethoprim, as was the uptake. Therefore, a possible passive transmembrane diffusion mechanism might be proposed. Brodimoprim did not decrease either phagocytosis or phagocyte-mediated bactericidal activity, nor did it affect oxidative burst activity, as investigated by luminol-amplified chemiluminescence. On the basis of the pharmacokineti...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} lead levels and adipose tissue in Sardinian children. As an environmental pollutant, lead occurs in two different chemical forms: inorganic and organic lead; organic lead {{is present in the}} environment mainly as lead-alkyls (tetramethyl and tetraethyl lead). The lead-alkyls are characterized by their liposolubility; because of this characteristic, the behavior of organic Pb in the organism {{is similar to that of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In fact, the high <b>liposolubility</b> of POPs, synthetic chemical substances highly resistant to biodegradation in both the environment and the human body, gives them a preferential tendency to accumulate in adipose tissue. Methods: The study sample consisted of 759 children between 11 and 15 years resident in various municipalities of Sardinia. Hair lead levels (PbH) were used as the biomarker of exposure, while several anthropometric indexes were adopted to evaluate the adipose tissue: weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist to hip circumference ratio, and sum of skinfolds (Rskf). Results: The results of the multivariate ridge regression analysis, controlling for sex and age, show a significant positive relationship between logPbH and logRskf but not the other adiposity indicators. Conclusions: This results suggests that organic lead tends to accumulate in adipose tissue, although it would be appropriate to measure lead levels in the adipose tissue itself in order to verify the results. Hence this tissue could be considered a possible new biological matrix for the evaluation of environmental lead exposure...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{permeability}} of 13 different {{gloves to}} 13 cytotoxic agents under controlled dynamic conditions is described. METHODS: Thirteen cytotoxic agents were prepared {{at the highest}} concentrations normally encountered by pharmacy personnel. Four glove types [...] neoprene, natural rubber latex, nitrile, and vinyl [...] {{were exposed to the}} cytotoxic agents for 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Tests were conducted using the middle finger of each glove. Linearity, reproducibility, and sensitivity were evaluated for each drug tested. Assays were run using liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet light (HPLC-UV). Permeability testing was conducted using an original system designed to evaluate dynamic constraints, such as rubbing, stretching, and tension. RESULTS: Linearity by LC/MS/MS and HPLC-UV was confirmed at concentrations up to 1000 ng/mL for all drugs. Most glove materials were permeable at rates below ASTM recommendations over the one-hour testing period. Vinyl was the most permeable material. Carmustine permeated the widest variety of materials. Due to the high sensitivity of the analytic methods, all materials displayed low but significant permeability for at least one drug after one hour. Higher resistance to permeation was recorded for all neoprene, some natural rubber latex, and one nitrile glove. CONCLUSION: Neoprene, natural rubber latex, and nitrile gloves displayed the highest resistance to permeation of the 13 cytotoxic agents studied. Additional factors, such as duration of exposure, glove thickness, and drug <b>liposolubility</b> and molecular weight, also affected permeability...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of 2 -(4 -fluoro- 3 -hydroxyphenyl) ethylamine (26) and of some N,N-dialkyl derivatives (27 - 30) starting from 4 -fluoro- 3 -hydroxytoluenea nd their in vitro binding affinities for dopamine (DA) receptor are reported. The amine 26 {{can be regarded}} as a molecular modification of DA in which the para hydroxyl group is replaced by fluorine. The new compounds 26 - 30 were evaluated for their affinity at D- 1 and D- 2 DA receptor subtypes by displacement of [3 H]SCH 23390 (D- 1 selective) and [3 H]spiperone (D- 2 selective). The amine 26 had about 2 -fold less affinity for D- 1 and D- 2 binding sites than DA. The substitution of the amino group with ethyl, n-propyl, and 2 -phenylethyl groups decreased the affinity for D- 1 binding sites but greatly enhanced the effectiveness on D- 2 binding sites. The N-ethyl- (28) and N-n-propyl-N-(2 -phenylethyl) - 2 -(4 -fluoro- 3 -hydroxypheny 1) ethylam(i 3 n 0 e) were the most potent members of the series with high selectivity for D- 2 binding sites. A similar effect was observed with isomeric N-n-propyl-N-(2 -phenylethyl) - 2 - 3 (-fluoro- 4 -hydroxypheny 1) ethylamine(31) which was approximately 65 times more selective for D- 2 sites vs D- 1 sites. The introduction of a 2 -phenylethyl group on the nitrogen atom induce the highest effect, perhaps as a consequence of an increased <b>liposolubility</b> or of binding to a complementary lipophilic site on the receptor...|$|E
40|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is {{a complex}} {{functional}} barrier composed of endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytic endfeets and neuronal cells. This highly organized complex express a selective permeability for molecules that bear, amongst other parameters, adequate molecular weight and sufficient <b>liposolubility.</b> Unfortunately, very few therapeutic agents currently available do cross the BBB and enters the CNS. As the BBB limitation {{is more and more}} acknowledged, many innovative surgical and pharmacological strategies have been developed to circumvent it. This review focuses particularly on the osmotic opening of the BBB, a well-documented approach intended to breach the BBB. Since its inception by Rapoport in 1972, pre-clinical studies have provided important information on the extent of BBB permeation. Thanks to Neuwelt and colleagues, the osmotic opening of the BBB made its way to the clinic. However, many questions remain as to the detailed physiology of the procedure, and its best application to the clinic. Using different tools, amongst which MRI as a real-time in vivo characterization of the BBB permeability and CNS delivery, we attempt to better define the osmotic BBB permeabilization physiology. These ongoing studies are described, and data related to spatial and temporal distribution of a molecule after osmotic BBB breaching, as well as the window of BBB permeabilization, are discussed. We also summarize recent clinical series highlighting promising results in the application of this procedure to maximize delivery of chemotherapy in the treatment of brain tumor patients...|$|E

In order to obtain the maximal complexation efficiency, the molar ratio of sodium deoxycholate to insulin was found. The zeta potential method was used to confirm the optimal ratio for formation of Ins-SD-Comp. The structural characteristics of Ins-SD-Comp were assessed using the Fourier transform infrared method. The apparent partition coefficient of insulin increased upon the formation of Ins-SD-Comp. Based on the preliminary study, Ins-SD-Comp was encapsulated into poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles using an emulsion solvent diffusion method. The maximal encapsulation efficiency of Ins-SD-Comp into PLGA nanoparticles was 93. 6 % &plusmn; 2. 81 %, drug loading was about 4. 8 % &plusmn; 0. 32 %, and the mean diameter of the nanoparticles was 278 &plusmn; 13 nm.

40|$|This work {{studied the}} {{synthesis}} of 5, 10, 15 -tris(4 -aminophenyl) - 20 -(N,N-dialkyl/diaryl-N-phenylurea) porphyrins (P 1 -P 4 with alkyl or aryl groups of Ph, iPr, Et and Me, respectively) and also the preparation of their manganese (III) and cobalt (II) complexes (MnP and CoP). The P 1 -P 4 ligands were characterized by different spectroscopic techniques (1 H NMR, FTIR, UV-Vis) and elemental analysis, and metalated with Mn and Co acetate salts. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds in vitro were investigated by agar-disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli (-), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (-), Staphylococcus aureus(+), Bacillus subtilis (+) and Aspergillus oryzae and Candida albicans. Results showed that antibacterial and antifungal activity of the test samples increased with increase of their concentrations and the highest activity was obtained when the concentration of porphyrin compounds was 100 µg/mL. The activity for the porphyrin ligands depended {{on the nature of}} the urea derivative substituents and increased in the order P 1 > P 2 > P 3 >P 4, which was consistent with the order of their <b>liposolubility.</b> MnP and CoP complexes exhibited much higher antibacterial and antifungal activity than P 1 -P 4 ligands. Further, the growth inhibitory effects of these compounds was generally in the order CoP complexes > MnP complexes > P 1 -P 4 ligands. Among these porphyrin compounds, CoP 1 displayed the highest antibacterial and antifungal activity, especially with a concentration of 100 µg/mL, against all the four tested bacteria and two fungi, and therefore it could be potential to be used as drug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Qishen yiqi pills (QY pills) are {{a type of}} {{standardized}} cardiovascular herbal medicine, which contain four component herbs, i. e., Astragalus membranaceus (Huangqi), Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), Panax notoginseng (Sanqi), and Dalbergia odorifera (Ji-angxiang). After oral administration of QY pills, the in vivo exposure types of each component herb in rats were first uncovered and iden-tified according to a target-directed strategy based on hyphenated chromatography techniques. The dominated metabolites in urine, blood and bile were originated from flavonoids of Huangqi and monomer phenolic acids of Danshen; no metabolites but parent drugs of Sanqi ginsenosides, namely ginsenosides Rb 1, Rd, Re and Rg 1, notoginsenoside R 1 and gypenoside XVII, were detected in rat urine and blood, and the 20 (S) -protopanaxatriol type ginsenosides (NR 1, GRe, GRg 1) could also be excreted to bile; the high <b>liposolubility</b> of volatile oils from Jiangxiang restricted them to small intestine, liver and adipose tissues. The identification of metabolites in bio-samples was achieved by exact mass measurement and detailed fragmentation pathway analyses. In specific conditions, not only the types of phase II metabolism but also their conjugation positions could be determined by our established cleavage pathways, which lead to discriminate the phase II metabolites of protocatechualdehyde for the first time. Based on the metabolite study in rats, the 4 main compounds (tanshi-nol, astragaloside IV, GRb 1 and GRg 1) in QY pills were selected as pharmacokinetic markers. The PK results showed that their maximal concentrations in blood were obtained within one hour, much shorter than the reported values in single herbs. The rat exposure was proximately linear under the studied dosages from 1 to 6 g/kg...|$|E
