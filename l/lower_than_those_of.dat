5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> samarium; similarly, the estimate for the boiling point, ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the Japanese {{consortium}} of Kawasaki Heavy Industries with Nippon Sharyo, Tokyu Car Corp and Kinki Sharyo was awarded Contract 151 {{at a cost}} of S$581.5 million for the construction of 396 passenger cars. Kawasaki won the contract; its bid—aided by favourable financing from Mitsui and positive economic conditions in Japan—was 12% <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other bidders. The award was the largest single contract awarded in the initial construction of the system. Kawasaki also promised to supply $20.9m worth of complimentary spare parts after delivery. The loss of Contract 151 was a massive financial blow to Metro-Cammell, who were forced to reduce their workforce by half later that year.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in the boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E

5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E
5|$|After {{hosting the}} first few home matches of the {{campaign}} at Selhurst Park—1,054 saw them lose 4–2 to Wigan Athletic in their last home game in London—Wimbledon F.C. received Football League clearance to host matches at the National Hockey Stadium on 19 September 2003, and eight days later played their first match in Milton Keynes, against Burnley. The game drew a crowd of 5,639, including 893 away fans. Wimbledon F.C. went two goals down before coming back to draw 2–2; Dean Holdsworth scored the club's first goal in Milton Keynes. The team struggled {{on and off the}} pitch {{for the rest of the}} season, losing important players regularly as the administrators sold them to keep the club afloat, and eventually finished bottom of the second-tier First Division. Attendances at the National Hockey Stadium were higher than those at Selhurst Park during the 2002–03 season, but <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the 2001–02 season. The 2–1 defeat to Sunderland on 7 April 2004 that confirmed Wimbledon F.C.'s relegation was attended by 4,800, of whom 2,380 were away fans.|$|E
5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E

A. canescens also enhances pasture growth at low densities.|$|R
30|$|Since the pores {{formed by}} CNTs, where rubber was filled, are highly {{challenging}} to directly characterize, data of pores formed by differently dispersed CNT agglomerates (Buckypapers, Fig.  4 a, b) {{were used to}} combine with electrical conductivity of CNT rubber composites. The pore diameters with the tops (pore volume: log differential intrusion) were plotted against electrical conductivity of the CNT rubber composites (Fig.  5 b). Turbulent flow-based methods (red-spotted) showed the high electrical conductivity (33, 28  S/cm) of the composite and small pore size diameters with the maximum pore volume (72, 61  nm). A cavitation-based method gave somewhat <b>lower</b> conductivity <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> turbulent-based methods (20  S/cm) and a small pore diameter with the maximum pore volume (56  nm). On the other hand, mechanical force-based methods provided <b>lower</b> conductivity <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> abovementioned methods (<[*] 16  S/cm) and large pore diameters with a maximum pore volume (90  nm to 10  μm).|$|R

5|$|The {{progenitors}} of Type Ib/c supernovae are {{not observed}} at all, and constraints on their possible luminosity are often <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> known WC stars. WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, {{so it is}} difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged. Population modelling shows that the observed Type Ib/c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems. The continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal Type Ib and Ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst. Most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems. A small number would be from rapidly-rotating massive stars, likely corresponding to the highly-energetic Type Ic-BL events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.|$|E
25|$|Physically, post-transition metals {{are soft}} (or brittle), have poor {{mechanical}} strength, and have melting points <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the transition metals.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to test combustive properties of medium density fibreboard (MDF) plates treated with piper-azinomethyl-bis-phosphonic acid (PIPEABP), methylpiperazinomethyl-bis-phosphonic acid (MPIPEABP), and N,N-dimethyle-thylenediaminomethyl-bis-phosphonic acid (MDEDAP). MDF specimens were painted three times with 15 wt % solution of the alkylenediaminoalkyl-bis-phosphonic acids at room temperature. After drying specimen treated with chemicals, combustive properties were examined using the cone calorimeter (ISO 5660 - 1). As a result, combustion-retardation properties increased due {{to the treatment of}} bare MDF with alkylenediaminoalkyl-bis-phosphonic acid solution. Especially, the specimens treated with chemicals showed the ignition (TTI) (148 s∼ 116 s) was retarded and the flameout (Tf) (633 s∼ 529 s) time increased, while the total heat release rate (THRR) (61. 1 ∼ 67. 0) MJ/m 2 was <b>lowered</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> using virgin plate by reducing the burnig rate.

25|$|Several toxic heavy metals, however, have Ksp values {{substantially}} <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the sulfides of {{iron and}} manganese - for example, cadmium (II) sulfide (CdS) has a Ksp equal to 10−32.85.
