5|$|Recent {{models of}} {{economic}} defence in a group-foraging context {{predict that the}} frequency of aggressive interactions should decline as resource density increases. Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch <b>location</b> <b>was</b> signaled, {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch <b>location</b> <b>was</b> signaled or not. Signaling patch <b>location</b> <b>was</b> equivalent to making the resources more spatially predictable. Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not signaled. When food <b>location</b> <b>was</b> signaled, increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E

Once item <b>locations</b> <b>are</b> scaled, the person <b>locations</b> <b>are</b> measured on the scale. As a result, person and item <b>locations</b> <b>are</b> estimated on a single scale as shown in Figure 2.|$|R
