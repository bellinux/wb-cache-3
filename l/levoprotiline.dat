40|$|Repeated {{treatment}} with fluoxetine and citalopram, which are potent 5 -HT reuptake inhibitors, resulted in different regulation of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 receptors in the rat brain. Their effects {{were compared with}} those of other antidepressants: imipramine, mianserin and <b>levoprotiline.</b> The density of 5 -HT 1 A receptors, labelled with [3 H] 8 -OH-DPAT, in the rat hippocampus was enhanced after citalopram, imipramine, mianserin and <b>levoprotiline,</b> but not altered after fluoxetine administration. [3 H]Ketanserin binding sites, which label 5 -HT 2 receptors, were increased after fluoxetine and <b>levoprotiline,</b> but decreased after citalopram, imipramine and mianserin in the rat cerebral cortex. Acute administration of fluoxetine, but not citalopram, resulted in a decreased density of 5 -HT 1 A receptors. 5 -HT 2 receptors were not changed by acute administration of either fluoxetine or citalopram. The obtained results indicate that besides 5 -HT reuptake inhibiting properties of both compounds, there may exist an additional mechanism(s) of their action, which leads to different regulation of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} {{studies indicate that}} clinical depression {{may be associated with}} disturbances of circadian rhythms. To explore the interaction between circadian rhythmicity, behavioral state, and monoaminergic systems, the present study investigated the effects of chronic administration and withdrawal of the following antidepressant agents on circadian wheel-running rhythms of laboratory rats: a) moclobemide, a reversible and selective monoamine oxidase (MAO) type A inhibitor; b) Ro 19 - 6327, a selective MAO type B inhibitor; c) desipramine, a preferential norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; d) clomipramine and e) fluoxetine, both serotonin reuptake inhibitors; and f) <b>levoprotiline,</b> an atypical antidepressant whose biochemical mechanism is still unknown. Wheel-running activity rhythms were studied in three inbred strains of laboratory rats (ACI, BH, LEW) under constant darkness (DD). Two of these inbred strains (BH and LEW) show profound abnormalities in their circadian activity rhythms, namely, a reduced overall level of activity and bimodal or multimodal activity patters. Chronic treatment with moclobemide and desipramine consistently increased the overall level, as well as the circadian amplitude, of the activity rhythm. Furthermore, the abnormal activity pattern of the LEW strain was changed into a unimodal activity pattern like that of other laboratory rats. The free-running period &# 964; was slightly shortened by moclobemide and dramatically shortened by desipramine. Effects of moclobemide and desipramine treatment on overall activity level and duration were reversed shortly after termination of treatment, whereas long aftereffects were observed for the free-running period. All other substances tested had no systematic effects on the activity rhythms of any of the strains. The fact that moclobemide and desipramine altered the period, amplitude, and pattern of circadian activity rhythms is consistent with the hypothesis that monoaminergic transmitters {{play a significant role in}} the neuronal control of behavioral state and circadian rhythmicity. Although the present study found that some antidepressives affect parameters of circadian rhythmicity, it could not demonstrate a common effect of all classes of antidepressives...|$|E
