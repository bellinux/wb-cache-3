5000|$|About 60 engines {{survived in}} the [...] "Forest of Engines", as {{described}} by engineers {{on a trip to}} the warehouse. In the mid-1990s, Russia sold 36 engines to Aerojet General for $1.1 million each, shipping them to the company facility in Sacramento CA. During the engine test in Sacramento, the engine hit its specifications. Aerojet now had the proof they needed to sell the engines for the latest <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>satellites.</b> The NK-33 Closed Cycle Technology works by sending the auxiliary engines' exhaust into the main combustion chamber. This made the engine design unique. This technology was believed to be impossible by Western rocket engineers. [...] The fully heated liquid O2 flows through the pre-burner and into the main chamber in this design. The extremely hot oxygen-rich mixture made the engine dangerous: it was known to melt 3 inch thick castings [...] "like candle wax". This resulted in Lockheed Martin developing a new metal to handle the heat, combustion and temperature. One of the controversies in the Kremlin over supplying the engine to the US was that the design of the engine was similar to Russian ICBM engine design. The NK-33's design was used in the later RD-180 engine, which were twice the size of the NK-33. The RD-180 engines were used (as of 2016) to power Atlas Rockets. This {{is one of the first}} engines produced in America using the NK-33's closed-cycle technology. This company also acquired a license for the production of new engines. Aerojet has modified and renamed the updated NK-33 to AJ26-58 and AJ26-62, and NK-43 to AJ26-59.|$|E

The presented method for developing heuristics {{can be used for}} a wider range of vessels.

I will review these results, together with similar results reported in the literature, from a critical perspective of understanding the true uncertainties involved in the measurements.

40|$|In this paper, a {{study of}} polarimetric {{optimization}} techniques {{in the frame of}} differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) is considered. Historically, DInSAR techniques have been limited to the single-polarimetric case, mainly due to the unavailability of fully polarimetric data. Lately, the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>satellites</b> with polarimetric capabilities, such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), RADARSAT- 2, or TerraSAR-X, allowed merging polarimetric and interferometric techniques to improve the pixels' phase quality and, thus, the density and the reliability of the final DInSAR results. The relationship between the polarimetrically optimized coherence or amplitude dispersion maps and the final DInSAR results is carefully analyzed, using both orbital and ground-based SAR fully polarimetric data. DInSAR processing using polarimetric optimization techniques in the pixel selection process is compared with the classical single-polarimetric approach, achieving up to a threefold increase of the number of pixel candidates in the coherence case and up to a factor of seven in the amplitude dispersion case.

40|$|The {{separation}} {{system is}} crucial for the <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>satellites.</b> Dynamic characteristics of satellite separation are quite complex and difficult to predict. With respect to the helical compression spring mechanism, an approach using transient perturbation analysis is presented. The separation springs and limit switches are mathematically modeled, and disturbing forces and moments are considered. ADAMS and MATLAB software platforms are combined to obtain separation trajectory and attitude parameters. The minimum relative distance is proposed to show whether there is collision between the satellite and launch vehicles. Emphasis is placed on introducing the approach by analyzing a typical separation system. With experimental design and statistical analysis, the influences of perturbation factors are concluded. For example, three angular velocities are approximately linear with center of gravity offsets of the satellite and deviations of spring parameters; however, the effect law of asynchronous time is non-linear. A ground test system of satellite separation is designed and the test results are compared with the analysis, which prove accuracy of the dynamic model and feasibility of the approach...|$|E

40|$|Owing to the {{randomness}} of load {{applied to}} mechanical components, {{it is difficult}} to accurately determine the strength degradation path. Therefore, the distribution of strength at each load application is always used to deal with the uncertainty of strength in its degradation process, which may cause errors in reliability calculations due to neglecting the correlation with the remaining strength at each load application in a strength degradation path. To deal with this problem, dynamic reliability models of mechanical components with the failure mode of fatigue are developed in this paper, based on equivalent strength degradation paths, whose uncertainty is determined by both the distribution of material parameters and the distribution of load. The proposed models can be used to quantitatively analyse the influences of the variation in statistical parameters of material parameters on the reliability and failure rate of components. Explosive bolts, which are important to the successful <b>launch</b> <b>of</b> <b>satellites,</b> have been chosen as representative examples to validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed models. The results show that using strength distribution at each load application may lead to large errors in calculating reliability. Moreover, different material parameters have different influences on dynamic characteristics of reliability and on the failure rate of mechanical components...|$|E
