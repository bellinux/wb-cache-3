50|$|<b>The</b> {{operation}} <b>of</b> hoeing is beneficial, {{not only}} as being destructive of weeds, but as <b>loosening</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> and rendering it more permeable to the gases and aqueous vapour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. Hoeing, therefore, not only protects the farmer's crops from being weakened by weeds, but it renders <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> itself as more capable <b>of</b> supplying <b>the</b> plants with their food.

5000|$|The {{advantages}} of the Ransome Victory plough are that it is relatively cheap ($100-200 USD), allows farmers to cultivate larger areas of land, requires only a single span of oxen to pull, and in wet soils, can be handled by even a youth. It also provides benefits common to all plows, such as burying of weed biomass and <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface. The dis{{advantages of}} the Ransome Victory are its relatively shallow draft (20 cm), {{the fragility of the}} torsion bar, and the short ploughshare, which tends to leave an uneven, smeared furrow in clayey soils unless well-handled. Furthermore, the Ransome Victory plough is nearly unusable in dry soils, limiting its use until after seasonal rains have sufficiently saturated the soil.|$|E

40|$|Within organic farming, {{chemical}} {{weed control}} is prohibited and is generally being replaced by different tillage practices. At the same time <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> sufficient amounts of nitrogen is often a problem within organic fanning. In cereal crops, harrowing {{is considered to be}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important mechanical weeding techniques. <b>The</b> <b>loosening</b> and aerating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> produced by harrowing should potentially enhance nitrogen mineralization. Furthermore, harrowing could enhance <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> structure and water content, since tillage is generally known to positively affect these soil factors through mechanisms such as crust breaking and enhanced tillering in cereals. This study investigated <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> mechanical weed control in the spring on weeds, nitrogen mineralization and yield of winter wheat. Weed control was carried out when the crop had 2 - 3 leaves. Three different implements were tested on two soils differing in clay content for three consecutive years: A Väderstad Crosskill roller, an s-tine harrow and a spring tine harrow, and compared with untreated controls. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm layers and total nitrogen content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crop were determined on several occasions for calculations of net nitrogen mineralization in the soi 1. The numbers and weight of weeds were recorded one month after harrowing and at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> harvesting. Grain yield was measured at harvest. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> dicotyledonous weeds was reduced by harrowing. On <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> with <b>the</b> lower clay content, weed numbers were reduced to between 50 and 82 % <b>of</b> those in <b>the</b> control, while on <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> with <b>the</b> higher clay content they were reduced to between 42 and 82 % <b>of</b> those in <b>the</b> control. On average, the best effect on <b>the</b> lighter clay <b>soils</b> was achieved by use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> s-tine harrow, while on <b>the</b> heavier clay <b>soils</b> <b>the</b> Väderstad Crosskill roller and the spring-tine harrow had the best weed control effect. In the harrowed treatments, the average mineral N content in the 0 - 30 cm layer was enhanced by only 0. 4 kg ha⁻¹. At the same time the N uptake in the crop was reduced by approximately the same amount due to the crop suffering mechanical damage, and calculations of net nitrogen mineralization showed no increase in N mineralization after harrowing. Despite annual variations, harrowing in general had a positive effect on grain yield. Comparing the different implements, the best yields on <b>the</b> lighter clay <b>soil</b> were achieved by use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spring tine harrow, which increased the yield compared with the control by an average of 5 % in two years out of three (2002 - 2005).

40|$|Introduction: Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) is {{a commonly}} used surgical treatment <b>of</b> osteoarthritis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip joint. A frequent complication <b>of</b> THA is <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> {{one or both}} components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis. <b>Loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis is usually caused by mechanical (aseptic) causes but can also have an infectional (septic) cause. Both types <b>of</b> <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis require a different surgical treatment. <b>The</b> treatment <b>of</b> aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis consists of one operation during which one or both components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis are being changed (1 -stage revision THA). Treatment <b>of</b> septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis requires a more intensive treatment because first the infection has to be cleared. Previous studies showed that certain patient-related factors have {{an increased risk of}} aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. However, no study has been performed into the difference between patient-related factors with aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this study was to identify patient-related factors that are associated with an increased risk of aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Methods: This retrospective cohort study consisted of 257 patients who underwent a revision THA between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011 admitted to <b>the</b> orthopedic unit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Martini Hospital in Groningen. After in- and exclusioncriteria, 161 patients were being included. Patient-related and surgical factors were derived from EPD and patient charts. Analysed patient-related factors included the 19 specific diseases that are used to determine the Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as the 30 most common chronic diseases according to the Dutch Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify patient-related factors related to aseptic or septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Results: <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 161 patients, 151 patients had an aseptic loosening and 15 patients had a septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Analysis showed that myocardial infarction (OR, 7. 37; BI 1. 86 - 29. 20) and cancer (OR, 5. 25; BI 1. 65 - 16. 76) had a raised chance for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Overweight showed to be a raised chance OR, 0. 26; BI, 0. 07 - 0. 97) for aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) in comparison with a Charlson score of 0 was a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Conclusions: This study showed that patients with myocardial infarction or cancer in the medical history have a significant higher risk for septic loosening in comparison with aseptic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Overweight is a risk factor for aseptic loosening in comparison with septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. Also having a high Charlson score (> 5) is a risk factor for septic <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip prosthesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Suction {{caissons}} are {{a promising}} foundation concept for supporting offshore wind turbines. Compared to {{applications in the}} oil and gas industry, where most practical experience exists, significant differences arise in terms of load paths and magnitudes, soil type and caisson aspect ratio (skirt length to diameter). In a set of two companion papers, this contribution investigates the response of suction caissons in dense sand through a series of centrifuge experiments. The caisson was installed using suction, followed by sequences of cyclic loading and then extraction, all steps completed continuously in- flight. This first paper discusses installation, limiting capacities and drainage, whereas the second paper focuses on vertical cyclic loading into tension. The work demonstrates that suction caisson installation behaviour is well described by existing calculation methods. Tests performed at different installation rates demonstrate that careful assessment of the pumping rate is needed to ensure successful installation, with low pumping rates resulting in premature refusal. In the centrifuge tests, full skirt penetration was achieved without apparent <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> plug. The limiting capacity in tension, measured during the testing at both fast and slow uplift rates, was also well described by existing calculation methods...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} river bank erosion in three {{catchments}} in the UK have {{been characterized by}} the persistent occurrence of negative erosion-pin results. The cause of these negative recordings is considered with reference to field data from the Afon Trannon, Nant Tanllwyth and River Arrow, and to a laboratory study of freeze-thaw and desiccation processes. It seems that there is potential for, {{and in some cases}} evidence of, a number of different circumstances that generate negative results, but none of these alone is sufficient to explain all incidents. Factors considered include: deposition of sediment during high flows; soil fall from the upper parts of the bank on to lower erosion pins; <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface and expansion/contraction of the soil mass with fluctuations in temperature and moisture content; movement of the erosion-pin within the bank and human interference. Each has its own implications for the use of erosion pins. Further issues arise when including negative data in subsequent data analysis, and it is demonstrated that attempts to correlate erosion rates with hydro-meteorological data in order to ascertain causes of erosion will be influenced by the way in which negative data are handled. It is thus suggested that any study of river bank erosion using erosion pins should state whether or not negative data were obtained, and if so, how they were included in data analysis. Failure to include this information could lead to comparison of mean erosion rates that reflect bank processes very differently. The studies presented here offer a clear example of the value of anomalous field data: results which do not appear to fit expected patterns can reveal as much about the processes in operation as those that do...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was initiated in 1997 with non-inverting soil tillage compared to conventional tillage with annual mouldboard ploughing to either 20 cm depth (CT) or 10 cm depth (RCT). The new system included a non-inverting mechanical <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> to approximately 35 cm depth {{combined with a}} shallow cultivation of the top 5 cm soil by either a rotovator (NIT) or an S-tine harrow (RNIT). The experiment was located on a sandy loam at the organic farmed Rugballegård Experimental Station. A plough pan at 20 - 35 cm depth was identified by cone penetration measurements. The non-inverting tillage system succeeded in breaking up the plough pan, which reduced the cone index from approximately 1. 8 MPa in the CT and RCT treatments to 0. 6 MPa in the NIT treatment. A detailed soil profile description of the top 30 cm of the soil indicated that root growth was restricted for especially CT and RCT treatments {{in the form of}} thickened and horizontally deflected roots at the interface between the topsoil and the plough pan at approximately 22 cm depth. For RCT a new plough pan was under development just below the present ploughing depth at 10 cm. This also resulted in root growth restriction, but to a lesser extent than the deeper plough pan. A soil drop test was performed to characterise soil fragmentation. Undisturbed cubic soil samples were taken from the 5 - 15 cm layer and dropped from 75 cm height in to a metal box. The resulting aggregate size distribution differed between the treatments with geometrical mean weight diameter (GMD) of 5. 7 mm 7. 4 mm and 8. 9 mm for CT, RCT and NIT treatments, respectively. The higher degree of fragmentation for the mouldboard ploughed soil may be explained by higher energy input per soil volume by mouldboard ploughing than by non-inverting deep loosening. The results indicate for the 5 _ 15 cm layer, that plant growth conditions were best for CT treated soil, due to a combination of low cone index and small aggregates. For the 20 _ 35 cm layer, the results indicates best plant growth conditions for NIT treated soil due to a low cone index and less restricted root growth. The spring barley/pea mix with grass/clover undersown yielded on average 47. 6 hkg/ha. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments...|$|E

40|$|Os Tabuleiros Costeiros, com ocorrência nas regiões Norte, Nordeste e Sudeste do Brasil, apresentam solos com horizontes coesos, os quais podem ocasionar impedimentos físicos à penetração das raízes e à dinâmica da água. No entanto, a gênese desses horizontes ainda é muito questionada. Desta forma, objetivou-se avaliar a influência do {{material}} amorfo na coesão desses solos, estudando-se uma topossequência no município de Trairi - CE. Foram descritos e caracterizados (física e quimicamente) três perfis de solos com caráter coeso (P 2; P 3 e P 4) e um perfil (P 1) não coeso. Para a avaliação do efeito do material amorfo na coesão dos solos, foram utilizadas amostras dos horizontes Bt 1 dos 4 perfis, com e sem extração de material amorfo. Três ciclos de umedecimento e secagem foram aplicados nas amostras e, em seguida, a resistência à penetração (RP) foi determinada. Com base nos resultados, os solos foram enquadrados, taxonomicamente, nas subordens dos Argissolos Amarelos (P 1; P 2 e P 3) e Acinzentados (P 4). A maior expressão do caráter coeso foi encontrada em P 4, situado na posição mais baixa da paisagem, sugerindo a influência do relevo na intensificação do caráter coeso. Apesar dos baixos teores de argila e de destorroamento, os solos retomaram uma alta RP após apenas três ciclos de umedecimento e secagem. Após a extração de material amorfo, os horizontes coesos dos perfis P 2 e P 4 apresentaram uma significativa redução da resistência à penetração, indicando que estes compostos atuam na gênese de horizontes coesos. The coastal plains, in the North, Northeast and Southeast Brazil, soils with {{cohesive layer}} are common, {{and can cause}} physical impediment to root and water. However, the genesis of these horizons is still unknown. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of amorphous materials on the cohesion processes with cohesive layers from a toposequence in Trairi - CE. Four soil profiles were described and characterized (physically and chemically). Three soils present cohesive layers (P 2, P 3 and P 4) and one (P 1) did not. To evaluate the effect of amorphous material in the cohesion, samples of Bt 1 horizons were subjected to two treatments: with and without extraction of amorphous material. Samples (with and without extraction) were subjected to three cycles of wetting and drying and then the penetration resistance (PR) was determined. Based on the chemical and physical analysis, the soils were classified as Ultisols. The highest expression of the cohesive character was found in P 4, located in the lowest position of the landscape, suggesting the influence of relief on the intensification of the cohesion. Despite the low clay content and the <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> a high PR was achieved {{after only a few}} cycles of wetting and drying. After extraction of amorphous material, the cohesive horizons of profiles P 2 and P 4 showed a significant reduction of PR, indicating that these compounds act in the genesis of cohesive layers...|$|E
40|$|Acid sulfate soils with sulfuric horizons (sulfuric soils) can exert a {{range of}} {{negative}} impacts on the ecology and productivity of soils. The primary treatment for these soils is to raise the pH using lime. Although often effective, this treatment can be expensive and not well suited to large areas. In this research, the possible use of plant organic matter to ameliorate sulfuric soils or to prevent acid sulfate soils with sulfidic materials (sulfidic soils) from acidifying was investigated. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that organic matter is readily available, inexpensive and environmentally friendly, especially in Ramsar listed wetlands where lime cannot be used. The experimental treatments used ground leaves of Phragmites, lucerne hay, pea straw and wheat straw as sources of organic matter with varying nitrogen, which were either incorporated into or overlaid {{on the surface of the}} soils. After 6 months of incubation under either aerobic or anaerobic soil conditions, pH, Eh and sulfate content were measured. Incorporation of complex organic matter significantly increased the pH of both sulfuric and sulfidic soils. These changes were correlated with reductions in soil redox and sulfate content. The magnitude of the changes depended on the nitrogen content of the complex organic matter. The relative importance of carbon and nitrogen in ameliorating acid sulfate soils was further investigated respectively using glucose, sodium acetate and molasses as simple carbon sources, and urea, nitrate and ammonium as simple nitrogen compounds. It was found that compounds containing inorganic nitrogen alone without carbon were ineffective, while urea significantly increased pH and reduced Eh, but did not affect the sulfate content of the soil. Glucose had no significant effect on sulfuric soils, either at low (catalytic) or high concentrations, while acetate significantly increased pH. Molasses (which may contain small amounts of nitrogen) caused moderate changes in pH, Eh and sulfate content. On sulfidic soils, acetate prevented oxidation but glucose strongly acidified the soil, most probably by fermentation to butyric acid. The effects of live roots on sulfidic and sulfuric soil chemistry under either aerobic or anaerobic soil conditions were investigated using Typha, Phragmites and Melaleuca. Typha and Melaleuca are respectively common wetland and inland plants, whereas Phragmites grows under both wetland and inland soil conditions. The study was extended to investigate the combined effects of incorporated ground Phragmites leaves as organic matter and Phragmites plants together. Generally, a great deal of variability was found in the changes in pH, redox and sulfate content, the overall effects being dependent on plant type, whether there was incorporated organic matter, the type of soil and the moisture conditions. However, in all cases the growth of the live plants resulted in greater acidity than in the unplanted control soils. In the case of Typha and Phragmites, which have aerenchymatous tissues, the acidification under anaerobic conditions was attributed to the transport of oxygen in these tissues into the soil. Under non-flooded conditions, the acidification was most likely due to increased oxygen penetration as a result of <b>loosening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> by the plant roots. Thesis (Ph.
