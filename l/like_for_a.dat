James' autobiographical Beyond a Boundary, the Trinidadian writer {{writes about}} his visits {{as a young}} man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a {{professional}} for the town Lancashire League team. He gives a vivid sense of what it must have been <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are {{individual}} pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between $300 and $800 USD and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often take more than a month to make and his work is considered to be in {{the high end of the}} market. Santiago’s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, but today he works mostly solo with his father to help. Another {{of the best}} known is one of the few female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop is not the only one run in this manner, hers is the newest and most successful. Olga’s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> commission, and wholesalers.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{released}} her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: [...] "I love {{to work with}} the weirdos that no one knows about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light." [...] The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one [...] "Music", [...] "Don't Tell Me", and [...] "What It Feels <b>Like</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Girl". The music video of [...] "What It Feels <b>Like</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Girl" [...] depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.|$|E
500|$|Kyle's {{depiction}} on {{the show}} has drawn both praise and criticism from the Jewish community.

To address this, 36, 518 participants rated their <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> 104 musical styles, completed a short form of the Big 5 personality inventory, and provided other data about their favorite musical styles. Personality factors were related to both <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> the musical styles and participants’ reasons for listening to this music. However, on the whole these latter variables were related more closely to participants’ age, sex, and income than to Big 5 scores.

[...] They also decided to introduce the Pevensies back into Narnia nearer the start, in order to weave the two separate stories of the Pevensies and Caspian, in contrast to the book's structure. A sense of guilt on the Pevensies' part was added, seeing the destruction of Narnia in their absence, as was hubris for Peter to enhance the theme of belief: his arrogance means he is unable to see Aslan.|$|E
500|$|The actual {{efficacy}} of jury consultants {{may not be}} very important because the demographic composition of the jury has {{little effect on the}} verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, [...] "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" [...] and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the mere {{presence}} of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as <b>a</b> tool <b>for</b> nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (<b>a)</b> <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence <b>for</b> <b>an</b> association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions...|$|R

40|$|It was {{hypothesised}} that consumers' {{expectations of}} <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> food {{would be affected}} by its appearance both when raw and when cooked and that the impact of these expectations on actual <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> the product after eating would vary with consumer awareness of internal body states (private body consciousness). We found that consumers' expectations of <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> the food generated by the appearance of the cooked product was related to expectation of liking from viewing the raw product. Under some conditions, consumers liked a food less after consumption if a raw product that generated low expectation of liking had been presented beforehand. There was no evidence that private body consciousness modified the consumers' susceptibility to expectation effects. It was concluded that expectations of <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> food generated by appearance both when raw and cooked influenced final evaluation of the product during consumption.
