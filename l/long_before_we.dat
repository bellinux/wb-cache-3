2500|$|Borlaug {{believed}} that {{genetically modified organisms}} (GMO) {{was the only way}} to increase food production as the world runs out of unused arable land. GMOs were not inherently dangerous [...] "because we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. <b>Long</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." ...|$|E

2500|$|During April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen {{discussed}} the [...] "Paradox of deleveraging" [...] described by economist Hyman Minsky: [...] "Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn’t take <b>long</b> <b>before</b> <b>we</b> {{were in a}} recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, {{we have been in}} the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole." ...|$|E
