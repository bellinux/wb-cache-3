40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{characteristics}} of elderly people living in residential and nursing homes over the period 1981 - 1996. The paper draws on information collected in four surveys: a 1981 survey of <b>local</b> <b>authority,</b> private <b>and</b> voluntary residential homes; a 1986 survey of private and voluntary residential and nursing homes; a 1988 survey of <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> residential homes; <b>and</b> a 1996 survey of <b>local</b> <b>authority,</b> private <b>and</b> voluntary residential homes, and private and voluntary nursing homes. The distributions of length of stay for permanent residents in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> voluntary residential homes and nursing homes in 1996 {{were similar to those}} in 1986 / 88. Mean lengths of stay for voluntary residential homes and nursing homes were slightly shorter in 1996 than in 1986, whereas the reverse appears to be the case for <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> homes. However, the mean length of stay of permanent residents in private residential homes was substantially longer in 1996 than in 1986. In terms of their length of stay, permanent residents in private residential homes resembled those in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> homes in 1996. In 1996, residents in nursing homes were most likely to have been admitted from hospital and residents in residential homes were most likely to have been living alone prior to admission, particularly in voluntary residential homes. Residents in private residential homes {{were more likely to have}} been admitted from hospital than residents in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> voluntary residential homes. A larger proportion of residents in voluntary residential homes and nursing homes had been admitted from hospital in 1996 than in 1986, whereas the proportion had decreased for private residential homes and, to a greater extent, for <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> homes. In 1996, residents in nursing homes were substantially more dependent than residents in residential homes, whereas levels of dependency among residents of <b>local</b> <b>authority,</b> private <b>and</b> voluntary residential homes were quite similar. Prior to 1996, residents in voluntary residential homes were less dependent than residents in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> private residential homes. Levels of dependency increased in all types of home between 1986 / 88 and 1996, but the changes were greater for voluntary residential homes and nursing homes, although levels of dependency among residents of nursing homes were also greater than in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> private residential homes in 1986 / 88. In 1981, residents in <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> private residential homes had similar levels of physical functioning and were much more dependent than residents in voluntary residential homes. Between 1981 and 1986 / 88 levels of dependency among residents of <b>local</b> <b>authority</b> <b>and</b> voluntary residential homes increased, but levels of dependency among residents of private residential homes were very similar in 1981 and 1986...|$|R

5|$|In 1821, {{the year}} that the War of Independence broke out, nine issues {{appeared}} between January and May.

In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis’ campaign was in full swing, the Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the excommunication issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Gregory V, against the architects of this uprising.

5|$|Kenyatta {{had made}} clear {{his belief that}} Kenya should become a one-party state, {{regarding}} this as a better expression of national unity than a multi-party system.

He argued that centralised control of the government was needed to deal with the growth in demands for local services and to assist more rapid economic development. In 1966, it launched a commission to examine reforms to local government operations. In 1969, it passed the Transfer of Functions Act, which stopped grants to <b>local</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>and</b> transferred major services from provincial to central control.|$|E
