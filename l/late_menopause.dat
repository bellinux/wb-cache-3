Generalizing the Western data to the population residing in the Himalayan region would breed inaccuracies. Aim: The aim of our study was to identify risk factors in our own population in a Western Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, India. Subjects and Methods: A case–control study with 377 cases of invasive breast cancer and 346 hospital-based controls was conducted for 1 year. The data were collected by interviewing the individuals during their visit to hospital using a questionnaire.

We analyzed whether concurrent BMI or waist circumference and/or changes in weight or waist circumference predicted incident VMS and whether these relations differed by menopause stage or race/ethnicity. METHODS: Data from 10 follow-up visits for 1, 546 participants in the Study of Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Across the Nation who reported no VMS at baseline were modeled for time to first symptomatic visit in relation to concurrent BMI and waist circumference and change in weight and waist circumference during early and <b>late</b> <b>menopause</b> using discrete survival analyses, adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: Greater concurrent BMI and waist circumference {{were significantly related to}} greater any and frequent (3 ̆e/= 6 d in the last 2 wk) incident VMS in early menopause and lower VMS risk in <b>late</b> <b>menopause.</b> Percentage weight change since baseline and since the prior visit was unrelated to incident any VMS in either menopause stage.

40|$|Hormones play a {{major role}} in the {{aetiology}} of several of the commonest cancers worldwide, including cancers of the endometrium, breast and ovary in women and cancer of the prostate in men. It is likely that the main mechanisms by which hormones affect cancer risk are by controlling the rate of cell division, the differentiation of cells and the number of susceptible cells. Hormones have very marked effects on cell division in the endometrium; oestrogens stimulate mitosis whereas progestins oppose this effect. The risk for endometrial cancer increases with <b>late</b> <b>menopause,</b> oestrogen replacement therapy and obesity, and decreases with parity and oral contraceptive use; thus risk increases in proportion to the duration of exposure to oestrogens unopposed by progestins, probably because unopposed oestrogens stimulate endometrial cell division. The effects of hormones on breast epithelial cell division in non-pregnant women are much less clear-cut than their effects on the endometrium, but both oestrogens and progestins appear to stimulate mitosis. Breast cancer risk increases with early menarche, <b>late</b> <b>menopause</b> and oestrogen replacement therapy, probably due to increased exposure of the breasts to oestrogen and/or progesterone. Early first pregnancy and multiparity reduce the risk for breast cancer, probably due to the hormonally-induced differentiation of breast cells and the corresponding reduction in the number of susceptible cells. Hormones do not have marked direct effects on the epithelial cells covering the ovaries, but hormones stimulate ovulation which is followed by cell division during repair of the epithelium. Risk for ovarian cancer increases with <b>late</b> <b>menopause</b> and decreases with parity and oral contraceptive use, suggesting that the lifetime number of ovulations may be a determinant of risk. For all three of these cancers risk changes within a few years of changes in exposure to sex hormones and some of the changes in risk persist for many years, indicating that hormones can affect both early and late stages of carcinogenesis.

40|$|Incidental {{pituitary}} adenoma is {{the common}} finding during brain imaging. According to multistep model of pituitary tumourigenesis genetic alterations provide the initiating event that transforms cells while hormones {{play a role in}} promoting cell proliferation. Development of pituitary adenoma in a case of excessive hypophysiotrophic hormones production or reduced feedback suppression by target gland hormones emphasizes the importance of hormonal stimulation in pituitary tumourigenesis. Pituitary hyperplasia has been reported in pregnancy, hypothyroidism and conditions such as CRH or GHRH hypersecretion. Moreover, recent study reported one case of gonadotroph macroadenoma and two cases of gonadotroph cells hyperplasia in patients with Klinefelter syndrome probably due to protracted stimulation of gonadotroph cells because of lack of androgen feedback. Significant changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis occurred with aging. In females, after menopause, estradiol level decreases by 35 -fold and estrone level by 20 -fold that results in increased gonadotropins levels. Similarly, FSH, but not LH, level is increased with advancing age in men, too, although the age-related difference in the level is less in comparison with women. Regarding these data, we hypothesised that high prevalence rate of pituitary incidentaloma in the elderly is associated with age-related decline in sex hormones levels and subsequent lack of feedback suppression leading to permanent gonadotrophs stimulation which is the crucial step in the pituitary tumour development. According to previously mentioned multistep model of pituitary tumourigenesis, incidentaloma will develop only in persons with already present intrinsic pituitary cell defects. However, further studies have to answer the questions of whether the incidence of pituitary tumours is more frequent in elderly, whether women with <b>late</b> onset <b>menopause</b> or those taking long-term hormone replacement therapy have lower rate of pituitary incidentaloma, and finally, is there any correlation between pituitary tumours incidence and serum concentrations of LH, FSH, bioavailable testosterone or estradiol...|$|R

The cancer series consisted of 3 / 887 patients selected from those reported to the Connecticut Cancer Registry between 1950 and 1959. The national sample comprised 3 / 581 women responding to the National Health Examination Survey of 1960 - 62. The validity of the comparison {{and the effect of}} the relatively large number of breast cancer patients whose menopause histories were deficient were evaluated; no substantial bias was identified. Overall/ surgically induced menopause was associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk to about 60 % of that experienced by women having natural menopause at ages 45 - 54. The decrease was greatest for those with meno-pause induced before age 35 / but induction up to age 50 was protective. Little effect occurred in the decade following the surgical procedure / but sub-stantial reduction occurred in all subsequent periods. Among women with menopause induced before age 35 / breast cancer risk remained as low as one-third that expected 30 and more years later. Relative risk of breast cancer increased with age at natural menopause. Women with natural menopause at age 55 or older had twice the breast cancer risk experienced by those whose menopause occurred before age 45.

Moreover, low-risk patients exhibited more deviation in the seasonal distribution of birth from general births than the high-risk patients.
