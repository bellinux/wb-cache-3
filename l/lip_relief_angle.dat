40|$|The {{development}} of shear textures and band-like {{features in the}} microstructure of commercially pure (CP) aluminum have been studied {{as a function of}} backpressure and die <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> during equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) through a die with a 90 ◦ die channel angle. Microtexture data were acquired by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) following one pass and four repetitive passes by route A. In a 90 ◦ die with zero <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> the microtexture data indicate that ECAP involves simple shear on a shear plane and in a shear direction that are rotated away from the plane of the die channel intersection toward the die exit channel. This rotation reflects the spreading of shear deformation through a fan-shaped region around the plane of the die channel intersection. The superposition of backpressure suppresses this spreading and the texture data indicate that deformation is confined to the plane of the die channel intersection, while the introduction of a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> at the outer corner of the die channel intersection promotes spreading and leads to further rotation of the shear plane and shear direction toward the axis of the die exit channel. Splitting of shear texture components is observed after the initial ECAP pass. Such splitting appears in the microstructure as band-like features separated by sub-grains. Band-like features became apparent in the microstructure after the initial pass and persisted through four ECAP passes by route A; these features become more prominent with increasing die <b>relief</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

Assuming that the workpiece profile consists of sinusoidal-wave components, the amplitude ratio between the workpiece profile and the tool motion is defined as copying rate rC. An experiment was conducted to identify rC in shaping of electroless plated nickel. With polycrystalline diamond tools, the copying rate was obtained as rC = 1. 16. The result indicates that the amplitude of the workpiece profile can be larger {{than that of the}} tool motion. Shaping of slot profiles was carried out to investigate the influences of depth of cut, rake <b>angle</b> and <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> on the copying characteristic.

5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|R

During the tests, the tool rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> {{and the depth of}} cut t were varied, whereas the cutting direction was held parallel to the fibre orientation. The trend of the principal forces recorded during cutting clearly showed the so-called `size effect': the unit cutting force (also known as `specific energy') was a decreasing function of the depth of cut, tending to infinity for vanishingly small values of t. A previous force scheme, assuming a significant influence of the friction generated by the work material sliding along the tool flank on the overall cutting forces, was utilized to interpret the cutting data, and to differently define the unit cutting force. According to the model, the unit cutting force and the coefficient of friction were independent of both the <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> and the depth of cut, although the former, as expected, sensibly decreased with increasing the rake angle...|$|R

The study was focused on the simulation analysis model for micro milling SKD 61 tool steel developed by the finite element method. First, because the impact of the effective rake angle on the oblique cutting model is equivalent to that of the rake angle on the orthogonal cut model, the complex tool geometry of an end-mill will be simplified to the orthogonal cutting model. Using the Taguchi method, the FEM simulation of orthogonal cutting operation was performed under different cutting speeds, cutting depths, effective rake <b>angles</b> and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> were modified.

40|$|Face-hobbing is the {{dominant}} and the most productive machining process for manufacturing bevel and hypoid gears. Bevel gears {{are one of the}} most important power transmission components, in automobile to aerospace industries, where the power is transmitted between two non-parallel axes. In current industries, the face-hobbing process confronts two major challenges, the tool wear and trial and error experiments to select machining parameters. In the present work, these two problems are targeted. The tool wear in face-hobbing happens at the tool corners of the cutting blades due to the multi-flank chip formation and large gradient of working rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> along the cutting edge at the corners. In addition, the cutting fluid absence contributes in the tool wear phenomena. In the present work, a cutting tool design method is proposed in order to improve the tool wear characteristics especially at the tool corners. The rake and relief surfaces of the conventional cutting blades are re-designed in such a way that normal rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> during the face-hobbing process are kept constant and consequently the gradients of these two angles are minimized, theoretically to zero. Using mathematical tool wear characterization relationship and also FEM simulation, the improvements in tool wear are approved. In addition, in the present thesis, semi-analytical methods are proposed to optimize the face-hobbing process in order to select appropriate machining settings. The optimization problem is constructed in such a way that the machining time is minimized subject to the tool rake wear or cutting force related constraints. In order to predict the tool rake wear (crater wear depth), methods are proposed to calculate un-deformed chip geometry, cutting forces, normal stresses, interface cutting temperature and chip sliding velocity. The un-deformed chip geometry is obtained using two proposed methods numerically and semi-analytically. In the numerical method, the workpiece in-process model is obtained and then the un-deformed chip geometry is approximated using the in-process model. In the semi-analytical method, an un-deformed chip boundary theory is constructed in such a way that the boundary curves of the un-deformed chip are formulated by closed form equations. The obtained un-deformed chip geometry is discretized along the cutting edge of the blades. Each infinitesimal element is considered as a small oblique cut. The differential cutting forces are predicted for each individual element using oblique cutting transformation theory. The total cutting forces are derived by integrating the differential cutting forces along the cutting edge. The proposed methods are applied on case studies of non-generated face-hobbing of gears to show the capability of the methods to find the un-deformed chip geometry, predict cutting forces and finally find the optimum machining parameters in non-generated face-hobbing...|$|R
