5|$|I-287 was to {{continue}} past I-95 in Port Chester and was to cross <b>Long</b> <b>Island</b> Sound via the unbuilt Oyster Bay–Rye Bridge. On <b>Long</b> <b>Island,</b> the route would {{run along the}} Seaford–Oyster Bay Expressway (NY135). Then, I-287 was again to be extended into Jones Beach by merging with the Wantagh State Parkway in Merrick. The plans for the bridge, and the I-287 extension onto <b>Long</b> <b>Island,</b> were dropped in 1973 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller {{as a result of}} community opposition and environmental concerns.|$|E

5|$|Along <b>Long</b> <b>Island,</b> {{the high}} storm surge flooded {{hundreds}} of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands {{of trees and}} damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 {{million people in the}} state lost power, including two-thirds of the <b>Long</b> <b>Island</b> Lighting Company customers, {{making it one of the}} worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on <b>Long</b> <b>Island,</b> two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed tree branches. In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. Unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the New York mainland.|$|E
