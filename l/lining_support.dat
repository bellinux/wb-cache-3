40|$|Nasal {{reconstruction}} {{continues to}} be a formidable challenge for most plastic surgeons. This article provides an overview of nasal reconstruction with brief descriptions of subtle nuances involving certain techniques that the authors believe help their overall outcomes. The major aspects of nasal reconstruction are included: <b>lining,</b> <b>support,</b> skin coverage, local nasal flaps, nasolabial flap, and paramedian forehead flap. The controversy of the subunit reconstruction versus defect-only reconstruction is briefly discussed. The authors believe that strictly adhering to one principle or another limits one's options, and the patient will benefit more if one is able to apply a variety of options for each individualized defect. A different approach to full-thickness skin grafting is also briefly discussed as the authors propose its utility in lower third reconstruction. In general, the surgeon should approach each patient as a distinct individual with a unique defect and thus tailor each reconstruction to fit the patient's needs and expectations. Postoperative care, including dermabrasion, skin care, and counseling, cannot be understated...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the overall safety of a tunnel support lining, a reliability-based approach is presented in this paper. Support elements in jointed rock tunnels are provided to control the ground movement caused by stress redistribution during the tunnel drive. Main support elements contribute to stability of the tunnel structure are recognized owing to identify various aspects of reliability and sustainability in the system. The selection of efficient support methods for rock tunneling is a key factor {{in order to reduce the}} number of problems during construction and maintain the project cost and time within the limited budget and planned schedule. This paper introduces a smart approach by which decision-makers will be able to find the overall reliability of tunnel support system before selecting the final scheme of the lining system. Due to this research focus, engineering reliability which is a branch of statistics and probability is being appropriately applied to the field and much effort has been made to use it in tunneling while investigating the reliability of the <b>lining</b> <b>support</b> system for the tunnel structure. Therefore, reliability analysis for evaluating the tunnel support performance is the main idea used in this research. Decomposition approaches are used for producing system block diagram and determining the failure probability of the whole system. Effectiveness of the proposed reliability model of tunnel lining together with the recommended approaches is examined using several case studies and the final value of reliability obtained for different designing scenarios. Considering the idea of linear correlation between safety factors and reliability parameters, the values of isolated reliabilities determined for different structural components of tunnel support system. In {{order to determine}} individual safety factors, finite element modeling is employed for different structural subsystems and the results of numerical analyses are obtained in different design scenarios. Finally, the reliability index values are obtained for the entire support structure in different design scenarios. The results of the work demonstrates that proposed reliability evaluation method of tunnel support system is effective not only for investigating the reliability of individual elements in the structure, but also for building an overall estimation about reliability performance of the entire tunnel structure.

40|$|The {{distinct}} element method (DEM) is {{a useful}} tool in rock engineering to model jointed rock masses. To simulate a jointed rock mass realistically, the main challenge {{is to be able}} to capture its complex geometry which consists of blocks with various shapes and sizes, and to model the interactions between these blocks. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of novel algorithms in the DEM to model jointed rock masses, namely rock slicing procedures for block generation, and algorithms for contact detection between polygonal blocks in 2 -D or polyhedral blocks in 3 -D. These algorithms make use of convex optimisation techniques, for which there exist efficient solution procedures. They do not rely on conventional vertex-edge-face hierarchical data structures and tedious housekeeping algorithms. The algorithms have been verified against analytical and numerical solutions, as well as validated against experimental results published in the literature. Among those, the results of DEM simulations were compared against the experimental model tests and numerical simulations of jointed beams carried out by Talesnick et al. (2007) and Tsesarsky & Talesnick (2007) respectively. Emphasis was placed on modelling the stiffness of the block interfaces accurately, and this was accomplished by reinterpreting the laboratory data published by the investigators. The capabilities of the numerical tools are also examined and demonstrated in areas for which the DEM has found practical application. A substantial fraction of this thesis is devoted to illustrating how these tools can assist the engineer in designing support systems; for example, designing the length and spacing of rock bolts and the lining thickness for a tunnel. Algorithms to model rock bolt and <b>lining</b> <b>support</b> were implemented for this purpose. Interesting comparisons with elastic solutions for supported openings were obtained. Further, it is shown that the relative benefit of introducing more rock bolts or thicker lining can be evaluated using the numerical tools with the aid of an interaction diagram. In the final part of this thesis, the case history of the 1963 Vaiont rock slide in Italy is studied. The 2 -D analyses led to useful insights concerning the influence of the reservoir water level, the rock mass strength and deformability, and the slide surface shear stiffness. 3 -D analyses were undertaken to investigate the influence of the eastern boundary of the slope, and interesting insights were obtained concerning the slope kinematics. Overall, the case study shows that the tools are capable of modelling problems with specific physical and geometrical detail in both 2 -D and 3 -D. </p...|$|E
40|$|The correct {{design and}} {{selection}} of <b>line</b> <b>supports</b> {{is of great}} importance for successful operation and safety of transmission lines.

40|$|In this paper, a {{computationally}} {{efficient and}} highly accurate numerical method is proposed {{to analyze the}} vibrations of symmetrically laminated rectangular composite plates with intermediate <b>line</b> <b>supports.</b> A set of admissible functions are developed from the static solutions of a beam with intermediate point supports under a series of sinusoidal loads, in which the beam may {{be considered to be}} a unit width strip taken from the plate in a direction parallel to the edges of the plate. In addition to satisfying both the geometric boundary conditions of the plate and the zero deflection conditions at the <b>line</b> <b>supports,</b> this set of static beam functions, being different from the existing admissible functions, can also properly describe the discontinuity of the shear forces at the <b>line</b> <b>supports,</b> so that more accurate results can be expected for the dynamic analysis of laminated rectangular plates with intermediate <b>line</b> <b>supports.</b> The governing eigenfrequency equation of the plates is derived by using the Rayleigh-Ritz approach. Several test problems are solved to demonstrate the accuracy and the convergency of the proposed method. The effects of the location and number of <b>line</b> <b>supports,</b> the material properties, the number of layers and the fiber orientations on the vibration behavior of the plates are studied in detail. Some data known for the first time are given and can serve as the benchmark for future research on the aforementioned problem. Moreover, two examples of the dynamic responses of line-supported laminated rectangular plates are also given as an extending application of the present method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
