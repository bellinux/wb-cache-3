5|$|Through {{its ability}} to work across a large range of animal species, {{universal}} primer technology can identify any bird, fish, reptile or mammal and satisfy <b>legal</b> <b>evidence</b> requirements {{in a court of}} law. Patents relating to this invention have been filed in several countries and the research papers published in various journals. This technique of CSIR-CCMB revitalised the field of wildlife forensics. It is currently being used routinely in LaCONES at the CSIR-CCMB to provide a wildlife forensics service across India in cases pertaining to wildlife crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{units of}} the field armies, {{including}} palatini, comitatenses, and sometimes pseudocomitatenses, were based in cities when not on campaign, and could be based in temporary camps when on campaign. But it seems that did not usually occupy purpose-built accommodation like the city-based limitanei. From the <b>legal</b> <b>evidence,</b> it seems they were normally compulsorily billeted in private houses (hospitalitas). This is because they often wintered in different provinces. The comitatus praesentales accompanied their respective emperors on campaign, while even the regional comitatus would change their winter quarters according to operational requirements. However, in the 5th century, emperors rarely campaigned in person, so the praesentales became more static in their winter bases. The Western comitatus praesentalis normally was based in and around Mediolanum (Milan) and the two Eastern comitatus {{in the vicinity of}} Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|Entomological {{evidence}} is <b>legal</b> <b>evidence</b> {{in the form}} of insects or related artifacts and is a field of study in forensic entomology. Such {{evidence is}} used particularly in medicolegal and medicocriminal applications. Insect evidence is customarily used to determine post mortem interval (PMI), but can also be used as evidence of neglect or abuse. It can indicate how long a person was abused/neglected as well as provide important insights into the amount of bodily care given to the neglected or abused person.|$|E
