40|$|Abstract. A dual-rotor {{calculation}} model which can expand freely in the axial direction is established in this paper, {{and the effects}} of one-dimensional axial temperature distribution on critical speeds of the dual-rotor system are analyzed with finite element method. The temperature distribution of the dual-rotor system is given referring to that of similar aero-engine rotor system. Assuming that the left end temperature remains at 0 ℃, and the highest temperature on the section of the high-pressure turbine disk is 0 ℃, 200 ℃, 400 ℃, 600 ℃, and 800 ℃ respectively, the critical speeds of the dual-rotor system are calculated, analyzed and compared. Calculation results show that, with the increase of the highest temperature of the dual-rotor system, the reduction percentage of the critical speeds increases, and the impact on the first critical speed is most obvious. When the highest temperature is 800 ℃, the first critical speed of the rotor system excited by the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>rotor</b> reduces 13. 13 %, and that excited by the high-pressure rotor reduces 13. 49 %...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} article analyzes the resonant reliability at the rotating speed of 6150. 0 [*]r/min for <b>low-pressure</b> compressor <b>rotor</b> blade. The {{aim is to}} improve the computational efficiency of reliability analysis. This study applies least squares support vector machine to predict the natural frequencies of the <b>low-pressure</b> compressor <b>rotor</b> blade considered. To build a more stable and reliable least squares support vector machine model, leave-one-out cross-validation is introduced to search for the optimal parameters of least squares support vector machine. Least squares support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation is presented to analyze the resonant reliability. Additionally, the modal analysis at the rotating speed of 6150. 0 [*]r/min for the rotor blade is considered as a tandem system to simplify the analysis and design process, and the randomness of influence factors on frequencies, such as material properties, structural dimension, and operating condition, is taken into consideration. Back-propagation neural network is compared to verify the proposed approach based on the same training and testing sets as least squares support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, the statistical results prove that the proposed approach is considered to be effective and feasible and can be applied to structural reliability analysis...|$|R

40|$|General Design Criterion 4 {{requires}} that structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be appropriately protected against environmental and dynamic effects, including {{the effects of}} missiles, that may result from equipment failure. Because turbine disks have large masses and rotate at relatively high speeds during normal reactor operation, failure of a disk may result in the genera-tion of high energy missiles and cause excessive vibration of the turbine rotor assembly. Measures taken by the applicant to assure turbine disk integrity and reduce the probability of turbine disk failure satisfy the relevant requirements of General Design Criterion 4. The purpose of {{this section of the}} SRP is to review and evaluate the information submitted by the applicant to assure turbine disk integrity and a low probability of turbine disk failure with the generation of missiles. The following areas of the applicantts safety analysis report (SAR) relating to turbine disk integrity are reviewed: 1. Materials Selection The <b>low-pressure</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> assembly usually consists of a rotor shaft with shrunk-on disks. Low-pressure disk stresses are due to thermal gradients, the interference fit, and centrifugal forces. These stresses are relatively high. The low-pressure turbine operates at lower temperatures than the high-pressure turbine. Thus, it is particularly important that low-pressure disks be made of a tough material. The use of suitable design, materials, and inservice inspection can greatly reduce the probability of a turbine disk failure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed experimental {{investigation of the}} evolution of secondary flow field characteristics and the losses at several measurement planes downstream of a highly loaded low pressure turbine/outlet guide vane (LPT/OGV). The experiments are conducted in a linear cascade equipped with a boundary-layer suction system designed at Chalmers in Sweden. The aerodynamic function of the LPT/OGV's is to turn the swirling flow out from the last <b>low-pressure</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> into an axial direction. This de-swirling gives a diffusive flow with growing boundary layers, strong secondary flows, and risk for separation both on vanes and end-walls. Important parameters that influence the secondary flow-field are the upstream boundary-layer height, the Re-number and the inlet incidence. All these parameters together with the turbulence intensity can be adjusted in the test-facility in order to encounter engine like conditions. In the final paper several upstream realistic incidences and turbulence intensities are investigated for one Reynolds number. Downstream characteristics have been measured by means of a 5 -hole pneumatic probe. It allows for the determination of the mean vortical structures, their development and their interactions. The trailing edge vortices, the two branches of the passage vortex and the corner vortex are clearly visible close to the blade trailing edge. They merge and grow into a single large vortical structure further downstream. Their intensity is shown to be strongly dependent on the incidence. The turbulence level seems to play a role on the mixing inside and between the structures. The measurements also show the dependence of the losses and the mean outlet flow angles along the blade span on the vortices development...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} effectiveness {{increase of}} the TPP heat-mechanical equipment repair, manufacturing and maintenance as exemplified by gas-thermal technique for hardening laststages rotor blades of the steam turbines. The rotor blades work under conditions of intense power loading, their airfoil being erosion-corrosion destructed {{by the action of}} the moist-steam flow. Repairing companies employ quite a number of technologies to restore some of erosion-worn rotor blades. Inter alia, argon-arc, plasma and gas-powder weld deposition of the original material with subsequent machining, stellite protection recovery, electrical spark alloying the entry edge mat surface, spraying ion-plasma coating on the blade airfoil surface. In domestic turbine building, rotor blades of the steam turbines last stages are manufactured of martensitic class stainless steel. The key condition for successful blade restoration is thermal effect minimizing on the base material for excluding the slag areas possible forming. The laser surface coating technology provides these conditions. They coat the surface of an item being processed by way of melting the base and the adding material. In as much the base melts smallest, the coating characteristics depend mainly on the properties of adding material. The procedure of laser coating passes through several stages including physical contact creation, chemical interaction (laser radiation absorption), volumetrical processes resulting in formation of stable bonds in volume of the materials that have reacted. For the <b>low-pressure</b> cylinder <b>rotor</b> blades supplementary protection against erosion destruction, LLC ‘Technological Systems of Protective Coating’ developed technology of the blade airfoil protective finish by method of high-speed gas-flame sputter. The company realized this technology in 2012 during K- 200 - 12, 8 turbine (of the Leningrad Metallurgical Works – LMZ) repairing in Zainsk SDPP by JSC ‘Tatenergo’. The feature of the technology is performing the rotor blade airfoil surface hardening without extracting the rotor out of the low-pressure cylinder and with rotor blades remaining on the rotor. According the SDPP data, as for the beginning of 2015 there are no traces of the rotor blade erosive wear detected.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) in the blade attachment region of <b>low-pressure</b> (LP) turbine <b>rotors</b> {{has emerged as}} one of the most significant problems affecting both nuclear and fossil steam turbines today. To assist turbine operators in evaluating the remaining life of LP rotors with known or suspected cracking, an easy-to-use PC-based computer program, LPRimLife, was developed for EPRI by Structural Integrity Associates. The first phase of development, incorporating the methodology for evaluating cracking in GE dovetail (straddle-mount) attachments, was completed in 1999 [1]. The second phase, which included evaluation of cracking in Westinghouse axial-entry (steeple) attachments, was completed in 2000 [2]. The third phase, to address cracking in GE multi pin-finger attachments is currently under way. Since initial development, the LPRimLife computer code has been successfully employed at nuclear and fossil plants, providing the basis for deferring or eliminating major unscheduled and costly repairs, such as “pressure plating ” which would have significantly extended the outages. Deferring unscheduled repairs for even one more fuel cycle allows for advance planning to evaluate and select the most-effective repair/replacement option and lead time needed for procurement of appropriate materials/services. In today’s competitive marketplace with evertightening outage schedules, timely application of LPRimLife has resulted in significant cost savings to utilities.
