The areal density of flash memory is {{doubling}} every two years, similar to Moore's law (40% per year) {{and faster than}} the 10–20% per year for HDDs. As of 2016, maximum capacity was 10terabytes for an HDD, and 15terabytes for an SSD. HDDs were used in 70% of the desktop and notebook computers produced in 2016, and SSDs were used in 30%. The usage share of HDDs is declining and could drop below 50% in 2018–2019 according to one forecast, because SSDs are replacing smaller-capacity (less than one-terabyte) HDDs in desktop and notebook computers and MP3 players.|$|E

In <b>laboratory</b> <b>demonstrations</b> motivated by foghorn issues, Tyndall established that sound is partially reflected (i.e. partially bounced back like an echo) at the location where an air mass of one temperature meets another air mass of a different temperature; and more generally when a body of air contains two or more air masses of different densities or temperatures, the sound travels poorly because of reflections occurring at the interfaces between the air masses, and very poorly when many such interfaces are present. (He then argued, though inconclusively, {{that this is the}} usual main reason why the same distant sound, e.g. foghorn, can be heard stronger or fainter on different days or at different times of day.) ...|$|E
