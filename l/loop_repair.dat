40|$|AbstractIn human cells, {{mismatch}} {{recognition is}} mediated by a heterodimeric complex, hMutSα, comprised of {{two members of}} the MutS homolog (MSH) family of proteins, hMSH 2 and GTBP [1, 2]. Correspondingly, tumour-derived cell lines defective in hMSH 2 and GTBP have a mutator phenotype [3, 4], and extracts prepared from these cells lack mismatch-binding activity [1]. However, although hMSH 2 mutant cell lines showed considerable microsatellite instability in tracts of mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeats [4, 5], only mononucleotide repeats were somewhat unstable in GTBP mutants [4, 6]. These findings, together with data showing that extracts of cells lacking GTBP are partially proficient in the repair of two-nucleotide loops [2], suggested that <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> can be GTBP-independent. We show here that hMSH 2 can also heterodimerize with a third human MSH family member, hMSH 3, and that this complex, hMutSβ, binds loops of one to four extrahelical bases. Our data further suggest that hMSH 3 and GTBP are redundant in <b>loop</b> <b>repair,</b> and help explain why only mutations in hMSH 2, and not in GTBP or hMSH 3, segregate with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) [7]...|$|E

It usually occurs in postmenopausal or multiparous women, after {{one or more}} vaginal operations. Most often the precipitating event for small bowel evisceration is sexual intercourse in premenopausal women, and increased intraabdominal pressure in postmenopausal women.

40|$|Sequence {{divergence}} {{reduces the}} frequency of recombination, {{a process that is}} dependent on the activity of the mismatch repair system. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, repair of mismatches results in gene conversion or restoration, whereas failure to repair mismatches results in postmeiotic segregation (PMS). By examining the conversion and PMS in yeast strains deficient in various MMR genes and heterozygous for large inserts (107 bp) with either a mixed sequence or a 39 (CA/TG) repetitive microsatellite sequence, we demonstrate that: (1) the inhibition of conversion by large inserts depends upon a complex containing both Msh 2 and Pms 1 proteins; (2) conversion is not inhibited if the single-stranded DNA loop in the heteroduplex is the microsatellite sequence; and (3) large heteroduplex loops with random sequence or repetitive sequence might be repaired by two complexes, containing either Msh 2 or Pms 1. Our results suggest that inhibition of recombination by heterologous inserts and large <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> are not processed by the same MMR complexes. We propose that the inhibition of conversion by large inserts is due to recognition by the Msh 2 /Pms 1 complex of mismatches created by intrastrand interactions in the heteroduplex loop...|$|E
40|$|Small looped mispairs are {{corrected}} by DNA mismatch repair (MMR). In addition, a distinct process called large <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> (LLR) corrects loops {{up to several}} hundred nucleotides in extracts of bacteria, yeast or human cells. Although LLR activity can be readily demonstrated, {{there has been little}} progress in identifying its protein components. This study identified some of the yeast proteins responsible for DNA repair synthesis during LLR. Polyclonal antisera to either Pol 31 or Pol 32 subunits of polymerase δ efficiently inhibited LLR in extracts by blocking repair just prior to gap filling. Gap filling was inhibited regardless of whether the loop was retained or removed. These experiments suggest polymerase δ is uniquely required in yeast extracts for LLR-associated synthesis. Similar results were obtained with antisera to the clamp loader proteins Rfc 3 and Rfc 4, and to PCNA, i. e. LLR was inhibited just prior to gap filling for both loop removal and loop retention. Thus PCNA and RFC seem to act in LLR only during repair synthesis, in contrast to their roles at both pre- and post-excision steps of MMR. These biochemical experiments support the idea that yeast polymerase δ, RFC and PCNA are required for large loop DNA repair synthesis...|$|E

In addition, a distinct process called large <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> (LLR) corrects heteroduplexes {{up to several}} hundred nucleotides in bacteria, yeast and human cells, and in cell-free extracts. Only some LLR protein components are known, however. Previous studies with neutralizing antibodies suggested a role for yeast DNA polymerase (Pol), RFC and PCNA in LLR repair synthesis. In the current study, biochemical fractionation studies identified FEN 1 (Rad 27) as another required LLR component. In the presence of purified FEN 1, Pol, RFC and PCNA, repair occurred on heteroduplexes with loops ranging from 8 to 216 nt. Repair utilized a 52 ̆ 7 nick, with correction directed to the nicked strand, irrespective of which strand contained the loop. In contrast, repair of a G/T mismatch occurred at low levels, suggesting specificity of the reconstituted system for looped mispairs. The presence of RPA enhanced reactivity on some looped substrates, but RPA was not required for activity. Although additional LLR factors remain to be identified, the excision and resynthesis steps of LLR from a 52 ̆ 7 nick can be reconstituted in a purified system with FEN 1 and Pol, together with PCNA and its loader RFC...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that heteroduplexes containing single-stranded <b>loops</b> are <b>repaired</b> efficiently in monkey cells, {{but not always}} correctly: 2 % of the repair products acquired mutations within a 350 base-pair target (Weiss, U. and Wilson, J. H., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 : 1123 - 1126, 1987). The structures of the mutant genomes, which are described here, are consistent with an error-prone repair system. The spectrum of mutations includes about 25 % point mutations and 75 % rearrangements, which consist of deletions, duplications, and substitutions. The mutations are clustered {{in the vicinity of}} single-stranded loops in the original heteroduplex. The high frequency of mutation, their clustering, and the positions of rearrangement endpoints suggest that the mutations were generated during repair of the heteroduplexes...|$|R
40|$|In vitro-constructed {{heteroduplex}} DNAs with defined mismatches were corrected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{cells with}} efficiencies that were {{dependent on the}} mismatch. Single-nucleotide <b>loops</b> were <b>repaired</b> very efficiently; the base/base mismatches G/T, A/C, G/G, A/G, G/A, A/A, T/T, T/C, and C/T were repaired with a high to intermediate efficiency. The mismatch C/C and a 38 -nucleotide loop were corrected with low efficiency. This substrate specificity pattern resembles that found in Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting an evolutionary relationship of DNA mismatch repair in pro- and eucaryotes. Repair of the listed mismatches was severely impaired in the putative S. cerevisiae DNA mismatch repair mutants pms 1 and pms 2. Low-efficiency repair also characterized pms 3 strains, except that correction of single-nucleotide loops occurred with an efficiency close to that of PMS wild-type strains. A close correlation {{was found between the}} repair efficiencies determined in this study and the observed postmeiotic segregation frequencies of alleles with known DNA sequence. This suggests an involvement of DNA mismatch repair in recombination and gene conversion in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} a new half hitch loop suture configuration on flexor tendon repair mechanics. Cadaver canine flexor digitorum profundus tendons were repaired with 4 - or 8 -strands, 4 - 0 or 3 - 0 suture, with and without half hitch loops. An additional group underwent repair with half hitch loops but without the terminal knot. Half hitch loops improved the strength of 8 -strand repairs by 21 % when 4 - 0, and 33 % when 3 - 0 suture was used, and caused a shift in failure mode from suture pullout to suture breakage. 8 -strand repairs with half hitch loops but without a terminal knot produced equivalent mechanical properties to those without half hitch loops but with a terminal knot. 4 -strand repairs were limited by the strength of the suture in all groups and, as a result, the presence of half hitch loops did not alter the mechanical properties. Overall, half hitch <b>loops</b> improved <b>repair</b> mechanics, allowing failure strength to reach the full capability of suture strength. Improving the mechanical properties of flexor tendon repair with half hitch loops has the potential to reduce the postoperative risk of gap formation and catastrophic rupture in the early postoperative period...|$|R
40|$|During meiotic {{recombination}} in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heteroduplex DNA is formed when single-stranded DNAs from two homologs anneal {{as a consequence}} of strand invasion. If the two DNA strands differ in sequence, a mismatch will be generated. Mismatches in heteroduplex DNA are recognized and repaired efficiently by meiotic DNA mismatch repair systems. Components of two meiotic systems, mismatch repair (MMR) and large <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> (LLR), have been identified previously, but the substrate range of these repair systems has never been defined. To determine the substrates for the MMR and LLR repair pathways, we constructed insertion mutations at HIS 4 that form loops of varying sizes when complexed with wild-type HIS 4 sequence during meiotic heteroduplex DNA formation. We compared the frequency of repair during meiosis in wild-type diploids and in diploids lacking components of either MMR or LLR. We find that the LLR pathway does not act on single-stranded DNA loops of 19, nucleotides in length, indicating that the two pathways overlap slightly in their substrate range during meiosis. Our data reveal differences in mitotic and meiotic MMR and LLR; these may be due to alterations in the functioning of each complex or result from subtle sequence context influences on repair of the various mismatches examined...|$|E
40|$|In {{the human}} DNA {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) system, hMSH 2 forms the hMutSalpha and hMutSbeta complexes with hMSH 6 and hMSH 3, respectively, whereas hMLH 1 and hPMS 2 form the hMutLalpha heterodimer. These complexes, {{together with other}} components in the MMR system, correct single-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion loops that occur during DNA replication. Microsatellite instability (MSI) occurs when the loops in DNA microsatellites are not corrected because of a malfunctioning MMR system. Low-frequency MSI (MSI-L) is seen in some chronically inflamed tissues {{in the absence of}} genetic inactivation of the MMR system. We hypothesize that oxidative stress associated with chronic inflammation might damage protein components of the MMR system, leading to its functional inactivation. In this study, we demonstrate that noncytotoxic levels of H 2 O 2 inactivate both single-base mismatch and <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> activities of the MMR system in a dose-dependent fashion. On the basis of in vitro complementation assays using recombinant MMR proteins, we show that this inactivation is most likely due to oxidative damage to hMutSalpha, hMutSbeta, and hMutLalpha protein complexes. We speculate that inactivation of the MMR function in response to oxidative stress may be responsible for the MSI-L seen in nonneoplastic and cancer tissues associated with chronic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Null {{mutations}} in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes elevate both base substitutions and insertions/ deletions in simple sequence repeats. Data suggest that during replication of simple repeat sequences, poly-merase slippage can generate single-strand loops {{on either the}} primer or template strand that are subsequently processed by the MMR machinery to prevent insertions and deletions, respectively. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, MMR {{appears to be more}} efficient at repairing mispairs comprised of loops on the template strand compared to loops on the primer strand. We identified two novel yeast pms 1 alleles, pms 1 -G 882 E and pms 1 -H 888 R, which confer a strong defect in the repair of “primer strand” loops, while maintaining efficient repair of “template strand ” loops. Furthermore, these alleles appear to affect equally the repair of 1 -nucleotide primer strand loops during both leading- and lagging-strand replication. Interestingly, both pms 1 mutants are proficient in the repair of 1 -nucleotide loop mispairs in heteroduplex DNA generated during meiotic recombination. Our results suggest that the inherent inefficiency of primer strand <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> is not simply a mismatch recognition problem but also involves Pms 1 and other proteins that are presumed to function downstream of mismatch recognition, such as Mlh 1. In addition, the findings reinforce the current view that during mutation avoidance, MMR is associated with the replication apparatus. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) contributes to genomic in...|$|E

40|$|Defective {{mismatch}} repair (MMR) in humans {{is associated with}} colon cancer and instability of microsatellites, that is, DNA sequences with one or several nucleotides repeated. Key factors of eukaryotic MMR are the heterodimers MutSα (Msh 2 -Msh 6), which recognizes base-base mismatches and unpaired nucleotides in DNA, and MutLα (Mlh 1 -Pms 1), which facilitates downstream steps. In addition, MutSβ (Msh 2 -Msh 3) recognizes DNA loops of various sizes, although our previous data and the data presented here suggest that Msh 3 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe does not {{play a role in}} MMR. To test microsatellite stability in S. pombe and hence DNA <b>loop</b> <b>repair,</b> we have inserted tetra-, penta-, and hepta-nucleotide repeats in the ade 6 gene and determined their Ade+ reversion rates and spectra in wild type and various mutants. Our data indicate that loops with four unpaired nucleotides in the nascent and the template strand are the upper limit of MutSα- and MutLα-mediated MMR in S. pombe. Stability of hepta-nucleotide repeats requires Msh 3 and Exo 1 in MMR-independent processes as well as the DNA repair proteins Rad 50, Rad 51, and Rad 2 FEN 1. Most strikingly, mutation rates in the double mutants msh 3 exo 1 and msh 3 rad 51 were decreased when compared to respective single mutants, indicating that Msh 3 prevents error prone processes carried out by Exo 1 and Rad 51. We conclude that Msh 3 has no obvious function in MMR in S. pombe, but contributes to DNA repeat stability in MMR-independent processes...|$|E
40|$|Double-strand break (DSB) induced gene {{conversion}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during meiosis and MAT switching is mediated primarily by mismatch repair of heteroduplex DNA (hDNA). We used nontandem ura 3 duplications containing palindromic frameshift insertion mutations near an HO nuclease recognition site {{to test whether}} mismatch repair also mediates DSB-induced mitotic {{gene conversion}} at a non-MAT locus. Palindromic insertions included in hDNA are expected to produce a stem-loop mismatch, escape repair, and segregate to produce a sectored (Ura+/-) colony. If conversion occurs by gap repair, the insertion should be removed on both strands, and converted colonies will not be sectored. For both a 14 -bp palindrome, and a 37 -bp near-palindrome, approximately 75 % of recombinant colonies were sectored, indicating that most DSB-induced mitotic gene conversion involves mismatch repair of hDNA. We also investigated mismatch repair of well-repaired markers flanking an unrepaired palindrome. As seen in previous studies, these additional markers increased <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> (likely reflecting corepair). Among sectored products, few had additional segregating markers, indicating {{that the lack of}} repair at one marker is not associated with inefficient repair at nearby markers. Clear evidence was obtained for low levels of short tract mismatch repair. As seen with full gene conversions, donor alleles in sectored products were not altered. Markers {{on the same side of}} the DSB as the palindrome were involved in hDNA less often among sectored products than nonsectored products, but markers on the opposite side of the DSB showed similar hDNA involvement among both product classes. These results can be explained in terms of corepair, and they suggest that mismatch repair on opposite sides of a DSB involves distinct repair tracts...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} ability of {{recombinant}} hMutSalpha (hMSH 2 /hMSH 6) and hMutSbeta (hMSH 2 /hMSH 3) heterodimers to complement the mismatch repair defect of HEC 59, a human cancer cell line whose extracts lack all three MutS homologues. Although repair of both base/base mispairs and insertion-deletion loops was restored by hMutSalpha, only the latter substrates were addressed in extracts supplemented with hMutSbeta. hMutSalpha was also able to complement a defect in the repair of base/base mispairs in CHO R and HL 60 R cell extracts. In these cells, methotrexate-induced amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) locus, which also contains the MSH 3 gene, led to an overexpression of MSH 3 and thus to {{a dramatic change in}} the relative levels of MutSalpha and MutSbeta. As a rule, MSH 2 is primarily complexed with MSH 6. MutSalpha is thus relatively abundant in mammalian cell extracts, whereas MutSbeta levels are generally low. In contrast, in cells that overexpress MSH 3, the available MSH 2 protein is sequestered predominantly into MutSbeta. This leads to degradation of the partnerless MSH 6 and depletion of MutSalpha. CHO R and HL 60 R cells therefore lack correction of base/base mispairs, whereas <b>loop</b> <b>repair</b> is maintained by MutSbeta. Consequently, frameshift mutations in CHO R are rare, whereas transitions and transversions are acquired at a rate two orders of magnitude above background. Our data thus support and extend the findings of Drummond et al. [Drummond, J. T., Genschel, J., Wolf, E. & Modrich, P. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We identify 1, 415 tandem duplications that are segregating in D. yakuba {{as well as}} 975 duplications in D. simulans, indicating greater variation in D. yakuba. Additionally, we observe high rates of secondary deletions at duplicated sites, with 8 % of duplicated sites in D. simulans and 17 % of sites in D. yakuba modified with deletions. These secondary deletions {{are consistent with the}} action of the large <b>loop</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> system acting to remove polymorphic tandem duplication, resulting in rapid dynamics of gain and loss in duplicated alleles and a richer substrate of genetic novelty than has been previously reported. Most duplications are present in only single strains, suggesting deleterious impacts are common. D. simulans shows larger numbers of whole gene duplications in comparison to larger proportions of gene fragments in D. yakuba. D. simulans displays an excess of high frequency variants on the X chromosome, consistent with adaptive evolution through duplications on the D. simulans X or demographic forces driving duplicates to high frequency. We identify 78 chimeric genes in D. yakuba and 38 chimeric genes in D. simulans, as well as 143 cases of recruited non-coding sequence in D. yakuba and 96 in D. simulans, in agreement with rates of chimeric gene origination in D. melanogaster. Together, these results suggest that tandem duplications often result in complex variation beyond whole gene duplications that offers a rich substrate of standing variation that is likely to contribute both to detrimental phenotypes and disease, as well as to adaptive evolutionary change.

40|$|Mismatch <b>repair</b> of {{palindromic}} <b>loops</b> in {{the presence}} or absence of single-base mismatches was investigated in wild-type and mismatch-binding defective mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombination intermediates with a maximum heteroduplex DNA (hDNA) region of 697 bp contained a centrally located, phenotypically silent 12 -base palindromic loop mismatch, and/or five single-base mismatches. In wild-type cells, both loops and single-base mismatches were efficiently repaired (80 - 100 %). When no other mismatches were present in hDNA, loops were retained with a 1. 6 - 1. 9 : 1 bias. However, this bias was eliminated when single-base mismatches were present, perhaps because single-base mismatches signal nick-directed repair. In the multiple marker crosses, most repair tracts were long and continuous, with preferential loss of markers in cis to proximal nicks, consistent with nicks directing most repair in this situation. However, approximately 25 % of repair tracts were discontinuous as a result of loop-specific repair, or from segregation or short tract repair of single-base mismatches. In mutant cells, single-base mismatches were repaired less frequently, but the <b>loop</b> was still <b>repaired</b> efficiently and with bias toward loop retention, indicating that the defect in these cells does not affect loop-specific repair. Repair tracts in products from mutant cells showed a wide variety of mosaic patterns reflecting short regions of repair and segregation consistent with reduced nick-directed repair.

We compared short- and medium-term outcomes of neochordal (“loop”) versus edge-to-edge (“Alfieri”) minimally invasive MV repair {{in patients with}} Barlow’s disease. Methods. From January 2009 to April 2014, 123 consecutive patients with Barlow’s disease (defined as bileaflet billowing or prolapse [or both], excessive leaflet tissue, and annular dilatation with or without calcifica- tion) underwent minimally invasive MV operations for severe mitral regurgitation (MR) at our institution. Three patients (2. 4 %) underwent MV replacement {{during the study period}} and were excluded from subsequent anal- ysis. The <b>loop</b> MV <b>repair</b> technique was used in 68 pa- tients (55. 3 %) and an edge-to-edge repair was performed in 44 patients (35. 8 %). Patients who underwent a combi- nation of these 2 techniques (n [8 [6. 5 %]) were excluded. The median age was 48 years, and 62. 5 % of patients were men. Concomitant procedures included closure of a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect (n [19), tricuspid valve repair (n [5), and atrial fibril- lation ablation (n [15). Follow-up was performed 24. 7 ± 17 months postoperatively and was 98 % complete. Results. No deaths occurred perioperatively or during follow-up. Aortic cross-clamp time (64. 1 ± 17. 6 minutes versus 95. 9 ± 29. 5 minutes) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (110. 0 ± 24. 2 minutes versus 146. 4 ± 39. 1 mi- nutes) were significantly shorter (p < 0. 001) in patients who received edge-to-edge repair. Although patients who underwent edge-to-edge repair received a larger annulo- plasty ring (38. 6 ± 1. 5 mm versus 35. 8 ± 2. 7 mm; p < 0. 001), the early postoperative resting mean gradients were higher(3. 3 ± 1. 2 mmHgversus 2. 6 ± 1. 2 mmHg;p[0. 007) and the mitral orifice area tended to be smaller in this group (2. 8 ± 0. 7 cm 2 versus 3. 0 ± 0. 7 cm 2; p [0. 06). The amount of residual MR was similar between groups (0. 3 ± 0. 6 versus 0. 6 ± 1. 0 for edge-to-edge versus loop procedures, respectively; p [0. 08). More than mild MR requiring early MV reoperation was present in 3 patients who underwent loop procedures (4. 4 %) and in no patients who had edge-to-edge procedures (p [0. 51). During follow-up, 2 patients (1 in each group) required MV replacement for severe MR. The 4 -year freedom from MV reoperation was 92. 8 % ± 5. 0 % in the Alfieri group compared with 90. 9 % ± 4. 6 % in the loop group (p [0. 94). Conclusions. Minimally invasive MV repair can be accomplished with excellent early and medium-term outcomes in patients with Barlow’s disease. The edge- to-edge (Alfieri) repair can be performed with reduced operative times when compared with the loop technique, but it results in mildly increased transvalvular gradients and mildly decreased valve opening areas without any difference in residual MR...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to the elucidation of time-dose- and if applicable linear energy transfer (LET) effects in the cellular response to ion or photon radiation. In particular, the common concept of the Local Effect Model (LEM) and the Giant Loop Binary Lesion (GLOBLE) model, which explains cell survival probabilities on the hand of clustering of double-strand breaks (DSB) in micrometer-sized sub-structural units of the DNA, was investigated with regard to temporal aspects. In previous studies with the LEM and GLOBLE model, it has been demonstrated that the definition of two lesion classes, characterized by single or multiple DSB in a DNA giant <b>loop,</b> with two <b>repair</b> fidelities is adequate to comprehensively describe the dose dependence of the cellular response to instantaneous photon irradiation or ion irradiation with varying LET. Furthermore, with the GLOBLE model for photon radiation, {{it has been shown that}} the assignment of two repair time scales to the two lesion classes allows to adequately reproduce time-dose effects after photon irradiation with an arbitrary constant dose-rate. In this work, the results of four projects that strengthen the mechanistic consistency and the practical applicability of the LEM and GLOBLE model will be presented. First, it was found that the GLOBLE model is applicable to describe time-dose effects in the cellular response to two split photon doses and in the occurrence of deterministic radiation effects. Second, in a comparison of ten models for the temporal course of DSB rejoining, it was revealed that a bi-exponential approach, as suggested by the LEM and GLOBLE model, finds a relatively large support by 61 experimental data sets. Third, in a comparison of four kinetic photon cell survival models that was based on fits to 13 dose-rate experiments, it was shown that the GLOBLE model performs well with respect to e. g. accuracy, parsimony, reliability and other factors that characterize a good approach. Last but not least, the dynamic concept of two time scales of cellular repair was introduced in the LEM. The consistency of predictions with this new kinetic model for ion radiation effects was verified and an agreement with experimental data was detected. In summary, the theoretical evidence that the time-dose-LET-dependence of the cellular response to radiation is explicable with radiation-characteristic damage distribution patterns on micrometer-scale was affirmed...|$|R
