40|$|A coupled {{numerical}} {{approach is}} investigated for predicting combustion instability limit cycle characteristics when the combustor contains a <b>long</b> <b>flame.</b> The test {{case is the}} ORACLES combustor, with a turbulent premixed flame a metre long: it exhibits limit cycle oscillations at ∼ 50 Hz and normalised velocity amplitude ahead of the flame of ∼ 0. 29. The approach obtains the flame response to acoustic excitation using Large Eddy Simulations (LES), and couples this with a low-order wave-based network representation for the acoustic waves within the combustor. The flame cannot be treated as acoustically compact; the spatial distribution of both its response and the subsequent effect on the acoustics must be accounted for. The <b>long</b> <b>flame</b> is uniformly segmented axially, each segment being much shorter than the flow wavelengths at play. A series of “local” flame describing functions, one for the heat release rate response within each segment to velocity forcing at a fixed reference location, are extracted from the LES. These use the Computational Fluid Dynamics toolbox, OpenFOAM, with an incompressible approximation for the flow-field and combustion modelled using the Partially Stirred Reactor model with a global onestep reaction mechanism. For coupling with the low-order acoustic network modelling, compact acoustic jump conditions are derived and applied across each flame segment, while between flame segments, wave propagation occurs. Limit cycle predictions from the proposed coupled method agree well with those predicted using the continuous 1 -D linearised Euler equations, validating the flame segmentation implementation. Limit cycle predictions (frequency 51. 6 Hz and amplitude 0. 38) also agree well with experimental measurements, validating the low-order coupled method as a prediction tool for combustors with long flames. A sensitivity analysis shows that the predicted limit cycle amplitude decreases rapidly when acoustic losses at boundaries are accounted for, and increases if combustor heat losses downstream of the flame are accounted for. This motivates more accurate determination of combustor boundary and temperature behaviour for thermoacoustic predictions...|$|E

30|$|Although fire {{of higher}} {{intensity}} and severity {{may be important}} for successful aspen regeneration, localized high heat loads associated with <b>long</b> <b>flame</b> residence times appear to have occurred at some sites (e.g., BUT) where large logs were present and probably contributed to lower post-fire aspen regeneration. We observed that, where fire consumed the duff layer, aspen roots were exposed, burned, and killed, and thus were unable to regenerate post-fire; whereas, areas within the same transect (< 10 m apart) with intact duff had successful aspen regeneration. This could not be observed or quantified for the older burns, so we could not analyze this systematically. However, on the adjacent Lassen National Forest, Jones et al. (2005) observed a similar absence of post-fire aspen regeneration in areas where slash piles were burned, possibly because the fire intensity and residence time killed the aspen roots. In declining, small aspen groves with heavy fuel loading, mechanical treatment (including removal of activity fuels) may be beneficial prior to burning, and regeneration may need initial protection from browse until stems reach heights of greater than 150 cm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Four {{kinds of}} {{commercial}} activated carbons were soaked in sodium hydroxide after modification with 10 % nitric acid.

The surface groups were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Boehm titration, the adsorption properties were determined by the iodine number and methylene blue number, the pHIEP were deduced by the Zeta potential analyzer. The results showed that nitric acid blocks the pore, while enhances the content of acid groups, especially carboxyl resulting in the decrease of nickel adsorption capacity. After sodium hydroxide treatment, the nickel capacity of activated carbon from anthracite, <b>long</b> <b>flame</b> coal, lignite and coconut increased by 21. 5 %, 116 %, 78. 9 %, 89. 1 % comparing with the virgin activated carbon, respectively.

40|$|A multi-dimensional {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed for the unsteady state oscillatory combustion of solid propellants subject to acoustic pressure disturbances. Including the gas phase unsteady effects, the assumption of uniform pressure across the flame zone, which has been conventionally used, is relaxed so that a higher frequency response in the <b>long</b> <b>flame</b> of a double-base propellant can be calculated. The formulation {{is based on a}} premixed, laminar flame with a one-step overall chemical reaction and the Arrhenius law of decomposition with no condensed phase reaction. In a given geometry, the Galerkin finite element solution shows the strong resonance and damping effect at the lower frequencies, similar to the result of Denison and Baum. Extended studies deal with the higher frequency region where the pressure varies in the flame thickness. The nonlinear system behavior is investigated by carrying out the second order expansion in wave amplitude when the acoustic pressure oscillations are finite in amplitude. Offset in the burning rate shows a negative sign in the whole frequency region considered, and it verifies the experimental results of Price. Finally, the velocity coupling in the two-dimensional model is discussed...|$|E

Using data from 1961 - 2002, we examine whether the courts of appeals are influenced by public mood, both indirectly through the federal judicial selection process and directly via responsiveness to changes in circuit and national mood. Our results indicate that public opinion affects courts of appeals decision making indirectly by way of judicial replacements, but we fail to uncover evidence that courts of appeals judges respond directly to changes in public opinion at either the regional or national levels. We conclude that, absent membership turnover, the courts of appeals are not responsive to the will of the public...|$|R
