5|$|The {{primary role}} of the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted lipid monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple lipid vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two lipid bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of {{two layers}} of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer,</b> as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> is {{very thin}} {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, neutron scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{membranes}} {{are composed}} mainly of phospholipids {{which are in}} turn, composed of five major chemical elements: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. Recent studies have suggested the possibility of sustaining life if the phosphorus is substituted by arsenic. Although this issue is still controversial, it is of interest to investigate the properties of arsenated-lipid bilayers to evaluate this possibility. In this study, we simulated arsenated-lipid, 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -arsenocholine (POAC), <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> using all-atom molecular dynamics to understand basic structural and dynamical properties, in particular, the differences from analogous 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine, (POPC) <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> Our simulations showed that POAC <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> have distinct structural and dynamical properties from those of native POPC <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> Relative to POPC <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers,</b> POAC <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> have a more compact structure with smaller lateral areas and greater order.

40|$|A {{new energy}} for the {{description}} of large deformations of <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> is formulated with mathematical rigor. This energy is derived by considering the smectic A liquid crystalline nature of <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> and the coupling between the deformations of the layers and their constituent lipid molecules. Analogies between smectic A liquid crystals, with {{an infinite number of}} layers, and <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers,</b> with a finite number of layers, are further discussed. The novelty of the energy density is demonstrated by studying the large deformations of planar <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> induced by cylindrical inclusions. The results of this study are directly compared with the results obtained using May's theoretical framework [May, Eur. Biophys. J., 2000, 29, 17 – 28] in which small deformations are assumed. As expected, the proposed energy density predicts larger distortions of the lipid molecules and deformations of the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> close to an inclusion...|$|R

5|$|A {{supported}} <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> (SLB) {{as described}} above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs.

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extensive}} research and use in medical practice, the precise molecular mechanism of volatile anesthetic action remains unknown. The distribution of anesthetics within <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> and potential targeting to membrane proteins {{is thought to}} be central to therapeutic function. Therefore, obtaining a molecular level understanding of volatile anesthetic partitioning into <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> is of vital importance to modern pharmacology. In this study we investigate the partitioning of the prototypical anesthetic, chloroform, into <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> and different organic solvents using molecular dynamics simulations with potential models ranging from simplified coarse-grained MARTINI to additive and polarizable CHARMM all-atom force fields. Many volatile anesthetics display significant inducible dipole moments, which correlate with their potency, yet the exact role of molecular polarizability in their stabilization within <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> remains unknown. We observe that explicit treatment of atomic polarizability makes it possible to accurately reproduce solvation free energies in solvents with different polarities, allowing for quantitative studies in heterogeneous molecular distributions, such as <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> We calculate the free energy profiles for chloroform crossing <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> to reveal a role of polarizability in modulating chloroform partitioning thermodynamics via the chloroform-induced dipole moment and highlight competitive binding to the membrane core and toward the glycerol backbone that may have significant implications for understanding anesthetic action...|$|R
40|$|The pentraxins are {{a family}} of highly conserved plasma {{proteins}} of metazoans known to function in immune defence. The canonical members, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid P component, {{have been identified in}} arthropods and humans. Mammalian pentraxins are known to bind <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers,</b> and a pentraxin representative from the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, binds and permeabilizes mammalian erythrocytes. Both activities are Ca(2 +) -dependent. Utilizing model liposomes and planar <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers,</b> in the present study we have investigated the membrane-active properties of the three pentraxin representatives from Limulus and show that all of the Limulus pentraxins permeabilize <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> Mechanistically, Limulus C-reactive protein forms transmembrane pores in asymmetric planar <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> that mimic the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and exhibits a Ca(2 +) -independent form of membrane binding that may be sufficient for pore formation...|$|R
5|$|In some archaea, the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse the tails of two phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
5|$|The organelles of the endomembrane {{system are}} related through direct contact {{or by the}} {{transfer}} of membrane segments as vesicles. Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. The thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, they may be modified {{several times during the}} membrane's life. One unifying characteristic the membranes share is a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer,</b> with proteins attached to either side or traversing them.|$|E
5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> {{can exist}} in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the lipid molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given lipid will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows lipid to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E

Due to the solid support, the {{properties}} of supported <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> {{are different from those}} of freestanding bilayers. In this article, we examine whether different surface treatments affect the properties of supported <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> It will be shown that depending on the treatment method, the diffusion of the lipids can be adjusted approximately threefold without altering the composition. Additionally, as the bilayer-support interaction decreases, it becomes easier to form coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains. The physical/chemical alterations that result from the different treatment methods will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The kinetic {{characteristics}} of the opening and closing of the excitability-inducing material (EIM) channel in oxidized cholesterol and in brain <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> are compared. The kinetics of the opening and closing of individual ion-conducting channels in bilayers doped with small amounts of EIM are determined from discrete fluctuations in ionic current. The kinetics for approach to steady-state conductance are determined for <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> containing many channels. Steady-state and kinetic characteristics for the EIM channel incorporated in brain <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> can {{be accounted for by}} the model developed for the EIM channel incorporated in oxidized cholesterol membranes. Relaxation time, calculated from rate constants of single-channel membranes or directly measured in many-channel membranes is strongly temperature dependent, and is always shorter in brain lipid membranes. Changes in temperature do not affect the interaction of the electric field and the open channel, but the open configuration of the EIM channel in brain <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> is stabilized with increasing temperature. The configurational energy difference between the open and closed channel, calculated from temperature studies, is larger in brain <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> The energy barrier which separates the two configurations of the channel is larger in oxidized cholesterol bilayers...|$|R
40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the effect of the peripheral proteins on physical properties of <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers.</b> The ten-state Pink model, which is originally proposed to describe the main transition of pure saturated <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers,</b> is extended in order to examine both one-component <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> and binary <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> containing peripheral proteins. The peripheral protein is introduced as a positively charged cylinder which covers seven lipid chains and the protein-lipid interaction is assumed to be mainly electrostatic. Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations are performed to describe the thermodynamic properties of the model including lipid-protein interaction in terms of order parameters and microconfigurations. The calculations are carried out for two minimal models where the protein concentration in the bilayer surface is either fixed or varies as the external conditions are changed. The basic phase behavior of lipid-protein systems are presented for each model. In both models, the lipid-protein interaction manifests itself by changes in the physical and thermodynamic properties of <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> and protein aggregation in the main transition region due to the forming of the gel-fluid phase coexistence. Finally, a non-equilibrium model due to Sabra and Mouristen is modified to describe the non-equilibrium phenomena of <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> with peripheral proteins which has two internal states. The steady-state of the system and its comparison to the case of integral proteins are described. The thesis is concluded in the final chapter which contains a discussion of future work...|$|R
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E

Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the glycerol backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the erythrocyte lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer.</b>|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of lipid in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of lipid vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried lipid sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that lipid bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E

We find that the head group composition of the deuterated and the hydrogenated lipid extracts is similar (approximately 75 % phosphatidylethanolamine, 13 % phosphatidylglycerol and 12 % cardiolipin) and that both samples can be used to reconstitute high-coverage supported <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayers</b> with a total thickness of 41 ± 3 Å, common for fluid membranes.

The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by <b>lipid</b> <b>bilayer</b> membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
