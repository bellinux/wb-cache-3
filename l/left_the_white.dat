5|$|After Ronald Reagan <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House in 1989, {{the couple}} retired {{to their home}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California. Nancy devoted {{most of her time}} to caring for her husband, who was {{diagnosed}} with Alzheimer's disease in 1994, until his death at the age of 93 on June 5, 2004. Reagan remained active within the Reagan Library and in politics, particularly in support of embryonic stem cell research, until her death from congestive heart failure at age 94 on March 6, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg {{spent the first}} three months of the season on the bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|Reagan was {{in great}} pain from the bullet that struck his rib, and he {{believed}} that the rib had cracked when Parr pushed him into the limousine. When the agent checked him for gunshot wounds, however, Reagan coughed up bright, frothy blood. Although the president believed that he had cut his lip, Parr believed that the cracked rib had punctured Reagan's lung and ordered the motorcade to divert to nearby George Washington University Hospital, which the Secret Service periodically inspected for use. The limousine arrived there less than four minutes after leaving the hotel, while other agents took Hinckley to a DC jail, and Nancy Reagan ("Rainbow") <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House for the hospital.|$|E

5|$|After Ford <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House in January 1977, {{the former}} President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

25|$|During {{the stage}} {{performance}} of the controversial Uncle Tom's Cabin, white actor G. C. Germon put on blackface to represent an African-American male. The play <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> audience pitying the character, Tom, rather than seeing him as an equal. Earlier during this play, an actor breaks into a song with lyrics stereotyping mischievous, black children. This play encapsulates the controversy between anti-slavery activists and those pro slavery in the United States.|$|E

25|$|When many Democrats <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House {{following}} Richard Nixon's {{replacement of}} Johnson, Dole did not. From 1969 to 1973, {{she served as}} deputy assistant to President Nixon for consumer affairs. In 1973, Nixon appointed her to a seven-year term on the Federal Trade Commission. In 1975, she became a Republican. She took a leave from her post as a Federal Trade Commissioner for several months in 1976 to campaign for her husband for {{vice president of the}} United States, when he ran on the Republican ticket with Gerald Ford. She later resigned from the FTC in 1979, to campaign for her husband's 1980 presidential run. During the 1970s, Dole was a self-described member of the Women's Liberation Movement and helped reform laws to ensure equal credit for women. She was also a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

Closely scrutinized by Democrats, Harrison's reputation was largely intact when he <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Having an advantage few 19th Century Presidents had, Harrison's own party, the Republicans, controlled Congress, while his administration actively advanced a Republican program {{of a higher}} tariff, moderate control of corporations, protecting African American voting rights, a generous Civil War pension, and compromising over the controversial silver issue.

Eventually, this protectiveness led to her consulting an astrologer, Joan Quigley, who offered insight on which days were [...] "good", [...] "neutral", or should be avoided, which influenced her husband's White House schedule. Days were color-coded according to the astrologer's advice to discern precisely which days and times would be optimal for the president's safety and success.|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{had long}} been anxious to escape hot, {{unhealthy}} Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House {{for the last time}} on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, Joe Stanley Brown, wrote 40 years later, [...] "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy." ...|$|E
