25|$|The Marbury and Quoisley Meres {{with their}} {{surrounding}} reed beds form a significant wildlife habitat. Quoisley Meres are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and {{have also been}} designated Wetlands of International Importance, {{as part of the}} Midland Meres and Mosses Ramsar site. The meres are important for wildfowl; gadwall, garganey and ruddy ducks are among the species observed at Quoisley, with great crested, red-necked and Slavonian grebes, great and <b>little</b> <b>bittern,</b> Canada and pink-footed geese, coots, moorhens and mute swans recorded at Marbury. The woodland across the civil parish also supports birdlife, with nightingale and marsh tit being among the many species recorded here.|$|E
500|$|Today, {{the area}} is still home to a diverse {{population}} of birds and mammals, {{and some of the}} breeding species found do not breed anywhere else in Jordan. Among the bird species found are the European roller, desert lark, Dead Sea sparrow, desert finch and blue-cheeked bee-eater. The King Talal dam has created a lake which is a habitat for migratory waterfowl and various fish species. Notable birds found in the lake area include the <b>little</b> <b>bittern,</b> cattle egrets, [...] grey herons, white storks, common teal and Eurasian coot. The lake's waters sustain fish, some of which are indigenous species and some are introduced species. The most common are tilapia. [...] Migratory birds also winter in the man-made pools which make up the Kherbit Al-Samra Sewage Treatment Plant, located in a broad depression close to Wadi Dhulayl, the main tributary of the Zarqa River. As many as 6,000 white storks have been spotted roosting there. Mammals found in the area include the common otter (Lutra lutra), and the Persian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus). The otter is considered a threatened species.|$|E
50|$|Herons, <b>bitterns,</b> <b>little</b> <b>bitterns,</b> ducks, geese and swans are {{commonly}} {{seen on the}} Eiswoog. Osprey, on the other hand, are only seen occasionally.

2500|$|There are 185 [...] {{species of}} birds in the reservation, of which 120 are {{resident}} birds.

It is a wetland that has sheltered migratory birds, and supports other animal and plant species; this has included predominantly avian species, such as the: Eurasian reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus), melodious warbler (Hippolais polyglotta), willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), <b>little</b> <b>bittern</b> (Ixobrychus minutus), great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), and the Savi's warbler (Locustella luscinioides). The 482 hectare area, under threat from industrial, residential and agricultural pollution, expansion of aquatic plants and eutrophication, has forced the governmental reorganization of land use in order to promote models of sustainability, and rural use that does not affect the migratory and aquatic bird populations.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, <b>little</b> <b>bittern,</b> night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E

In Eastern part of the {{reservoir}} in the more densely reeds and willow thickets there are three species of grebes, <b>little</b> <b>bitterns,</b> spotted crakes and Western marsh harriers, and to the end of April there are Savi's warblers species of bird. Various species also rest in the area and are the Eurasian curlews, Northern lapwings, grey plovers and dunlins and curlew sandpipers. There are also ruddy turnstones, Eurasian oystercatchers and red-necked phalarope.|$|R

5000|$|The dunes {{began to}} form in the Bronze Age, {{developing}} considerably from the 16th to the 18th century. Their formation has been reduced by planting marram grass, heather and pine trees but this has given them as darker look.

Among the flora {{in the area are}} blue hair grass, polypody, field wormwood, thyme, lady's bedstraw and burnet rose. Bird species include the crane, which has only recently started to breed in the area, <b>bittern,</b> <b>little</b> grebe, red-necked grebe, teal, snipe and curlew.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} monsoon months {{especially}} on moonless and foggy dark nights between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., birds are not disturbed by the locals but {{out of the dark}} northern skies will start to descend as they are attracted to lights. These dazed birds are captured using bamboo poles by the locals. The local tribals first took this natural phenomenon to be spirits flying from the sky to terrorize them. This phenomenon is not confined to a single species, with tiger <b>bittern,</b> black <b>bittern,</b> <b>little</b> egret, pond heron, Indian pitta, and kingfishers all being affected, as well as hill partridge, green pigeon, emerald dove, necklaced laughingthrush, black drongo.
