30|$|To {{control the}} output current, a control system is {{required}} that can automatically regulate the duty cycle. The DC/AC controller has two control loops: the external DC-bus voltage <b>control</b> <b>loop,</b> {{and the internal}} current <b>control</b> <b>loop.</b> The internal <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> sudden changes in AC current to maintain a sinusoidal current. A PLL sinusoidal signal reference generates the reference current (Iref), which synchronizes the grid voltage with the output inverter current [68, 83, 84]. The amplitude current {{is controlled by the}} external voltage loop. The external <b>loop</b> <b>controls</b> the DC-bus voltage (Vdc). This voltage should be limited; however, controlling Vdc is required for controlling the power fed into the grid.|$|R

30|$|As the UE {{is limited}} by the maximum {{transmission}} power, the uplink power control is an important issue. It consists of open <b>loop</b> power <b>control</b> and closed <b>loop</b> power <b>control.</b> The open <b>loop</b> power <b>control</b> aims at compensating for slow variations of channel conditions, i.e., pathloss and shadowing. The closed <b>loop</b> power <b>control</b> targets at further adjusting the UE’s transmission power to optimize the system performance.|$|R
25|$|When wire {{insulation}} disintegrates, it {{can result in}} an unintended electrical contact at a different location from the desired sensing point. If such a damaged thermocouple {{is used in the}} closed <b>loop</b> <b>control</b> of a thermostat or other temperature controller, this can lead to a runaway overheating event and possibly severe damage, as the false temperature reading will typically be lower than the sensing junction temperature. Failed insulation will also typically outgas, which can lead to process contamination. For parts of thermocouples used at very high temperatures or in contamination-sensitive applications, the only suitable insulation may be vacuum or inert gas; the mechanical rigidity of the thermocouple wires is used to keep them separated.|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open <b>loop</b> <b>control.</b> Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

2500|$|In closed <b>loop</b> <b>control,</b> {{the control}} {{action from the}} {{controller}} is dependent on feed back from the process {{in the form of}} the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a controller output to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the [...] "Reference input" [...] or [...] "set point". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.|$|E

Generally, and as already mentioned, this choice {{separates}} the video-level <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> from enhancement <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> (like Auto Black and Tone-mapping loops) and avoids introducing nonlinear elements (local and global tone mapping, Gamma function) within the video-level <b>control</b> <b>loop.</b> The enhancement <b>control</b> contains an Auto Black (AB) <b>control</b> <b>loop,</b> which sets the minimum value of the input signal to a predefined black level. This effectively lowers the video level setting after the wanted video level was already set by the user. This problem is typically solved by closing the lens/sensor control at Point C, hence, creating effectively a feed-back control to the sensor/lens control block at the start. Unfortunately, {{this leads to a}} <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> that includes other <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> like DG and AB.|$|R
30|$|Load {{frequency}} control (LFC) of conventional power systems is performed {{with three different}} <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> [2, 3], which loops are primary, secondary and tertiary <b>control</b> <b>loops.</b> The primary <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> provides active power balance, and the secondary <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> minimizes the steady-state error in the <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> frequency formed {{at the end of}} the primary <b>control</b> <b>loop.</b> The tertiary <b>control</b> <b>loop</b> is the central loop that regulates the system frequency error and includes measures performed by verbal instructions in case primary and secondary loops are insufficient. Linear models including primary and secondary <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> are suggested to analyze the {{frequency control}} of the systems [3, 4, 5]. However, there is also a time delay caused by phasor measurement units (PMUs) as well as communication links. The time delay affects performances of these <b>control</b> <b>loops</b> in the power systems and it is approximately in the range of 5 – 15  s [4, 6]. Also the time delay may reduce the damping performance of the control system and even cause the instability if it exceeds the delay margin [7, 8, 9]. In fact, this value is the delay time which makes the system marginally stable. Therefore, the time delay must be considered for both analysis and design of a power system. For this purpose, linear models including time delay have been proposed [3, 4, 5].|$|R
