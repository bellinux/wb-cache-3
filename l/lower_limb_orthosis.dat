For example, he had {{subjects}} wear an active orthosis on one leg which performed a very strong plantar flexion every time they flexed the soleus, {{which is expected to}} plantar flex. However, the plantar flexion performed by the device was too strong and the subjects had to only use a minimal amount of muscle strength on that one leg in order to walk normally. People were able to adapt to this difficulty in under 30 minutes. Another study by S.

The implementation of pneumatic artificial muscle will {{play an important role}} {{for the development of the}} advanced robotic system. In this research a derivation model for the antagonistic mono- and bi-articular muscles using pneumatic artificial muscles of a <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>orthosis</b> will be verified with actual human’s muscle activities models. A healthy and young male 29 years old subject with height 174 cm and weight 68 kg was used as a test subject. Two mono-articular muscles Vastus Medialis (VM) and Vastus Lateralis (VL) were selected to verify the mono-articular muscle models and muscle synergy between anterior muscles. Two biarticular muscles Rectus Femoris (RF) and Bicep Femoris (BF) were selected to verify the bi-articular muscle models and muscle co-contraction between anterior-posterior muscles. The test was carried out on a treadmill with a speed of 4. 0 km/h, which approximately around 1. 25 m/s for completing one cycle of walking motion. The data was collected for about one minute on a treadmill and 20 complete cycles of walking motion were successfully recorded. For the evaluations, the mathematical model obtained from the derivation and the actual human muscle activation patterns obtained using the surface electromyography (sEMG) system were compared and analysed. The results shown that, high correlation values ranging from 0. 83 up to 0. 93 were obtained in between the derivation model and the actual human muscle’s model for both mono- and biarticular muscles. As a conclusion, based on the verification with the sEMG muscle activities data and its correlation values, the proposed derivation models of the antagonistic mono- and bi-articular muscles were suitable to simulate and controls the pneumatic muscles actuated <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>orthosis...</b>|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, medical {{rehabilitation}} system {{has become a}} requirement due to increment in national rehabilitation centres and medical hospitals. An assistive rehabilitation orthosis becomes essential and was used for rehabilitation therapy, condition monitoring, and physical strengthening. This study focused on the <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> assistive rehabilitation <b>orthosis</b> development using pneumatic artificial muscle. To successfully control this orthosis system which consists of antagonistic mono- and biarticular muscle actuators, {{it is necessary to}} construct a reliable control algorithm. The suitable control scheme and strategy to manoeuvre this orthosis system similar to human musculoskeletal system have yet to be fully developed and established. Based on the review study, it is said that the co-contraction controls of anterior-posterior pneumatic muscles was able to improve the joint stiffness and stability of the orthosis as well as good manoeuvrability. Therefore, a characterization model of an antagonistic mono- and bi-articular muscles activities of human's lowerlimb during walking motion will be necessary. A healthy young male subject was used as test subject to obtain the sEMG muscle activities for antagonistic mono- and bi-articular muscles (i. e., Vastus Medialis-VM, Vastus Lateralis-VL, Rectus Femoris-RF, and Bicep Femoris-BF). The tests were carried out at different speeds of 2 km/h, 3 km/h, and 4 km/h for one minute walking motion on a treadmill. Then, the patterns of the sEMG muscle activities were modelled and characterised using fifth order polynomial equation. Based on the results, it is shown that the anterior and posterior muscles were exhibited a muscle synergy in-between multiple anterior or posterior muscles and muscle co-contraction between anteriorposterior muscles in order to control the movements at the joints during walking motion.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of producing an orthotic knee joint that could lock and unlock during ambulation for eventual use in a reciprocating gait orthosis (RGO) for severely disabled patients. Method. Three prototype orthotic knee joints incorporating braking mechanisms were designed and manufactured to demonstrate their ability to withstand a maximum calculated sagittal plane bending moment of 73 Nm. Each was then subjected to bench trials to test their performance against the required specification. Results. Although all three joints achieved the requirement to sustain the specified externally applied bending moments, the hydraulic disc brake system proved significantly superior and was selected for more comprehensive testing. Conclusions.

Rocker profiles {{are one of the}} most commonly prescribed therapeutic footwear modifications. Typically, they are used to allow lower limb forward progression when ankle and foot motion are restricted by mechanical constraint (i. e. <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>orthosis)</b> or clinical pathology (i. e. lower limb fracture). Although rocker profiles are commonly used, their design and performance have not been clearly described. To address this need, we studied the role of rocker profile footwear and its influence on lower limb forward progression when used in combination with an orthosis designed to constrain the ankle joint. We hypothesize that healthy subjects walking with unilateral ankle-foot orthosis footwear combination will elicit no difference in the shank forward progression compared to control (no ankle constraint) during stance phase (early, mid, late). The shank forward progression was quantified as the forward and vertical components of the acceleration. Analysis of constrained and unconstrained shank acceleration for three subjects revealed no difference during mid-stance, but showed differences during early and late stance. Although there are some differences in the shank acceleration when walking with and without ankle constraint, there is no notable gait deviation between the two conditions. This supports the notion that the rocker profile designed in our laboratory functions as a biomimetic ankle-foot complex that restores lower limb forward progression when the ankle is mechanically constrained by an orthosis.

40|$|A {{number of}} passive orthoses have been {{developed}} to provide gait assistance and rehabilitation for individuals who have lost the ability to walk. However, the required metabolic cost for legged mobility with conventional orthoses is huge, preventing its daily use. Using the forces/torques generated by external actuators is one of the effective ways to solve the problem induced from the considerable effort required for orthotic gait. For that, design of a compact, efficient and light weight actuation system and its delicate control are required. In Chapter 1, Powered Reciprocating Hip Orthosis, a novel hip actuator making use of the coupling hip mechanism of the reciprocating gait orthosis (RGO) is proposed. The RGO, a wearable and passive orthosis, provides paralyzed patients with hands-free standing and the ability for dynamic ambulation without any external actuation. Therefore, the mechanism of the RGO can be utilized effectively for improving the hip actuator design for a powered <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>orthosis.</b> Starting with this motivation, a powered limb orthosis combined with the conventional RGO was designed and its control structure was implemented on a paraplegic subject (T 12 complete). First, a dynamic analysis is presented to identify and better understand the potential use of the RGO mechanism. For the analysis, the simple RGO dynamic model at a single support phase is obtained and its equations of motion are derived using Lagrange's equations of motion. Through the physical interpretation provided by the inverse dynamics, it is proved that the required maximum hip torque for stance phase is significantly decreased when the RGO hip coupling mechanism is applied. An unproved torso stability provided by the design is also investigated. Subsequently, overall control structure with a user-interface module is introduced to provide basic functions to the powered orthosis for locomotion. While implementing the designed orthosis with the human subject, a difficult problem on the dorsiflexion-activated passive knee orthosis of the conventional RGO is discussed and leads to Chapter 2 : Friction Damping Control Knee Orthosis. A simple, but effective, microprocessor orthotic knee control method is presented with a novel knee joint design and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor in Chapter 2. First, an electric hardware and a control structure with the IMU sensor are introduced. Next, to understand the knee dynamics and determine a control strategy, a lower extremity model is set up. Using this model, a dynamic analysis for ballistic walking with overshooting and circumduction of the hip joint motion, and downstairs walking is executed with the experimental hip motion data. Based on the observations for human hip joint motion and the obtained dynamic simulation results, a friction damping control method is proposed. Its implementation enables natural walking on level ground and provides the appropriate resistance of the knee joint in downstairs walking for assistance and safety to normal human subjects using the designed knee orthosis...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScPhysio) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012 ENGLISH ABSTRACT: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ABSTRACT - BACKGROUND: Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFOs) are {{considered}} {{as the most}} suitable <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> <b>orthosis</b> to correct gait deficits related to ankle instability. AFOs are recommended to minimize gait deviations and to correct drop foot or equinus foot in hemiplegic patients. OBJECTIVES - To identify the effectiveness of different ankle orthoses and/or supports on the temporal, spatial, kinetic and kinematic gait parameters. To critically appraise the methodological quality of the included studies {{and to provide a}} description of the studies with a view to identify opportunities to improve future research quality. METHODS - Search strategy A comprehensive search was conducted between March and October 2010, and updated in August 2011. Thirteen computerized bibliographic databases were individually searched, namely PubMed Central, Cohrane Library, CINAHL, OT Seeker, SPORTDiscus, PsyARTICLE, PEDro, Proquest, Biomed Central, Science Direct, Clinicaltrials. gov, Web of Science, and Ingenta Connect. All databases were searched since their inception. The following key terms were used: stroke, hemipleg*, assistive device*, ankle foot orthos*, AFO, (splint*), taping, and strapping. A secondary search (pearling) was conducted by screening the reference lists of all eligible full text studies. The authors of the unpublished studies were conducted to minimize publication bias. Selection criteria The following selection criteria applied: all relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trails published in English; participants were post-stroke patients older than eighteen years; interventions included any type of ankle foot orthosis (AFO), ankle taping or strapping and ankle foot splint without any additional intervention and the comparison/control groups were limited to walking without support, either barefoot or walking with shoes only. Studies were excluded when the outcome measures did not focus on {{at least one of the}} following: temporal spatial gait parameters, kinetic gait parameters or kinematic gait parameters. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion and assessed methodological quality. The data was extracted by the primary reviewer and validated by a second reviewer. In event of disagreement, a third reviewer was asked to re-evaluate until consensus could be reached. Homogenous data were statistically summarized in sub-group meta-analysis using Revman© Review Manager Software. The results of heterogeneous data were summarized in a narrative form. MAIN RESULTS - The search yielded 11134 initial hits. Sixteen studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The studies investigated the immediate effect of various types of AFOs on a broad range of temporal spatial gait parameters mainly gait speed, cadence, stride and step length. Only two studies reported on the kinetic and six on various kinematic gait parameters. The meta-analysis yielded significant improvement in gait speed (0. 06 m/s; 95 % CI 0. 04, 0. 08. p 0. 5) temporal spatial gait parameters and ankle joint kinematics in ambulant adult hemiplegic patients. The following positive trends were however found and need to be further explored in larger homogeneous study samples: ankle taping of ambulant adult hemiplegic patients has limited benefits on selected temporal parameters as ankle taping could potentially improve cadence. Ankle taping could decrease plantarflexion of the plegic leg at initial contact. CONCLUSIONS - A systematic review revealed no conclusive evidence either to support or refute the beneficial effects of ankle taping on gait parameters of ambulant adult hemiplegic patients. Ankle taping of ambulant adult hemiplegic patients has potential clinical benefits on temporal, spatial and affected ankle kinematics, gait cadence and affected leg swing and stance duration...|$|E

Therefore, this study aimed {{to determine whether there}} were any significant differences in selected kinetic, kinematic, and muscle activation patterns characterizing <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> biomechanics displayed by the dominant limb compared with the nondominant limb of participants during a stop-jump task. Methods: Sixteen male athletes with normal patellar tendons on diagnostic imaging performed five successful stop-jump trials. Patellar tendon forces (FPT), ground reaction forces, three-dimensional kinematics, and EMG activity of seven <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscles were recorded for the dominant and nondominant <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> during each trial.

Correlations between diagonal upper/lower limb trajectories increased as right belt speed became faster, suggesting increasing cross-body matching regardless of side.

The upper limbs reached maximum horizontal displacement before the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> except between the right upper limb/left <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> for asymmetrical belt speeds.

For the next study, I examined neural coupling in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury to determine if adding upper limb effort enhanced muscle recruitment of volitionally maximally active <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> The data indicated that maximal upper limb effort did not increase active <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle recruitment in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. Similar to neurologically intact individuals, spinal cord injured individuals also demonstrated increased passive <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> muscle activation with greater upper limb effort. Lastly, I used computer simulations to examine potential neural mechanisms behind the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> neural coupling. These models showed that excitatory sensory feedback, excitatory ipsilateral pathways, and supraspinal drive were all possible specific neural mechanisms explaining my empirical results. Future studies using more sophisticated neural techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation can test the specific neural mechanisms shown in the simulations. Overall, my findings provide {{a better understanding of}} interlimb neural coupling and have specific implications for the design of exercise therapies for gait rehabilitation after neurological injury...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To explore job adjustments, job satisfaction, {{and health}} {{experience}} among employees with an upper limb amputation and {{to compare the}} results with those of <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees and control subjects. Methods: Amputees were recruited from data files of a large European University Medical Centre and orthopaedic workshops. Controls were matched colleagues of the <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees. All participants filled out the VAG questionnaire (Vragenlijst Arbeid en Gezondheid), assessing job satisfaction and job adjustments, and the RAND- 36. Results: 28 upper limb amputees were compared to 144 <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees and 144 controls. Job adjustments were necessary in 38 % and 28 % of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees, respectively. All three groups were equally satisfied with their jobs (p= 0. 90). Vocational rehabilitation was applied to 26 % and 8 % of upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees, respectively. Upper limb amputees rated their general health worse (18 points, 95 % CI: 12 - 25) compared to <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees, corrected for effects of confounders (age and co-morbidity). Conclusions: Upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees have high job satisfaction and a minority need job adjustments. In upper limb amputees, {{the causes of the}} worrisome general health experience need further investigation. In upper and <b>lower</b> <b>limb</b> amputees, vocational rehabilitation deserves additional attention...|$|R
40|$|Title: Use {{of fitness}} center {{to affect the}} {{strength}} of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> for football players. Objectives: The aim of thesis is to create an overview for strengthening the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> of football players from lower categories in fitness center. Find information about the strengthening of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> of football players from performance category and compared with men who go strengthen to the fitness centers. Methods: The paper has been used the literature analysis and carrying out survey which was conducted using interviews. 50 football players of performance category were target group. Results: In this work it was found that 72 % football players dedicated strengthening the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> especially in a comprehensive way and not just in fitness centers, as well ass at home and in training. The <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> of football players are overwhelmingly strengthened, but at lower categories the quidance of trained coach is missing. The number of reps and sets in training for the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs</b> are rather <b>lower.</b> 60 % of footballers train in one set under 10 reps and 84 % footballers do under 16 sets in strength training of the <b>lower</b> <b>limbs.</b> Keywords: <b>Lower</b> <b>limbs</b> - football - strength abilities - methodology of the strengthening - exercises application...|$|R
