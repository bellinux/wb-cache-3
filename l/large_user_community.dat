When operational the Meteosat First Generation provided images every half-hour in three spectral channels (Visible, Infrared) and Water Vapour, via the Meteosat Visible and Infrared Imager (MVIRI) instrument. Until 1-February 2017, Meteosat-7 provided the primary imagery coverage over the Indian Ocean and provided a service relaying data from Data Collection Platforms (DCP), such as buoys, {{in support of the}} Tsunami Warning System for the Indian Ocean. A range of processed meteorological products were also produced. The last disseminated Meteosat-7 image was on 31-March-2017.

40|$|Abstract- Kerberos {{has become}} a mature, reliable, secure network {{authentication}} protocol. Kerberos is based on secret key encryption technology. It is the native network authentication protocol in the Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system and may {{be a candidate for}} use as a general-purpose authentication protocol for <b>large</b> <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> on the Internet. Several proposals have been developed that add public key cryptography to various stages of Kerberos to make the protocol work with <b>large</b> <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> and Public Key Infrastructures. But the computational requirements of public key cryptography are higher than those of secret key cryptography. As a result, the substitution of public key encryption algorithms for secret key algorithms impacts performance. As main disadvantage of Secret cryptography is that key is transferred over open system In this paper we provide alternative approach as Public crypto system in which private key is not shared second phase, the client sends a TGS-REQ with the TGT from phase 1 to the TGS, which responds with a servicegranting ticket (SGT) in the TGS-REP. In the final phase, the SGT is presented to the application server, which then grants the service.

40|$|Most {{currently}} deployed public-key cryptosystems are certificate-based (CBPK) cryptosystems. In <b>large</b> {{and distributed}} <b>user</b> <b>communities,</b> CBPK cryptosystems typically require encryptors {{to obtain the}} public-key certificate of each intended recipient, and signature verifiers to obtain the public-key certificate of each claimed signer. However, the management and distribution of public-key certificates are cumbersome in these communities. To address this issue, identity-based (ID-based) cryptosystems have been suggested as a possible alternative, because they enable the derivation of public keys from arbitrary string identifiers (such as email addresses, IP addresses, or privilege identifiers). This dissertation investigates the use of ID-based cryptography for <b>large</b> <b>user</b> <b>communities.</b> In particular, we present efficient and provably-secure (hierarchical) ID-based cryptographic schemes to support the following applications: (1) generation of decryption keys from non-repeatable (e. g. biometric) information; (2) authentication of the sender of encrypted information; (3) verification that a user belongs to a publicly known subset of a group, while the user remains anonymous to all but a designated party...|$|R
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of cloud technologies, on the one hand, and social networks, on the other hand, the possibilities for e-learning have been drastically enhanced in the latest years. Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) can now indeed contain {{a huge amount of}} learning resources; in parallel, <b>large</b> <b>user</b> <b>communities</b> are available in social networks. These nevertheless remain different systems but, by using these heterogeneous software environments together, the possibilities for interaction could be multiplied. That is why, this paper suggests to build a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) environment through a Multi-Agent System (MAS) working as a virtual abstraction layer over heterogeneous software platforms. The idea is to aggregate different traditional VLE to dispose of the learning objects they own as well as other platforms such as social networks to furnish an easy access to the MOOC of their <b>large</b> <b>user</b> <b>communities.</b> The MAS design has been architectured around a real-life organisational pattern – the joint venture – allowing one to deal with the complexity of heterogeneous software environments in a manner that real-life companies set up joint governance. Communication scenarios issued of a field analysis are pointed out in the paper; these are supported by the MOOC platform in the native environment as well as in Facebook. The proposal is indeed validated through the development of a prototype using Facebook as a case study for third-party platform interfacing.
