Traditionally, these studies are performed for a single new device and single penetration level, neglecting the harmonic interaction between new types of devices, as well as giving little information at which moment in time possible problems may arise. A composite approach to access the impact of harmonic sources on the distribution network is therefore proposed. This method combines a bottom-up stochastic modeling of the residential load with harmonic measurement data and harmonic <b>load-flows</b> all based on a scenario analysis. The method is validated with measurement data and shows a good prediction of {{the current level of}} harmonics in a residential neighborhood for the current situation. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, case studies are performed on the IEEE European Low Voltage Test Feeder.

These properties are relevant not only for the reliability of existing off-line and real-time applications, but also because they enable new types of analytical tools that would be impossible to build with existing iterative load flows (due to their convergence problems).

More residents start to install their own energy generation sources such as photovoltaic cells. The introduction of distributed generation in the low-voltage network can have effects that were unexpected when the network was designed and {{could lead to a}} bad power quality. These developments ask for better insight in the effects of a planning for a fleet of households in a network. This paper presents the results of adding network models to planning strategies.

40|$|In voltage {{stability}} analysis, both {{static and}} dynamic approaches {{are used to}} evaluate the system critical conditions. The static approach is based on the standard <b>load-flow</b> equations. For small-disturbance analysis, the dynamic approach is based on the eigenvalue computation of the linearized system, while for large-disturbance analysis a complete time-domain simulation is required. However, both the equilibrium point around which linearization is performed and the initial conditions for the simulation are computed by a procedure which uses the standard <b>load-flow</b> equations. The standard <b>load-flow</b> equations make some implicit assumptions on the steady-state behaviour of dynamic components (generator control systems, loads). These assumptions are not satisfied by the usual dynamic models, and this discrepancy leads to different results in the voltage stability assessment using static and dynamic methods. In the framework of bifurcation theory, this paper discusses the relationships between static and small-disturbance dynamic approaches to find the voltage stability critical condition, with emphasis on system component modelling. A set of hypotheses on generator control systems and load models is given for a multimachine system, according to which the same critical conditions are obtained both from the <b>load-flow</b> equations and from the full eigenvalue analysis. These hypotheses are less restrictive than those previously proposed in the literature and make it possible to obtain equivalence between the singularity of the <b>load-flow</b> Jacobian and a null eigenvalue of the linearized dynamic system. Following a dynamic argumentation based on small-disturbance analysis, this result may justify the use of simple and fast static methods for voltage stability assessment and shows that the small-disturbance voltage stability limit depends only on the steady-state characteristics of the dynamic components of the system...|$|E

40|$|Besides {{the need}} to have {{generally}} available power system test networks with parameters that closely match those of realistic power systems, the continuously increasing sizes of practical power systems also dictates a growing requirement for larger and larger test networks. A new method is proposed for the development of artificial, but reasonably realistic, power system networks of arbitrary size and complexity, suitable for full <b>load-flow</b> analysis (having feasible <b>load-flow</b> solution). It is based on an iterative procedure to expand an initial network by adding a new bus and/or line at each iterative step, until the system of the desired size and complexity is reached. The method is implemented using a new "backwards" approach, which maintains the network determined in the previous iterative step the same everywhere, except at the bus (or buses) where the new network element is added. Five different sample networks, together with all the data necessary for full <b>load-flow</b> calculations have been computed to illustrate the performance of the new method.

Once the conditions are satisfied, the unique <b>load-flow</b> solution can be reached by a given fixed point iteration method of approximately linear complexity. Therefore, the proposed approach is of particular interest for modern active distribution network (ADN) setup in the context of real-time control.

Case studies based on real distribution networks show that the proposed method is more efficient for distribution network planning in presence of renewable energy sources than time subsampling and, in some cases, voltage linearization.

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} {{one of the fastest growing}} {{technologies}} in energy generation industry nowadays. As wind energy is increasingly integrated into power systems, the stability of the existing power systems is becoming a concern and of utmost importance to the power system engineers and operators. The subject of voltage variation at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) is very crucial to the consumers. This voltage variation is as a result of variable nature of wind turbine power output, which is a function of the wind speed. A <b>load-flow</b> analysis, therefore, needs to be carried-out to ascertain the effect on the test distribution grid with and without the connection of wind turbine generators. Only a small part of Lagos (test) Distribution system is considered in this research work. The purpose of carrying-out <b>load-flow</b> analysis is to evaluate the voltage at each bus, its phase angle and the total loss on the system. Due to high Resistance/Reactance (R/X) ratio of the distribution lines and the radial nature of distribution network, the usual <b>load-flow</b> methods used for transmission network are not adequate for distribution system. To further evaluate the impact of the wind turbine generators on the test distribution network, a dynamic stability was carried out to see if the turbine generator will stay in service during and after the fault is cleared. The stability assessment carried out in this work involves the following: Modelling of the test distribution network components for both static and dynamic stabilities, the mathematical model of the grid parameters and the simulation using Matlab/Simulink (SIMSPOWER Tools) software for dynamic stability. The results of the <b>load-flow</b> analysis show that connection of wind turbine to this test distribution system improves the voltage profile at each bus and it also minimizes the loss on the system’s lines.
