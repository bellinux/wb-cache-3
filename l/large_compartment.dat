The Hebrew Ashuri script must be used and there are three main styles of lettering used: Beis Yosef – generally used by Ashkenazim; Arizal – generally used by Hasidim; Velish – used by Sefardim. The passages contain 3,188 letters, which take a sofer (scribe) between 10–15 hours to complete. The arm-tefillin has one <b>large</b> <b>compartment,</b> which contains all four biblical passages written upon a single strip of parchment. The head-tefillin has four separate compartments in each of which one scroll of parchment is placed.|$|E
2500|$|From the outset, the D.H.121 {{was planned}} to employ {{avionics}} which were very advanced for the period. Among other capabilities, they would offer automatic {{approach and landing}} {{within a few years}} of service entry. The avionics were also to have triplicated components for reliability and to allow [...] "majority 2:1 voting" [...] for aircraft guidance during automatic approach and landing. The physical dimensions of most avionics of the period required them to be housed in a <b>large</b> <b>compartment</b> beneath the Trident's flightdeck; the compartment's size was among the factors dictating a distinctive nose undercarriage design: offset by [...] to the port side and retracting sideways to stow across the D.H.121's longitudinal axis.|$|E

Perhaps the man who slept on the pallet was in there at this minute. How reckless he had been! To what danger he had exposed himself! With his pistol cocked, the captain advanced cautiously toward the innermost compartment. Putting his head in at the doorway, he glanced up, down, and around. He called out, [...] "Who's here?" [...] and then he entered, and looked around, and behind each of the massive pieces of rock with which the floor was strewn. No one answered, and he saw no one. But he saw something which made him stare.|$|E
60|$|It must {{be called}} sympathy that leads a courageous dog to fly {{at any one}} who strikes his master, as he {{certainly}} will. I saw a person pretending to beat a lady who had a very timid little dog on her lap, and the trial {{had never before been}} made. The little creature instantly jumped away, but after the pretended beating was over, it was really pathetic to see how perseveringly he tried to lick his mistress’s face and comfort her. Brehm[113] states that when a baboon in confinement was pursued to be punished, the others tried to protect him. It must have been sympathy in the cases above given which led the baboons and Cercopitheci to defend their young comrades from the dogs and the eagle. I will give only one other instance of sympathetic and heroic conduct in a little American monkey. Several years ago a keeper at the Zoological Gardens, showed me some deep and scarcely healed wounds on the nape of his neck, inflicted on him whilst kneeling on the floor by a fierce baboon. The little American monkey, who was a warm friend of this keeper, lived in the same <b>large</b> <b>compartment,</b> and was dreadfully afraid of the great baboon.

50|$|A {{significant}} {{implication of}} this work is that gene regulatory networks largely evolve by indels in both cis and trans (in enhancer DNAs and polyQ-encoding genes, respectively).

40|$|AbstractIt is {{demonstrated}} that in chicken embryonic and mature erythrocyte nuclei {{the distribution of}} a versatile transcription factor CTCF differs drastically from its distribution in nuclei of proliferating erythroid and non-erythroid cells. In the latter case CTCF was distributed throughout the whole nucleus volume, being concentrated in many small compartments (punctuate nuclear staining). In contrast, in embryonic and mature erythrocytes CTCF was concentrated in {{a limited number of}} <b>large</b> <b>compartments.</b> These <b>large</b> CTCF-containing <b>compartments</b> were not observed in other cells. Occasionally, but not in all cells, some of these compartments were localized close to nucleoli but did not colocalize with them. In mature erythrocytes a clear exclusion of CTCF-containing compartments from the chromatin domain was observed. This exclusion correlated with a tight association of CTCF with the nuclear matrix. Concentration in relatively <b>large</b> <b>compartments</b> and exclusion from the chromatin domain in nuclei of mature erythrocytes were also observed for RNA polymerase II and several transcription factors. The data are discussed {{in the context of a}} hypothesis postulating that relocalization of different components of the transcriptional machinery from the chromatin domain into the interchromatin compartment is an important step of the terminal inactivation of chicken erythrocyte nuclei...|$|R

40|$|Deposition of soot {{generated}} from fires {{is important for}} tenability, smoke management, detector response, and fire forensics. Previous versions of Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) did not account for soot deposition, but FDS 5. 3. 1 includes an optional soot deposition model based on thermophoresis and turbulent deposition. This thesis analyzes the implementation of these deposition mechanisms independently. Predictions using FDS 5. 5. 1 are compared with measurements from three existing test series that involve small-scale hood tests, corridors, and <b>large</b> <b>compartments,</b> with heat release rates of 2 kW - 2 MW. Predictions of optical densities for well ventilated compartments generally agreed with experimental data. FDS over predicted optical density for small fires in <b>large</b> <b>compartments</b> and under predicted the mass deposition on surfaces in the small-scale hood test. Compartments without vents indicate that decreased smoke production rates or increased deposition rates would improve the agreement...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, the {{building}} regulations have no design mies for <b>large</b> fire <b>compartments</b> (over 1000 m 2). With {{respect to the}} ability of people to escape from a fire in such large spaces, the Centre for Fire Research of TNO Building and Construction Research has developed a guideline that integrates the calculation of the available safe escape time (ASET) and the required safe escape time (RSET). The ASET is calculated using traditional zone models which were extended modelling several aspects relevant for large spaces, such as the cooling of smoke on ceiling and walls as well as the effects of unstratified smoke spread in the room. A calculation model for the RSET using the flow capacity of exits was extended by taking into account the travel distance inside <b>large</b> fire <b>compartments</b> and the moment people start to escape. These extensions for modelling both aspects, ASET and RSET for <b>large</b> <b>compartments,</b> may also be useful outside the scope of the proposed Dutch guideline...|$|R
