5|$|Ascension was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reception. Critics recommended it as a party game favorable to Super Smash Bros. and praised its balance. However, some felt that its single-player mode was a <b>low</b> <b>point,</b> and lamented {{the lack of an}} online multiplayer mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{peak traffic}} density {{in terms of}} average annual daily traffic on I-68 in West Virginia is 32,900vehicles per day at the {{interchange}} with I-79 in Morgantown. The traffic gradually decreases further eastward, reaching a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> at 14,600vehicles per day at the Hazelton exit.|$|E
5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have been badly {{affected}} by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that <b>low</b> <b>point,</b> the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of Scotland {{in this period}} is unknown. The first reliable information in 1755 shows the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380. Best estimates put the Scottish population for earlier periods in the High Middle Ages between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people, growing from a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> to a high point.|$|E
5|$|The synagogue {{experienced}} difficulty {{during the}} Great Depression—membership dropped, the congregational school was closed, and staff had their salaries reduced—but conditions had improved {{by the late}} 1930s. In 1943 the synagogue {{changed its name to}} Temple Israel, and by the late 1940s membership had almost doubled from its <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in the 1930s. Ettelson retired in 1954, and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr had {{a delayed}} release in Germany and opened to a {{generally}} negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception {{to the film}} {{has become much more}} favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Examples of <b>lowest</b> {{bridging}} <b>points</b> in Britain include London, the <b>lowest</b> bridging <b>point</b> on the Thames; Lancaster, the <b>lowest</b> bridging <b>point</b> on the Lune; York, the <b>lowest</b> bridging <b>point</b> on the Ouse; and Gloucester, the <b>lowest</b> bridging <b>point</b> on the Severn. Mathew Paris’s map of 1247 {{appears to}} show only one {{bridge in the}} whole of Britain: at Stirling, the <b>lowest</b> bridging <b>point</b> on the River Forth.|$|R

5|$|Aberdeen's {{first and}} only foreign manager, Ebbe Skovdahl, was {{appointed}} in 1999 and his time in charge coincided {{with some of the}} heaviest defeats in the club's history. The <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of the club's history came in the 1999–2000 season, where they finished bottom of the table. As the Scottish Premier League was being expanded to twelve teams, there was then a three team play-off. However, as Falkirk's stadium did not meet SPL requirements, Aberdeen retained their status in the top flight. This was followed by an early-season defeat to Ireland's Bohemian F.C. on the away goals rule in the next season's UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War. It was strategically important during the early stages of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its <b>low</b> <b>point</b> during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E
5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, {{the crowds}} and {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, but in the 1980s, public criticism {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E
5000|$|Sophienhöhe {{is about}} 6 km {{east of the}} city Jülich at the north-end of the open pit Tagebau Hambach. The {{distance}} (in respect to sea-level) between the top of Sophienhöhe and the <b>lowest</b> <b>point</b> of the pit is 594.8 meters. Tagebau Hambach is the <b>lowest</b> surface <b>point</b> in Europe, lying 293 meters below sea level. The CIA still maintains that Neuendorf bei Wilster is Germany's <b>lowest</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite {{significant}} European {{success in}} the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s marked a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> for English football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.|$|E
5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} two seasons of the 1970s, Nea Salamina {{finished}} {{in the middle of}} the table; the next two seasons threatened relegation, which was avoided. The club's <b>low</b> <b>point</b> was 14 August 1974, when the occupation of Famagusta by Turkish troops led to Nea Salamina becoming a refugee club. Fans and players scattered to unoccupied areas of Cyprus and abroad. In October, board members met at the offices of Aris Limassol, deciding to revive the club. Since most players were in Larnaca, it was decided to make Larnaca the club's temporary home. Its offices were housed temporarily at the offices of Alki Larnaca F.C. and in January 1975 acquired a rented building. Expenses were paid with contributions from members and friends of the club. Two youth academies were founded, in Larnaca and Limassol.|$|E

5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Critics generally {{felt that the}} game was true to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, but some thought that the story pace slowed at times. Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertrons cooperative campaign as a <b>low</b> <b>point.</b> Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the British {{organisation}} {{now known}} as the Shire Horse Society was created, with the American Shire Horse Association beginning in 1885. The breed was exported from Britain to the United States in large numbers during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but popularity fell as mechanisation increased, reaching a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in the 1950s and 1960s. Popularity began to increase again in the 1970s and after. However, population numbers are still considered to be at critical levels by both the UK-based Rare Breeds Survival Trust and the US-based American Livestock Breeds Conservancy.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided quickly after the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E

5|$|Pompey's death {{did not see}} the end of {{the civil}} wars since {{initially}} Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander Titus Labienus, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the Battle of Ruspina. However, after this <b>low</b> <b>point</b> Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the Battle of Munda in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man would have received. She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the <b>low</b> <b>point</b> of her poetic career.|$|E
5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came back to haunt his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the <b>low</b> <b>point</b> in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E
