5|$|Norton Fitzwarren was {{the site}} of a boat <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the now unused section of the Grand Western Canal from 1839 to 1867. A 300-person {{prisoner}} of war camp built here during World War II housed Italian prisoners from the Western Desert Campaign and German prisoners from the Battle of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed on soft ground, which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E

As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E

5|$|On day two, {{problems}} in Arnhem forced Hicks {{to change the}} divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge—strong German defences had halted the other battalions so Hicks decided that the Staffords would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective. However, the Staffords also failed to break through the German defenders. Bad weather over England kept the planned second <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the ground. The first troops did not arrive until 15:00, a delay that gave the Germans time to approach the landing grounds and engage the KOSB in numerous probing attacks on the northern perimeter. At one stage KOSB commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Payton-Reid led a bayonet charge to clear the Germans from the area. Meanwhile, the Borders were repeatedly attacked from the south of landing zone's 'X' and 'Z', and were eventually forced to call on the 75mm guns of the 1st Airlanding Light Regiment to break up the attacks. Hicks had previously decided to send the Staffords on the second lift to join their battalion fighting in Arnhem, while he also sent the 11th Parachute Battalion on the same lift to support 1st Parachute Brigade. The KOSB, until then responsible for defending the landing ground, were attached to 4th Parachute Brigade to replace the 11th Parachute Battalion. However they were still responsible for defending landing ground 'L', for the arrival of the Poles gliders on day three. This left only the Borders, No. 2 Wing GPR and the field ambulance under brigade command.|$|E

25|$|Tailwheel {{aircraft}} {{are more difficult}} to taxi during high wind conditions, due to the higher angle of attack on the wings which can then develop more <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> one side, making control difficult or impossible. They also suffer from lower crosswind capability and in some wind conditions may be unable to use crosswind runways or single-runway airports.|$|E

25|$|On Monday 18September 1944 {{the second}} day, 4th Parachute Brigade's lift of ninety-two C-47s (for the paratroops), forty-nine Horsa and nine Hamilcar gliders, were {{scheduled}} to arrive furthest away from Arnhem on Ginkel Heath drop zone 'Y', {{as early as possible}} on 18September. Bad weather over England kept the second <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the ground and the first troops did not arrive in the Netherlands until 15:00. The delay gave the Germans time to approach the northern landing grounds and engage the defenders from the 7th King's Own Scottish Borderers.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is yawing, then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E

25|$|The track {{underwent}} a major redesign between the 1990 and 1991 races, transforming the ultra-fast track (where {{in its last}} years every corner was taken in no lower than fourth or fifth gear, depending on the transmission of the car, except for the Bridge chicane, which was usually taken in second gear) into a more technical track. The reshaped track's first F1 race {{was perhaps the most}} memorable of recent years, with Nigel Mansell coming home first in front of his home crowd. On his victory lap back to the pits Mansell even found time to pick up stranded rival Ayrton Senna and give him a <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> his side-pod after Senna's McLaren had run out of fuel on the final lap of the race.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} velocities {{of the air}} {{passing by}} the wing, the air pressure differences, the change in direction of the airflow, and the <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the wing are intrinsically one phenomenon. It is, therefore, possible to calculate lift {{from any of the}} other three. For example, the lift can be calculated from the pressure differences, or from different velocities of the air above and below the wing, or from the total momentum change of the deflected air. Fluid dynamics offers other approaches to solving these problems—and all produce the same answers if done correctly. Given a particular wing and its velocity through the air, debates over which mathematical approach is the most convenient to use can be mistaken by novices as differences of opinion about the basic principles of flight.|$|E
25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|E

25|$|The Ngong Ping 360 is a gondola <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> Lantau Island in Hong Kong. Intended {{to improve}} tourism to the area, the aerial lift was {{previously}} known as Tung Chung Cable Car Project before acquiring the Ngong Ping 360 brand in April 2005. It {{consists of the}} Ngong Ping Cable Car, {{formerly known as the}} Ngong Ping 360 Skyrail, and the Ngong Ping Village, a retail and entertainment centre adjacent to the cable car's upper station. Ngong Ping 360 connects Tung Chung, on the north coast of Lantau and itself linked to central Hong Kong by the Tung Chung Line, with the Ngong Ping area in the hills above. This is home to the Po Lin Monastery and the Tian Tan Buddha, both already significant tourist attractions in their own right. Before Ngong Ping 360's opening, the only access was via a mountain road and bus service.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{access to}} the deep-tube {{platforms}} was by a lift. Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office. The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts. The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing. In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers {{to stand on the}} right and signs followed in World War II. Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage {{on the left side of}} the escalator. The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common. In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators. After the fatal 1987 King's Cross fire, all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires. The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at Greenford station, which remained until October 2015 when TfL replaced it with the first incline <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> the UK transport network.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{becoming}} a hurricane, Alex {{was located in}} a moist, low shear environment, which led to steady intensification on June30. The pressure continued to falla sign of an intensifying cyclonewith a more rapid drop occurring that afternoon and evening. The hurricane strengthened into a Category2 storm late on June30 as it approached the northeastern Mexican coast. At 0200 UTC on July1, Alex made landfall at peak strength, with maximum sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h), gusts of 125mph (205km/h) and an unusually low central pressure of [...] in the municipality of Soto la Marina in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. After the storm, the National Hurricane Center revised the landfall intensity estimate, showing Alex was even stronger when it struck the Mexican coast, with sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h) and a central pressure of [...] Several hours after moving ashore, the storm weakened to Category1 status, and its structure began to deteriorate. However, deep convection persisted around the center. By 1200UTC, Alex had weakened into a tropical storm; by 0000UTC July2, the Sierra Madre Oriental disrupted Alex's core, causing the storm to weaken into a tropical depression and dissipate over San Luis Potosí. However, the interaction with the mountain range caused orographic <b>lift</b> <b>on</b> {{the eastern side of}} the storm after the center of circulation had ceased to exist, producing torrential rainfall throughout northern and central Mexico. Following the dissipation of Alex, divergence at the 200mb atmospheric pressure level (approximately at [...] of altitude), a ridge of high pressure located over southern Texas, and Alex's residual moisture interacted to produce intense convection over Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Coahuila for the next 72hours.|$|E
