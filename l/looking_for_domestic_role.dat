40|$|This article {{presents}} three distinct interpretations of how parliamentary war powers affect British foreign policy more generally, {{based on a}} detailed analysis of the debate preceding the vote in parliament in August 2013 on whether Britain should intervene in the Syrian civil war. The first interpretation treats parliament as a site <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>role</b> contestation. From this perspective, parliamentary war powers matter because they raise the significance of MPs' doubts about Britain's proper global ‘role’. The second interpretation treats parliament as a forum for policy debate. There is nothing new about MPs discussing international initiatives. But now they do more than debate, they decide, at least where military action is involved. From this perspective, parliamentary war powers matter because they make British foreign policy more cautious and less consistent, even if they also make it more transparent and (potentially) more democratic in turn. The final interpretation treats parliament as an arena for political competition. From this perspective, parliamentary involvement exposes major foreign policy decisions to the vagaries of partisan politicking, a potent development in an era of weak or coalition governments, and a recipe for unpredictability. Together these developments made parliament's war powers highly significant, not just where military action is concerned, but for British foreign policy overall...|$|R

She loses her parents to small-pox, arrives in London to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> work, and gets lured into a brothel. She is a clandestine witness to two separate sexual encounters (one between an ugly older couple and another between a young pretty pair), and is a far from unwilling participant in a lesbian dalliance with a bisexual prostitute named Phoebe. Charles (who is a customer at the brothel) induces Fanny to make an escape, which she manages {{to do with her}} virginity intact. Soon thereafter, she loses it to Charles and becomes his lover. Charles is sent away by deception to the South Seas, and Fanny is driven by her desperation and destitution to become the kept woman of a rich merchant named Mr H—. After enjoying a brief period of stability, she espies Mr H— in casual congress with her own maid, and goes on to seduce Will (the young footman of Mr H—) as an act of calculated revenge. However, she is soon discovered by Mr H— in flagrante delicto with Will. After being abandoned by Mr H—, Fanny becomes a prostitute for wealthy and discerning clients in a pleasure-house run by Mrs Cole. This marks {{the end of the first}} letter.|$|R

The organization has already completed 50 years but still there is much debate on its success. Excluding Israel and Egypt, the success story would be much poor.

40|$|This {{publication}} provides summary data on both Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{trade and}} investment relationships with the Group of Twenty (G 20) members as well as G 20 members 2 ̆ 7 trade with the world. Introduction The Group of Twenty (G 20) comprises 19 major economies plus the European Union. It is a forum for international economic cooperation and in 2014 continues its focus on lifting growth and jobs. The G 20 started in 1999 as a meeting of Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors {{in the aftermath of}} the Asian financial crisis. In 2008, the first G 20 Leaders Summit was held, and the group played a key role in responding to the global financial crisis. Its decisive and coordinated actions boosted consumer and business confidence and supported the first stages of economic recovery. G 20 leaders have met eight times since 2008. The 2014 Summit under Australia’s Presidency will be held in Brisbane on 15 and 16 November. Australia’s 2014 agenda focuses on three key themes: (i) growth and jobs, (ii) global resilience and (iii) the relevance of international institutions to 21 st century issues. Trade is a key part in this agenda. On 19 July 2014, Australia hosted a Trade Ministers meeting in Sydney. Ministers and representatives of international organisations discussed the trade actions G 20 members are taking as part of their comprehensive growth strategies that aim to lift collective GDP by more than 2 per cent above the current trajectory over the next five years. They agreed that G 20 members needed to make further contributions to promote trade in their growth strategies. These strategies will form the Brisbane Action Plan to be presented to Leaders at the Summit in November. G 20 countries account for nearly 68 per cent of Australia’s goods and services trade and over 65 per cent of inward investment in Australia. Australia is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> trade actions as part of G 20 countries` comprehensive growth strategies that work towards removing obstacles to trade and enhancing countries’ ability to participate in global value chains (GVCs). The OECD has found that income from trade in GVCs has doubled between 1995 and 2009, benefiting both advanced and emerging economies. Each year the G 20 president invites several guest countries to participate in G 20 events and contribute to the agenda. In 2014 Australia welcomes Spain as a permanent invitee; Mauritania as the 2014 chair of the African Union; Myanmar as the 2014 Chair of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN); Senegal, representing the New Partnership for Africa 2 ̆ 7 s Development; New Zealand; and Singapore.

Children are harmed by it, even if they are not the direct victims of the physical violence. Because domestic abuse is so prevalent and its effects are so far-reaching, court personnel must educate themselves to understand domestic violence and determine strategies for handling cases where it is present. Even if domestic violence is present but {{does not seem to have}} a direct impact on the case at hand, one should be aware of the power and control dynamics of domestic abuse to provide effective intervention in domestic violence cases. Screening <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> violence is important because it can provide information that can help courts make better decisions about the cases before them. Domestic violence is a critical fact in determining the process and the outcome in a domestic relations case. Without an understanding of domestic violence in general and knowledge about whether there is domestic violence in a particular case, the decision maker could erroneously be making orders that (1) increase danger to the victim and children, including the danger of lethality, and (2) reduce the resources available to the victim, thus increasing the likelihood that the violence and abuse will continue. Before the court orders mediation or other alternative processes, it should <b>look</b> into screening <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> violence to ensure that the process of mediation can be effective, and not coercive or revictimizing...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{predictions about the}} effects of personality traits on {{the role of women in}} the workforce, sociopsychological theorists argue that women's representation is largely due to the role of sociological stereotypes and stigmas about the place of women in society. Because it is so widely held (in patrimonial societies) that women are responsible <b>for</b> <b>domestic</b> duties and child-rearing, it has been more difficult for them to advance professionally. Using this information, these theorists have said that the underlying ideas of <b>domestic</b> <b>roles</b> have been so pervasive that they have become integrated into the very institutions of government and business and are often indiscernible. For this reason, the American government has taken action to litigate protection of women in government and workplaces under a variety of Equal Employment Opportunity laws and anti-discrimination policies. Private enterprises have taken measures to limit ddiscrimination by means of training programs, merit hiring, and other policies.|$|R
