50|$|In 1821, William Hart dug {{the first}} well {{specifically}} to produce natural {{gas in the}} United States {{on the banks of}} Canadaway Creek in Fredonia. It was 27 ft deep, excavated with shovels by hand, and its gas pipeline was hollowed out <b>logs</b> <b>sealed</b> with tar and rags. It supplied enough natural gas for lights in two stores, two shops and a gristmill (currently the village's fire station) by 1825. Expanding on Hart's work, the Fredonia Gas Light Company was formed in 1858, becoming the first American natural gas company.

40|$|The most {{promising}} method for {{the disposal of}} highly radioactive nuclear wastes is a vitrification {{process in which the}} wastes are incorporated into borosilicate glass logs, the <b>logs</b> are <b>sealed</b> into welded stainless steel canisters, and the canisters are buried in suitably protected burial sites for disposal. The purpose of the research supported by the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) project of the Department of Energy through Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) and summarized in this report was to gain a basic understanding of the hydrogen generation process and to predict the rate and amount of hydrogen generation during the treatment of HWVP feed simulants with formic acid. The objectives of the study were to determine the key feed components and process variables which enhance or inhibit the. production of hydrogen. Information on the kinetics and stoichiometry of relevant formic acid reactions were sought to provide a basis for viable mechanistic proposals. The chemical reactions were characterized through the production and consumption of the key gaseous products such as H{sub 2 }. CO{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 } 0, NO, and NH{sub 3 }. For this mason this research program relied heavily on analyses of the gases produced and consumed during reactions of the HWVP feed simulants with formic acid under various conditions. Such analyses, used gas chromatographic equipment and expertise at the University of Georgia for the separation and determination of H{sub 2 }, CO, CO{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 }O and NO...|$|R
40|$|Susceptibility {{to branch}} dieback caused by Phytophthora ramorum {{was tested using}} a {{detached}} branch assay for 66 Australian native plant species sourced from established gardens and arboreta in California. Six of these species were further tested for their susceptibility to bole cankers caused by P. ramorum using a <b>sealed</b> <b>log</b> assay. Isopogon formosus and Eucalyptus denticulata were identified as potentially highly susceptible Australian branch dieback hosts. Thirteen potentially tolerant Australian host species included Banksia attenuata, B. marginata, E. haemastoma, E. regnans, Pittosporum undulatum and Billardiera heterophylla. Eucalyptus regnans {{was identified as a}} potentially highly susceptible bole canker host, while E. diversicolor and E. viminalis were considered potentially tolerant species to bole cankers caused by P. ramorum. Phytophthora ramorum was able to infect all 66 species, as confirmed by reisolation. These results extend the known potential host range for P. ramorum, confirm it as a possible threat to Australian plant industries and ecosystems and highlight additional associated hosts that are important in the global horticultural trade, native forests and plantation forestry...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{analysis}} of fish habitat structures has received little attention in engineering research or in practical application. The objective {{of my work}} was to calibrate scour and discharge equations for common habitat structures. These equations predict water depths and velocities, {{which can be used}} in physical habitat models to predict quantities of habitat created or lost when structures are installed in streams. In addition to habitat estimation, this research can aid in proper placement of structures in streams and in flood-potential analysis. Structures that were physically modeled include log weirs, flow deflectors, digger logs, and a new structure called a digger weir. One existing scour equation slightly underestimated scour at log weir models. The same equation also predicted scour at models of digger weirs. The coefficient of discharge for model log weirs correlated with log diameter. Field conditions of sloped log crests and poorly <b>sealed</b> <b>logs</b> contributed to a wide variation in discharge coefficients at prototype logs. The submerged flow equation predicted backwater depths at model deflectors with less than 15 % error. Three deflector scour equations tested were based on sand bed channels and did not accurately predict gravel bed model scour. Model digger logs developed the largest scour hole when the base of the log was level with the channel bed...|$|R
40|$|In {{air drying}} of Eucalyptus urophylla and Corymbia citriodora logs for the {{production}} of charcoal it is necessary to be able to predict when logs have reached the required moisture content of &# 8804; 35 %. This study is aimed to produce models using basic density and diameter to predict the moisture content of Eucalyptus urophylla and Corymbia citriodora logs after 30, 60 and 90 days drying. 1, 2 m long logs were taken at three different heights from three C. citriodora trees and three trees each from two E. urophylla clones (VM 4 and Mn 463). The 27 debarked, end <b>sealed</b> <b>logs</b> were air dried under cover for 90 days during which the change in moisture content was monitored. The relationship between density and drying was analyzed by Pearson&# 8217;s correlation coefficient and the models for predicting the moisture content based on the basic density and diameter were produced. The density and the drying showed a high correlation coefficient. The coefficient of determination of the models was above 0, 89 with a standard error lower than 6 %. The use of the density and diameter to estimate the wood moisture content simplifies the production of the models, which can be used for Eucalyptus and Corymbia genetic materials...|$|R
50|$|Species were {{described}} from three other islands, but their existence {{is based on}} scant evidence. The purported Rábida Island species (C. wallacei) was described from a single specimen collected by the California Academy of Sciences in December 1905, which has since been lost. This individual was probably an artificial introduction from another island that was originally penned on Rábida next to a good anchorage, as no contemporary whaling or <b>sealing</b> <b>logs</b> mention removing tortoises from this island. The C. phantastica species from Fernandina is known from a single specimen — an old male from the voyage of 1905-06. No other tortoises or remains have been found on the island, suggesting the specimen was an artificial introduction from elsewhere. Fernandina has neither human settlements nor feral mammals, so if this species ever did exist, its extinction must have been by natural means, such as volcanic activity. The Santa Fe species has no binomial name, having been described from the limited evidence of bone fragments (but no shells, the most durable part) of 14 individuals, old eggs, and old dung found on the island in 1905-06. The island has never been inhabited by man nor had any introduced predators. The remains are considered artificial introductions, possibly from camping at the good anchorage on the island.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRepresentative {{strains of}} Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum (MAIS) grew at equal rates in {{laboratory}} medium at 21 % (air) and 12 % oxygen. Growth in 6 % oxygen proceeded at a 1. 4 – 1. 8 -fold lower rate. Colony formation {{was the same}} at 21 % (air) and 6 % oxygen. The MAIS strains survived rapid shifts from aerobic to anaerobic conditions as measured by two experimental approaches (Falkinham (1996) [1]). MAIS cells grown aerobically to log phase in broth were diluted, spread on agar medium, and incubated anaerobically for up to 20 days at 37 °C. Although no colonies formed anaerobically, upon transfer to aerobic conditions, greater than 25 % of the colony forming units (CFU) survived after 20 days of anaerobic incubation (Prince et al. (1989) [2]). MAIS cells grown in broth aerobically to <b>log</b> phase were <b>sealed</b> and vigorous agitation led to oxygen depletion (Wayne model). After 12 days anaerobic incubation, M. avium and M. scrofulaceum survival were high (> 50 %), while M. intracellulare survival was lower (22 %). M. avium cells shifted to anaerobiosis in broth had increased levels of glycine dehydrogenase and isocitrate lyase. Growth of MAIS strains at low oxygen levels and their survival following a rapid shift to anaerobiosis is consistent with their presence in environments with fluctuating oxygen levels...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sealing</b> <b>log</b> {{books from}} 75 out of 79 {{commercial}} harvest cruises carried out between 1972 and 1994 in the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia, were analyzed to describe {{spatial and temporal}} allocation of ice-associated seal harvest effort, species composition of catches, total harvest rates, and related parameters for species including ringed (Pusa hispida), ribbon (Histriophoca fasciata), bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and spotted (Phoca largha) seal. Variations in catch per unit effort were explored in relation to year, sea ice conditions, day of the year, and geographic location. In most years, the harvest was predominantly represented by ringed seals (mean = 0. 43, range 0. 25 - 0. 67), followed by ribbon (mean = 0. 31, range 0. 15 - 0. 43), spotted (mean = 0. 19, range 0. 11 - 0. 35) and bearded seals (mean = 0. 07, range 0. 03 - 0. 14). The struck-and-lost percentages were as high as 30 - 35 % for ringed, bearded and spotted seals and 15 - 20 % for ribbon seals. Catch per unit effort (number of seals/skiff*day) for ringed, ribbon, and spotted seals had a similar seasonal pattern with a distinct spike in catches for spotted seals {{in the first week}} of May, for ribbon seals in the last week of May, and for ringed seals in the second week of June. Catches of bearded seals showed a less pronounced temporal structure with a gradual increase toward the end of the harvest season in the majority of years. Spatial distribution of harvest effort followed closely with seal distribution obtained from aerial surveys. These data could be used as a source of information on seal herd location throughout the breeding and molting seasons and for more complex demographic or life-table models. We did not find any evidence of the decline of catch per unit effort over the study period. Timely introduction of state regulations and efficient harvest management apparently prevented severe depletion of ice-associated seal populations in the Sea of Okhotsk during the periods of their intense exploitation...|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora ramorum is an {{invasive}} {{plant pathogen}} causing considerable and widespread damage in nurseries, gardens and natural woodland ecosystems of the USA and Europe. In Australia, {{where it is}} classified as a Category 1 emergency plant pest, {{it has the potential}} to become a major economic and ecological threat in areas with susceptible hosts and a favourable climate. Phytophthora ramorum causes three distinct diseases on susceptible plants: ramorum leaf blight, ramorum shoot dieback and sudden oak death (characterised by lethal bole cankers). In some species, foliar infection can play a crucial role in disease development by producing inoculum that can drive an epiphytotic. The geographic origin of P. ramorum remains unknown and an understanding of the environmental requirements most conducive to establishment and persistence of disease under natural conditions is still poorly understood. This study aimed to: (a) provide an understanding of the foliar, branch and bole susceptibility to P. ramorum and sporangia producing potential of a broad range of Australian plant species; (b) develop a climate-based model of the potential geographic range of the pathogen; and (c) analyse the effectiveness of integration of scientific knowledge between European and North American policy and management responses to P. ramorum. Detached leaves, branches and logs of up to 70 Australian native plant species were tested for their susceptibility and sporulation potential. Foliar susceptibility was tested using detached leaf assays for 70 Australian native plant species; twenty-eight of these species were tested for their ability to produce sporangia on foliage. Branch dieback susceptibility was tested for 66 of these species, six of which were further tested for their susceptibility to bole cankers caused by P. ramorum using a <b>sealed</b> <b>log</b> assay. All materials were sourced from native woodlands, established gardens and arboreta in California. Positive control species known to be naturally highly susceptible to P. ramorum were included in all experiments. All species tested were capable of being infected by P. ramorum. Highly susceptible foliar hosts included Banksia attenuata, Eucalyptus delegatensis, E. denticulata, E. viminalis, Isopogon cuneatus, I. formosus and Leptospermum scoparium. Hedycarya angustifolia, Olearia argophylla, Phyllocladus aspleniifolius, Pittosporum undulatum and Podocarpus lawrencei were identified as potentially resistant foliar hosts. Putative sporulating hosts include five members of the Myrtaceae: Agonis flexuosa, C. ficifolia, E. haemastoma, E. delegatensis and E. viminalis. Highly susceptible branch hosts included E. denticulata, E. sideroxylon, E. viminalis, Hardenbergia violaceae, I. formosus and N. cunninghamii. Thirteen potentially tolerant branch dieback hosts were identified and included B. attenuata, B. marginata, Billardiera heterophylla, E. haemastoma, E. regnans and P. undulatum. Eucalyptus regnans was identified as a potentially highly susceptible bole canker host, while E. diversicolor and E. viminalis were considered potentially tolerant species to bole cankers caused by P. ramorum. A simulation model was developed using CLIMEX to estimate the global climate suitability patterns for establishment of P. ramorum. Growth requirements and stress response parameters were derived from ecophysiological laboratory observations and site-level transmission and disease factors related to climate data in the field. Models fitted to the European (EU 1) and combined EU 1 and North American (NA 1) genotypes indicated that European genotypes may be constrained to a greater degree by higher temperatures than North American genotypes. The combined risk model suggests that the invasion of P. ramorum in both North America and Europe is still in its infancy and it is presently occupying a small fraction of its available range. Southern Europe may be at greater risk of invasion should the NA 1 genotype be introduced into warmer areas unsuitable for the predominant EU 1 genotype. Phytophthora ramorum appears to be climatically suited to large areas of Australasia (including New Zealand), Africa and South America. Potential distribution in Australia indicates south east coastal Australia, the southwest region of Western Australia and Tasmania are at highest risk of invasion. Comparison of the integration of science into policy-making and control efforts in Europe and North America are varied, representing the use of many different ‘boundary arrangements’. Experiences with P. ramorum in these regions indicate that future biosecurity efforts to prevent the entry and establishment of P. ramorum and other invasive organisms may benefit from: (i) fostering local management approaches which connect and build relationships with affected communities and build capacity accordingly; (ii) incorporating structural arrangements for the integration of science into policy at a national level, encouraging scientists and policy makers to directly engage with one-another to allow for the rapid dissemination of new knowledge directly applicable to policy applications; (iii) aiming to produce regional or global pest risk analyses which enable knowledge and research cost-sharing, and; (iv) investment in studies outlining the effectiveness and success of different boundary arrangements in achieving positive biosecurity outcomes. These results extend the known potential host range for P. ramorum and define its potential geographic range, confirming it as a potential threat to Australian plant industries and ecosystems. Caution is advised when interpreting these results; the species studied represent only a small proportion of Australian taxa which exist in climatically suitable areas for the pathogen in Australia and invasive organisms may behave differently in novel locations given different environmental and management constraints. Nevertheless, risk predictions generated by the model, an understanding of the pathogen’s potential host range and analysis of the best way to integrate this knowledge into policy and management efforts will allow us to target high risk areas for early detection surveillance and assist Australian regulators in developing appropriate quarantine policies and protocols...|$|R
