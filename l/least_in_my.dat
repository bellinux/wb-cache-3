500|$|Wario World {{received}} fairly positive reviews. The US {{version of}} Play magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that Wario World [...] "pays off every second [...] holding the controller, and that, to , is greatness". Nintendo Power {{said that the}} game was [...] "tons of fun". GamePro stated that Wario World [...] "stays addictive by weight of sheer design innovation". The American-based publication Game Informer praised the game for including [...] "droves of awesome boss battles". Matt Casamassina of IGN declared that Wario World had [...] "some great control mechanics and inventive level work". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Greg Ford said, [...] "Wario [...] delivers a great time while it lasts and is well worth checking out. Just don't expect a Mario-quality adventure". Worthplaying gave the game 9 out 10, stating that [...] "Treasure has done itself proud with this title, and Wario himself can lift his head up high. At <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book, he's got at least one game that's better than Mario's." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{supporting}} tour for 9, Mercyful Fate {{was put on}} hiatus. King Diamond focused on his eponymous band, along with guitarist Mike Wead, who joined the group during the European House of God tour. Hank Shermann and Bjarne T. Holm reunited with Michael Denner to form Force of Evil, while Sharlee D'Angelo joined the band Arch Enemy. When asked about {{the current state of}} the band in 2008, Diamond stated that Mercyful Fate is currently [...] "hibernating", and that [...] "it's definitely not finished, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book." [...] In August 2008, King Diamond was asked by Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich if Mercyful Fate would be willing to participate in Activision's [...] video game. Ulrich requested the original masters for two of the band's songs, so they could be used in the game. Unable to locate them, Diamond suggested to Activision the band re-record the songs, and as a result, King Diamond, Hank Shermann, Michael Denner, Timi Hansen and Bjarne T. Holm reunited to re-record the songs [...] "Evil" [...] and [...] "Curse of the Pharaohs". King Diamond was also made into a playable character in the game.|$|E
2500|$|While still {{attending}} Franklin in 1943, Capote {{began working}} as a copyboy in the art department at The New Yorker, a job he held {{for two years before}} being fired for angering poet Robert Frost. Years later, he reminisced, [...] "Not a very grand job, for all it really involved was sorting cartoons and clipping newspapers. Still, I was fortunate to have it, especially since I was determined never to set a studious foot inside a college classroom. I felt that either one was or wasn't a writer, and no combination of professors could influence the outcome. I still think I was correct, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own case." [...] He left his job to live with relatives in Alabama and began writing his first novel, Summer Crossing.|$|E

2500|$|... "Without PETA, {{the number}} of people who have even HEARD of animal rights/welfare/protection would be reduced by at <b>least</b> half, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> best guestimate." ...|$|R
5000|$|The bar line is much, {{much more}} than a mere accent, and I don't believe that it can be {{simulated}} by an accent, at <b>least</b> not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only one can go, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cariole," [...] remarked Lambert, [...] "for it only holds two, {{and no one}} {{can drive}} Black Dick but myself." ...|$|E
60|$|With Bewick on my knee, I {{was then}} happy: happy at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast- room door opened.|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{like them}} or not, as you please," [...] said Dan sullenly; but he sat down, and waited decently for his sister to speak. [...] "But you can't abuse them--at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> presence." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is not the}} <b>least</b> use <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{looking over}} these sheets: you {{probably}} know more about Athens than I do, and what I do know is out of and in Smith's Dictionary, {{where you can find}} it without trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} hurry when {{the object is}} only to prevent my saying a bon mot, for {{there is not the}} <b>least</b> wit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> nature. I am a very matter-of-fact, plain-spoken being, and may blunder on the borders of a repartee for half an hour {{together}} without striking it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he, at <b>least,</b> is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> debt," [...] cried Mademoiselle, {{now making}} a step forward, and {{sustained}} by an excitement born of hope. [...] "Whatever may be my father's sins, M. la Boulaye, at least, will {{not seek to}} visit them upon the daughter, for he owes his life to me, and he will not forget the debt." ...|$|R
60|$|I had now {{completely}} {{got over}} my sea-sickness, and felt very well; at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> body, though {{my heart was}} far from feeling right; so that I could now look around me, and make observations.|$|E
60|$|Har. Never {{any thing}} of moment {{was done at}} our council-table without a leaking tub, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time; great affairs require great {{consultations}}, great consultations require great drinking, and great drinking a great leaking vessel.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} fear that my {{presence}} will offend you much longer, mademoiselle," [...] he said coldly. [...] "I can quite understand how hateful {{it must be}} to you, though I would have wished that you could believe at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sincerity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in {{the sense}} you mean, Sergeant--no, not in that p'int of view; never! At <b>least,</b> not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion. I know that natur' is weak--human natur', I mean--and that we should none of us vaunt of our gifts, whether red or white; but I do not think a truer-hearted lad lives on the lines than Jasper Western." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was not the}} <b>least</b> doubt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind (knowing as I did, {{how deeply}} Madame Fontaine was {{interested}} in forcing her acquaintance on Mr. Keller) that this was exactly what she did want. Fortune is proverbially said to favor the bold; and Fortune offered to the widow the perilous opportunity of which {{she had been in}} search.|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} the art of continuous-time filter design is reviewed. Several {{techniques}} are discussed and compared in terms of performance an implementation feasibility in different fabrication technologies. This review does not aim at historical completeness, but rather emphasizes techniques that have proven their worth in commercial applications or at <b>least</b> show, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion of the author, promise for the future...|$|R
60|$|Some of {{my friends}} (H.C. for instance) doubt whether poetry on {{contemporary}} persons and events can be good. But I instance Spenser's 'Marriage,' and Milton's 'Lycidas.' True, the 'Persae' {{is one of the}} worst of Aeschylus's plays; at <b>least,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion.|$|E
60|$|The {{business}} of the evening was {{to present to the}} people a great Object Lesson, and the only figure on the platform that bulked large--at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> esteem--was that of Dr Barnardo himself, and a magical master of the ceremonies did the doctor prove himself to be.|$|E
6000|$|... [571] The {{advance of}} science and of {{language}} has rendered it unnecessary to translate the above good and true English, spoken in its original purity by the select mobility and their patrons. The following is a stanza of a song which was very popular at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> early days:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of {{historic}} fact, and since you put it directly, one does not," [...] said Attwater. [...] "Why ring a bell, when there flows out from oneself and everything about one a far more momentous silence? the least beat of my heart and the <b>least</b> thought <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind echoing into eternity for ever and for ever and for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|As he was {{thinking}} how he also might escape now,--might escape and comfort himself with his triumph,--Mrs. Outhouse returned to the chamber. She was very demure, and her manner towards him was considerably changed since {{she had left the}} chamber. [...] "Mr. Stanbury," [...] she said, [...] "this kind of thing mustn't go any further indeed;--at <b>least</b> not <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house." ...|$|R
6000|$|He.--And {{that is what}} I said: the atrocity of {{the action}} carries [...] you beyond contempt, and hence my sincerity. I wished you to know [...] to what a degree I excelled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> art, to extort from you the [...] {{admission}} that I was at <b>least</b> original <b>in</b> <b>my</b> abasement, to rank me [...] in your mind on {{the line of the}} great good-for-noughts, and to hail [...] me henceforth--Vivat Mascarillus, fourbum imperator! ...|$|R
60|$|Friend,-However thou camest by {{this book}}, I will assure thee thou wast <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{thoughts}} when I writ it; I tell thee, I intended this book as little for thee as the goldsmith intendeth his jewels and rings for the snout of a sow. Wherefore put on reason, and lay aside thy frenzy; be sober, or lay {{by the book}} (Matt 7:6).|$|E
6000|$|And in the {{delirium}} of the moment, I {{began to}} indulge in foolish golden visions of the counts and countesses to whom Harry might introduce me; and every instant I expected to hear the waiters addressing some gentleman as [...] "My Lord," [...] or [...] "four Grace." [...] But if there were really any lords present, the waiters omitted their titles, at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are really}} most generous," [...] went on Ida {{in the same}} bitter tone, the irony of which made her father wince, for he {{understood}} her mood better than did her lover. [...] "I only regret that I cannot appreciate such generosity more than I do. But it is at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power {{to give you the}} return which you deserve. So I can no longer hesitate, but once and for all----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would to}} Heaven," [...] he {{repeated}} in conclusion, [...] "I {{could have come}} in time to save you from becoming his wife. But at <b>least</b> it is <b>in</b> <b>my</b> power to make you very speedily his widow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>in</b> Heaven's name, <b>my</b> good friend, tell it me,' said Nicholas. 'For God's sake {{consider}} my deplorable condition; and, while I promise {{to take no}} step without taking counsel with you, give me, at <b>least,</b> a vote <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own behalf.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me of them all," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have heard}} naught of them since we left Tutbury, where at <b>least</b> we were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Lord's house, and the dear old silver dog was on every sleeve. Ah! there he is, the trusty rogue." ...|$|R
60|$|Of birds {{not found}} in the {{interior}} of the State,--at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> neighborhood,--I heard, in the summer, the Black-throated Bunting (Fringilla Americana) amid the shrubbery, and in the open land the Upland Plover (Totanus Bartramius), whose quivering notes were ever and anon prolonged into a clear, somewhat plaintive, yet hawk-like scream, which sounded at a very indefinite distance. The bird may have been in the next field, though it sounded a mile off.|$|E
60|$|The plaster Venuses and Apollos {{that used}} to adorn the vast aisle and huge grey {{terraces}} of the Crystal Palace were the first intimations of {{the beauty of the}} body that ever came into my life. As I write of it I feel again the shameful attraction of those gracious forms. I used to look at them not simply, but curiously and askance. Once at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> later days at Penge, I spent a shilling in admission chiefly for the sake of them....|$|E
60|$|And {{whatever}} is good {{is led by}} the manager of the works, whose influence over the workmen's minds has never failed. Even when he talked to me on that day, I thought there was a change in his tone. He had never sneered (at <b>least</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hearing) nor questioned other men's faith, but when he told me of Harold his manner had something of awe, as well as of sorrow and admiration, and I could not but think that a sense had dawned out that the spiritual was a reality, and an absolute power over the material.|$|E
60|$|At {{that period}} I had the fortune {{to find myself}} in perfect {{concurrence}} with a large majority in this House. Bowing under that high authority, and penetrated with the sharpness and strength of that early impression, I have continued ever since, without the <b>least</b> deviation, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> original sentiments. Whether this be owing to an obstinate perseverance in error, or to a religious adherence to what appears to me truth and reason, it is in your equity to judge.|$|R
60|$|I {{wanted to}} kill that gnawing pain of suspicion. I thought if I stood up before them and cried out that <b>my</b> trust <b>in</b> you was so great, I was willing to marry you {{notwithstanding}} everything, I should at <b>least</b> have peace <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own heart.|$|R
60|$|We rode a few miles, {{and then}} Matteo turned back. When I found myself alone I heaved a great sigh of relief. I was free {{for a while}} at <b>least....</b> Another episode <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life was finished; I could forget it, {{and look forward to}} new things.|$|R
