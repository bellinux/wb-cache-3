40|$|Effective, Economical, and Environmentally Friendly – {{the three}} Es of spray application. In {{practical}} terms, the three Es mean the pesticide {{has to do}} a good job controlling the pest while allowing the operation to be fast, inexpensive, and low-drift. Viewed individually, or in groups of two, each of these goals is achievable. But meeting all three together requires compromise. Success relies less on a herbicide’s knockout punch, and more on integrating application with agronomic considerations that help herbicides do their job. For example, perhaps timely application is more important than perfect control; this may mean that coarser sprays, though possibly less effective, provide an overall advantage if they allow sprays to be applied at the right time. Any application approach has to be reconciled with continuing trends in the equipment, such as the use of heavier, faster machines and the need to cover more area in less time. All of these have implications for nozzle selection, because changes in boom height or travel speed affect nozzle performance. A better understanding of these three factors is necessary so that appropriate nozzle, sprayer, or water volume selections can be made. Inevitably, compliance with spray quality or wind speed restrictions on product <b>labels</b> will require <b>applicators</b> to apply coarser sprays no matter what type of sprayer they use. Selecting the correct nozzles and using them properly will be the key ingredients to success...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} chemoreception by squamate {{reptiles}} has become integral to understanding {{many aspects of}} their behaviour. However, previous studies of snakes have concentrated on its importance in prey choice and {{few studies have examined}} its role in kin discrimination. We examined the role of chemoreception not only in prey selection by ingestively naı¨ve neonate smooth snakes, but also as a mechanism for discrimination between kin. We tested the responses of neonate smooth snakes to cotton-tipped <b>applicators</b> <b>labelled</b> with odours of potential prey species and control substances, both before and after their natal shedding events. Neonates tested prior to their natal shedding event were able to discriminate between potential prey species and an odourless control but not between potential prey and a pungent control. In contrast, neonates tested after their natal shedding event showed a significantly increased tongue-flick response towards the scent of nonkin conspecifics, lizard (Anguis fragilis and Zootoca vivipara) and mammalian prey (Mus musculus) compared to that towards both pungent and odourless controls. However, scents of invertebrate prey species and kin, while eliciting more tongue-flicks than the odourless control, did not elicit more than the pungent control. The apparent ability of smooth snake neonates to differentiate between kin and nonkin using chemoreception was confirmed during ‘blind’ trials. The mechanism by which kin discrimination occurs is discussed...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{foraging}} mode of the Cape grass lizard, Chamaesaura anguina, {{was determined}} by using three criteria: 1) the number of movements per minute (MPM) {{and the percentage of}} time spent moving (PTM) during periods of activity; 2) the amount of tongueflicking directed at cotton <b>applicators</b> <b>labelled</b> with prey chemicals as a measure of prey chemical discrimination; 3) the stomach contents of the lizards as an indication of the natural diet. Observations were made by means of binoculars from an observation tower using a seminatural outdoor enclosure, and through a one-way glass panel using a seminatural indoor enclosure. Each lizard was observed for aIO minute period during peak activity and the times it was moving and the times it was stationary were recorded. Data obtained in the indoor- and outdoor enclosures did not differ significantly and were pooled. "MPM(0. 37 ± 0. 21 SD) and PTM (1. 92 % ± 0. 93 SD) values recorded for C. anguina (N = 10) fall within the range given as characteristic for sit-and-wait foragers. Nine C. anguina individuals were habituated in glass terraria to accept mealworms offered to them. When all lizards accepted food without hesitation, they were tested for their ability to discriminate among three different odours presented to them in a randomized block design: prey odours consisting of mealworm surface odours, distilled water as an odourless control stimulus, and cologne as a pungency control. The number of tongue-flicks directed at the cotton applicator containing the stimulus odour during 60 s was recorded. No statistically significant differences were found among the responses to the three treatment odours (Kruskal-Wallis, H = 2. 41, dj = 2, P = 0. 30). An analysis of the stomach contents of 21 C. anguina specimens revealed a diet of mostly diurnally active arthropod prey species. The preferred body temperatures selected by 12 grass lizards in a thermal gradient were measured six times during a 48 hour period, using a copper-constantan thermocouple inserted into the cloaca. The measured body temperatures (N = 72) ranged from 22. 62 oe - 27. 07 oe with a mean of 24. 82 oe ± 2. 27 SD. The low preferred body temperature exhibited by C. anguina as compared to other cordylids may be attributed to the combined influence of vegetative cover, high altitude, and high surface-volume ratio. To determine movement patterns and microhabitat use, six lizards were observed in a seminatural outdoor enclosure (4 x 4 m). The location of the grass tufts in the enclosure was mapped, and the position of each lizard within the enclosure was noted on 17 mornings. Observations of lizard behaviour during periods of activity were made by means of binoculars from an observation tower. Although C. anguina did not show reliance on a specific shelter site, the taller, broader tufts were generally preferred as refuges during inactivity. There were significant differences between the heights (student's z-test; P < 0. 001) and the diameters (Mann-Whitney; P < O. 00 1) of the preferred grass tufts, and those grass tufts that were not preferred as refuges, respectively. The lizards usually sheltered in a coiled-up position {{in the middle of the}} grass tufts close to the ground. During active periods, the lizards perched in an elevated position in the vegetation by entangling their elongated bodies and tails in the grass for efficient weight distribution. Locomotion was mainly restricted to the strike action when attacking prey. Fynbos and grassland, which are the main habitat of grass lizards of the genus Chamaesaura, are fire-prone. With their serpentiform morphology, grass lizards differ markedly from other cordylids, the majority of which are rock-dwelling. One aim of this study was to determine whether grass lizards make use of refuges like burrows or crevices within their grasslrestioid habitat during periods of inactivity or when threatened by fire. Refuge selection during inactivity was determined experimentally. Twelve lizards were offered different refuge options, namely grass tufts, crevices, burrows and loose sand. All twelve lizards preferred to shelter in the grass tufts. When the grass tufts were removed, only two lizards made use of the burrows and crevices provided, the other 10 not sheltering at all. Refuge selection when threatened by fire was tested by placing the 12 lizards in an enclosure provided with grass tufts and two types of refuges, burrows and crevices. The grass was set alight at one end of the enclosure and the fire was fanned on towards the other end with the aid of a high-speed fan. Precautions were taken to ensure the safety of all the lizards and to intervene when they were in direct danger. Only two of the 12 lizards sought shelter in the refuges provided. Of the remaining 10, six fled and four were trapped by the flames, requiring intervention. The results of these experiments, as well as field observations, suggest that C. anguina seldom makes use of shelter options other than grass and restio tufts, even when threatened by fire. In the case of fire, it flees by 'grass-swimming'. Field observations also suggest that mortality during and after a fire is considerably higher than in the case of rock-dwelling cordylids. The reproductive status of adult females (N = 85) were determined on the basis of the developmental stage of ovarian follicles and the presence or absence of oviductal eggs. Females were grouped into four reproductive categories: pre-vitellogenic, early vitellogenic, pre-ovulatory and gravid. To determine the reproductive cycle exhibited by the males (N = 46), testicular volume and seminiferous tube diameter were measured, as well as the spermatogenic activity assessed qualitatively. Spermatogenic activity was assessed by using Licht's (1967) classification system. The snout-vent length (SVL) of 144 specimens was measured. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) recorded for C. anguina was quantified by a size dimorphism index (SDI). Reproductive activity was asynchronous among females, differing from the normal cordylid cycle of autumn/winter vitello genic activity, followed by winter/spring ovulation and gestation in late summer to autumn. The significant seasonal variation that existed in testes volume (ANOVA; F (7, 22) = 3. 70; P < 0. 05) and seminiferous tubule diameter (ANOVA; F (10, 25) = 4. 90; P < 0. 05), as well as sermatogenic activity as observed by histological examination, indicated that C. anguina males follow an annual spermatogenic cycle that can be described as post-nuptial. The cycle is characterized by summer/autumn spermiogenesis, associated with sperm storage throughout winter. Chamaesaura anguina males differ from other cordylids following a post-nuptial cycle, by starting with spermatogenesis in spring. The mean SVL of female grass lizards (109. 51 mm ± 20. 60 SD) was significantly larger (Mann-Whitney; P < 0. 001) than that of males (84. 77 mm ± 9. 39 SD). A positive SDI of 1. 29 and a SDImax of lAO were determined. Female-biased dimorphism in SVL recorded for C. anguina corresponds with the general pattern recorded for terrestrial cordylids, but contrasts with male-biased dimorphism in rupicolous forms. The longer SVL of C. anguina females facilitates higher fecundity. This, in turn, might be an adaptive survival strategy for this lizard species in the fire-prone environment where it occurs, because successful recruitment is facilitated by high fecundity.

Waarnemings is met 'n verkyker vanaf 'n waarnemingstoring langs 'n buitemuurse kampie gemaak, terwyl dit deur 'n eenrigting glaspaneel in die geval van 'n binnemuurse opstelling gemaak is. Elke akkedis is vir 'n periode van 10 minute tydens piek-aktiwiteit dopgehou, en die tye wat dit beweeg het en nie beweeg het nie, is aangeteken. Data verkry in die binnemuurse - en buitemuurse opstellings het nie statisties van mekaar verskil nie en is saamgevoeg. BPM (0. 37 ± 0. 21 SD) en PTB (1. 92 % ± 0. 93 SD) waardes aangeteken vir C. anguina (N = 10) val binne die reeks waardes wat as kenmerkend vir sit-en-wag voeders beskou word. Nege C. anguina individue is in glas terraria gewoond gemaak om meelwurms te aanvaar wat hul aangebied is. Toe al die akkedisse die kos sonder huiwering aanvaar het, is hul vermoë getoets om tussen drie verskillende geure wat hul aangebied is in 'n ewekansige blokontwerp, te diskrimineer: prooigeur bestaande uit die reuk van meelwurms, gedistilleerde water as 'n geurlose kontrole stimulus, en reukwater as 'n skerp kontrole. Die hoeveelheid tongskiete gerig na die gegeurde wattepluisie gedurende 'n 60 s periode, is aangeteken. Geen statisties-beduidende verskille is gevind tussen die reaksies tot die drie geure nie (Kruskal-Wallis, H = 2. 41, df= 2, P = 0. 30). 'n Analise van die maaginhoude van 21 C. anguina individue het meestal dag-aktiewe arthropoda prooispesies onthul. Die voorkeur liggaamstemperature wat deur 12 akkedisse in 'n termiese gradiënt geselekteer is, is ses maal gemeet gedurende 'n 48 uur periode, deur van 'n termo-koppel wat in die kloaka geplaas is, gebruik te maak. Die bepaalde liggaamstemperature (N = 72) het gevariëer van 22. 62 oe - 27. 07 oe met 'n gemiddeld van 24. 82 oe ± 2. 27 SA. Die lae|$|R
