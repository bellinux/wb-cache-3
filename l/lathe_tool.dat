50|$|Diamond turning is a {{multi-stage}} process. Initial {{stages of}} machining {{are carried out}} using a series of CNC lathes of increasing accuracy. A diamond-tipped <b>lathe</b> <b>tool</b> {{is used in the}} final stages of the manufacturing process to achieve sub-nanometer level surface finishes and sub-micrometer form accuracies. The surface finish quality is measured as the peak-to-valley distance of the grooves left by the lathe. The form accuracy is measured as a mean deviation from the ideal target form. Quality of surface finish and form accuracy is monitored throughout the manufacturing process using such equipment as contact and laser profilometers, laser interferometers, optical and electron microscopes. Diamond turning is most often used for making infrared optics, because at longer wavelengths optical performance is less sensitive to surface finish quality, and because many of the materials used are difficult to polish with traditional methods.|$|E
