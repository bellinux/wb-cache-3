5|$|This {{class of}} {{objections}} is more radical than the above, claiming {{that a major}} aspect of evolution is not merely unscientific or implausible, but rather impossible, because it contradicts some other <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> or is constrained {{in such a way}} that it cannot produce the biological diversity of the world.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by its mother. His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E
40|$|<b>Laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are puzzling {{because they}} have a ‘modal character’—they seem to be ‘necessary-ish’—even though they also seem to be metaphysically contingent. And it is hard to {{understand}} how contingent truths could have such a modal character. Scientific essentialism is a doctrine that seems to dissolve this puzzle, by showing that <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are actually metaphysically necessary. I argue that even if the metaphysics of natural kinds and properties offered by scientific essentialism is correct, there are still some metaphysically contingent truths that share the modal character <b>of</b> the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> I argue that these contingent truths should be considered <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> So even if scientific essentialism is true, at least some <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are metaphysically contingent...|$|R
40|$|Space is something. Space {{inherently}} contains <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> nature: universal rules (mathematics, space dimensions, {{types of}} forces, types of fields, and particle species), laws (relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism) and symmetries (Lorentz, Gauge, and symmetry breaking). We have significant knowledge about these <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> because all our scientific theories assume their presence. Their existence {{is critical for}} developing either a unique theory of our universe or more speculative multiverse theories. Scientists generally ignore the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> because they “are what they are” and because visualizing different <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> challenges the imagination. This article defines a conceptual model separating space (<b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature)</b> from the universe’s energy source (initial conditions) and expansion (big bang). By considering the ramifications <b>of</b> changing the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> initial condition parameters, and two variables in the big bang theory, the model demonstrates that traditional fine tuning is {{not the whole story}} when creating a universe. Supporting the model, space and “nothing” are related to the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> mathematics and multiverse possibilities. Speculation on the beginning of time completes the model...|$|R
25|$|Armstrong's {{theory of}} {{universals}} {{gives him the}} basis for an understanding <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as being relations between universals, a non-Humean account <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> proposed independently by Armstrong, Michael Tooley, and Fred Dretske. This account posits that the relations between universals are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are {{a feature of the}} world rather than just a way we talk about the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between universals rather than particulars as an account <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> involving just particulars rather than universals would not adequately explain how <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> operate in the case of counterfactuals.|$|R
5|$|My lords, the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> moves me to sorrow for my sister; {{the burden}} that is fallen upon me makes me amazed, and yet, {{considering}} I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring {{from the bottom}} of my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the more}} famous <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are found in Isaac Newton's {{theories}} of (now) classical mechanics, presented in his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, and in Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.

25|$|To {{explain all}} {{experiments}} conducted before 1904, Lorentz {{was forced to}} again expand his theory by introducing the complete Lorentz transformation.

40|$|Some {{have tried}} to make miracles {{compatible}} with the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> by re-defining them as something other than interventions. By contrast, this article argues that although miracles are divine interventions, they are not violations <b>of</b> the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Miracles are also not exceptions to the laws, nor do the laws not apply to them. The laws never have exceptions, they never are violated or suspended. They probably are necessary and unchangeable. They apply to divine interventions too. We need to reconsider not miracles but laws. The main claim {{of this article is}} that <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> do not entail regularities, and that therefore miracles do not violate the laws. We need a new theory <b>of</b> the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> the tendency theory...|$|R

5000|$|Gerald Schroeder in [...] "The Big Bang Creation: God or the <b>Laws</b> <b>of</b> Nature" [...] {{explains}} that [...] "The Grand Design breaks the news, bitter to some, that … {{to create a}} universe from absolute nothing God is not necessary. All that is needed are the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> … is, there can {{have been a big}} bang creation without the help of God, provided the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> pre-date the universe. Our concept of time begins with the creation of the universe. Therefore if the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> created the universe, these laws must have existed prior to time; that is the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> would be outside of time. What we have then is totally non-physical <b>laws,</b> outside <b>of</b> time, creating a universe. Now that description might sound somewhat familiar. Very much like the biblical concept of God: not physical, outside of time, able to create a universe." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nomological {{possibility}} is possibility under the actual <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Most philosophers since David Hume {{have held that}} the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are metaphysically contingent—that {{there could have been}} different natural laws than the ones that actually obtain. If so, then it would not be logically or metaphysically impossible, for example, for you to travel to Alpha Centauri in one day; it would just have to be the case that you could travel faster than the speed of light. But of course there is an important sense in which this is not possible; given that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are what they are, {{there is no way that}} you could do it. (Some philosophers, such as Sydney Shoemaker , have argued that the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are in fact necessary, not contingent; if so, then nomological {{possibility is}} equivalent to metaphysical possibility.) ...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} is {{an extremely}} successful theory <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and yet it lacks an intuitive axiomatization. In contrast, the special theory of relativity is well understood and is rooted into natural or experimentally justified postulates. Here we introduce an axiomatization approach to quantum mechanics which {{is very similar to}} special theory of relativity derivation. The core idea is that a composed system obeys the same <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as its components. This leads to a Jordan-Lie algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The starting assumptions are minimal: the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are invariant under time evolution, the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are invariant under tensor composition, the <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are relational, together with the ability to define a physical state (positivity).

25|$|As in {{all other}} {{phenomena}} of the physical universe, so {{in the distribution of}} organic beings: amidst the apparent disorder which seems to result from the influence of a multitude of local causes, the unchanging <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> become evident as soon as one surveys an extensive territory, or uses a mass of facts in which the partial disturbances compensate one another.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{principles}} of relativity {{have been widely}} assumed in most scientific disciplines. One of the most widespread {{is the belief that}} any <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> should be the same at all times; and scientific investigations generally assume that laws of nature are the same regardless of the person measuring them.

50|$|Another {{theory of}} Zilsel {{was that the}} rise of the notion <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> in early modern science was a product of the {{generalization}} of the juridical concept <b>of</b> <b>law</b> to natural phenomena.
