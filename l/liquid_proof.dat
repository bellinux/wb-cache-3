30|$|Surgical gown {{should be}} made out of <b>liquid</b> <b>proof</b> fabric to protect the {{blood-borne}} infectious microbes from penetrating through the fabric. Risks of patients are contamination from both endogenous and exogenous microorganisms and risk of healthcare workers are contamination from various blood-borne pathogens due to occupational exposure to patient blood and body fluids (Unsal et al. 2005). Surgical gowns should provide an effective protective barrier against the transfer of microorganisms, particulates and fluids, in addition to acting as an aseptic barrier for the patient’s protection, {{in order to minimize}} strike-through and the potential for personnel contamination (Rutala and Weber 2001). Due to the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses in the patient population, the barrier efficacy of protective surgical gowns have gained importance. During surgery, in an operating room, a patient’s blood can penetrate surgical gown material and possibly contaminate the surgeon’s skin, if not well protected. Several blood borne pathogens have the potential to spread in this manner, the most important being the HIV and the hepatitis B virus, which are related to AIDS and hepatitis (Loveday et al. 2007).|$|E

Cases include "generalized Klein" models without obvious non-valence bond ground states, {{as well as a}} "resonating-valence-bond" Hamiltonian whose unique ground states within the nearest neighbor valence bond space are four topologically degenerate "Sutherland-Rokhsar-Kivelson" (SRK) type wavefunctions, which are expected to describe a gapped Z_ 2 spin <b>liquid.</b> The <b>proof</b> of this uniqueness is intimately related to the linear independence of the nearest neighbor valence bond states on quite general and arbitrarily large kagome lattices, which is also established in this work.

40|$|The {{properties}} of isolated AlCl 3 clusters and the bulk system are investigated {{by means of}} static and dynamic electronic structure methods. We find important structural motifs with the edge connectivity dominant in a dimer and the corner connectivity dominant in a trimer. Furthermore, the trimer cluster exhibits an interesting ring structure with large cooperative effects relative to the dimer. Comparing the found structural motifs in isolated molecule calculations with {{the structure of the}} liquid allows us to determine the dominance of edge connectivity in the liquid. The size of the clusters present in the liquid indicates indeed that the dimer is the most abundant species, but there are also trimers, tetramers, and pentamers present. From the local dipole analysis both for the isolated clusters {{as well as for the}} <b>liquid,</b> further <b>proof</b> for the edge connectivity is given. However, all results point to the fact that there is also some small percentage of corner connectivity present that might be attributed to the most stable corner-connected cluster, namely the trimer. Importantly, we find that energetic considerations of isolated (static) clusters only do not represent the findings in liquid phase. Instead, a quantum cluster equilibrium approach or simulations are needed...|$|R

40|$|Graft {{copolymers}} of starch with {{acrylic acid}} are a promising green, bio based material with many potential applications. The grafting of acrylic acid onto cassava starch {{in an aqueous}} medium initiated by Fenton’s reagent has been studied. Common grafting result parameters are add-on (yield) and graft efficiency (selectivity). However, {{the analysis of the}} reaction products and an accurate determination of these parameters stand or fall with a complete separation of the entangled but ungrafted homopolymer from the grafted product. Therefore, this separation is the core of the newly developed analytical procedure. An appropriate solvent has been selected with dedicated testing from the range methanol, ethanol, acetone, dioxane, 2 -propanol, and 1 -propanol. Acetone showed the best performance in many respects. It has a high dissolving power for the homopolymer, as well as the highest yield of precipitation for the starch derivatives and it is the most economical in use. After the successful separation, the precipitated graft copolymers could be analyzed quantitatively by nuclear magnetic resonance. The liquid with homopolymer and unreacted monomer was analyzed by high pressure <b>liquid</b> chromatography. <b>Proof</b> of grafting has been found by FTIR and TGA analyses. The mass balance calculation shows a systematic error which appears fairly consistent: 18. 0 ± 2. 5 wt %. This was used as a correction factor in the calculation of the grafting parameters but more importantly, it means that the method we developed has a high level of repeatability, in the order of 97 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Are liquid {{crystals}} living organisms? In 1888 the Austrian botanist F. Reinitzer {{made the}} observation that the solid compound cholesteryl-benzoate changes - when melting at 145. 5 °C - into a cloudy liquid, that, however, turns into a clear liquid at 178. 5 °C and higher temperatures. The cloudy liquid seemed to be doubly refracting. Soon {{a number of these}} so-called 'liquid crystals' were discovered; in 1908 D. Vorlander, professor of organic chemistry at Halle, described more than 250 of these substances. It was O. Lehmann, professor of physics at Aachen (1885), Dresden (1888) and Karlsruhe (1889), who immediately after Reinitzer's observation began a systematic study of these liquid crystals. In The Netherlands the Amsterdam professor of physical chemistry H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom was interested in liquid crystals, in particular because of their place in his phase system. F. M. Jaeger, at that time teaching chemistry in a secondary school in Zaandam (near Amsterdam) and working as an unpaid university lecturer at the Amsterdam university (by recommendation of Bakhuis Roozeboom), investigated liquid crystals (1906), as did a number of doctoral students (A. C. de Kock, 1903; A. Prins, 1907). At the university of Utrecht L. S. Ornstein, professor of physics, gave the study of liquid crystals a prominent place in his research programme. The discovery of liquid crystals, which seemed to be able to grow, move, divide, copulate, and so on, led to a discussion on the nature of these substances. Time and again Lehmann called them 'apparently living crystals', although without considering them as 'real living beings'. In his book Flüssige Kristalle und die Theorien des Lebens (1906), Lehmann proved to be an obvious adherent of the monistic views of the biologist E. Haeckel. Haeckel considered the existence of <b>liquid</b> crystals as <b>proof</b> of the unity between the inorganic and the organic world that he believed in so strongly. In his last book, Kristallseelett. Studiën über das Anorganische Leben (1917), he considered liquid crystals a real form of life, as did F. Rinne, professor of mineralogy and petrography, as late as in the nineteen thirties...|$|R
40|$|Commercial pure {{terephthalic acid}} (PTA) {{manufacturing}} generates process streams mainly containing acetic acid (HAc) and water. A large financial incentive exists {{to replace the}} costly and energy intensive distillation column used to recycle HAc-water mixtures. This work focuses {{on the development of}} pervaporation technology to separate HAc-water mixtures using a hollow fiber-based membrane unit. Currently a 250 m outer diameter Matrimid® hollow fiber is used in industry for gas separation. Due to the difference between gas and liquid separations, the fiber performance associated with high flux in pervaporation is limited by a pressure change inside the bore along the axial direction of the fiber. A mathematical model was developed to describe the bore pressure change in pervaporation in this work, which demonstrated that spinning a large bore size fiber was a good solution to minimize the bore pressure change. Spinning technology has been adapted to obtain a large bore size defect-free Matrimid® hollow fiber. In addition to a large bore size, the asymmetric fiber exhibits an intrinsically defect-free selective layer supported on an open porous substrate. This eliminates the post-treatment with a caulking layer and has a special advantage for aggressive <b>liquid</b> separation. A <b>proof</b> of concept was provided by testing both small and large bore size defect-free fibers with a model 20 % wt HAc feed in a pervaporation system at 101. 5 oC. The membrane selectivity (~ 25) and water flux (~ 4. 5 kg/m 2 hr) were increased by about 150 % with a diameter (O. D. ~ 500 m) twice as large as the regular fiber. Further, a decrease in the HAc flux was observed with the increased bore size due to the reduction in HAc-induced plasticization. Sub-Tg thermal annealing was used to stabilize the fiber by suppressing HAc-induced plasticization. This improves the polymer discrimination of shape and size for penetrants although no chemical reaction occurs with thermal annealing. The resulting membrane selectivity was increased from 10 to about 95 using a large bore size defect-free annealed fiber with acceptable water flux (~ 1. 5 kg/m 2 hr) for 20 % wt HAc concentration feed streams. These improvements make Matrimid® hollow fiber membranes very attractive for future scale-up and commercial development. Ph. D.

40|$|Ionic liquids form a {{relatively}} new class of solvents entirely composed by ions that have specific properties such as low volatility, low flammability, large electrochemical window, broad liquidus range and a high thermal stability. These properties make ionic liquids very attractive for applications {{in a wide variety}} of fields. In the field of metal processing, ionic liquids have been used as extraction media in solvent extraction and promising results have already been reported. Nevertheless, there are some challenges for the use of ionic liquids as extraction phase. The general application of ionic liquids for liquid-liquid extraction processes is hampered because of the ion exchange problem where metal ions are exchanged with the ionic constitutes of the ionic liquid. This PhD thesis presents different approaches in an attempt to overcome the practical problems with ion exchange and offers a greener approach to solvent extraction by replacing volatile organic compounds with non-volatile ionic liquids; and it shows the separation between metals, in particular cobalt and nickel, by solvent extraction using ionic liquids as extraction media. Furthermore, the dissolution of metal oxides in ionic liquids is generally poor and so far there are only a few examples which reports the successful dissolution of metal oxides. In this thesis another approach for the processing of metal oxides in ionic liquids is presented and further, the metal species in solution and the reaction between selected metal oxides and ionic liquids are investigated. The first part presents the use of the ionic liquid trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride (Cyphos IL 101) as extraction phase for the extraction and separation of metal ions. The selective extraction of cobalt from nickel to Cyphos IL 101 has been demonstrated. In the described process no additional organic diluents are added to the ionic liquid phase, which is a main advantage in comparison with the current state as no volatile odorous compounds are emitted offering thus a more sustainable approach to solvent extraction. Furthermore the practical issues accompanied with ion exchange are overruled in this case - the metals are extracted as anionic chlorocomplexes and because a chloride based ionic liquid is used, there is no net loss of the ionic liquid constitutes to the aqueous phase. The separation between cobalt and nickel shows a very high selectivity with a separation factor of about 50000. The properties of the extraction phase and the extraction parameters are discussed and compared with other phosphonium and ammonium ionic liquids. This batch ionic liquid extraction process has been transformed subsequently into a lab pilot-scale continuous process and the performance of this process proves to be competitive with currently applied industrial processes. This work is a significant step towards achieving a competitive industrial process using ionic liquids as extraction phase. The ionic nature of ionic liquids make them able to absorb water. In the second part advantage is taken of this behaviour to obtain an water saturated acidic solution of trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium chloride used to dissolve metal oxides (CaO, MnO, Fe 2 O 3, CoO, NiO, CuO, ZnO) directly in ionic liquid phase. This presents particular opportunities for bringing metal ions which cannot enter the ionic liquid phase via extraction into ionic liquid solution and it offers opportunities to further process these metals in ionic liquid phase. Additionally the selective back-extraction to aqueous phase of these dissolved metals is investigated. In the third part another approach for the use of ionic liquids in metal separation is applied, by which both the aqueous phase and the organic phase are replaced by two mutually immiscible ionic <b>liquids.</b> A <b>proof</b> of principle for the separation of metals by redistribution between two mutually immiscible ionic liquids is given and the process is applied for the cobalt and nickel mixture. In the process cobalt is selectively extracted from 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride to trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium bis-[2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl]phosphinate. Processing steps such as washing, stripping and regeneration the ionic liquid phase are further discussed. The last part presents the dissolution of metal oxides in imidazolium ionic liquids. Although ionic liquids show in general a low solubility of metal oxides it is shown that metal oxides can be dissolved in imidazolium ionic liquids. Silver(I) carbene complexes are formed upon reaction of Ag 2 O with the imidazolium moieties which have a hydrogen atom in the C 2 position. The presence of carbenes in the solution is detected by 13 C NMR spectroscopy and the reactions were also monitored by Raman spectroscopy. The dissolution of other metal oxides, namely CuO, ZnO and NiO in imidazolium ionic liquids is studied and it is found that stable zinc(II) carbenes are formed in solution.

5000|$|... "Wm Miller's {{admiration of}} Turner was unbounded, and his pupils soon caught the infection. The drawings, which {{at first sight}} looked so mysterious and unintelligible, the more they were pondered, {{unfolded}} their wondrous meaning and beauty; and from my own experience I can testify, that sitting for weeks before the same drawing, I did not tire over them, {{as was the case}} with inferior pictures. The plates executed from 1833 to 1836 consisted of the illustrations to Scott's Works, Turner's 'Annual Tour', Gainsborough's 'Watering Place', a large Venice, by Turner and, of course, some plates of less note. The plates for Rogers's poems were engraved before my time, but not published till afterwards; these are probably the most exquisite gems that ever were, or ever will be produced. I beg however to differ from Ruskin in my estimate of them. I like Loch Lomond, and the old Ancestral Hall better than the vignette, with the fountain, at the beginning of the volume...........The Gainsborough was entirely the work of your father's own hand; it was done from a smaller copy of the original in the National Gallery. The pencil drawing was sent as usual to be transferred by the printer through the rolling press on to the etching ground, but when it came back the drawing was found to have shifted during the process, and the transferred outlines were thick and blurred. I should have been appalled, but your father made light of it, and etched away as if it had been all right."I need hardly say that it is as the interpreter of Turner your father's fame very much rests, and that Turner himself preferred 'the Scotch Quaker' to all other engravers. The skill with which he translated the high aerial effects was beyond all rivalry.........."In making the outline drawings for transference to the plate, we were instructed to preserve every minute touch, indeed, keeping the touch was a point much insisted on. I remember an amusing instance of this. I was etching the Pass of Killicrankie, a vignette for Scott's Works; cottages were in flames, and the dead lying in the foreground; in the distance was a row of dark spots - the subject suggested they might be a regiment of soldiers, at the same time they looked very much like fir-trees. I asked your father's opinion, he reply was 'Oh, just keep the touch, and they can be taken for either.' He was not, however, so particular in the case of architecture; and when Edinburgh, from St. Anthony's Chapel, was in hand, he sent me to the spot to make sketches of the principal buildings in the distance. The High School in Turner's drawing was little more than a white patch. Your father did the foreground, and I believe, the sheep, but St. Anthony's Chapel, and the various distant buildings were etched by me - the latter from the sketches I had taken. For closeness of line and minute detail, it is the most laborious plate I was ever engaged on, and will, I believe, bear looking at through a magnifier. Of course, the beautiful effects depend entirely on the finish of your father. I had only to do with the mechanical part - the body - the soul is his. In the case of Turner's figures, perhaps keeping the touch was carried too far."Your father usually etched the foreground of the plates his pupils worked upon; and was fond of etching water, both rough and smooth, which was remarkable for its <b>liquid</b> effect."Turner's touched <b>proofs</b> were always an object of interest in the workroom. I recollect on the margin of one of them he had written. 'Mr Miller will please return all my touched proofs.' Whether this was done I cannot say; but they are generally considered the property of the engraver. They must be of considerable value." ...|$|R
