5|$|Although {{nearly the}} entire DuMont film archive was destroyed, several {{surviving}} DuMont shows have been released on DVD. A large number of episodes of Life Is Worth Living have been saved, and they are now aired weekly on Catholic-oriented cable network, the Eternal Word Television Network, which also makes a collection of them available on DVD (in the biographical information about Fulton J. Sheen added {{to the end of}} many episodes, a still image of Bishop Sheen <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> DuMont Television camera can be seen). Several companies that distribute DVDs over the Internet have released a small number of episodes of Cavalcade of Stars and The Morey Amsterdam Show. Two more DuMont programs, Captain Video and His Video Rangers and Rocky King, Inside Detective, have had a small amount of surviving episodes released commercially by at least one major distributor of public domain programming.|$|E

They applied for a permit in 1913, which was issued in July 1915. KES immediately started construction of the Lilleaker Line. Trial runs were carried out on 8 May 1919 and the line officially opened to Lilleaker the following day. Unlike {{the rest of the}} network, the Lilleaker Line was built as a suburban light rail, running on an exclusive line rather than in the streets. KES started planning further extensions in 1917 and received permission in 1921 to extend the line to Avløs.|$|E
25|$|Raleigh-Durham has {{finished}} {{most of its}} construction with {{the completion of the}} Terminal 1 renovation, leading the airport to have the proper infrastructure until 2040. Nevertheless, the airport still owns nearly 2000 acres of unused land around the airport that it wants to develop. Some ideas for developing that land include an airport hotel or warehouse facilities. For air service, the airport is looking at several domestic destinations including Portland and San Diego for new non-stop air service. With the addition of the Paris flight, Raleigh is now <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> transpacific flight, possibly to somewhere in India, the Middle East or China where companies such as Lenovo have frequent business flights.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on May 22, 2008, five-days of festivities {{celebrated the}} 125th {{anniversary of the}} bridge's opening. The events kicked-off with a live {{performance}} of the Brooklyn Philharmonic in Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park, followed by special lighting of the bridge's towers and a fireworks display. Other events held during the 125th anniversary celebrations, which coincided with the Memorial Day weekend, included a film series, historical walking tours, information tents, a series of lectures and readings, a bicycle tour of Brooklyn, a miniature golf course featuring Brooklyn icons, and other musical and dance performances. Just before the anniversary celebrations, artist Paul St George installed the Telectroscope, a video link between New York and London, on the Brooklyn side of the bridge. The installation lasted {{for a few weeks}} and permitted viewers in New York to see people <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> matching telectroscope near London's Tower Bridge. A newly renovated pedestrian connection to the DUMBO neighborhood was also unveiled before the anniversary celebrations.|$|E

25|$|The City of Chicago is <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{plan for}} an express train {{that would take}} tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs and coming up with a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E

[...] Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid.

Shaw and Thomas moved to the western side, where they found other men, alive but injured, and arranged for them to travel to the surface.

500|$|Meanwhile, the Smith family faced {{financial}} hardship, {{due in part}} to {{the death}} of Smith's oldest brother Alvin, who had assumed a leadership role in the family. Family members supplemented their meager farm income by hiring out for odd jobs and working as treasure seekers, a type of magical supernaturalism common during the period. Smith was said to have an ability to locate lost items by <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> seer stone, which he also used in treasure hunting, including several unsuccessful attempts to find buried treasure sponsored by a wealthy farmer in Chenango County, New York. In 1826, Smith was brought before a Chenango County court for [...] "glass-looking", or pretending to find lost treasure. The result of the proceeding remains unclear as primary sources report various conflicting outcomes.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ugly" [...] {{was directed by}} Toby Tremlett and filmed on 1 November 2005. It {{is set in a}} warehouse in New York City that is used for people who are taking part in an audition. It begins with a yellow taxi driving on a New York City road with apartment complexes. As the song begins, Buena sings her verse while <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mirror, and other people in the warehouse begin to hold up signs of the song's lyrics. During the chorus, they begin to showcase their talents such as dancing and juggling. Buchanan's chorus features her sitting on a staircase; during this part, a child holds up a sign reading [...] "short" [...] while a woman carries a sign saying [...] "loneliness". As Range sings the bridge, she is leaning on a wall in the warehouse while more people begin dancing. When Sugababes sing the chorus again, they dance with the people who also begin to show other talents, including instrumentation and magic tricks. As the video ends, a row of people hold up signs containing one word from the song's lyrics, [...] "people are all the same".|$|E
500|$|Paintings of nudes and of Venus by Italian, and {{especially}} Venetian, artists were influences on Velázquez. However, Velázquez's version is, {{according to the}} art historian Andreas Prater, [...] "a highly independent visual concept that has many precursors, but no direct model; scholars have sought them in vain". Forerunners include Titian's various depictions of Venus, such as Venus and Cupid with a Partridge, Venus and Cupid with an Organist and notably the Venus of Urbino; Palma il Vecchio's Reclining Nude; and Giorgione's Sleeping Venus, all of which show the deity reclining on luxurious textiles, although in landscape settings in the latter two works. The use of a centrally placed mirror {{was inspired by the}} painters of the Italian High Renaissance, including Titian, Girolamo Savoldo and Lorenzo Lotto, who used mirrors as an active protagonist, as opposed to more than merely a prop or accessory in the pictorial space. Both Titian and Peter Paul Rubens had already painted Venus <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> mirror, and as both had had close ties to the Spanish court, their examples would have been familiar to Velázquez. However, [...] "this girl with her small waist and jutting hip, does not resemble the fuller more rounded Italian nudes inspired by ancient sculpture".|$|E

[...] Donna Dickens of HitFix concurred that the song's lyrics are about [...] "yearning to break free from suffocating parental expectations". Writing for Billboard, Taylor Weatherby identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song about [...] "fantasizing over living a life you can’t," [...] to which he believes many people are able to relate.

Some news outlets reported that police are <b>looking</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established.
