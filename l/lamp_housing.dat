25|$|The <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> is a {{metal or}} plastic {{container}} {{that serves as}} a body for the entire instrument and prevents light from spilling in unwanted directions. It comprises all of the exterior of the fixture except for the lens or opening. The housing may be designed with specific elements that help reduce heat and increase the efficiency of a lamp. Older instruments were made from rolled and machined steel or aluminum. With the advent of the Source Four, many lighting instruments are being made from die cast metal. Die casting allows for one single, light-weight body that is more economical to produce and use. The first lantern to make use of die castings was the Strand Pattern 23 designed by Fred Bentham in 1953, this small mirror spot enjoyed a 30-year production run and found its way into many British schools, halls and theaters. Some instruments are made from plastic, such as the Selecon Pacific.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} achieve maximum efficiency, the xenon gas inside short-arc lamps is {{maintained}} at an extremely high pressure— up to 30 atmospheres (440 psi / 3040 kPa)— which poses safety concerns. [...] If a lamp is dropped, or ruptures while in service, pieces of the lamp envelope can be thrown at high speed. [...] To mitigate this, large xenon short-arc lamps are normally shipped in protective shields, which will contain the envelope fragments should breakage occur. [...] Normally, the shield is removed once the lamp is installed in the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing.</b> [...] When the lamp reaches {{the end of its}} useful life, the protective shield is put back on the lamp, and the spent lamp is then removed from the equipment and discarded. As lamps age, the risk of failure increases, so bulbs being replaced are at the greatest risk of explosion. Because of the safety concerns, lamp manufacturers recommend the use of eye protection when handling xenon short-arc lamps. Because of the danger, some lamps, especially those used in IMAX projectors, require the use of full-body protective clothing.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2013, the Fred Rouse Company, a local developer, {{proposed}} {{building a}} six-story apartment {{building to the}} north of the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> that would require the demolition of three adjacent houses constructed between 1872 and 1904. Opposition to the plan prompted district alderperson Ledell Zellers in September 2013 to form an ad hoc committee to advise on plans for the block. The committee recommended that the northern viewscape toward Lake Mendota be preserved. In 2014, four houses east of the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> were demolished to make room for a new residential building.

50|$|HMI lamps {{can reach}} {{ignition}} voltages {{of up to}} 70,000 V when striking hot, and are considered very dangerous if miswired. It is good practice to strike {{the light from the}} ballast and not the head, in the event that there is a short circuit in the lamp head. Proper striking procedures should be followed as well, such as calling out a vocal warning whenever a light is turned on to warn persons in the area. Also, the header cable should be properly and securely connected. Nearly all present-day header cables are equipped with 'twist-lock' fittings at either end to ensure a safe and precise connection, both at the ballast and the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The square, [...] "open" [...] {{floor plan}} without a wall between {{living room and}} dining room devised by Walter Burley Griffin for the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> would become a {{standard}} in the following years, reused in no fewer than 25 of Wright's later projects, including the Barton House (1903-04) in Buffalo, New York, and adapted by Prairie School architects in numerous other projects. Wright adapted it in a plan he published in 1907, titled [...] "A Fireproof House for $5000", which {{became one of the}} exemplary modern residential floor plans of the period up to about 1920. Deficiencies in the exterior design of the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House,</b> such as the patterned brickwork, are probably attributable to the haste with which the project moved from commission to completion. Wright ordered working drawings to be made before a final version was put to paper. The <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> nonetheless has great significance in the history of both Wright's and Griffin's development.|$|R

5000|$|Its plan is {{composed}} of four inter-connected rectangular rooms connected by a central body (taking {{the form of a}} [...] "H"), on which the main 13 metre-high prismatic white tower is surmounted by a red cupola. [...] The lighthouse building complex consists of three spaces for lighthouse-keepers, two cisterns, an office and inspection room. The first floor terrace gives access to the tower, through two narrow openings, to the terrace, and from there to the dome structure, which is manufactured steel topped by a weather-vane. The building, which is circled by a cornice and terrace, is painted white. The light terrace and the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> atop the building are painted red. The structure is interspersed with square sash windows and sills.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, {{this very}} sharp {{switching}} {{on and off}} inherent to the square-waveform causes extremely high frequency vibrations in the lamp. A square wave {{can be thought of}} as an infinite sum of odd-numbered harmonics, which will include frequencies at the resonant frequency of the bulb, causing it to vibrate at that frequency like a bell or whistle. The <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> does not help this, acting as a resonating chamber that amplifies the noise and presents a problem for sync-sound recording for film and video. To correct this, most electronic ballasts are equipped with a silent mode that eliminates the higher frequencies, but rounds off the voltage transition, causing the same flicker issue with magnetics, though to a lesser extent. This mode provides safe, flicker-free filming at framerates up to 24 frame/s on most electronic ballasts.|$|E
50|$|It {{had been}} known {{since the middle of}} the 19th century that gas flames were {{electrically}} conductive, and early wireless experimenters had noticed that this conductivity was affected by the presence of radio waves. De Forest found that gas in a partial vacuum heated by a conventional lamp filament behaved much the same way, and that if a wire were wrapped around the glass housing, the device could serve as a detector of radio signals. In his original design, a small metal plate was sealed into the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing,</b> and this was connected to the positive terminal of a 22 volt battery via a pair of headphones, the negative terminal being connected {{to one side of the}} lamp filament. When wireless signals were applied to the wire wrapped around the outside of the glass, they caused disturbances in the current which produced sounds in the headphones.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, {{a significant}} {{fraction of the}} light shining {{on the surface of}} the water is lost by reflection and, thus, will not be available to attract fish and members of their food chain. Security lights can be modified to operate submerged in water. Positioning the bulb underwater delivers approximately twice as much light to attract fish. However, the modification must be done professionally as the high voltages that power these lamps can be lethal. Commercially made, submersible fishing lights are available on the internet. The power ballast and <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> is mounted on a pole in a dry location. The lamp, potted in a waterproof housing, is connected to the ballast via a waterproof cable. Floating like a fishing line bob, the lamp is positioned underwater by weights on its submerged power supply cord. The bulb is fragile so some manufacturers offer protective covers and hard lenses. However, one unique feature of the submerged, unprotected bulb is that its outer glass envelope gets hot enough to prevent establishment of marine growth. When the bulb has a protective cover or is not operated daily occasional cleaning is required. A permanently fixed fishing light attractor is most effective if it is operated every night. It takes to a week or two for larger fish to discover the increasing concentration of bait fish attracted to the light. Once discovered, the fish return regularly — often arriving at predictable times of the evening.|$|E

In July 2013 a <b>lamp</b> <b>house</b> once used by Empire Coal and Coke Co. {{and the land}} around it were cleared {{as part of a}} 2013 Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree service project. John Ellison and others plan to build a replica of his boyhood home at the site and utilize it and the existing <b>lamp</b> <b>house</b> as a museum facility to preserve the history of coal camp life in southern West Virginia and John Ellison's musical career.|$|R
5000|$|Ellipsoidals are {{supplied}} {{with a certain}} size lens or lenses that determines the field angle, anywhere from five to ninety degrees. Field angle is {{the angle of the}} beam of light where it reaches 10% of the intensity of the center of the beam. Most manufacturers now use field angle to indicate the fixture's spread typically in this series (5°, 10°, 19°, 26°, 36°, 50°, 75°, 90°). Older fixtures are described by the width of the lens x focal length of the instrument. For example, a 6x9 ellipsoidal would have a 6" [...] diameter lens and a focal length of 9". 6x9 Instruments have a field angle of approximately 37°. 6x12 instruments have a field angle of approximately 27°. As the field angle narrows, the instrument can be used further from the stage. Variable focus (zoom) instruments with two lenses that move in and out from the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> are also available, allowing the user to manually adjust to the desired focal length within a certain range. Ellipsoidals can be used for any job but their primary function is to illuminate a specific proximity. They are the common use for spotlights as they can give a small sharp circle. It has an ellipsoidal reflector behind the lamp to reflect the light in the direction required. They have brackets on the end to attach gels and barn doors. Barn doors do the same as the shutters but give a softer edge.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these concerns, HMI lamps {{have been known to}} explode violently {{at the end of their}} lifetime or if stressed enough. While not as violent as the explosion of a xenon short-arc bulb, they still require caution. As a result, HMI lamps should not be used past half their rated lifetime, and care should be taken with larger lamps when striking (turning on the lamp), as a lamp is most likely to explode within the first five minutes of striking. For this reason, each HMI lamp will usually carry with it a detailed log of the number of strikes and number of hours it has been used. Care should also be taken transporting the lamp and replacing lamps. The gases in an HMI lamp are under pressure, which increases with temperature. Dropping the lamp could result in an explosion, sending hot quartz glass flying. As with quartz-halogen bulbs, care should be taken not to touch the glass directly as skin oils left behind on the glass can actually heat up past the working temperature of the glass and cause bubbling and/or a weak point on the bulb. For this reason, anytime a bulb is handled it should be cleaned with an isopropyl alcohol wipe. Most <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> designs are inherently tougher and thicker than traditional tungsten units so that in the event of a bulb explosion, those nearby are protected from flying debris. There is the possibility of the front lens element on the lamp head cracking from thermal shock (though not completely blowing out or shattering). Proper safety procedures should always be followed when using HMI units, as they can be quite dangerous if misused.|$|E
50|$|The unit is {{available}} in profile and wash versions. The profile model uses the lens barrel and reflector assembly of a Source Four, while the wash model uses only the reflector assembly. The manufacturer provides a lens assembly for the wash unit. There is also a high-intensity discharge lamp (HID) model available wherein only the lens barrel from the Source Four {{is used in the}} profile fixture. The wash version of the HID fixture is a completely stand alone unit, not using Source Four components at all, although the same color engine technology is used. The color engine contains integral power supply and communication interface. The unit mounts between the <b>lamp</b> <b>housing</b> and the barrel assembly of a Source Four fixture, meaning that it is placed {{directly in front of the}} source, or lamp and before any optics or beam shaping devices. Inside the unit, four micro-lithographed dichroic filters are gradually saturated from 0-95%. The optional Studio Dichroic color filters are gradually saturated from 0-100%. Wheel colors are standard CMY, having one wheel each for cyan, magenta, and yellow, as well as one green wheel. The SeaChanger profile is unique in that its green color filter increases its color gamut to include deep blues, reds and greens that are difficult to create through dichroic color mixing. The green wheel may be replaced with black for mechanical dimming purposes in HID fixture applications or other applications where dimmers are not available. Stepper motors turn each of the wheels to create colors, with wheel position and speed controlled by a four-channel DMX512 or RDM signal from a lighting console.|$|E

Although completely landlocked, the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> originally provided a viewscape in many ways comparable to that of a lakefront residence. It has always been surrounded on all four sides by residential buildings, and although the southern viewshed toward Lake Monona has been cut off by a high-rise on an adjacent lot and the westward view toward the Capitol was blocked by new construction in 2015, the penthouse enclosure later added on the <b>Lamp</b> <b>House</b> roof still has a view of Lake Mendota over the ensemble of 19th- and early 20th-century buildings to the immediate north and east.|$|R
