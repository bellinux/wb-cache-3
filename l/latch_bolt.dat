50|$|The STANAG {{magazine}} {{concept is}} only an interface, dimensional, and control (magazine <b>latch,</b> <b>bolt</b> stop, etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines {{to be made in}} various configurations and capacities. STANAG magazines come in 20, 30, and 40 round box magazines, as well as 60 and 100 round casket magazines, 90 round snail-drum magazines, and 100 round saddle-drum magazines.|$|E

The key may then strike a lever, {{activating}} a <b>latch</b> or sliding <b>bolt,</b> {{or it may}} itself push against the <b>latch</b> or <b>bolt.</b> In a double acting lever lock, the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.|$|R
40|$|Structural {{testing of}} the D- 1 A Centaur nose fairing was {{completed}} to determine the loads imposed during flight on the <b>latch</b> <b>bolts</b> of the fairing separation system. This testing was conducted to supplement and/or verify the analytic techniques used in calculating bolt loads for the D- 1 A, and to gain insight into the general structural behavior of separation latch systems. It was shown that the assumed bolt load magnification due to prying action of the latch fittings on the bolt does occur, but {{is strongly dependent on}} fairing shell stiffness...|$|R
50|$|When {{the bolt}} release is locked {{down by the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>latch</b> release lock on the buffer tube sleeve, the gun {{functions}} in fully automatic mode. Conversely, the bolt release can be unlocked into the up position resulting in single-shot firing (the gunner must press the <b>bolt</b> <b>latch</b> release to send the bolt forward). Unlike virtually all other modern machine guns, it has no safety (although a sliding safety switch has recently been fielded to USMC armorers for installation on their weapons and is standard-issue for the U.S. Army for all M2s). Troops in the field {{have been known to}} add an improvised safety measure against accidental firing by slipping an expended shell casing under the butterfly trigger. The upgraded M2A1 has a manual trigger block safety.|$|R
5000|$|Deadlocking {{latchbolt}} (deadlatch) is an elaboration on the latchbolt {{which includes}} a guardbolt to prevent “shimming” or “jimmying” of the <b>latch</b> <b>bolt.</b> When the door is closed, the latchbolt and guardbolt are retracted together, and the door closes normally, with the latchbolt entering the strike plate. The strike plate, however, holds the guardbolt in its depressed position: a mechanism within the lockset holds the latchbolt in the projected position. This arrangement prevents the latchbolt from being depressed {{through the use of}} a credit card or some other tool, which would lead to unauthorized entry.|$|E
5000|$|The STANAG {{magazine}} {{concept is}} only an interface, dimensional and controls (magazine <b>latch,</b> <b>bolt</b> stop, etc.) requirement. Therefore, it not only allows one type of magazine to interface with various weapon systems, but also allows STANAG magazines {{to be made in}} various configurations and capacities. The standard capacities of STANAG-compatible magazines are 20 or 30 rounds of 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. There are also 5-, 10-, 40- and 50-round box magazines, as well as 60- and 100-round casket magazines, 90-round snail-drum magazines, and 100-round drum magazines. [...] There has also been a 150-round drum magazine produced.|$|E
5000|$|Latchbolt or <b>Latch</b> <b>bolt</b> An {{extremely}} common latch type, typically {{part of a}} lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an angled edge. When {{the door}} is pushed closed, the angled edge of the latchbolt engages with {{the lip of the}} strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once the door is fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the strike plate, holding the door closed. The latchbolt is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the latchbolt, allowing the door to open.|$|E

50|$|The Fedorov Avtomat is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon which fires from {{a closed}} bolt. The bolt locking is {{achieved}} by two dumbbell-shaped locking plates, mounted at {{either side of the}} breech, <b>latching</b> barrel and <b>bolt</b> together through lugs on the bolt. Those plates are allowed to tilt slightly down after about 10 mm of free recoil, unlocking the bolt. A bolt hold-open device is fitted and the firing mechanism is of hammer type.|$|R
50|$|The XM296/M296 is {{a further}} {{development}} of the AN/M2 machine gun for the OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter. The M296 differs from previous remote firing variants in that it has adjustable firing rate (500-850 rpm), while lacking a <b>bolt</b> <b>latch</b> (allowing single-shot operation). As an air-cooled gun used aboard a relatively slow rotary-wing aircraft, the M296 has a burst restriction rate of 50 rounds per minute sustained fire or 150 rounds per minute maximum while conducting peacetime training requirements; the combat firing rate is unrestricted but a ten-minute cooling period after prolonged firing is mandated to avoid stoppages due to overheating.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of June 17, Wills noticed a piece of duct tape {{on one of the}} door locks when he was making his first round. The tape was placed over the <b>latch</b> <b>bolt</b> to prevent the door from {{latching}} shut. He removed the tape and continued on his patrol. Thirty minutes later, Wills came back to the door and he noticed there was more tape on the door. Without hesitation, Wills rushed up to the lobby telephone and asked for the Second Precinct police. Five men were found in the DNC offices and arrested. [...] Details that emerged during their questioning and trials triggered the Watergate scandal. The five men arrested were Bernard L. Barker, Virgilio Gonzalez, Eugenio Martinez, James W. McCord Jr., and Frank Sturgis.|$|E
5000|$|Electric strikes (also called {{electric}} latch release) {{replace a}} standard strike {{mounted on the}} door frame and receive the latch and <b>latch</b> <b>bolt.</b> Electric strikes can be simplest to install when they are designed for one-for-one drop-in replacement of a standard strike, but some electric strike designs require that the door frame be heavily modified. Installation of a strike into a fire listed door (for open backed strikes on pairs of doors) or the frame must be done under listing agency authority, if any modifications to the frame are required (mostly for commercial doors and frames). In the US, {{since there is no}} current Certified Personnel Program to allow field installation of electric strikes into fire listed door openings, listing agency field evaluations would most likely require the door and frame to be de-listed and replaced.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{door knob}} has a bolt or spindle running through it that sits just above a cylinder, {{to which the}} spindle is connected. Turning the knob pulls the cylinder {{in the direction of}} the turn. The end of the cylinder is the [...] "latch bolt" [...] (more simply known as the [...] "latch"), which protrudes into a space carved out of the door frame, and which prevents the door from being opened if the knob is not turned. A spring or similar mechanism causes the latch to return to its protruding state whenever the knob is not being turned. escutcheon plates are the keyhole covers, usually circular, through which keys pass to enter the lock body. If the door handles have a square or rectangular plate on which the handle is mounted this is called the backplate. The backplate can be plain (for use with latches), pierced for keyholes (for use with locks), or pierced and fitted with turn knobs and releases (for use with bathroom locks). The plate on the front edge of the lock where the <b>latch</b> <b>bolt</b> protrudes is called the faceplate.|$|E
60|$|Joliffe was {{no sooner}} gone, than, before {{a single word}} was spoken between Albert Lee and his page, the former hastened to the door, {{examined}} lock, <b>latch,</b> and <b>bolt,</b> and made them fast, with the most scrupulous attention. He superadded to these precautions that of a long screw-bolt, which he brought out of his pocket, and which he screwed on to the staple {{in such a manner}} as to render it impossible to withdraw it, or open the door, unless by breaking it down. The page held a light to him during the operation, which his master went through with much exactness and dexterity. But when Albert arose from his knee, on which he had rested during the accomplishment of this task, the manner of the companions was on the sudden entirely changed towards each other. The honourable Master Kerneguy, from a cubbish lout of a raw Scotsman, seemed to have acquired at once all the grace and ease of motion and manner, which could be given by an acquaintance of the earliest and most familiar kind with the best company of the time.|$|R
50|$|After the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) {{announced}} {{their desire for}} a new Precision Sniper Rifle in December 2009, Barrett created the MRAD {{in accordance with the}} specifications laid out by SOCOM. Building off of the successful Barrett 98B, the MRAD features multiple improvements such as a folding stock which allows the rifle to be transported more easily. When folded, the stock <b>latches</b> around the <b>bolt</b> handle which increases the security of transporting the rifle. Additional features of the MRAD include a single-button length-of-pull adjustment, a bolt guide which acts as a dust cover to reduce debris entering the action, a trigger module which can be removed without tools making cleaning easier, an ambidextrous magazine release, and the ability to accept standard M4/M16 pistol grips.|$|R

50|$|The town {{grew in the}} 19th century {{around the}} nut, bolt and gun lock {{manufacturing}} and coal mining industries. It was highly industrialised {{with a population of}} 6,000 in 1841. Large areas of land were owned by the Birmingham Coal Company and the area was accessed by the Birmingham Canal Navigations and Grand Junction Railway. In December 1839, the rector of the parish reported that there were approximately 1,500 homes in the parish of Darlaston, most of which were in poor condition and owned by working-class people. The Rose family were identified as a wealthy family in the area during the 19th century as a result of Richard Rose's acquisitions of unenclosed land. Upon his death in 1870, his estate was valued at over £877. He bequeathed the land to his wife Hannah. His brother was identified as James Rose in an 1871 census and was listed as a <b>latch,</b> <b>bolt</b> and nut maker, employing 39 people, including 19 children. At the time of the 1881 census, James Rose was 55 and his business had expanded to employ 90 people. James Rose died in 1901. Construction of Darlaston Town Hall commenced on 21 June 1887 and it was completed in 1888.|$|E

I had no refuge, no appliances, no human being in the world in whom I could confide. To have told my secret would have given me away--made a mere show and rarity of me. Nevertheless, I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy. But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke. I made no plans in the street. My sole object was to get shelter from the snow, to get myself covered and warm; then I might hope to plan.

40|$|Social {{learning}} in 11 human-raised capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) was investigated using an artificial fruit {{that was designed}} as an analogue of natural foraging problems faced by primates. Each subject observed a human model open each of 3 principal components on the fruit in 1 of 2 alternative ways ("morphs"). The capuchin monkeys reproduced, to differing extents, the alternative techniques used for opening 1 component of the task (poking vs. pulling while twisting {{out a pair of}} smooth plastic bolts) but not the other 2. From the subjects' actions on the <b>bolt</b> <b>latch,</b> independent coders could recognize which morph they had witnessed, and they observed a degree of matching to the demonstrator's act consistent with simple imitation or object movement reenactment (A learns from watching B how an object, or parts of an object, move).

50|$|Willenhall {{was a small}} {{agricultural}} village {{throughout the}} Middle Ages. From Tudor times, the natural mineral wealth began to be exploited with ore being sent out to charcoal furnaces in nearby Cannock Chase. The iron product was then returned to be turned into small metal goods. Nails were a common product {{and by the end}} of 17th century Willenhall had a healthy hand trade, making grid irons, curry combs, <b>bolts,</b> <b>latches</b> and coffin handles. According to the Hearth Tax Returns in 1665, Willenhall comprised 136 households and 894 persons. The population did not increase dramatically until the 18th century when iron and coal began to be fully exploited. The town grew up around the Market Place and Stafford Street with many tiny streets crammed with houses, workshops and pubs. Evidence of the town's growing prosperity is still visible today in the Dale House, once the home of the Hincks family, and 33 Market Place, the home of the Clemsons, both maltsters.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the joint halves during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular tongue and groove. The two joint halves are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the <b>latch</b> <b>bolt</b> and the latch plunger. This force presses the two joint halves tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|E

5000|$|In modern usage, {{minimum length}} and barrel length {{restrictions}} only apply to civilian use; {{military and police}} departments may issue short-barreled shotguns, and major manufacturers offer special models with barrels {{in the range of}} 10 to 14 in as riot shotguns or combat shotguns for use in areas with restricted space. These are generally referred to as [...] "entry shotguns", because they are generally used for entering buildings, where the short easy handling {{is more important than the}} increased ammunition capacity of a longer shotgun. Breaching rounds provide another use for very short shotguns. These rounds are usually made of sintered powdered metal, but a normal buckshot or bird shot round will also work. A shotgun is used for breaching by placing the gun next to a door lock (0 to 2 inches away, 0 to 5 cm), and firing at a 45 degrees downward angle through the door between the lock or latch and the door frame. The impact of the projectile(s) opens a hole through the door, removing the <b>latch</b> or locking <b>bolt.</b> When through the door, the shot or sintered metal disperses quickly, and because it was aimed downwards, the risk of harming occupants on the other side of the breached door is minimized. Breaching guns used by police and the military may have barrels as short as 10 in, and they often have only a pistol grip rather than a full butt stock. Some models use a special cup-like muzzle extension to further minimize the risk of debris injuring the shooter. Because few rounds are fired, any sporting shotgun with a 3-round capacity could be shortened and used as a capable breaching shotgun.|$|R
