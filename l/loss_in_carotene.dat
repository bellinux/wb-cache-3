40|$|THE {{importance}} of alfalfa meal {{as a source}} of vitamin A in animal nutri-tion makes it imperative to know under what conditions of storage the vitamin A activity in the meal may best be main-tained. Since the vitamin A activity of plant tissue is largely, if not wholly, based on its carotene content, the loss of vitamin A potency during storage can be measured by means of carotene determinations. Several investigators have reported on the stability of <b>carotene</b> <b>in</b> plant tissues. Russell, Taylor, and Chichester (1934) found no <b>loss</b> of <b>carotene</b> <b>in</b> finely ground alfalfa stored for two to three months in vacuo at 0 ° ± S°C. Fraps and Treichler (1933), however, observed a SO percent <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> the vitamin A activity of alfalfa meal stored for 11 months at room temperature. Later Fraps and Kemmerer (1937) re-ported that the <b>loss</b> of <b>carotene</b> <b>in</b> alfalfa meal was less when the meal was stored at 6 °C. then when it was stored at room temperature. Miller and Bearse (1934) also noted a loss of vitamin A activity in alfalfa meal stored for one year. Guilbert (1935) reported that temperature was a major fac-tor <b>in</b> the <b>loss</b> of <b>carotene</b> from alfalfa hay or meals during storage and that the rate of loss was approximately doubled for every 10 degree rise in temperature. Similar ob-servations have been reported by Smit...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{effects of}} {{pre-treatment}} in osmotic salt solution followed by oven-drying on the moisture removal, and β-carotene content of yellow-fleshed sweet potato were investigated. Potato rings of 3 cm diameter and thicknesses of 2 mm, 3 mm and 4 mm were soaked in NaCI solutions of 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 % w/v, for varying time of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 minutes. The pre-treated slices were then oven-dried in a convective oven at 60 °C. Moisture diffusivity {{was determined by}} the method of slopes, while β-carotene was measured by UV/VIS- spectrophotometer. Moisture diffusivity values during drying were between 3. 648 × 10 − 7 m 2 /s and 1. 459 × 10 − 6 m 2 /s, while <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> β- <b>carotene</b> ranged from 47 to 86 %. The amount of water removed by pre-treatment with NaCl solution decreased significantly as the concentration and the time soaking increased, however, the water out flow was found to increase significantly with increase in thickness of the samples, where the 4 mm size had the highest (1. 535 g H 2 O/g sample) and 2 mm the least (1. 434 g H 2 O/g sample) Osmotic pre-treatment in salt solution had no effect on β-carotene, but subsequent oven-drying however degraded the β-carotene...|$|R

50|$|Newly hatched {{flamingos}} are gray or white. They gain color after 2 or 3 {{years of}} age. The active component {{that gives the}} feathers the pink color are the terpenoids alpha and beta-carotene (similar to <b>carotene</b> <b>in</b> carrots). A diet rich <b>in</b> <b>carotene</b> allows them to produce pigmented feathers. An adult has 12 main feathers designed for flight on each wing. The body is covered in contour feathers, which protect the bird and also help with waterproofing from a secretion of oil {{at the base of}} the feather. When roosting they face the wind so that if it rains the rain does not get up and under the feathers. Plumage is pale pink, with bright carmine streaks around the neck and on the back. When perched a small amount of black can be seen in the wings, these are the flight feathers mentioned above. There are typically 12 to 16 tail feathers. James's flamingos molt their wing and body feathers according to their breeding schedule and the color of the new feathers depends on the quality of the diet that they have obtained. There is no evidence of color differentiation between the males and females.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{to assess the impact}} of pink {{grapefruit}} juice composition and structure on the degradation kinetics of lycopene and β-carotene using model systems and multiresponse modeling. Carotenes were heated at four temperatures in their native matrix (juice) or were extracted and incorporated in water/ethanol emulsion systems formulated with or without ascorbic acid or naringin. Kinetic analysis showed that the rate constants and activation energy were lower for lycopene than for β-carotene in the juice, while this trend was inversed in the model system. Multiresponse modeling was used to analyze the role of ascorbic acid and naringin <b>in</b> <b>carotene</b> degradation. Ascorbic acid had a very low impact, while naringin significantly increased the carotene degradation and isomerization rates. We concluded that lycopene was more sensitive to thermal degradation and phytochemical interactions than β-carotene, but this behavior was masked in the fruit juice matrix by better structural protection.

40|$|ABSTRACT The stated {{frequency}} with which 30 Indonesian children with corneal xeroph-thalmia and age/sex/neighborhood matched controls ordinarily consumed vitamin- and provitamin A-rich foods was compared. Controls were more frequent consumers of eggs (p < 0. 05), fish (p < 0. 05), dark green leafy vegetables (p < 0. 05), carrots (p < 0. 01), and carotene-containing fruits (p < 0. 1). Similar data were collected on 358 children with Bitot’s spots and on normal preschool age children in a countrywide survey. Breast-feeding was more common among normals than among cases (p < 0. 00 1). Normals were also more frequent consumers of mango and papaya during the 2 nd and 3 rd yr of life (p < 0. 05); and of dark green leafy vegetables and eggs during the 3 rd through 6 th yr of life (p < 0. 01).
