5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of <b>Lexan</b> that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E

25|$|ULDs {{come in two}} forms: pallets and containers. ULD pallets are rugged {{sheets of}} {{aluminum}} with rims designed to lock onto cargo net lugs. ULD containers, also known as cans and pods, are closed containers made of aluminum or combination of aluminum (frame) and <b>Lexan</b> (walls), which, depending {{on the nature of}} the goods to be transported, may have built-in refrigeration units. Examples of common ULDs and their specifics are listed below.|$|E
25|$|The {{body was}} {{an entirely new}} design by Pininfarina {{featuring}} panels made of Kevlar, carbon fiber, and aluminum for strength and low weight, and intense aerodynamic testing was employed. Weight was further minimized {{through the use of}} a plastic windshield and windows. The cars did have air conditioning, but had no sound system, door handles, glove box, leather trim, carpets, or door panels. The first 50 cars produced had sliding <b>Lexan</b> windows, while later cars were fitted with wind down windows.|$|E
500|$|Throughout filming, various scenes {{make use}} of all three effects departments. For scenes {{involving}} the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in [...] "Home", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith {{stood in front of}} a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production. Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of <b>Lexan</b> placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them. For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck to go out of control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look [...] "pretty real".|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{a series}} of {{accidents}} caused by bird strikes between 1965 and 1970, all T-37s were later retrofitted with a new windshield made of <b>Lexan</b> polycarbonate plastic 0.5in (12.7mm) thick, which could tolerate the impact of a [...] bird at a relative speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Improved version, aerodynamically cleaned up, {{extended}} fuselage with baggage compartment, <b>Lexan</b> {{doors and}} wheel pants are standard. The wing is [...] shorter, {{with a higher}} aspect ratio, 100% double surface, flaps and a NACA 4412 airfoil. Certified under UK BCAR Section [...] "S" [...] as a microlight and marketed in the UK as the X-Air Falcon. Standard engine is the [...] Rotax 582, although the [...] Rotax 503 or [...] Jabiru 2200 four-stroke engine can be used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Le Pelican airframe {{is constructed}} from aluminum tubing, using gussets and pop rivets. The wing {{consists of a}} [...] "D" [...] cell with foam and aluminum ribs. All flying surfaces are covered in doped aircraft fabric. The very first Pelicans had wire-bracing for the wing and spoilers for roll control. These were replaced with strut-bracing and one-third span ailerons. The enclosed cabin, designed for Quebec winters included <b>Lexan</b> doors. The Pelican's conventional landing gear consists of a fibreglass rod for the main gear, with a tailskid, replaced on later models by a steerable tailwheel.|$|E
2500|$|... 1982: First cab {{regulation}} {{requirement for}} [...] "LEXAN" [...] vs."PLEXIGLAS". Neither [...] "LEXAN" [...] nor [...] "PLEXIGLAS" [...] complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard *205. Cost: approx. $140.00. In {{an effort to}} deflect concerns about liability {{on the part of}} the sanctioning agency or partition manufacturers for the use of a material that fragmented badly, this [...] "Lexan" [...] requirement was instituted. The doctors at Boston City Hospital informed the police that acrylic glazing fragments killed a driver in an assault, not the bullet. The BPDHD admits in a letter to Dr. Ronald Malt that they changed the glazing requirement to <b>Lexan</b> after this death.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is of predominantly wooden construction, with {{a wooden}} geodesic fuselage and wood framed wings and tail surfaces all covered in doped aircraft fabric. The high wing is supported by aluminum [...] "V" [...] struts with jury struts. The control system is standard three-axis type including ailerons, elevators and tail-mounted rudder. The conventional configuration fixed main landing gear is made from steel tube with bungee suspension, while the tail wheel is steerable. The engine cowling is built from fiberglass. Pilot access to the cockpit is via a fold-down door {{on the right-hand side}} of the fuselage. The windshield is fashioned from <b>Lexan</b> and side windows are optional.|$|E
2500|$|... 1977 {{also saw}} two radical {{technical}} innovations {{that would change}} the future of Formula One. The purpose of Lotus's experimentation in 1976 was revealed with the Lotus 78, which brought ground effect to Formula One for the first time, using wing-profiled sidepods sealed to the ground by sliding <b>lexan</b> skirts. Generating radically increased downforce with significantly less drag, the Lotus 78s driven by Mario Andretti and Gunnar Nilsson won five Grands Prix in 1977. Renault unveiled the second when their RS01 made its first appearance powered by a 1.5-litre turbocharged engine, derived from their sportscar unit. Although supercharged engines were successful in the 1950s and the regulations allowing for turbocharged engines had existed for 11 years, no Formula One team had built one, feeling that the fuel consumption and turbo lag (boost lag) would negate its superior power. Motor engineer Bernard Dudot, who had observed the turbocharged Offenhauser engines used in Champ Car racing in the USA, pushed for this choice.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{method was}} {{developed}} by Robert Fleischer, P.Buford Price, and RobertM. Walker for use in high-altitude balloons. In this method, sheets of clear plastic, like 0.25mm <b>Lexan</b> polycarbonate, are stacked together and exposed directly to cosmic rays in space or high altitude. The nuclear charge causes chemical bond breaking or ionization in the plastic. At {{the top of the}} plastic stack the ionization is less, due to the high cosmic ray speed. As the cosmic ray speed decreases due to deceleration in the stack, the ionization increases along the path. The resulting plastic sheets are [...] "etched" [...] or slowly dissolved in warm caustic sodium hydroxide solution, that removes the surface material at a slow, known rate. The caustic sodium hydroxide dissolves the plastic at a faster rate along the path of the ionized plastic. The net result is a conical etch pit in the plastic. The etch pits are measured under a high-power microscope (typically 1600× oil-immersion), and the etch rate is plotted {{as a function of the}} depth in the stacked plastic.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, LEDs {{replaced}} the incandescent {{lights on the}} National Christmas Tree. The tree's [...] of red garland also used LEDs. The 2006 star-shaped tree-topper was reused, although it was reworked to use LEDs as well. According to the National Park Service officials, the tree was 100 times more energy efficient than in 2006 — although the lighting designer from General Electric said it was just 60 percent more energy efficient. The ornaments were 125 red bows [...] high and [...] wide. SABIC Innovative Plastics donated the <b>Lexan</b> {{used to make the}} ornaments. That same year, the tree lighting ceremony was officially named the Lighting of the National Christmas Tree. The Pageant of Peace was also officially renamed as [...] "The National Christmas Tree and Pathway of Peace." [...] LEDs replaced incandescent lights on the state trees along the Pathway of Peace, the lighted garland was omitted, and smaller illuminated ornaments were used in 2008, achieving an additional 50 percent savings in electricity. However, traditional bulbs were still used in the ornaments. A Santa's workshop was added to the pageant in 2008 as well. The lighting ceremony was dedicated to the memory of Ron Hudler.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{lighting}} display and ornaments were made after 2001. In 2002, the National Christmas Tree sported a gold, green, and red design (again) with gold garland and wreath-shaped ornaments. For the first time, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were used {{as part of the}} lighting scheme. Two strands of red LED lights were entwined with the garland. The incandescent tree lights changed from gold to green and back again continuously. The garland and lighted ornaments remained lit without a color change. The tree consumed enough power nightly to light two homes. The following year, the 80th anniversary of the tree-lighting ceremony, a nostalgic and simplified lighting design featuring 13,000 incandescent blue, gold, green, and red lights with lighted candle and snowflake ornaments was used. In 2004, holographic suncatchers were first used as ornaments on the tree, to help make it sparkle during daylight hours. A blue, gold, green, and red lighting scheme (composed of 15,000 incandescent bulbs) was used again, but de-emphasized the green in order to evoke a patriotic theme. One-hundred and thirty star-shaped ornaments also adorned the tree. A three-dimensional star made of <b>Lexan</b> topped the tree. The 2005 lighting design used 25,000 clear white incandescent lights. There were 105 large snowflake ornaments (each lit from within by 25 clear incandescent lights) with holographic blue vinyl accents, and a three-dimensional snowflake tree topper. Suncatchers were used also again. There were 105 snowflake-shaped suncatchers on the tree. A traditional lighting design returned in 2006. The tree featured 25,000 blue, green, orange purple, and red incandescent lights. Its 125 [...] wide round ornaments with concave fronts. The glass fronts were reverse painted, while the concave area was covered in a gold holographic material that made the ornament appear to sparkle when lit. The tree topper was a star in three dimensions, with a holographic vinyl plate between the two to enhance its sparkle.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Daniel W. Fox (May 14, 1927 - February 15, 1989) was a polymer chemist who {{is often}} {{regarded}} {{as the father of}} <b>LEXAN.</b> <b>LEXAN</b> is the flagship product of SABIC Innovative Plastics (formerly GE Plastics) and is used in everything from CDs and DVDs to car bumpers.

5000|$|In 1947, having {{relied on}} wax-cylinder {{recording}} {{to the end}} of World War II, Dictaphone introduced their Dictabelt technology. This cut a mechanical groove into a <b>Lexan</b> plastic belt instead of a wax cylinder. The advantage of the <b>Lexan</b> belt was that recordings were permanent and admissible in court. Eventually IBM introduced a dictating machine using an erasable belt made of magnetic tape which enabled the user to correct dictation errors rather than marking errors on a paper tab. Dictaphone in turn added magnetic recording models while still selling the models recording on the <b>Lexan</b> belts. Machines based on magnetic tape recording were introduced in the late seventies, initially using the standard compact (or [...] "C") cassette, but soon, in dictation machines, using mini-cassettes or microcassettes instead. The size of the cassette was important as it enabled the manufacturer {{to reduce the size of}} portable recorders.|$|E
