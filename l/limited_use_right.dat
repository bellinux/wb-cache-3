30|$|Under the separatist {{development}} agenda, later crystallised in {{the apartheid}} regime, South Africa was a country exhibiting levels of inequality in wealth {{and access to}} services {{among the highest in}} the world. A combination of policies and legislation dating from the early 20 th century consistently denied Africans vital components of well-being and a secure base in the cities. This gave rise to racial imbalances in the provision of housing, infrastructure and services, which were inherited by post-apartheid local governments. The legacy of apartheid has impacted specifically on the provision of services in Johannesburg in two ways. First, the well-known policy of providing inferior quality services for Africans meant that standards of social and physical infrastructure were intentionally set lower than they were for whites (Beall et al. 2000). During the colonial era, South Africa had <b>limited</b> land <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> and provision of infrastructure in black population areas was very poor.|$|R
40|$|In the Federal Communications Commission, Ronald Coase (1959) exposed deep {{foundations}} via normative argument {{buttressed by}} astute historical observation. The government controlled scarce frequencies, issuing sharply <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> <b>rights.</b> Spillovers {{were said to}} be otherwise endemic. Coase saw that Government limited conflicts by restricting uses; property owners perform an analogous function via the "price system. " The government solution was inefficient unless the net benefits of the alternative property regime were lower. Coase augured that the price system would outperform the administrative allocation system. His spectrum auction proposal was mocked by communications policy experts, opposed by industry interests, and ridiculed by policy makers. Hence, it took until July 25, 1994 for FCC license sales to commence. Today, some 73 U. S. auctions have been held, 27, 484 licenses sold, and $ 52. 6 billion paid. The reform is a textbook example of economic policy success. We examine Coase‘s seminal 1959 paper on two levels. First, we note the importance of its analytical symmetry, comparing administrative to market mechanisms under the assumption of positive transaction costs. This fundamental insight has had enormous influence within the economics profession, yet is often lost in current analyses. This analytical insight had its beginning in his acclaimed early article on the firm (Coase 1937), and continued into his subsequent treatment of social cost (Coase 1960). Second, we investigate why spectrum policies have stopped well short of the property rights regime that Coase advocated, considering rent-seeking dynamics and the emergence of new theories challenging Coase‘s property framework. One conclusion is easily rendered: competitive bidding is now the default tool in wireless license awards. By rule of thumb, about $ 17 billion in U. S. welfare losses have been averted.

Rather, we explain this empirical pattern by imperfect substitution between insider trading profits and other private benefits of control...|$|R
40|$|The {{legal status}} of land is not only {{determined}} by its ownership situation and by the existence of <b>limited</b> private <b>use</b> <b>rights.</b> Public authorities may also impose public law restrictions on land, mainly with regard to its use (these restrictions are limitations in the admissible use of real estate or encroachments on the property-rights of real estate caused by official decisions {{which are based on}} specific statutory laws). Registration of these restrictions {{is in the interest of}} potential buyers as it aims at preventing them from buying real estate they can not use the way they intend to. It is also in the interest of the authorities, for checking if people live up to them and for incorporating them in (physical) plans. The paper presents the structure of the registration system that is proposed in the Netherlands and the results of some pilot projects. The bill to introduce the system is accepted by the Government and is likely to be discussed in Parliament in 2002. The proposed system gives important roles to both the Cadastral Agency and the municipalities. It uses the existing cadastral map as a geometric base.

40|$|The {{accelerated}} rate {{of global}} forest depletion poses {{a series of}} complexproblems for development planners and resource managers in many developingnations. Among the issues being confronted are the need for foresters to gain newskills in managing human resources, design forest use systems which are bothproductive and sustainable, and {{to insure that the}} benefits of these systems aredisrtibuted more equitably. In the last quarter of a century reserved forest lands inThailand have been seriously degraded through deforestation, overcutting, and theillegal encroachment of poor and landless farmers. To counter these forces thegovernment proposed two new forest management programs in 1975 which wouldgrant certificates of <b>use</b> or <b>limited</b> land <b>use</b> <b>rights</b> to some degraded forest land inareas of national reserved forest. This paper examines the use of this policy in theForest Village and National Forest Land Allotment Projects in northeast Thailand. Since their implementation in the Dong Mun National Reserved Forest 8 years ago,these projects have been plagued with conflicts over de jure and de facto land rights,public misperceptions about the government’s grant of amnesty to illegal forestresidents, problems controlling immigration, and the small 2. 4 ha land allotmentsgiven to project participants. These conditions have produced unequal access to anddistribution of land, allotment of land poorly suited for agriculture, the destructionof reforestation plots, continued degradation of reserved forest, and a pronouncedpattern of social and economic inequality within and between the villages participatingin both projects. We argue that these problems are fundamentally caused bygovernment failures to correctly assess population pressures on land in the northeastand to modify program design to better fit community needs, capabilities and insuresustainable forest use for future generations...|$|R

Much of the Ogallala High Plains Aquifer has been drawn down between 2011 and 2012, in some parts by as much as 10 feet on average. The increased need for irrigation during successive drought years has raised some serious concerns about future water availability especially considering the slow recharge rate of the aquifer. New legislation was passed in 2012 to help conserve the aquifer.

40|$|Hackers’ attacks {{at the end}} of 2016 and at the {{beginning}} of 2017 р. on governmental information and telecommunication systems, including Ministry of Finance in Ukraine, and State Treasury Department, caused vast delays in budgetary payments. They showed «sensitiveness» and insecurity of governmental institutions for cyber-attacks because of control absence of three main security measures, such as technical limitations for downloading programs, <b>limited</b> <b>use</b> of <b>rights</b> for local administrators, systematical software renewals. International experience shows these security measures of governmental IT-systems have to be the audit subject of state financial control authorities. The base of information technology audit was initiated in the studies of І. К. Drozd, S. V. Іvachnenkova, М. М. Benko, Ju. А. Кuxminskiy, А. V. Мamyshev. Simultaneously, the issue of IT-system state audit was examined in theoretical researches partially because there is no practice of such audit in Ukraine. That is why it is necessary to learn international practice of efficiency audit for IT-systems and world standards for establishments of state management sector. The research allowed to propose the methodology of efficiency audit for IT-systems for state institutions; the methodology provides planning and conducting the main procedures on the base of risk estimation of security threats for information systems. The author determines the peculiarities in security risk management for IT-systems by means of risk estimation of security components of IT-systems while conducting efficiency audit. The author sets the method of descending step-by-step detailing for audit estimation of IT-system risk management efficiency at strategic enterprises belonging to state management sector by means of adaptation of ISSAI standard norms. The paper proposes three possible options of management solution concerning IT-system risk management efficiency on the base of information about the risk levels according to the results of efficiency audit. To document the IT-system efficiency audit results the author develops the standard forms of auditor’s working documents, that is, «Statement about information vulnerability and determining the category of protection», «Estimation of results and threats for activity». The further research of the issue of IT-system efficiency audit is to develop organizational actions as to carrying out the check-ups (by Account Chamber) of IT-system security at strategic enterprises belonging to state management sector. ...|$|R
