5|$|Negotiations {{between the}} owners, led by {{commissioner}} David Stern, and the players, led by director Billy Hunter and president Derek Fisher {{of the labor}} union National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), began in early 2011 and continued through November. The main issues dividing both sides were the division of revenue {{and the structure of}} the salary cap and <b>luxury</b> <b>tax.</b> Owners proposed to reduce the players' share of basketball related income (BRI) from 57% to 47%, but the players countered with 53% of BRI. Owners wanted to implement a hard salary cap and a harsher <b>luxury</b> <b>tax,</b> hoping to increase competition among teams, whereas players wanted to keep the current soft salary cap structure intact.|$|E
5|$|As {{both sides}} {{failed to reach}} an agreement, the NBA {{canceled}} the preseason and all games through December. On November 14, the players dissolved the union, allowing them to file antitrust lawsuits against the league. On November 26, both sides reached a tentative agreement to end the lockout. The new CBA calls for a revenue split of 49-to-51.2% and a flexible salary cap structure with harsher <b>luxury</b> <b>tax.</b> After the tentative deal was reached, owners allowed players to have voluntary workouts at team sites starting December 1. After the deal was ratified on December 8, training camps, trades and free agency began the next day. During the lockout, some players signed contracts to play in other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, with most of them having the option to return upon the lockout's conclusion. The lockout also affected the economy due largely to NBA cities losing revenue generated by games as well as television networks losing ratings and advertisement revenue.|$|E
5|$|If the bid was rejected, the NPB team {{retained}} {{rights to}} the player. If it was accepted, the successful MLB team was granted the exclusive rights {{to negotiate with the}} player for 30days. If the player and the MLB team agreed on contract terms before the 30-day period expired, the NPB team received the bid amount as a transfer fee within five business days. The player was then free to play for his new MLB team in the coming season. The transfer fee was not included when calculating an MLB team's total payroll, which is subject to a <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> when it exceeds $155million. If the MLB team could not come to a contract agreement with the posted player, then no fee was paid and the {{rights to the}} player reverted to his NPB team. A player could request to be posted again in subsequent years, and the process would be repeated with no advantage to the club that had won the bidding the previous year.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the players}} were locked out by the owners {{because of a lack}} of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104days and {{resulted}} in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners. The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} gate revenue sharing and <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes</b> on professional sports leagues {{within the context of}} a less restrictive demand function than those used in prior models. In contrast to previous studies, the analysis finds that the increased sharing of revenues may enhance competitive balance. Consistent with other models, the analysis finds that player salaries will diminish as the percentage of shared gate receipts rises. The analysis also explores several variations of <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes.</b> All have the effect of lowering salaries. The impact on league balance depends on how the tax is implemented and on how its proceeds are distributed. As with salary caps, enforcement problems exist with the tax.

40|$|O ver {{the last}} 20 years, several excise taxeswere both instituted {{and allowed to}} expire orwere repealed. These {{measures}} arose {{for a variety of}} reasons. The windfall profit tax, an excise tax on domestically produced crude oil, was a transi-tory measure during a period when price controls were being lifted from crude oil. Environmental taxes were used to fund the cleanup of polluted sites. <b>Luxury</b> <b>taxes</b> were put in place solely to raise rev-enue from the wealthy. During the course of their enactment, windfall profit, environmental, and <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes</b> generated over $ 90 billion in revenue. Despite {{the fact that most of}} these taxes have not been active for several years, funds still flow through their respective accounts. Funds continue to ebb and flow, as different claims are resolved for or against the Government. Taxpayers may file late or amended returns for refunds after a tax is no longer active. Results of IRS enforcement activities (audits) may also lead to liability for a tax that has expired. Contested payments are eventually resolved through litigation. This article examines the history and cur-rent state of the windfall profit, several environmen-tal, and <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes.</b> It also provides a list of excise taxes active in Fiscal Year 1999 and reports excise tax collections for Fiscal Year 1998...|$|R

25|$|While most NBA teams hold {{contracts}} {{valued in}} excess of the salary cap, few teams have payrolls at <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> levels. The tax threshold in 2005–06 was $61.7million. In 2005–06, the New York Knicks' payroll was $124million, putting them $74.5million above the salary cap, and $62.3million above the tax line, which Knicks owner James Dolan paid to the league. Tax revenues are normally redistributed evenly among non-tax-paying teams, so there is often a several-million-dollar incentive to owners not to pay the <b>luxury</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E

25|$|Prior to the lockout, in late 2003 {{the union}} {{proposed}} {{a system that}} included revenue sharing, a <b>luxury</b> <b>tax,</b> a one-time five percent rollback in player salaries, and reforms to the league's entry level system. The league rejected this proposal almost immediately because it essentially maintained {{the status quo in}} favor of the players. Shortly before the lockout commenced in 2004, the NHLPA offered another proposal to the league that was believed to be similar to their earlier proposal. The league again rejected the union offer, claiming the union's new proposal was worse than the offer they rejected in 2003. At this point, negotiations stopped until early December, when the NHLPA made a highly anticipated proposal based on a <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> that increased the proposed one-time rollback in players' salaries from 5 to 24 percent. The NHL rejected the offer and countered with a proposal that the union quickly rejected.|$|E
25|$|Furuta {{was skeptical}} of the losses {{reported}} by the teams but conceded that if the losses were accurate then player salaries {{would have to be}} adjusted accordingly. The players association made several suggestions to improve the teams' financial situations, including relaxing the rules on how much player salaries could be reduced as well as proposing a <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> that would result in the reduction of player salaries. Furthermore, the JPBPA supported the two-league system, proposed interleague play and a fairer distribution of television broadcast revenue.|$|E
25|$|As in 1994, the owners' {{position}} was predicated around {{the need for}} a salary cap. In an effort to ensure solidarity amongst the owners, the league's governors voted to give Bettman the right to unilaterally veto any union offer as long as he had the backing of just eight owners. The players initially favored <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> system, and a 5% rollback on player salaries—later increased to 24 percent. As the threat of a canceled season loomed, the players agreed to accept a salary cap, but the two sides could not come to terms on numbers before the deadline expired.|$|E
50|$|Elitism endorses the {{exclusion}} {{of large numbers of}} people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, populism, socialism, or communism. They may also support affirmative action, social security, <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes,</b> and highly progressive taxes for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti-meritocratic in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.|$|R
50|$|In the {{terminology}} of professional sports in North America, teams are often {{said to be}} based not in a city but in a media market. The size of the media market is usually a good indication of the potential viability of a major league team. A small market team is likely to struggle to compete financially against teams from larger markets and may therefore also be outbid in the competition for top talent. This has led to calls for revenue sharing, <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes,</b> and / or salary caps in most North American sports leagues {{in order to ensure}} competitive balance or parity.|$|R
50|$|MLB is now {{alone among}} the major leagues in that it lacks any form of a salary cap and has enacted only modest forms of revenue sharing and <b>luxury</b> <b>taxes.</b> Compared to the other leagues, there is a far greater {{disparity}} between MLB payrolls. The New York Yankees had the highest payroll of any American sports team in 2006 when they paid $194 million in players' salaries - nearly twice the NFL salary cap and nearly thirteen times the payroll of the Florida Marlins who spent about $15 million (significantly less than the mandatory minimum team payrolls in the NFL and NHL).|$|R
25|$|Teams {{above the}} cap (or teams below the cap but {{would end up}} more than $100,000 over the cap {{following}} a trade) cannot acquire more than 125% plus $100,000 of the salary they trade away. Under the 2011 CBA, teams that remain below the <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> threshold even after the trade can acquire the lesser of 150% plus $100,000, or 100% plus $5 million, of the salary they trade away. There is no lower limit—teams may divest themselves of as much salary as they wish (or can convince another team to take on) in a trade.|$|E
25|$|A <b>luxury</b> <b>tax</b> {{applied to}} goods and {{services}} for conspicuous consumption {{is a type of}} progressive sales tax that at least partially corrects the negative externality associated with the conspicuous consumption of positional goods. In Utility from Accumulation (2009), Louis Kaplow said that assets exercise an objective social-utility function, i.e. the rich man and the rich woman hoard material assets, because the hoard, itself, functions as status goods that establish his and her socio-economic position within society. When utility is derived directly from accumulation of assets, this lowers the dead weight loss associated with inheritance taxes and raises the optimal rate of inheritance taxation.|$|E

Coming off from winning their fifteenth championship in the NBA Finals defeating the Orlando Magic in five games, the Lakers successfully defended their title. They spent the most money of any team on player salaries this season, totaling $112.7 million ($91.3 million on player salaries and $21.4 million on <b>luxury</b> <b>tax).</b> The Lakers once again sold out all 41 home games for the season at Staples Center.|$|E
