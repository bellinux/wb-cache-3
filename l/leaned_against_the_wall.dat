500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lemme See" [...] {{was released on}} June 14, 2012, and was directed by Philip Andelman. The video opens with a close-up of Usher's estate, and a woman bound by ropes. Usher is stood by a swimming pool singing the first verse, with the pool reflecting on him. During the pre-chorus, Usher is leaning against a wall while pulling up his top to reveal his chest. Entering the chorus, the video intercuts to Usher preparing drinks for himself and the tied up woman– his love interest. With the second verse, Usher is admiring his still tied up love interest. In the second pre-chorus, leaned against a wall Usher removes his shirt, while the video intercuts to him approaching his love interest to make love. Entering Rick Ross' verse, Ross is sat down shirtless, accompanied by two women sat by him left and right. Touching Ross' back, their tattoos transfer on to Ross and bloom. Him and Usher are both by a pool with Ross performing his rap, while in an intercut scene Usher's love interest is being released from her tied up predicament. In the final chorus, Usher and his love interest make love in a risqué scene, with both their tattoos moving and blooming on {{to each other in}} a similar way to Ross' scene. This alternates with the latter scene, Usher <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and him and Ross by the pool, with Usher singing the verse. The video ends with Ross and Usher echoing the song's title.|$|E

6000|$|When Marston {{had gone}} Flora {{sat down on}} the bench. She was pale and trembled. Wyndham, looking very grim, <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> They were quiet for a moment or two, and then he asked: ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and a sob {{broke from}} me. Then, in an instant, the passage {{was flooded with}} light, and in the open doorway Giuliana stood all white before me, her arms held out.|$|E

60|$|He {{staggered}} {{back with}} the basket, painfully conscious the while that it was creasing his waistcoat, and dumped is down on the study floor. Mr. Downing stooped eagerly over it. Psmith <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and straightened out the damaged garment.|$|E
60|$|Next moment, Kit swung round, {{for the man}} {{who stepped}} out into the road wore a white uniform. The sailor <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to steady his aim, and his tense pose and rigid hand {{indicated}} that he was pressing the trigger.|$|E
60|$|As to Berthier, {{he could}} only <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and pant {{for a couple of}} minutes, putting his hands up to his throat and rolling his head about. Then, with an angry gesture, he turned to the heavy blue curtain which hung behind his chair.|$|R

60|$|Down {{the long}} hall he went, slowly and laboriously, the others {{following}} silently behind him, then {{up the steep}} winding stairs, step by step, now and then stopping to <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> So he reached a long and gloomy passageway lit only {{by the light of}} a little window at the further end.|$|R
60|$|Not {{long after}} that Kells called her from her room. He wore his somber and {{thoughtful}} cast of countenance. Red Pearce and Jesse Smith were standing at attention. Cleve {{was sitting on the}} threshold of the door and Wood <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{he began}} to roar and bay and whoop in the passage, I haled him out into the street, and there we <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and had it all over again--waving our hands and wagging our heads--till the watch came to know if we were drunk.|$|E
60|$|Even {{now when}} at last she was alone, when once again {{she was able to}} close and bolt the door, she could {{scarcely}} stand. She <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> with eyes closed, and heart that beat so furiously and so fast that she thought she must choke.|$|E
