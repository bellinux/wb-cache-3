5000|$|Visbreaking {{preferentially}} cracks aliphatic compounds {{which have}} relatively <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents,</b> <b>low</b> density and high viscosity {{and the effect}} of their removal can be clearly seen in the change in quality between feed and product. A too severe cracking in a visbreaker will lead to the asphaltene colloid becoming metastable. Subsequent addition of a diluent to manufacture a finished fuel oil can cause the colloid to break down, precipitating asphaltenes as a sludge. It has been observed that a paraffinic diluent is more likely to cause precipitation than an aromatic one. Stability of fuel oil is assessed using a number of proprietary tests (for example [...] "P" [...] value and SHF tests).|$|R
40|$|FCC {{gasoline}} is generally {{responsible for more}} than 90 % of the sulphur compounds in the engine gasoline,its desulphurization is thus required to produce ultra <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> gasoline (<b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> < 10 ppm). In thispaper the possibilities of reducing the <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> of FCC gasolines are summarized. In theexperimental section the results of hydrodesulphurization carried out over PtPd/USY zeolite with full rangeFCC gasoline feeds of different <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> are presented. The original 66 ppm <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> of thegasoline was increased to 196 ppm by adding benzothiophene. For comparison the feed was hydrotreatedon conventional CoMo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst, too. The results indicated that PtPd/USY-zeolite is suitable for theselective desulphurization of FCC gasoline cracked from pre-treated FCC feed.

40|$|A {{study of}} the best {{conditions}} to prepare smooth heterogeneous Co. Ag films with low amounts of S from a thiourea-based electrolytic bath has been performed. Using a 0. 01 M AgClO 4 + 0. 1 M Co(ClO 4) 2 + 0. 1 M thiourea + 0. 1 M sodium gluconate + 0. 3 M H 3 BO 3 + 0. 1 M NaClO 4 bath, low temperature (10 °C) allowed obtaining compact and smooth deposits containing 2 wt. % <b>sulphur.</b> Decreasing thiourea <b>content</b> 0. 06 M and increasing gluconate concentration up to 0. 3 M, better deposits (more compact with lower <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> (1. 2 wt. %)) were obtained. A clear influence of the species present in the bath on the film quality was observed: while gluconate favoured film cohesion, boric acid hindered hydrogen adsorption. For all films, fcc-Ag, hcp-Co and hcp-CoAg 3 phases were always detected by XRD, TEM and electron diffraction, their proportions varying with the electrodeposition conditions. Magnetic measurements revealed {{that the increase in}} the CoAg 3 led to an increase in the film coercivity. GMR values were only measured at cryogenic temperatures, they being higher for the deposits with the <b>lowest</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content</b> revealing that <b>sulphur</b> exerts a negative effect on magnetoresistance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|The coal {{found in}} the South Yorkshire Coalfield was a {{bituminous}} coal that was generally used {{for the production of}} coal gas and coke.

40|$|Decrease {{in carbon}} dioxide {{emissions}} was not the driver when shipping started to investigate fuel alternatives to replace the traditional heavy fuel oil. Instead it was regulations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> in fuel in sulphur emission control areas (SECA). The dominating driving forces for a ship-owner to change fuel are regulations and price. The result will thus be an economic based fuel choice among those fuels fulfilling present regulations rather than a long term sustainable alternative. A fuel change is usually also connected to a capital cost for conversion and infrastructure {{that has to be}} compensated by lower fuel price. Fuels used in SECA areas today are <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> marine gas oil (LSMGO), “hybrid fuels” (heavy fuel oils that has been blended to <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents),</b> LNG or methanol. LNG and methanol in addition to fulfilling sulphur regulations also provide a pathway to renewable fuel and have low emissions of nitrogen oxides and particles. However, in the past years, the economic incentive has changed from a favourable situation for the “clean” fuels like LNG or methanol towards traditional fuels fulfilling only sulphur regulations. Decisions are today based entirely on the fast changing prices, providing a selection of fuels that fulfil only present regulations and excluding possible future regulations or customer demands. The long-term pathway towards sustainability with a change into fossil free fuel production is not taken into account. In the paper, the relation between the many possible drivers as well as the implications of market changes for decrease of greenhouse gas emissions will be further discussed...|$|R

The flow of heavy and waxy crudes in pipelines and in reservoir formations is {{not as easy as}} light and medium oils. A mathematical correlation has been developed to describe the viscosity of waxy base oil as a function of shear rate, temperature, and wax concentration: μ=A exp (B/T+CW) γ ̇D where μ is viscosity, T is temperature, W is % wax by weight, and γ is the shear rate. The experimental tests were performed by measuring the rheological properties of the waxy oils using rotational viscometer at different temperatures (9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 °C) and wax concentrations (2 %, 4 %, 6 % and 8 % by weight).

40|$|Oil was {{extracted}} from tomato seeds, tested for several important alternative fuel properties and {{compared with other}} vegetable oils. The oil yield of tomato seeds is about 35 % on a dry weight basis. This vegetable oil has <b>low</b> volatility, <b>low</b> <b>sulphur,</b> <b>low</b> ash <b>content,</b> and high viscosity. Cetane number, density {{as well as the}} cold flow properties {{are similar to those of}} other vegetable oils. The fatty acid profile of tomato seed oil shows that there is a predominance of compounds containing an even number of carbon atoms, especially C- 16 and C- 18. The total saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition is 18. 28 % and 81. 72 %, respectively, and the most abundant fatty acid is linoleic acid (56. 12 %). This study indicates that tomato seed oil is a renewable energy source and a promising fuel substitute which could be used in the diesel engine to bring down the consumption of the conventional petroleum products.

40|$|The depositional {{environments and}} {{hydrocarbon}} {{potential of the}} siliciclastic, clayey and carbonate sediments from the Middle Miocene succession in the Varna-Balchik Depression, located in the south-eastern parts of the Moesian Platform, were studied using core and outcrop samples. Based on the lithology and resistivity log the succession is subdivided from base to top into five units. Siliciclastic sedimentation prevailed in the lower parts of units I and II, whereas their upper parts are dominated by carbonate rocks. Unit III is represented by laminated clays and biodetritic limestone. Units IV and V are represented by aragonitic sediments and biomicritic limestones, correlated with the Upper Miocene Topola and Karvuna Formations, respectively. Biogenic silica {{in the form of}} diatom frustules and sponge spicules correlates subunit IIa and unit III to the lower and upper parts of the Middle Miocene Euxinograd Formation. Both (sub) units contain organic carbon contents in the order of 1 to 2 wt. % (median: 0. 8 for subunit IIa; 1. 3 for unit III), locally up to 4 wt. %. Based on Hydrogen Index values (HI) and alkane distribution pattern, the kerogen is mainly type II in subunit IIa (average HI= 324 mg HC/g TOC) and type III in unit III (average HI ~ 200 mg HC/g TOC). TOC and Rock Eval data show that subunit IIa holds a fair (to good) hydrocarbon generative potential for oil, whereas the upper 5 m of unit III holds a good (to fair) potential with the possibility to generate gas and minor oil. The rocks of both units are immature in the study area. Generally <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents</b> are probably due to deposition in environments with reduced salinity. Normal marine conditions are suggested for unit III. Biomarker composition is typical for mixed marine and terrestrial organic matter and suggests deposition in dysoxic to anoxic environments...|$|R

The thermal behaviour of these fuels during combustion was studied by thermogravimetry, at non-isothermal heating conditions. Fly ashes were collected from tests in a lab-scale fluidized bed facility. The effect of the inorganic constituents of the fuels on slagging/fouling and agglomeration propensities, as well as environmental pollution was examined. Kinetic models were developed and reaction rates were determined. The agroresidues studied were characterized as good quality fuels, having high volatile and <b>low</b> ash and <b>sulphur</b> <b>contents.</b> Their ash was rich in Ca, Si, K and P minerals. However, fly ashes were poorer in alkali compounds, implying lower deposition and corrosion problems in boilers. The environmental impact of heavy metals is negligible.

50|$|Carbondale {{takes its}} name from Carbondale, Pennsylvania, {{hometown}} of some of Carbondale's early settlers. Carbondale's economy was initially agriculturally based. Farmers and ranchers capitalized on open lands around Carbondale to supply food for miners in nearby Aspen, then a booming center of silver mining activity. Early in the 20th century, before the rise of industrial agriculture in Idaho, Carbondale's primary agricultural product was potatoes. The legacy lives on in Potato Day, an annual fall parade and cookout in Sopris Park. Despite the non-geologic origins of the town's name, the Carbondale area does in fact possess significant coal resources. Until the late 1980s Carbondale's economy was primarily based on coal operations up the Crystal River Valley. The coal mined from the area was favored for its high burning temperature, <b>low</b> <b>sulphur</b> <b>content,</b> and density. However, the coal deposits also contained significant amounts of methane gas. In 1981, a methane gas explosion killed 15 miners http://www.postindependent.com/article/20060416/VALLEYNEWS/104160006 and by 1991 the mines closed down permanently. The rise of Aspen as a skiing mecca and subsequent hyperinflation of its real estate prices has forced a majority of its workers downvalley to other towns like Carbondale. Thus, especially since the 1980s, Carbondale has partly served as a bedroom community to Aspen. More recently Carbondale has seen a boom of second-home construction, arts and recreational amenities, and tourism as the area's wealth and renown has grown.
