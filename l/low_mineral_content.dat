Mid-level feeders, they are best kept in schools of five to six or more, for the shoaling effect when they move around the tank. They shoal naturally in the wild and are thus happier, more brightly colored, and more active when kept as a shoal as opposed to singly. The color may also fade {{during a period of}} stress.

Its maximum flow is 11,700 m3/s, while the minimum flow recorded is 128 m3/s. It is a navigable river and is a major water route of the province to carry goods to other provinces. The second major river is the Gâm, which originates in China and flows through Cao Bằng and Hà Giang, before entering Tuyên Quang. The Gâm joins the Lô at Tu Hiep. The river flows for 170 km length in the province darining an area of 2870 km2. The next major river of importance is the Pho Day River which rises in the Tam Dao Mountains in Bắc Kạn Province. It traverses 84 km in the province through Yên Sơn, Sơn Dương District to Phú Thọ, and has a drainage area of 800 km2. The navigation possibilities of this river are very limited.

Thirteen bottled waters and fourteen tap waters from the territory of Serbia were analyzed in the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) laboratory in Berlin, for the purpose of the “Geochemistry of European Bottled Water“ project conducted by EuroGeo Survey Geochemistry (EGS). Macrocomponents (main cations and anions) of ground waters usually reflect on lithogeochemistry of the aquifer, while microcomponents indicate the circulation of ground water through the different lithological environment. Analyzed bottled waters could be classified as those with <b>low</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> (M 500 mg/L) with prevailing HCO 3 anion and Na cation. Waters with <b>low</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>content</b> were mainly from limestone and dolomite, while mineral waters mainly originated from magmatic and metamorphic rocks. Higher content of Cs, Li, Ge, Rb and F in bottled waters indicates the importance of the magmatic intrusions influence on their chemical composition. In some waters higher content of B, I, NH 4, as well as of Tl and W has been observed which can be attributed to water’s circulation through different lithological complexes. Tap water was mostly obtained from groundwater (from Neogen and alluvial aquifers and karst springs) with rest being those of rivers and surface accumulations.
