5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the <b>liquid</b> <b>film</b> to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale grooves, but it cannot enter into the smaller grooves. This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale grooves, the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E

25|$|Stripe-patterned polymer films can {{be formed}} on solid {{substrates}} by casting diluted polymer solution. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, {{and has no}} restriction on the scaffold materials that can be used. The procedure involves horizontally overlapping glass plates while keeping them vertically separated by a narrow gap filled with a polymer solution. The upper plate is moved at a constant velocity between 60 and 100µm/s. A thin <b>liquid</b> <b>film</b> of solution is continuously formed {{at the edge of}} the sliding glass following evaporation of the solvent. Stripe patterns prepared at speeds of 60, 70, and 100µm/s created width and groove spacings of 2.2 and 6.1µm, 3.6 and 8.4µm, and 4.3 and 12.7µm, respectively; the range of heights for the ridges was 50–100nm. Tsuruma, Tanaka et al. demonstrated that embryonic neural cells cultured on film coated with poly-L-lysine attached and elongated parallel to poly(ε-caprolactone)/chloroform solution (1g/L) stripes with narrow pattern width and spacing (width: 2.2µm, spacing: 6.1µm). However, the neurons grew across the axis of the patterns with wide width and spacing (width: 4.3µm, spacing: 12.7µm). On average, the neurons on the stripe-patterned films had less neurites per cell and longer neurites compared to the neurons on non-patterned films. Thus, the stripe pattern parameters are able to determine the growth direction, the length of neurites, and the number of neurites per cell.|$|E
40|$|<b>Liquid</b> <b>films</b> are {{important}} in many industrial applications, but also from a fundamental point of view, they {{are important}} two-phase flow systems. In this paper, we develop a sharp interface/level set method for the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> with large interfacial deformations, and large density ratio between the liquid and the gas phase. We use the ghost fluid method to capture the interface motion without smoothing properties across it, and adopt a maximization scheme for the implicit treatment of the viscous term in the Navier–Stokes equations. Because <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> have very low average depth compared to the distance between waves, several innovations are required to handle solving the equations on grid structures of high aspect ratio. Two-dimensional (2 D) calculations for wavy films falling down a vertical wall are presented, and good agreement is found when numerical solutions are directly compared with the experiments of Nosoko et al.

40|$|While the {{stability}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> on substrates is a classical topic of colloidal science, the availability of nanostructured materials, such as nanotubes, nanofibres and nanochannels, has {{raised the question of}} how {{the stability}} of <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> and their wetting behaviour is affected by nanoscale confinement. This paper will present the conditions for {{the stability of}} <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> on and inside cylindrical solid substrates with nanometre scale characteristic dimensions. It is shown that the stability is determined by an effective disjoining/conjoining pressure isotherm which differs from the corresponding disjoining/conjoining pressure isotherm of flat <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> on flat solid substrates. From the former, the equilibrium contact angles of drops on an outer or inner surface of a cylindrical capillary have been calculated as a function of surface curvature, showing that the expressions for equilibrium contact angles vary for different geometries, in view of the difference in thickness of the film of uniform thickness with which the bulk liquid (drops or menisci) is at equilibrium. These calculations have been extended to the case of glass nanocapillaries and carbon nanotubes, finding good agreement with experimental results in the literature...|$|R

2500|$|The frit FAB and {{continuous}} flow-FAB (CF-FAB) interfaces {{were developed in}} 1985 and 1986 respectively. Both interfaces were similar, but they differed in that the first used a porous frit probe as connecting channel, while CF-FAB used a probe tip. From these, the CF-FAB was more successful as a [...] LC-MS interface and was useful to analyze non-volatile and thermally labile compounds. In these interfaces, the LC effluent passed through the frit or CF-FAB channels to form a uniform <b>liquid</b> <b>film</b> at the tip. There, the liquid was bombarded with ion beams or high energy atoms (fast atom). For stable operation, the FAB based interfaces were able to handle liquid flow rates of only 1-15 μl and were also restricted to microbore and capillary columns. In order {{to be used in}} FAB MS ionization sources, the analytes of interest should be mixed with a matrix (e.g., glycerol) that could be added before or after the separation in the LC column. FAB based interfaces were extensively used to characterize peptides, but lost applicability with the advent of electrospray based interfaces in 1988.|$|E
60|$|The {{conception}} of the Sun's constitution thus set forth, is like that of M. Faye {{in so far as}} the successive changes, the resulting structures, and the ultimate state, are concerned; but unlike it in so far as the Sun is supposed to have reached a later stage of concentration. As I gather from your abstract of M. Faye's paper [this referred to an article in The Reader], he considers the Sun to be at present a gaseous spheroid, having an envelope of metallic matters precipitated in the shape of luminous clouds, the local dispersions of which, caused by currents from within, appear to us as spots; and he looks forward to the future formation of a <b>liquid</b> <b>film</b> as an event that will soon be followed by extinction. Whereas the above hypothesis is that the <b>liquid</b> <b>film</b> already exists beneath the visible photosphere, and that extinction cannot result until, in the course of further aggregation, the gaseous nucleus has become so much reduced, and the shell so much thickened, that the escape of the heat generated is greatly retarded.... M. Faye's hypothesis appears to be espoused by him, partly because it affords an explanation of the spots, which are considered as openings in the photosphere, exposing the comparatively non-luminous gases filling the interior. But if these interior gases are non-luminous from the absence of precipitated matter, must they not for the same reason be transparent? And if transparent, will not the light from the remote side of the photosphere seen through them, be nearly as bright as that of the side next to us? By as much as the intensely-heated gases of the interior are disabled by the dissociation of their molecules from giving off luminiferous undulations, by so much must they be disabled from absorbing the light transmitted through them. And if their great light-transmitting power is exactly complementary to their small light-emitting power, there seems no reason why the interior of the Sun, disclosed to us by openings in the photosphere, should not appear as bright as its exterior.|$|E

30|$|We {{showed the}} results of {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of forsterite-MgSiO 3 liquid, which contribute {{to our understanding of}} the nanoscale structure of the interface and diffusivity of atoms in the interface. From these simulations, the characteristic structure of <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> in forsterite-MgSiO 3 liquid interface is observed. We also observe the layered structure of an altered crystal surface, an Si-rich layer, and an Mg-rich layer in the crystal-liquid interface. The layered structure is formed by the strength difference between Si-O covalent bonds and Mg-O ionic bonds. Si-O-Si bridging and free oxygen atoms are excessively formed in the near surface because Si-O bonding is much stronger than Mg-O bonding. The difference in the layered structure indicated by the thickness of MgSiO 3 <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> might be caused by the difference in degree of freedom of the configuration in <b>liquid</b> <b>films.</b> The two-dimensional diffusivity of oxygen is controlled by two factors. One factor is the thickness of the <b>liquid</b> <b>films</b> that decreases oxygen diffusivity with decreasing film thickness because of the decrease of degree of freedom of the configuration in the <b>liquid</b> <b>films.</b> The other factor is the composition of the sliced layer, where oxygen diffusivity increases with increasing Mg/Si ratio because Si-O bonding is much stronger than Mg-O bonding. The degree of Mg/Si layering strongly depends on film thickness and decreases with increasing film thickness. The effect of the crystal-liquid interface is negligible in texturally equilibrated rocks. However, the interface can affect the melt flow in deformed samples because the grain boundary melt film of several nanometer thickness exists stably in deformed partially molten rocks.|$|R
