5|$|It begins after Oberon {{has ordered}} Puck to anoint {{the eyes of}} Demetrius with the love-juice. Titania and her fairies merrily revel ("Come all ye songsters of the sky"), and Night ("See, even Night"), Mystery ("Mystery's song"), Secrecy ("One charming night") and Sleep ("Hush, no more, be silent all") lull them asleep and <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> to {{pleasant}} dreams.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving outpost of the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E
5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, Christmas time at {{the office}} leads to {{depression}} for Michael, when his girlfriend Carol (Steve Carell's wife, Nancy Walls) breaks up with him. Michael, Andy, Dwight, and Jim then go to a local Benihana restaurant, where Michael and Andy find dates {{with two of the}} restaurant's waitresses. Back at the office, after a conflict with a bossy Angela, Karen and Pam decide to create their own Christmas party. When the majority of the office decide to go to Karen and Pam's party, Angela becomes upset, and seeing this, Karen and Pam decide to combine the parties. Soon after, Michael and Andy's dates <b>leave</b> <b>them,</b> but Michael nevertheless finds someone to go to Jamaica with him.|$|E
5|$|Martin runs an {{official}} website and administers a lively blog {{with the assistance}} of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> unanswered for years. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go to three or four science-fiction conventions a year simply {{to go back to his}} roots and meet friends. He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.|$|E
5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E

5|$|The King County Superior Court {{ruled in}} April that the {{university}} was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay that would <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's favor, and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the Wall, Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) and Meera Reed (Ellie Kendrick) are {{rescued from}} the White Walkers by Benjen Stark (Joseph Mawle). Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) returns to his family's home in Horn Hill, {{accompanied}} by Gilly (Hannah Murray) and little Sam, intending to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> there, but changes his mind after reuniting with his cruel father. In King's Landing, Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) attempts to rescue the Queen, Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer), but learns that King Tommen Baratheon (Dean-Charles Chapman) has united the faith and the crown. Across the Narrow Sea, in Braavos, Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) refuses to kill the actress she was assigned to poison by the Faceless Men, and in the Dothraki Sea, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) rides on Drogon and emboldens her newly acquired khalasar.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy first {{appears in}} EastEnders at Lucy Beale's (Melissa Suffield) party, where he gets {{pleasure}} from watching {{a fight between}} two girls, and asks other girls to play Twister with him but nobody will. In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop out of the window. On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Andrew Jackson invaded Florida {{to hasten}} its {{annexation}} to the United States, in {{what became known}} as the First Seminole War. After Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821, conflicts between settlers and the Seminole increased as the former tried to acquire lands. The Second Seminole War lasted from 1835 to 1842, and afterward, the US forcibly removed about 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), west of the Mississippi River. Many others died in the war. Conflict broke out again in the Third Seminole War from 1855 to 1859, when a few hundred Seminole fought off US forces from the swamps of the Everglades. The US finally decided to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> alone, as they could not dislodge them even after this protracted and expensive warfare.|$|E

5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms {{to be a threat}} to their own cultures and traditions which would <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{continues}} {{his efforts to}} break up the relationship between his ex-girlfriend Ann (Rashida Jones) and her new boyfriend Mark (Paul Schneider). Andy challenges Mark to a game of pool with the hopes of hustling him, but Mark turns out to be an excellent player and wins multiple games. Mark and Andy make one final wager: if Andy wins, he gets Ann, but if Mark wins he has to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> alone. Mark dominates the game but loses when he scratches on the 8 ball. Initially delighted, Andy becomes confused when Ann leaves with Mark anyway. The next day, he tells Mark and Ann he will no longer be bothering them, and says a final goodbye to Ann.|$|E

Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> and run back into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|On 26 October 1942, Oliphant {{embarked}} from Melbourne, taking Rosa and {{the children}} back with him. The wartime sea voyage on the French Desirade was again a slow one, {{and they did not}} reach Glasgow until 29 February 1943. But he had to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> behind once more in November 1943 after he joined the Manhattan Project in the United States as part of the British Mission. Oliphant was one of the scientists whose services the Americans were most eager to secure, and Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the Los Alamos Laboratory attempted to persuade Oliphant to join. The work on the bomb itself made him uneasy, and he preferred to head the team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic uranium enrichment– a vital but less overtly military part of the project.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members will not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby community members repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E
5|$|The Heirs of Fate saga, {{released}} after {{the rest of}} the DLC, focuses around the game's Child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into killing each other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, broke the illusion and banded the two Kanas' armies together, only to <b>leave</b> <b>them</b> to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to take down Anankos for one final time.|$|E
