25|$|As a {{demonstration}} of the principles involved in raytracing, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>consider</b> how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere. This is merely the math behind the line–sphere intersection and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of raytracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>consider</b> a two-class {{prediction}} problem (binary classification), {{in which}} the outcomes are labeled either as positive (p) or negative (n). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is p and the actual value is also p, then it is called a true positive (TP); however if the actual value is n then {{it is said to}} be a false positive (FP). Conversely, a true negative (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are n, and false negative (FN) is when the prediction outcome is n while the actual value is p.|$|E
