2500|$|... <b>lyophilizing</b> and wire-heating {{process is}} another method of {{creating}} longitudinally oriented channels, developed by Huang et al. (2005). A chitosan and acetic acid solution was frozen around nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) wires in a liquid nitrogen trap; subsequently the wires were heated and removed. Ni-Cu wires were chosen {{because they have}} a high resistance level. Temperature-controlled lyophilizers were used to sublimate the acetic acid. There was no evidence of the channels merging or splitting. After <b>lyophilizing,</b> scaffold dimensions shrunk causing channels to be a bit smaller than the wire used. The scaffolds were neutralized to a physiological pH value using a base, which had dramatic effects on the porous structure. Weaker bases kept the porous structure uniform, but stronger base made it uncontrollable. The technique used here can be slightly modified to accommodate other polymers and solvents.|$|R
30|$|S-S-Cur, EDC, and DMAP were {{dissolved}} in DMSO and activated at 60  °C for 2  h, and then TPP-oHA was {{added in the}} above solution and reacted for 24  h at room temperature.

25|$|Many {{parenteral}} formulations are unstable {{at higher}} temperatures and require storage at refrigerated or sometimes frozen conditions. The logistics process of delivering these drugs {{to the patient}} is called the cold chain. The cold chain can interfere with delivery of drugs, especially vaccines, to communities where electricity is unpredictable or nonexistent. NGOs like the Gates Foundation are actively working to find solutions. These may include <b>lyophilized</b> formulations which are easier to stabilize at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all of the}} TNF inhibitors, {{infliximab}} is {{an expensive}} medication, costing about US$900 for a 100mg dose, and within the United States is covered by almost every medical insurance plan (though caps on many plans {{make it possible to}} be covered for only a subset of treatments {{in the course of a}} year). Infliximab is supplied as a sterile, white, <b>lyophilized</b> (freeze-dried) powder, so must be reconstituted and administered by a health care professional, usually in a hospital or office setting. For this reason, it is usually covered under major medical insurance rather than prescription drug coverage. The loading regimen for all approved indications occurs at weeks 0, 2, and 6 at the above dosages.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{does not}} require the use of a solid porogen like SCPL. First, a synthetic polymer is dissolved into a suitable solvent (e.g. polylactic acid in dichloromethane) then water is added to the polymeric solution and the two liquids are mixed in order to obtain an emulsion. Before the two phases can separate, the emulsion is cast into a mold and quickly frozen by means of immersion into liquid nitrogen. The frozen emulsion is subsequently freeze-dried to remove the dispersed water and the solvent, thus leaving a solidified, porous polymeric structure. While emulsification and freeze-drying allow for a faster preparation when compared to SCPL (since it {{does not require}} a time consuming leaching step), it still requires the use of solvents. Moreover, pore size is relatively small and porosity is often irregular. Freeze-drying by itself is also a commonly employed technique for the fabrication of scaffolds. In particular, it is used to prepare collagen sponges: collagen is dissolved into acidic solutions of acetic acid or hydrochloric acid that are cast into a mold, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then <b>lyophilized.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nano-sized zinc {{containing}} β-tricalcium phosphate (ZnTCP) powders were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. The co-precipitation {{took place}} in an ice-water bathed beaker, after further washing, freezing, <b>lyophilizing</b> and calcining at 800 ºC, the precipitates transformed to ZnTCP powders. The XRD pattern of the ZnTCP powders demonstrated a pure β-TCP phase. TEM observation revealed the particle size is about 100 - 120 nm, which is favorable for TCP particles to form composites, such as polymer based composite, and as well to attain a desired microstructure. It was found zinc incorporation could eventually result in the decrease of particle size, thus be beneficial for its further application...|$|R

In adsorption experiments, about 1 mL of GO/PEI hydrogel (without <b>lyophilizing)</b> was added to 100 mL of either MB (10 mg·L− 1) or RhB (4 mg·L− 1) solutions. The dye solutions containing gel adsorbents were stirred slowly and continuously at room temperature in a dark condition. The gel samples were then separated by centrifugation at different time intervals, and the supernatant liquid was collected for subsequent analysis using an UV-vis spectrometer (752, Sunny Hengping, Shanghai, China). The absorbance at 662 nm (MB) and 554 nm (RhB) {{was used to determine}} the concentration of residual dyes in the supernatant liquid.|$|R
2500|$|High {{performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} or high pressure liquid chromatography {{is a form}} of chromatography applying high pressure to drive the solutes through the column faster. This means that the diffusion is limited and the resolution is improved. The most common form is [...] "reversed phase" [...] HPLC, where the column material is hydrophobic. The proteins are eluted by a gradient of increasing amounts of an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile. The proteins elute according to their hydrophobicity. After purification by HPLC the protein is in a solution that only contains volatile compounds, and can easily be <b>lyophilized.</b> HPLC purification frequently results in denaturation of the purified proteins and is thus not applicable to proteins that do not spontaneously refold.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the realization of}} a temperature sensor based on plasma sputtered thermocouples. The thermocouples are realized in the vacuum with quite pure materials, negligible oxydation and with low contamination thus enabling accurate measurements and are made inert {{by means of a}} thin coating of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) that seals them. The thermocouples have an overall thickness of few hundreds of nanometers and are designed to allow non invasive, though accurate temperature measurement to be obtained in adverse conditions, such as the ones found during lyophilization processes. Lyophilization is widely employed to obtain pharmacological active powders in an economical and massive way. The lyophilization process effectiveness depends on the thermal distribution inside the <b>lyophilizing</b> vials: if the temperature is too low the process become extremely slow thus greatly increasing the powder cost, but if the temperature is too high a melting of the frozen substance can occur that can make the powder useless. Tuning the drying process is therefore extremely important, but such an operation is quite difficult since the temperature greatly changes inside each <b>lyophilizing</b> vial due to the process itself and among vials due to their position within the apparatus. A local temperature measurement would therefore be necessary, but normal temperature sensors would alter the drying local condition making the measurement incorrect and indirect measurements proved to be not reliable. The proposed solution instead is almost inert, capable of performing accurate local measurements and {{can be used in a}} variety of conditions where size and possible contamination are of importance. A sensor prototype is described and its performance compared with conventional sensors highlighting the advantages of the proposed solutio...|$|R
40|$|The {{prepared}} polyelectrolyte complexes of anionic copolymer of divinyl ester and {{maleic anhydride}} and cationic water soluble chitosan {{proved to be}} able to undergo reversible phase transition, in particular at physiological pH and ionic strength. Formation of either soluble or insoluble complexes occurred depending on pH value, charge ratio and degree of polymerization of the polymers. The stability of positively or negatively charged complexes against destruction action of the added salt drastically increased in acidic media presumably owing to H-bonds formation. According to light-scattering data, the size of the soluble complexes varied from 100 to 300 nm and remained virtually unchanged under storage after <b>lyophilizing</b> drying and resuspending in the same medium.
