Their diversity in both behavior and morphology (outward appearance) rivals that of the monkeys and apes found elsewhere in the world. Ranging in size from the 30g (1.1oz) Madame Berthe's mouse lemur, the world's smallest primate, to the recently extinct 160–200kg (350–440lb) Archaeoindris fontoynonti, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E

His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused on rural infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E

25|$|The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), {{the federal}} agency {{responsible}} for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy {{because there was a}} lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 together between the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time try to maintain a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big study was a compromise between the high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> and political pressure and the low level of evidence on the theory.|$|E

A majority voting equilibrium is shown to exist in which the median voter is liquidity-constrained.

25|$|At the {{institutional}} and societal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> structure, there {{do not seem}} to be proportional counterparts for males and females. Sexist policies treat men at {{the institutional}} levels as vessels of authority and have factually omitted females up until the enforcement of the Nineteenth Amendment allowing females the right to vote. Empowerment of females at this point in time has needed the confirmation of males in order to be counted in the society’s agenda and to be specified an adequate amount of sustenance to become policy. This cannot be said of females, who previously have not dealt with political establishments and clubs especially in the United States. These kinds of procedures will guarantee that the privilege men have becomes fixed in foundations so individuals will abstain from being sexist in order to prolong governance and male privilege in societies. Regardless of being less common in recent academic circles, oppression and gendered discrimination are vindicated in which male dominance is supported by declarations that inequality grounded on gender is deep-rooted in natural variances instead of by communal structures of advantage and difference.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

500|$|The {{resurgence}} in French keep design began after {{the defeat of}} the royal armies at the battles of Crécy in 1346 and Poitiers in 1356, which caused high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> unrest across the remaining French territories. Charles V of France attempted to restore French royal authority and prestige through {{the construction of a new}} range of castles. The Château de Vincennes, where a new keep was completed under Charles by 1380, was the first example of these palace fortresses. The keep at Vincennes was highly innovative: six stories high, with a chemin de ronde running around the machicolated battlements; the luxuriously appointed building was protected by an enceinte wall that formed a [...] "fortified envelope" [...] around the keep. The Vincennes keep was copied elsewhere across France, particularly as the French kings reconquered territories from the English, encouraging a style that emphasised very tall keeps with prominent machicolations. No allowance for the emerging new gunpowder weapons was made in these keeps, although later in the century gunports were slowly being added, as for example by Charles VI to his keep at Saint-Malo.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the process <b>of</b> {{building}} <b>social</b> capital as constrained by the availability {{of public and private}} services. The purpose is to show that social capital shapes, both in positive and negative terms, the capacity of local institutions to support development projects and strategies. The analysis shows that a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital gives to communities a stronger planning capacity; a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital implies that new initiatives are implemented only if they give private individual benefits; a higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital generates actions that increase and improve social capital itself. The first section outlines the logical links between the concept <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital and the availability <b>of</b> "services". <b>Social</b> capital is seen here as a public good. Section 3 focuses on the relationship between the supply of public services and the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> capital. Section 4 compares the Italian case with other cases in Northern Europe. The concluding section shows the relationship between marginality and the availability of public goods. It contributes to the analysis of the relationship between social capital and development, showing that there is both a theoretical framework and evidence to justify the "principle" that public action supporting social capital has a major role in determining the performance of development strategies and actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to develop the concept <b>of</b> <b>social</b> {{solidarity}} such {{that it can be}} compared across different societies. This is demonstrated by comparing social solidarity across four different historical societies. This thesis develops the concept <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity through a critical dialogue with the work of Emile Durkheim. By applying contemporary sociological and psychological theory to the concept <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity this thesis develops a conceptual framework <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity such that differing <b>levels</b> and forms <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity can be inferred across societies. In particular this is done by linking human material and psychological needs to social solidarity. This thesis argues that those social institutions which meet the needs of people also increase the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity between those people. By examining social institutions {{and the degree to which}} they meet people's needs it is possible to infer the extent <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity in that society. This thesis goes on to apply this procedure to four forms of society, feudal, early industrial, Fordist and neo-liberal societies. This thesis argues that the shift from feudal society to industrial capitalist society caused a significant decline in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity, although this social transformation was not without potential for generating a society with a much higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity. Fordist society is an example of one possible society which merges a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>social</b> solidarity with industrial capitalism. However the brief nature of Fordist society suggests that the underlying logic of capitalism may make such a society with high social solidarity unsustainable...|$|R
