Much of the eastern movement is due to major strike-slip faults. These strike-slip faults, along with the other faults in Tibet could still be interpreted as on a plate margin though. True intraplate deformation occurs farther north in areas such as Mongolia or the Tian Shan mountains. These areas display true intraplate deformation because there is still much faulting and folding to accommodate some of the crustal shortening from the India/Eurasia collision hundreds of kilometers away from the plate margin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{tectonics}} of the Chenoua massif suggests block rotations of Neogene nappes {{associated with}} the African–European plate convergence. To estimate the extent of these rotations, a Paleomagnetic study on rhyolites and andesites of Langhian–Serravallian age and sandstones of Burdigalian age was carried out on 23 sites (200 specimens). The sites are distributed in the northwestern, southeastern and southern Chenoua massif. One or two components of magnetization, mainly carried by magnetite, pyrrhotite and/or hematite, were isolated in sandstones and volcanics. The sandstone sites reveal magnetizations in sandstones from the Cap Blanc syncline that are post-folding. However, both polarities are found, {{which is consistent with}} data from Africa during the Upper Miocene. Clockwise and counterclockwise rotations were recorded, dating back to the Neogene times in volcanics and sediments. From the faulted Cap Blanc syncline counterclockwise rotations of 1 [*]±[*] 4 ° to 18 [*]±[*] 28 ° around a vertical axis occurred in sediments since the Miocene with respect to Africa. In fact, remagnetizations occurred at several periods of time and in different sites, providing information on the evolution of post-tectonic rotations. Some volcanics record counterclockwise rotations of about 30 ° since the Miocene, whereas others do not show any significant rotation. This {{can be explained by the}} direction of the principal compressive stress axis σ 1 and by <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusions</b> related to an indentation model, in which we expect both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLarge sector collapses {{are a major}} {{component}} of oceanic islands evolution. Here we show that voluminous events such as the Icod landslide on Tenerife (Canary Islands) cause dramatic changes on the magma feeding system and control the subsequent volcanic and geomorphologic evolution of the eruptive complex over a period of more than 150 kyr. Instantaneous unloading by the Icod landslide is marked by the development of a large phonolitic explosive eruption dated at 175 +/- 3 ka and interpreted as reflecting the immediate emptying of a shallow pre-existing magma chamber. Geochronological, geomorphological and geochemical analyses, carried out on the post-landslide volcanic succession sampled in a 4. 4 km-long underground water-recovery gallery, provide further evidence for an enhanced extrusion of primitive lavas starting in the 10 kyr time interval following the failure. Rapid construction (< 40 kyr) of a thick basaltic volcano in the landslide scar at high eruptive rates (up to 8 km(3) ky(- 1)) increased the lithostatic pressure which then favored the intermittent storage of basic magma under the edifice. This resulted in more episodic construction evidenced by a significant decrease in output rates and the increasing occurrence of lavas with intermediate composition from 117 +/- 7 to 52 +/- 7 ka. An apparent volcanic gap is observed between 52 +/- 7 and 18 +/- 1 ka, after which highly differentiated lavas have been dominantly erupted. We propose that part of the gap {{can be explained by the}} individualization of a shallow magma reservoir a few kilometers below the base of the Teide volcano. During recent periods, vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusions</b> of trachytic and phonolitic viscous bodies from this storage area contributed to increase the slope of the main edifice up to 35 degrees, overall favoring its present-day instability.

40|$|Syn-tectonic {{extension}} is {{a process}} that has been observed by previous workers in the eastern Central Range of Taiwan, using geodetic, geologic and seismic data. The details of the location, direction and magnitude of the extension, as well as the mechanism by which extension occurs, has not been adequately explained in a comprehensive tectonic model of the Taiwan arc-continent collision. This study correlates multiple sets of data to constrain the location of active block bounding structures that accommodate extension and interprets extension in both northern and southern Taiwan {{to be associated with the}} <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of the crust, parallel to the Taiwan orogen. The extent of <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> is interpreted to be controlled by the location of a basement high indenter below the topographic low of the Puli basin. ^ The first chapter examines the distribution of low to intermediate magnitude (ML 1 - 4) earthquakes, available focal mechanisms and GPS data across north-central Taiwan. These data suggest the presence of two shear zones that accommodate exhumation and <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of the metamorphic basement: the western and eastern metamorphic shear zones. ^ The second chapter presents the results from a three-year GPS campaign across the northern Hengchun Peninsula. Velocity vectors are used in a strain analysis across the region by interpolating between the irregularly spaced data. Extension is generally constrained to the central and eastern portions of the Central Range and is oriented northeast/southwest. The magnitude of extension is higher than the magnitude of compression and is interpreted to be the result of transtension between two range bounding oblique faults. ^ The third chapter compares the irregular strain pattern of the fold-and-thrust belt of south-central Taiwan to the strain pattern of the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt of Iran and identifies the boundaries of <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> in southern Taiwan from the systematic changes in GPS velocity vectors. The western boundary is interpreted to be approximately coincident with the Kouhsiaoli/Lunhou fault system and the eastern boundary is interpreted to be approximately coincident with the metamorphic and slate belt boundary.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{analogue}} experiments simulating intra-continental subduction contemporaneous with <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{of the upper}} plate are performed to study the interference between these two processes at crustal levels and in the lithospheric mantle. The models demonstrate that intra-continental subduction and coeval <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of the upper plate are compatible processes leading to similar deformation structures within the extruding region {{as compared to the}} classical setup, lithosphere-scale indentation. Strong coupling across the subduction boundary allows for the transfer of stresses to the upper plate, where strain regimes are characterized by crustal thickening near a confined margin and dominated by lateral displacement of material near a weak lateral confinement. The strain regimes propagate laterally during ongoing convergence creating an area of overlap characterized by transpression. When subduction is oblique to the convergence direction, the upper plate is less deformed and as a consequence the amount of <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> decreases. In addition, strain is partitioned along the oblique plate boundary resulting in less subduction in expense of right lateral displacement close to the weak lateral confinement. Both oblique and orthogonal subduction models have a strong resemblance to <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> tectonics of the Eastern Alps (Europe), where subduction of the adjacent Adriatic plate beneath the Eastern Alps is debated. Our results imply that subduction of Adria is a valid mechanisms to induce extrusion-type deformation within the Eastern Alps lithosphere. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Oligocene to Late Miocene structural evolution of the Eastern Alps reflects a phase of oblique subduction followed by a later stage of orthogonal subduction conform a Miocene shift in the plate motion of Adria. Oblique subduction also provides a viable mechanism to explain the rapid decrease in slab length of the Adriatic plate beneath the Eastern Alps towards the Pannonian Basin...|$|E

40|$|The ascent and {{emplacement}} of magmas in {{the upper}} crust modify the local pre-existing thermal and rheological settings. Such changes have important effects in producing anomalous structures, mass extrusion, rock fracturing, and in some conditions, hydrothermal mineralizations. In the Campiglia Marittima area, detailed field mapping led to the reconstruction of a local deformation history that overlaps, chronologically and spatially, with regional extension. This local deformation was triggered at the Mioceneâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Pliocene boundary by the intrusion of a monzogranitic pluton beneath a carbonate sedimentary sequence. The emplacement of the pluton produced a perturbation in the rheological behaviour of the carbonate host rocks, producing transient ductile conditions in the very shallow crust. The carbonate rocks were thermally weakened and flowed laterally, accumulating downslope of the pluton roof, mainly toward the east. As the thermal anomaly was decaying, the brittleâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 ductile boundary moved progressively back towards the pluton, and large tension gash-shaped volumes of fractured marble were generated. These fractured volumes were exploited by rising hydrothermal fluids generating sigmoidal skarn bodies and ore shoots.

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, {{the authors}} employ tailor welded {{aluminum}} alloy pipes for <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> process with a lost core {{to perform a}} hollow light-weight-part. Design/methodology/approach: The pipe is welded longitudinally by YAG-laser. “The <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> process with a lost core (LELC) ” consists of <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of pipes with a soluble solid core, called the “lost core”, {{which serves as a}} plastic mandrel. The process proceeds as follows. First, the pipe cavity is filled with the liquid low temperature melting material composing the lost core. The liquid is then solidified to form the soluble core of the pipe. The material is compressed longitudinally as a composite billet as well as forging, and extruded in the lateral direction. After the pipe is deformed, the lost core is melted and removed. s. The bulge by the LELC is carried out by extruding the material for the lateral direction, however the simple bulge by hydro-forming is done by internal pressure. Findings: The LELC process can make a hollow product having uneven wall thickness without the deformation concentrating on a thinner part of the material, because the circumferential deformation of the material will be performed by its meridian strain. Practical implications: The authors have developed LELC process in which the lost core consists of low-temperature melting alloys and have tried to apply the process to perform bulge process with a tailor-welded pipe having two different wall thickness. Originality/value: Optimum volume distribution is important for light-weight-parts, and employment of tailor-welded blanks is effective technique in sheet metal forming.

The structural framework of the Zimbabwe craton is dominated by the evolution of the c. 2700 Ma Limpopo belt. Strongly developed, major shear zones were initiated at this time. These major shear zones focused strain, which in the Midlands greenstone belt, evolved from pure N-S compression, to <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of the main Rhodesdale gneiss block westwards. The structural features seen in the gold deposits of the Midlands greenstone belt are consistent with such a model of NNW-SSE compression linked to <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of the Rhodesdale gneiss block westwards.

40|$|Large-scale {{extension}} {{affected the}} Eastern Alps during post-collisional <b>lateral</b> tectonic <b>extrusion</b> in Early and Middle Miocene times. The Tauern window was mainly tectonically exhumed by the 160 -km pullapart of the rigidly behaving Austroalpine basement blocks forming the tectonic {{lid of the}} Penninic contents of the window. An evaluation of the syn-extrusion fault pattern reveals displacements of several tens of kilometers along the low-angle extensional shear zones at the western and eastern margins of the window, and along the important strike-slip fault zones {{north and south of}} the window. Large-scale shear is re¯ected by discontinuities in mineral cooling patterns across important shear zones. The cooling histories of the tectonic blocks show that the window boundaries during exhumation coincide only partly with the classical boundaries of the window de®ned by thrust units. Reconstruction of the exhumation history shows an asymmetric evolution of the Tauern window. We argue that the eastern and western low-angle extensional shear zones formed in sequence, which is re¯ected by different evolutions of the fragmentation and uplift history of the Austraolpine tectonic blocks to the east and west of the window. In the Central and Eastern Alps, three structural domes, the Lepontin dome in the Central Alps and the Tauern and Rechnitz domes in the Eastern Alps, were formed by large-scale extension in Miocene times.

40|$|The Gran Sasso {{range is}} a {{striking}} salient formed by two roughly rectilinear E–W and N–S limbs. In the past ∼ 90 ° counterclockwise (CCW) rotations from the eastern Gran Sasso were reported [Tectonophysics 215 (1992) 335], suggesting west–east increase of rotation-related northward shortening along the E–W limb. In this paper, we report on paleomagnetic data from Meso-Cenozoic sedimentary dykes and strata cropping out at Corno Grande (central part of the E–W Gran Sasso limb), the highest summit of the Apennine belt. Predominant northwestward paleomagnetic declinations (in the normal polarity state) from both sedimentary dykes and strata are observed. When compared to the expected declination values for the Adriatic foreland, our data document no thrusting-related rotation at Corno Grande. The overall paleomagnetic data set coupled with the available geological information shows that the Gran Sasso arc {{is in fact a}} composite structure, formed by an unrotated-low shortening western (E–W trending) limb and a strongly CCW rotated eastern salient. Late Messinian and post-early Pliocene shortening episodes documented along the Gran Sasso front indicate that belt building and arc formation occurred during two distinct episodes. We suggest that the southern part of a late Messinian N–S front was reactivated during early–middle Pliocene time, forming a tight range salient due to CCW rotations and differential along-front shortening rates. The formation of a northward displacing bulge in an overall NW–SE chain is likely a consequence of the collision between the Latium-Abruzzi and Apulian carbonate platforms during northeastward propagation of the Apennine wedge, inducing <b>lateral</b> northward <b>extrusion</b> of Latium-Abruzzi carbonates towards ductile basinal sediment areas...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was}} to verify the results of previous theoretical work, based on the mathematical models, regarding a relationship between the cross-section shape of the meniscus and the risk of its extrusion. Knee MRI examination was performed in 77 subjects (43 men and 34 women), mean age 34. 99 years (range: 18 - 49 years), complaining of knee pain. Patients with osteoarthritic changes (grade 3 and 4 to Kellgren classification), varus or valgus deformity and past injuries of the knee were excluded from the study. A 3 -Tesla MR device was used to study the relationship between the shape of the lateral meniscus (using slope angle, meniscus-cartilage height and meniscus-bone angle) and the risk of extrusion. Analysis revealed that with values of slope angle and meniscus-bone angle increasing by one degree, the risk of meniscus extrusion raises by 1. 157 and 1. 078 respectively. Also, an increase in meniscus-cartilage height by 1 mm significantly elevates the risk of extrusion. At the same time it was demonstrated that for meniscus-bone angle values over 42 degrees and slope angle over 37 degrees the risk of extrusion increases significantly. This was the first study to demonstrate a tight correlation between slope angle, meniscus-bone angle and meniscus-cartilage height values in the assessment of the risk of <b>lateral</b> meniscus <b>extrusion.</b> Insertion of the above parameters to the radiological assessment of the knee joint allows identification of patients characterized by an elevated risk of development of this pathology...|$|R

Both shortening {{in front of the}} rigid piston, which models the northward motion of Arabia, and extension resulting from the gravity spreading of the sand-silicone layer are necessary to initiate the <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Strike-slip faults accommodate the lateral escape and link the normal faults accompanying gravity spreading with the thrust faults in front of the rigid indenter. Strike-slip faults begin to accommodate extrusion at a late stage in the experiments after the normal and thrust faults have developed. Experiments also show that the initial geometry of the boundary of the spreading layer may result in the formation of two arcs behind which material extends, in a manner analogous to the Hellenic and Cypriot arcs, without invoking a rheological change at the junction of the two arcs. The experiments also suggest that southward motion of {{the eastern part of the}} spreading region is compensated by the northward advance of the piston, which is a possible explanation for the slower movement of the Cypriot arc compared to the Aegean arc...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of innovative}} lightweight materials and their further processing by forming allows functional dimensioning of components {{in addition to}} lightweight design. Accordingly, workpieces can be produced that have locally differing component properties. The new <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> process of composites produces near net shape lightweight composites. This process application is particularly useful when producing corrosion-resistant Al/Mg composites since it facilitates combining the favorable strength/weight ratio of magnesium with the favorable corrosion behavior of aluminum. The composite interface area is of specific significance in this respect. The presented method initiates diffusion processes with phase reformation to obtain a firmly-bonded metal joint...|$|E
30|$|Stephenson [26] used a {{combined}} medial and lateral approach {{and found that}} the small lateral approach made it possible to reduce the posterior facet accurately under direct vision and to obtain secure fixation that allowed early subtalar motion. Also, by using the medial approach, an accurate reduction of the tuberosity fragment relative to the superomedial fragment was possible. Paley and Hall [20] used only the medial approach for all his cases and reported that this approach was not adequate to address the <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> of bone fragment. This <b>lateral</b> <b>extrusion</b> lead to fibulocalcaneal impingement and irritation of the peroneal tendon sheath which is {{the most common cause of}} pain at the lateral aspect of hind foot. In the current study, small lateral approach was used for all cases on the premise that it was sufficient for the management of such fractures and to avoid the common wound problems encountered with the extensile approach especially in smokers and patients with diabetes. This approach was familiar, easy, simple, rapid, and adequate for the reduction and minimal fixation of the posterior facet; it also allowed for the insertion of bone graft and reduction of the lateral wall. However, it was difficult to visualize the far medial fracture of the posterior facet and to address the displaced medial wall fracture. The difficulty was overcome by closed manipulation of the tuberosity fragment in a way similar to that used by Essex-Lopresti [10].|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and geomorphology of active orogens evolves on time scales {{ranging from a}} single earthquake to {{millions of years of}} tectonic deformation. Analysis of crustal deformation using new and established remote sensing techniques, and integration of these data with field mapping, geochronology and the sedimentary record, create new opportunities to understand orogenic evolution over these timescales. Timor Leste (East Timor) lies on the northern collisional boundary between continental crust from the Australian Plate and the Banda volcanic arc. GPS studies have indicated that the island of Timor is actively shortening. Field mapping and fault kinematic analysis of an emergent Pliocene marine sequence identifies gentle folding, overprinted by a predominance of NW-SE oriented dextral-normal faults and NE-SW oriented sinistral-normal faults that collectively bound large (5 - 20 km 2) bedrock massifs throughout the island. These fault systems intersect at non-Andersonian conjugate angles of approximately 120 ° and accommodate an estimated 20 km of orogen-parallel extension. Folding of Pliocene rocks in Timor may represent an early episode of contraction but the overall pattern of deformation is one of <b>lateral</b> crustal <b>extrusion</b> sub-parallel to the Banda Arc. Stratigraphic relationships suggest that extrusion began prior to 5. 5 Ma, during and after initial uplift of the orogen. Sedimentological, geochemical and Nd isotope data indicate that the island of Timor was emergent and shedding terrigenous sediment into carbonate basins prior to 4. 5 Ma. Synorogenic tectonic and sedimentary phases initiated almost synchronously across much of Timor Leste and < 2 Myr before similar events in West Timor. An increase in plate coupling along this obliquely converging boundary, due to subduction of an outlying continental plateau at the Banda Trench, is proposed as a mechanism for uplift that accounts for orogen-parallel extension and early uplift of Timor Leste. Rapid bathymetric changes around Timor are likely to have {{played an important role in}} evolution of the Indonesian Seaway. The 2010 Mw 7. 1 Darfield (Canterbury) earthquake in New Zealand was complex, involving multiple faults with strike-slip, reverse and normal displacements. Multi-temporal cadastral surveying and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys allowed surface deformation at the junction of three faults to be analyzed in this study in unprecedented detail. A nested, localized restraining stepover with contractional bulging was identified in an area with the overall fault structure of a releasing bend, highlighting the surface complexities that may develop in fault interaction zones during a single earthquake sequence. The earthquake also caused river avulsion and flooding in this area. Geomorphic investigations of these rivers prior to the earthquake identify plausible precursory patterns, including channel migration and narrowing. Comparison of the pre and post-earthquake geomorphology of the fault rupture also suggests that a subtle scarp or groove was present along much of the trace prior to the Darfield earthquake. Hydrogeology and well logs support a hypothesis of extended slip history and suggests that that the Selwyn River fan may be infilling a graben that has accumulated late Quaternary vertical slip of < 30 m. Investigating fault behavior, geomorphic and sedimentary responses over a multitude of time-scales and at different study sites provides insights into fault interactions and orogenesis during single earthquakes and over millions of years of plate boundary deformation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to develop a {{clinically}} useful and reproducible method for evaluating <b>lateral</b> meniscal <b>extrusion</b> in normal and transplanted knees under different axial loading conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) were used to assess meniscal extrusion. Both types of imaging were performed at least 6 months postoperatively (mean 23. 5 months). Coronal MR images (DESS- 3 D sequence) of the lateral compartments of 10 normal knees and 17 transplanted lateral knees were analyzed. Extrusion was defined as the distance measured from the femoral condyle or tibial plateau to {{the outer edge of the}} meniscus. Subjects were examined in the supine position. Ultrasound print-outs of the lateral compartment of both knees of ten patients (transplanted side and contralateral normal side) were analyzed. Extrusion cross-sectional area (CSA) and distance were measured just anterior to the lateral collateral ligament: the former was defined as the CSA of the meniscus outside the knee, the latter as the greatest distance from a line connecting the femur and tibia to the outer edge of the lateral meniscus. Patients were examined in the supine position, bipodal stance and unipodal stance. The viable meniscal allograft was securely sutured to a bleeding functional meniscal rim. No bone blocks were used to fix the allograft; instead, the anterior and posterior horn were firmly sutured to their enthesis. The MRI results (tibial) show the transplanted lateral meniscus to be significantly (p< 0. 005) more extruded in comparison to the normal lateral meniscus. The anterior horn (mean 5. 8 mm, SD= 2. 8) of the transplanted lateral meniscus tends to be more extruded than the posterior horn (mean 2. 7 mm, SD= 1. 48). The posterior horn of the normal lateral meniscus does not (mean 0 mm) extrude, while the mean extrusion of the anterior horn is 0. 8 mm (SD= 0. 92). In the US results, the transplanted lateral meniscus is significantly (p< 0. 005) more extruded than the normal lateral meniscus in all patient positions. Both cross-sectional surface and distance are equally good parameters to determine meniscal extrusion. There is no statistical difference between patient positions. The transplanted lateral meniscus extrudes, in the supine position, bipodal and unipodal stance 6. 43 (SD= 1. 84), 6. 01 (SD= 1. 93) and 6. 99 mm (SD= 2. 7) respectively. The extrusion surface of the lateral transplanted meniscus is 50. 50 mm(2) (SD= 15. 32), 47. 24 mm(2) (SD= 14. 35) and 58. 61 mm(2) (SD= 29. 65) in the supine position, bipodal stance and unipodal stance respectively. The normal lateral meniscus extrudes in the supine position, bipodal and unipodal stance 3. 77 (SD= 1. 76), 3. 94 (SD= 1. 66) and 3. 79 mm (SD= 1. 79) respectively. The extrusion surface of the normal lateral meniscus is 22. 42 mm(2) (SD= 12. 54), 23. 24 mm(2) (SD= 12. 74) and 24. 79 mm(2) (SD= 10. 18) in the supine position, bipodal stance and unipodal stance respectively. The presented data shows that the transplanted lateral meniscus, without bone block fixation but with firm fixation of the horns to the original entheses, extrudes in the lateral direction significantly more than the normal meniscus. The transplanted lateral meniscus, however, does not extrude more in the lateral direction under axial load. The anterior horn of both normal and transplanted menisci is extruded more laterally than the posterior horn. Both methods are adequate to measure laterally-directed extrusion of the normal and transplanted lateral meniscus, but have distinctive advantages and disadvantages: MRI in this series visualizes the comple Using ultrasound one can evaluate the meniscal extrusion in different conditions of axial loading, but only from a single examination point...|$|R
40|$|Introduction In human medicine, far <b>lateral</b> lumbar disc <b>extrusion</b> (FLLDE) {{represents}} 7 to 12 % of all disc herniations and MRI is {{the method}} of choice for diagnosis. MRI findings of a FLLDE {{has been reported in}} one dog and the aim of this case report is to describe computed tomographic (CT) findings of a FLLDE in a dog. Methods A six-year-old neutered female Beagle with a good general health status was presented with a month history of left hind limb pain with shivering of this limb. Clinical examination revealed a left hind proprioceptive deficit but no pain was elicited at palpation. Results A CT scan pre- and post- contrast studies of the lumbosacral spine and a myelographic-CT were performed. A 1. 3 x 0. 6 x 0. 3 cm homogeneous hyperattenuating (+/- 350 HU) ovoid structure was observed at the left lateral aspect of L 6 -L 7 intervertebral disc space. The L 6 -L 7 intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus was calcified but the annulus fibrosus had a normal non-calcified attenuation and seemed intact apart from a very thin hyperattenuating line next to the ovoid structure. This change was well circumscribed by an even hyperattenuating rim (1000 HU) mimicking a thin dense cortex and was in close proximity with the annulus fibrosus and the left transverse process of L 7. Perineural fat was not observed and contrast enhancement was visualized {{at the level of the}} left sixth lumbar nerve root with impingement and thickening of this root. No compression of the spinal cord was observed at this level on the myeloCT. These findings were suggestive of a dystrophic mineralization or an osteochondromatosis. FLLDE was considered less likely because of the almost normal appearance of the annulus fibrosus. At surgery some mixed gelified calcified material consistent with disc material was removed at the level of the left L 6 -L 7 nerve root tract and disc fenestration was performed. The histological analysis confirmed the presence of degenerated herniated vertebral disk. Discussion/Conclusions In human medicine, MRI and CT scan are the main diagnostic modalities employed for diagnosis of FLLDE. In veterinary medicine, CT is often used to assess spinal diseases because of its availability. To the authors’ knowledge, CT findings of a FLLDE have not been described previously in dogs. Moreover, the thin dense cortex appearance surrounding the disc material was surprising. In conclusion, FLLDE should be included in the differential diagnosis of a calcified ovoid structure lateral to the spine even if the annulus fibrosus appears normal and if this structure is in close relation with the vertebral transverse process.
