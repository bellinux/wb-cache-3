25|$|As {{a generous}} {{patron of the}} arts, Marguerite befriended and {{protected}} many artists and writers, among them François Rabelais (1483–1553), Clément Marot (1496–1544), Claude de Bectoz (d. 1547) and Pierre de Ronsard (1524–1585). Also, Marguerite served as a mediator between Roman Catholics and Protestants (including John Calvin). Although Marguerite espoused reform within the Catholic Church, {{she was not a}} Calvinist. She did, however, do her best to protect the reformers and dissuaded Francis I from intolerant measures as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> After her death, eight religious wars occurred in France, marked notably by the notorious St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell entered office {{facing a}} {{statutory}} general election. [...] She waited as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> before asking Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to dissolve Parliament on September 8, only weeks before Parliament {{was due to}} expire. The election was scheduled for October 25, the latest date it could be legally held under Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
2500|$|The tale has {{an abrupt}} ending. Opinions vary {{on whether the}} ending was the {{intended}} ending of the author. Arthur Waley, who made the first English translation of the whole of The Tale of Genji, believed that the work as we have it was finished. Ivan Morris, author of The World of the Shining Prince, {{believed that it was}} not complete, with later chapters missing. [...] Edward Seidensticker, who made the second translation of the Genji, believed that it was not finished, and that Murasaki Shikibu would not have had a planned story structure with an [...] "ending", and would simply have gone on writing as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tucker toured on both U.S. coasts {{to support}} the 1,000 Years album, in {{addition}} to dates {{in other parts of}} the country. Additionally, on May 3, 2011, Corin opened for M. Ward at the Crystal Ballroom, in Portland, Oregon. In a Kill Rock Stars press release, Tucker stated that she was no longer able to tour for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> once <b>could,</b> and that [...] "We’re definitely playing shows, but it’s more like a week here, a week there." ...|$|R
5000|$|In October 2006, on French television, Mutter {{appeared}} {{to indicate that}} she would be retiring when she turned 45, in 2008. However the following month she said that her words were [...] "misinterpreted" [...] and that she would continue to play <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> [...] "bring anything new, anything important, anything different to music".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{accept my}} devotion?" [...] said Grandcourt, holding his hat {{by his side}} and looking {{straight}} into her eyes, without other movement. Their eyes meeting in that way seemed to allow any length of pause: but wait <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> would, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> contradict herself! What had she detained him for? He had shut out any explanation.|$|R
2500|$|Kirner {{went into}} 1992 knowing she faced a {{statutory}} general election, one which opinion polls gave her virtually {{no chance of}} winning. [...] She waited as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> finally calling an election for October. [...] It was obvious {{as soon as the}} writs were dropped that Labor would not win a fourth term. [...] Although she remained personally more popular than the Liberal Opposition Leader, Jeff Kennett, it was not nearly enough to overcome the electorate's anger at her party. The Coalition's [...] "Guilty Party" [...] campaign did much to stoke this anger, targeting many Ministers in the Kirner Government and providing examples of concerns in their portfolios.|$|E
2500|$|King was {{starting}} to think about being an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, {{an important part of}} German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870–1938). The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it. King went to see the artist Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz’ advice to King about a career in art was “Don’t do it if you can help it. It is so difficult”. Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: “I haven’t regretted it. I agree with her, it’s difficult.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Brennan {{turned down}} the {{internship}} and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her [...] "If you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" [...] and [...] "I am never going to help you." [...] Now alone, Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money. She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused. Brennan hid her pregnancy for as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> living {{in a variety of}} homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation. At the same time, according to Brennan, Jobs [...] "started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child." [...] A few weeks before she was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm and she accepted the offer. When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him) Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.|$|E
60|$|There {{could be}} no doubt from the tone, {{in the mind of}} any one who knew Mr. Maurine Mohun, that the {{decision}} was final; but perhaps Dolores would have asked more if the door-bell had not rung at the moment and Mr. Smithson had not been announced. Fate was closing in on her. She retired into her book, and remained <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> possibly <b>could,</b> for the sake of seeing her father and hearing his voice; but after a time she was desired to call Caroline, and to go to bed herself, for it was a good deal past nine o'clock.|$|R
50|$|It is with {{compassion}} for our native land {{and love for}} our daughter Dorothy that we withdraw her {{as a student at}} Harding High School. As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> we felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be protected from bodily injury and insults within the school’s walls and upon the school premises, we were willing to grant her desire to study at Harding.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{said the}} hostess in the applause which {{recognized}} Wetmore's mischievous intent. [...] "I'll not believe {{anything of the}} kind." [...] From her this {{had the effect of}} repartee, and when she asked with the single-heartedness which Wetmore had praised among her friends as her strongest point, and advised her keeping up <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> possibly <b>could,</b> [...] "It isn't so, is it, Mr. Ludlow?" [...] the finest wit could not have done more for her. The general beamed upon her over the length of the table. Mrs. Rangeley said at his elbow, [...] "She's always more charming than any one else, simply because she is," [...] and he made no effort to turn the compliment upon her <b>as</b> <b>she</b> thought he might very well have done.|$|R
60|$|Miss Pillenger was {{not entirely}} sorry to obey the request. Mr Meggs's sudden fury had startled and frightened her. So <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> end the scene victorious, she was anxious to withdraw.|$|E
60|$|I was now quite myself again, and Polly {{had evidently}} made her story as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> {{to allow me}} to recover myself, and to divert my {{thoughts}} a little from my great joy.|$|E
60|$|But Mr. Turnbull came now to meet her; {{a medical}} {{man is the}} good angel of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom she {{remember}}ed as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember anything, with a trembling, questioning look.|$|E
60|$|Dr. Grantly {{did not see}} his {{sister-in-law}} in company with Mr. Slope, but Mr. Arabin did. Mr. Arabin came out with Mr. Thorne {{to the front door}} to welcome Mrs. Grantly, and he remained in the courtyard till all their party had passed on. Eleanor hung back in the carriage <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> well <b>could,</b> but <b>she</b> was nearest to the door, and when Mr. Slope, having alighted, offered her his hand, she had no alternative but to take it. Mr. Arabin, standing at the open door while Mrs. Grantly was shaking hands with someone within, saw a clergyman alight from the carriage whom he at once knew to be Mr. Slope, and then he saw this clergyman hand out Mrs. Bold. Having seen so much, Mr. Arabin, rather sick at heart, followed Mrs. Grantly into the house.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, {{through the}} {{assistance}} of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> it <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't want to {{send for}} help so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had any thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sell," [...] said the little boy in a deprecating tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would never}} suit my daughter," [...] Mrs. Forsyth lugged in, {{partly because the}} talk had gone on away from her family as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> endure, and partly because Charlotte's indecision always amused her. [...] "She can't bear to choose." ...|$|E
60|$|He studied its sparse {{supplies}} with care. There was {{not much}} to do with, but he boiled some eggs and made coffee very quietly, with intent to let his mother sleep as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> He found himself less savage than the night before.|$|E
6000|$|... "The famous History?" [...] cried Anne. The {{writing and}} the {{printing}} of this Magnum Opus {{had been going on}} as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> remember. All her childhood long Uncle Henry's History had been a vague and fabulous thing, often heard of and never seen.|$|E
60|$|A Snob <b>she</b> is, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{sets that}} prodigious value upon herself, upon her name, upon her outward appearance, and indulges in that {{intolerable}} pomposity; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes parading abroad, like Solomon {{in all his}} glory; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> goes to bed--as I believe she does--with a turban and a bird of paradise in it, and a court train to her night-gown; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is so insufferably virtuous and condescending; <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does not cut {{at least one of}} those footmen down into mutton-chops {{for the benefit of the}} young ladies.|$|R
60|$|Mark's happy-go-lucky way {{of taking}} things did not {{convince}} his sister; but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do nothing, <b>she</b> submitted {{and made her}} friends <b>as</b> comfortable <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|Anna, the eldest, was so {{beautiful}} that when she took the sheep to pasture they forgot to eat <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was walking with them. Stana, the second, was {{so beautiful}} {{that when she was}} driving the flock the wolves protected the sheep. But Laptitza, the youngest, with a skin as white as the foam on the milk, and with hair as soft as the finest lamb's wool, was as beautiful as both her sisters put together--as beautiful <b>as</b> <b>she</b> alone <b>could</b> be.|$|R
6000|$|For {{some little}} time, they {{traveled}} in silence--alone in the railway carriage. After submitting as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to lay an embargo {{on the use}} of her tongue, Mrs. Ellmother started the conversation by means of a question: [...] "Do you think Mr. Mirabel will get over it, miss?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{inclined}} {{her head}} slightly in acknowledgment of his bow, and he whirled {{out of the room}} and down the dim narrow passageway into the arms of Mrs. Pasmer, who had resisted as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> her curiosity to know what the angry voices of himself and Alice meant.|$|E
60|$|I did not wake Rectus to {{tell him}} the news. It would not do any good, and I was afraid Corny might hear us. I wanted her to sleep as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and, indeed, I dreaded the moment when she should awake, and find that all had been given up.|$|E
60|$|Alice {{thought the}} whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave {{that she did not}} dare to laugh; and, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not think of {{anything}} to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking <b>as</b> solemn <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then when Liza did it <b>as</b> gently <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>she</b> grumbled again.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Braile {{contented}} herself <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{with his}} ironical concession.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have little}} enough to atone for, madam," [...] said Tom, as he busied himself about the sufferer. He saw that all {{would soon be}} over, and would have had Mrs. Vavasour withdraw: {{but she was so}} really good a nurse as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> control herself, that he could hardly spare her.|$|E
6000|$|... "would steal out of {{the house}} at night, and go off and wander about [...] the street for hours, proud, heartsick, despairing, not knowing which [...] way to turn, or what to do, while Mrs. Clemm would endure the anxiety [...] at home as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and then start off in search of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|She was {{definitely}} {{sorry to hear}} that they were to leave at nine that evening, and she clung to them as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> She took them to St. Mark's for dinner. Stooped, her elbows on the table, she heard with excitement that [...] "Cy Bogart had the 'flu, but of course he was too gol-darn mean to die of it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> told it <b>as</b> shortly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> they {{listening}} {{without a}} word.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave the}} account of her capture and journey <b>as</b> shortly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|Charley {{shook her}} head <b>as</b> <b>she</b> methodically drew his rags about him and made him <b>as</b> warm <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
