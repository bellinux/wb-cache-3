6000|$|... "On he came, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> well up (a buffalo {{does not}} {{generally}} <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> till {{he does so}} to strike); those great black horns--as I look at them before me, gentlemen, I seem to see them come charging at me as I did ten years ago, silhouetted against the green bush behind;--on, on!" ...|$|R
60|$|Selim was {{inclined}} to take things leisurely, and Harry gradually allowed him to slacken his pace into a walk, and even occasionally to stop and <b>lower</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> to take a bite from some particularly tempting bunch of grass {{by the side of}} the road.|$|R
