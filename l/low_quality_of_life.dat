40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze subjectively, using the SWAL-QOL questionnaire, {{swallowing}} dys function and associated factors after treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients treated for head and neck cancer. Material and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, based on the selection of patients with tumors of the head and neck area, treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy during the years 2000 to 2006 at the Oncology Institute of Juiz de Fora. The data were analyzed using SPSS 15. 0 software, and were evaluated using the chisquare test to compare differences in proportions between groups. The statistical significance level was set at 5 %. Results: It was observed that with respect to foods of solid consistency, there was a statistically significant difference for mouth tumors (p< 0. 01), with a tendency in this group to use softer foods, easier to chew (stews, boiled vegtables, creamy soups, canned fruit). With reference to the domains of the SWAL-QOL, the location of the tumor in the mouth was statistically associated with the <b>lowest</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the symptoms domain (p< 0. 05). The female gender variable was associated with the <b>lowest</b> perceived <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in several domains, namely swallowing (p= 0. 02); fatigue (p= 0. 008); symptoms (p= 0. 009). Age (split below and above 60 years) was not associated with differences in perceived <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in any domain. Conclusion: Tumor in the mouth and the total dose of radiation in the superior fossa were associated with the <b>lowest</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the symptoms domain.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{sought to}} {{examine the effect of}} sociodemographic {{characteristics}} and perioperative clinical factors 1 year after coronary bypass operations on <b>low</b> health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> We also sought to assess the usefulness of an additional single question on overall health for identifying patients with <b>low</b> health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Methods: This report is part of the Israeli coronary artery bypass study of 1994, in which every patient undergoing isolated coronary bypass grafting in Israel was included. The target population for this report comprised all survivors beyond 1 year who were 45 to 65 years of age. Patients were interviewed before the operations. Self-administered questionnaires regarding health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> (SF- 36) were sent to 1724 patients who were successfully located 1 year postoperatively, and 1270 questionnaires were completed. <b>Low</b> health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was defined as the lowest tertile of the distribution of scores for the 2 summary components of the SF- 36 and the single question on overall health. Logistic models were constructed for each of the 3 outcomes. Results: Female sex and low socioeconomic background were associated with <b>low</b> health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in the logistic models. Other significant factors were symptoms of angina, sleep disturbances, hypertension, high severity of illness scores, hospital readmission, no rehabilitation, and hospitals with high perioperative mortality. Of the 3 study outcomes, the model for the single question on overall health was the most discriminating (C statistic = 0. 76 vs 0. 70 and 0. 70, respectively). Conclusions: The study identifies patients who would most benefit from posthospitalization community support after bypass operations. Under circumstances of limited resources, these disadvantaged groups should be targeted as a priority. Encouraging participation in existing rehabilitation programs or introducing telephone hotlines could improve health-related <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> after coronary bypass grafting without large investments.

50|$|The {{improvement}} {{to quality}} of life following an intestinal transplantation is significant. Of living patients 6 months after transplant, 70% are considered to have regained full intestinal function, 15% are at partial function, and 15% have had their grafts removed.

The ability to resume regular activities {{such as the ability}} to consume food and exert control over digestive function is certainly a welcome return for patients. The <b>low</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> induced by intestinal failure is oftentimes further supplemented by significant psychosocial disability and narcotic dependence.

There were also concerns about the long-term structural soundness of the houses due to their novel construction. Parliament commissioned a report into {{the design of the}} houses {{and its impact on the}} occupants.It found that the health issues were due to poor windows and poor heating; the insulating properties of the no-fines walls were adjudged reasonable compared to single skin buildings of the same period. It concluded that the buildings were structurally sound. Subsequent improvements to windows and heating facilities have brought the houses broadly up to modern living standards and the design is now seen as largely vindicated. Some examples now enjoy additional exterior insulation, which can be readily identified from its distinctive design. The novel nature construction is still a residual concern and many lenders make restrictions on mortgages against no-fines houses.Wimpey no-fines houses are no longer in active construction.|$|E

Five hundred patients who visited our inner city, university-based gastroenterology practice, were asked about symptoms of fecal incontinence. We also retrospectively reviewed 500 charts to identify the frequency of patient-physician reporting of fecal incontinence. Results. Of the 500 patients that were directly questioned, 58 (12 %, 43 women, 15 men) admitted to fecal incontinence compared to 12 (2. 4 %) in the retrospective arm.
