It {{has been shown that}} complicated loading conditions lead to fracture of a tool surface and these conditions are attributed to the action of various mechanisms: wearing due to high local stresses and deformations, fracture due to stretching stresses at <b>logway</b> expansion, small-cycle fatigue, heat shock etc. It is proposed to evaluate <b>logway</b> serviceability by such indices as hardness, strength and fracture viscosity and an amount of bundle and size of tungsten carbide grain influence on these indices. Â  As an alternative material to a hard alloy it is advanced to use a diamond-silicon carbide composite. It is shown that a preliminary protection of diamond crystals with the help of a-SiC nano-coating makes it possible to obtain super-hard material. Its fracture viscosity can be compared with the fracture viscosity of a hard alloy and the composite out-performs a hard alloy in respect of wear characteristics that ensures rather good prospects for its application for manufacturing <b>logway...</b>|$|E
