Of the many homers in those games, the most often replayed is Reggie Jackson's drive to right field that hit so {{high up in the}} <b>light</b> <b>tower</b> that the TV camera lost sight of it, until it dropped to the field below. Jackson dropped his bat and watched it sail, seemingly astonished at his own power display.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Field Park is {{a public}} park located along the North Branch of the Chicago River in the Albany Park {{neighborhood}} of Chicago. The park was platted, designed and constructed between 1923 and 1930, with the Clarence Hatzfeld-designed field house completed in 1930 {{under the auspices of}} the Albany Park District. The Chicago Park District was consolidated in 1934 and took over Eugene Field Park. The park has seen numerous changes and improvements over the years. Eugene Field park has tennis courts, athletic fields, a playground, two bridges and 60 foot tall <b>light</b> <b>tower.</b> Together, the park, and its historic features were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.|$|E

25|$|The {{first two}} lighthouses in Lowestoft {{were built in}} 1609 on the {{foreshore}} and candlelit, to give warning of the dangerous sandbanks around the coast. These were the first lighthouses constructed by Trinity House. The Low Light was discontinued in 1706 following sea encroachment, but re-established in 1730 {{in a form that}} could be easily moved in response to further changes to the Stamford Channel and shoreline. It was finally discontinued in August 1923. The High <b>Light</b> <b>tower</b> was rebuilt as the present lighthouse in 1874 with the intention of displaying an electric light, but when opened paraffin oil was used instead; it was not until 1936 that it was electrified. The lighthouse, along with two cottages originally used by lighthouse keepers, is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|The ground barely {{changed from}} then until the mid-1980s. During {{this time the}} ground had a hump in {{the centre of the}} ground making only the top half of players visible {{from the other side of}} the ground. There was a shed for players located where the main {{pavilion}} now stands. There was a hill on the outer (where the hill now is) that could accommodate two rows of vehicles, the small scoreboard stood on the outer close to where the electronic scoreboard is now, and the time clock sat about halfway up a training <b>light</b> <b>tower.</b> The police booth sat, until very recently, in the north-east corner of the oval. A concrete cricket pitch served for local junior teams until the 1956/57 season, when it was replaced by a turf wicket.|$|E
25|$|The Albany Park District {{fell behind}} on its bills by 1932 {{and it became}} clear that the district, as an {{independent}} entity, was not going to survive the lean years of the Great Depression. In 1934 there were 22 separate park districts operating in the city of Chicago. That year, motivated by the fiscal disaster the Depression had brought to many small independent agencies, voters approved the Park Consolidation Act of 1934 and unified all 22 disparate park districts, including the Albany Park District, into the Chicago Park District. The newly formed conglomerate qualified for $82 million in federal funding through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA) between 1935 and 1941. These funds allowed extensive improvements throughout the Chicago park system and Eugene Field Park saw many changes in the 1930s and early 1940s. The athletic fields were improved, paths and sidewalks laid, and through a 1941-42 WPA project the river banks were graded, and retaining wall, rip rap, and chain link fence were installed along the river bank. It was during this time that the 60 foot tall <b>light</b> <b>tower</b> was erected near the tennis courts.|$|E

25|$|Dyson also {{produced}} buildings with arced forms. The Lencioni house (1985) in Sanger, California, produced a particularly unique two story oval form {{that was also}} widely recognized. Appearing in popular magazines, professional journals, architectural yearbooks, and most recently in a college textbook, the composition was cited by important critics such as Bruno Zevi as a superior expression of organic architectural principles. In the award-winning Tuxford-Barrett residence (1987) in Richland Center, Wisconsin, curvilinear massing was refined {{through the development of}} two successive schemes. Unfolding in shape from a natural resonance with the slope of the hillside, the curvature of the earth-enclosed foundation wall embraced an interior space divided into living, working, and sleeping areas. A terrace extruded by the use of earth from the construction excavation extended the living space into an arboreal setting of trees rooted down grade of the building. This house was also lauded by Bruno Zevi in the same article where he extolled the Lencioni house design. Two unbuilt house designs by Dyson used similar oval pod forms. The plan for the Carlson residence (1981) in Van Nuys, California, occupied an exceptionally steep building site with an integrated system of cantilevered pods. The Millerton house project (1984) in Madera County, California, for a similarly difficult site grouped the pods with a connecting bridge over a rocky cleft and also responded to an environmentally exposed position by incorporating a Teflon roof covering supported by a steel frame for thermal regulation. Dyson further developed a curvilinear form for the Glynns Restaurant (1984) in Fresno, California, that incorporated round <b>light</b> <b>tower</b> elements which would evolve and feature significantly in later projects.|$|E

Elsewhere, flooding was mostly limited to locations with poor drainage and low-lying areas. Coastal flooding was not widespread, though surge in the Pungo River flooded several local homes. Other coastal flooding was reported in various harbors and coastal cities. Part of North Carolina Highway 12 was flooded and closed on Hatteras Island due to tidal flooding. At North Topsail Beach, many of the protective dunes constructed after Hurricane Fran in 1996 were destroyed, and along the Bogue Banks, tens of thousands of tires, part of an artificial reef, were washed ashore.|$|E

He {{had another}} sterling first half, amassing a [...]335 batting average with 26 {{home runs and}} 84 RBI at the 2001 All-Star break. However, he missed some time battling hamstring injuries and struggled down the stretch, finishing at [...]306 with 41 home runs and 125 RBI. On June 23, Ramirez hit two monstrous home runs against the Toronto Blue Jays at Fenway Park, with the second one hitting {{the very top of}} the <b>light</b> <b>tower</b> in left field. Its length was officially listed at 501 feet, second-longest by a Red Sox player in Fenway Park's history, just short of Ted Williams' 1946 record of 502 feet. He also launched a prodigious home run in an away game on June 3 against the Blue Jays into the fifth deck at the SkyDome, which still stands as the longest home run in that ballpark's history at 491 feet. However, despite his efforts, the Red Sox did not qualify for the MLB postseason in 2001. Ramirez, primarily a Right Fielder in his career previous to this point, spent most of the season as the Designated Hitter for the Red Sox. This was due to the Red Sox' belief that Manny would be best suited as a Left Fielder due to the presence of Trot Nixon in right, as well as the injuries Ramirez battled during the 2001 season. After signing with the Red Sox, Ramirez would only go on to see 7 more games of action in right field, all of which came during the 2002 season.|$|E
