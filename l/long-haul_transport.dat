In the laboratory, we demonstrate 10 -channel wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) point-to-point transmission over 2000 km on a 150 -GHz WDM grid, and 1200 -km optically routed networking including 6 recon-figurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) on a 100 -GHz grid. We then report transmission over the commercial, 50 -GHz spaced <b>long-haul</b> optical <b>transport</b> platform LambdaXtreme®. In a straight-line laboratory testbed, we demonstrate single-channel 700 -km transmission, including an intermediate ROADM.

40|$|The {{enabling}} technologies {{and the issues}} of next-generation millimeter-wave wireless access network and 100 G <b>long-haul</b> optical <b>transport</b> network were developed and identified. To develop a simple and cost-effective millimeter-wave optical-wireless system, all-round research on the technical challenges of optical millimeter-wave generation, transmission impairments compensation, and simple base station design were discussed. Several radio-over-fiber systems were designed to simultaneously deliver multi-band wireless services on a single optical infrastructure, enabling converged system control and quality maintenance in central office. For the 100 G optical transport network, the issues related to successful implementations of transmitter, fiber link, and receiver of a 112 -Gb/s polarization-division multiplexing-quadrature phase shift keying (PDM-QPSK) system were comprehensively explored. The experimental results based on the constructed 112 -Gb/s testbed indicated that careful dispersion management can effectively increase nonlinearity tolerance. Furthermore, the special emphasis on the two impairments of the 100 G network with reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers: passband narrowing and in-band crosstalk, was studied. The results demonstrated that these impairments can be readily predicted with proper experimental and simulation efforts.

30|$|Conclusions—for the GLOBAL scenario—are {{that we will}} {{certainly}} see a spatial redistribution of production platforms, however they will not necessarily be located near final markets. In fact, the key variables—in {{a context in which}} transport costs will have a relative impact—will be production and logistics specialization and efficiency. The prevailing model will be a more spatially distributed/diffused one, but it will be based on a rationale of specialization and efficiency. In a word: “one will produce in the more specialized and efficient areas and will (potentially) distribute to major global markets”. Manufacturing and logistics activities will be spatially concentrated in the most efficient and specialized regions and <b>long-haul</b> <b>transport</b> flows will be potentially fostered. Potential global leaders could then emerge in certain areas, thus implying a spatial concentration of innovation processes and of volumes (economies of scale).|$|E

NDMS’s capacity to handle very large mass casualty events, such as those included in the Na-tional Planning Scenarios, is examined. Following Hurricane Katrina, Congress called for a reevaluation of NDMS. In that context, we make three key suggestions to improve NDMS’s capacity to respond to large mass casualty disasters: (1) increase the level of engagement by the private (i. e., nonfederal) healthcare system in preparedness and response efforts; (2) increase the reliance on regional hospital collaborative networks as part of the backbone of the NDMS system; and (3) de-velop additional, alternative patient transportation systems, linked to the overall NDMS patient tracking effort, to de-crease the sole reliance on DoD <b>long-haul</b> air <b>transport</b> in medical evacuation. 319 THE NATIONAL DISASTER MEDICAL SYSTEM (NDMS) isdesignated as the primary federal response mechanism for mass casualty events.

40|$|Projected future {{conditions}} at large urban airports {{were used to}} identify design objectives for a <b>long-haul,</b> advanced <b>transport</b> airplane introduced for operation in the mid- 1980 s. Operating constraints associated with airport congestion and aircraft noise and emissions were of central interest. In addition, some of the interaction of these constraints with aircraft fuel usage were identified. The study allowed for advanced aircraft design features consistent with the future operating period. A baseline 200 passenger airplane design was modified to comply with design requirements imposed by terminal area constraints. Specific design changes included: (1) modification of engine arrangement; wing planform; (2) drag and spoiler surfaces; (3) secondary power systems; (4) brake and landing gear characteristics; and (5) the aircraft avionics. These changes, based on exploratory design estimates and allowing for technology advance, were judged to enable the airplane to: reduce wake turbulence; handle steeper descent paths with fewer limitation due to engine characteristics; reduce runway occupancy times; improve community noise contours; and reduce the total engine emittants deposited in the terminal area. The penalties to airplane performance and operating cost associated with improving the terminal area characteristics of the airplane were assessed. Finally, key research problems requiring solution in order to validate the assumed advanced airplane technology were identified...|$|R
50|$|The rounded {{surface of}} round bales poses a {{challenge}} for <b>long-haul,</b> flat-bed <b>transport,</b> as they could roll off of the flat surface if not properly supported. This is particularly the case with large round bales; their size makes them difficult to flip, so {{it may not be}} feasible to flip many of them onto the flat surface for transport and then re-position them on the round surface at the destination. One option that works with both large and small round bales is to equip the flat-bed trailer with guard-rails at either end, which prevent bales from rolling either forward or backward. Another solution is the saddle wagon, which has closely spaced rounded saddles or support posts in which round bales sit. The tall sides of each saddle prevent the bales from rolling around while on the wagon, as the bale settles down in between posts. On 3 September 2010, on the A381 in Halwell near Totnes, Devon, UK an early member of British rock group ELO Mike Edwards was killed when his van was crushed by a large round bale. The cellist, 62, died instantly when the 600 kg bale fell from a tractor on nearby farmland before rolling onto the road and crushing his van.|$|R

Over the past 50 years, the rail network has contracted while tonnage has increased.

40|$|<b>Long-haul</b> <b>transport</b> along microtubules {{is crucial}} for {{neuronal}} polarity, and transport defects cause neurodegeneration. Tau protein stabilizes microtubule tracks, but in Alzheimer’s disease it aggregates and becomes missorted into the somatodendritic compartment. Tau can inhibit axonal transport byobstructingmotors onmicrotubules, yet tau itself can stillmove into axons. We therefore investigated taumovement by live-cell fluorescencemicroscopy, FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), and FSM (fluorescence speckle microscopy). Tau is highly dynamic, with diffusion coefficients of 3 m 2 /s and microtubule dwell times of 4 s. This facilitates the entryof tau into axonsoverdistances ofmillimeters andperiodsof days. For longerdistances and times, twomechanismsof tau transport are observed. At low near-physiological levels, tau is cotransported with microtubule fragments from cell bodies into axons, moving at instantaneous velocities 1 m/s. At high concentrations, tau forms local accumulations moving bidirectionally at 0. 3 m/s.

40|$|Purpose – To {{present a}} {{decision}} support system (DSS) enabling {{the analysis of the}} cost-effectiveness of direct-shipping <b>long-haul</b> road <b>transport</b> policies, including full truck load (FTL) and less than truck load (LTL) modes, and to select the optimal carrier. Design/methodology/approach – Analytical estimation of transportation costs is provided in a framework including an interactive computer procedure and a dedicated database structure capable of characterizing the logistics system. Findings – Main criticalities of manual logistic planning are: sub-optimal selection of carrier and excessive use of LTL transport, while the optimal FTL vs LTL trade-off is not fully explored in practice. Research limitations/implications – This is an analysis tool of user-defined scenarios and does not provide the automatic synthesis of shipments planning. Admittedly, this model does not attempt to optimize the shipping strategy, but to quantitatively assess the effects of the adopted decisions. Practical implications – Alternative shipping policies can be compared to perform what-if analyses and explore the outcome of alternative decisions (FTL vs LTL shipping modes) even in terms of transportation expenditures. Allows rapid selection of the optimal motor carrier and assesses the extra cost due to a sub-optimal choice. Gives the experienced manager a framework for critical assessment of shipping decisions, suggesting improvement areas for cost reduction. Originality/value – With respect to other software tools for carrier selection provides explicit analysis of extra costs incurred by manual planning, thus becoming a strategic tool for logistic decision making. Furthermore, enables managerial insights to be gained and makes manual planning more effective...|$|R
40|$|Dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (DWDM) {{is becoming}} the technology of choice for meeting the increasing bandwidth demands in optical networks. DWDM {{has been used to}} increase the capacity of <b>long-haul</b> optical <b>transport</b> systems. Efforts are being made to move DWDM into the broadband access network serving residential and business subscribers. First, a new centralized DWDM PON scheme is demonstrated for bi-directional upstream and downstream transmissions. The proposed DWDM PON scheme is implemented using optical carrier suppression and separation (OCSS) technology to generate a wavelength pair from a single laser source at the central office. This method enables the co-location of both upstream and downstream DWDM transmitters in the central office. In addition, the complexity, cost, and maintenance of the optical network unit are reduced by enabling wavelength independent operation. Second, a new multistage architecture is proposed for the delivery of information to groups of subscribers located at different distances from the central office. A 25 GHz DWDM comb is generated using OCSS technology, and error-free transmission of four 10 Gbps channels is demonstrated. Finally, a new wide area access network with bi-directional DWDM amplification using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) is demonstrated. The detrimental effect of SOA crosstalk resulting from cross gain modulation can be suppressed using a constant intensity modulation format such as differential phase shift keying (DPSK). The feasibiity of bi-directional DPSK transmission of 16 interleaved DWDM channels using an in-line SOA has been studied experimentally. In addition, the reduction of bi-directional SOA reflections has been realized by optimizing the SOA bias current and facet reflectivities. Ph. D.
