The tests investigated include parametric tests (F, Score, Likelihood, Asymptotic), <b>logrank</b> <b>tests</b> (Mantel, Peto-Peto), and Wilcoxon-Type tests (Gehan, Prentice). Equal sized samples, n = 18, 16, 32 with 1000 (size) and 500 (power) simulation trials, are compared for 16 combinations of the censoring proportions 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, and 60 %. For n = 8 and 16, the Asymptotic, Peto-Peto, and Wilcoxon tests perform at nominal 5 % size expectations, but the F, Score and Mantel tests exceeded 5 % size confidence limits for 1 / 3 of the censoring combinations. For n = 32, all tests showed proper size, with the Peto-Peto test most conservative {{in the presence of}} unequal censoring. Powers of all tests are compared for exponential hazard ratios of 1. 4 and 2. 0. There is little difference in power characteristics of the tests within the classes of tests considered. The Mantel test showed 90 % to 95 % power efficiency relative to parametric tests. Wilcoxon-type tests have the lowest relative power but are robust to differential censoring patterns. A modified Peto-Peto test shows power comparable to the Mantel test.

To examine whether this association is attributable specifically to disturbance of activity and attention (ADHD) or to psychopathology in general, we wanted to extend existing research by comparing the rate of mid-adulthood working disabilities for individuals diagnosed with ADHD as children with the rate for clinical controls diagnosed with either conduct disorder, emotional disorder or mixed disorder of conduct and emotions. Methods Former Norwegian child-psychiatric in-patients (n = 257) were followed up 17 – 39 years after hospitalization by record linkage to the Norwegian national registry of disability pension (DP) awards. Based on the hospital records, the patients were re-diagnosed according to ICD- 10. Associations between the diagnoses, other baseline factors and subsequent DP were investigated using Kaplan–Meier survival analyses and <b>logrank</b> <b>testing.</b> Results At follow-up, 19 % of the participants had received a DP award. In the <b>logrank</b> <b>testing,</b> ADHD was the only disorder associated with a subsequent DP, with 30 % being disabled at follow-up (p = 0. 01). Low psychosocial functioning (assessed by the Children’s Global Assessment Scale) at admission uniquely predicted future DP (p = 0. 04). Conclusions ADHD in childhood was highly associated with later receiving a DP. Our finding of worse prognosis in ADHD compared with other internalizing and externalizing disorders in mid-adulthood supports the assumption of ADHD being specifically linked to working disability. Assessment of psychosocial functioning in addition to diagnostic features could enhance prediction of children who are most at risk of future disability. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWeighted <b>logrank</b> <b>tests</b> are {{the usual}} tool for {{detecting}} late effects in clinical trials. Weights determine the alternative hypotheses {{against which the}} tests are optimal. Choosing a specific weight is thus a crucial issue in practice. One common weight was introduced in 1982 by Harrington and Fleming. The corresponding test is implemented in standard statistical softwares packages. However, using this test in randomized controlled clinical trials raises two major and still unsolved difficulties. First, the weight depends on a parameter q {{that has to be}} set before collecting the data. Second, the necessary sample size depends on this q. This article addresses these difficulties. We provide the explicit form of the alternative hypothesis under which the Fleming–Harrington test for late effects is optimal in terms of Pitman’s asymptotic relative efficiency. Using simulations, we investigate various aspects of the Fleming–Harrington test for late effects, such as power properties and sensitivity to the value of q. We also investigate the relation between q and the necessary sample size for the Fleming–Harrington test. Based on these results, we propose as a general choice for testing late effects.

Nine hundred and ninety-five premature and term newborns were divided into 3 cohorts, according to the prevalence of cefepime use in the unit: Group 1 (n= 396) comprised patients admitted from January 2002 to December 2003, period in which cefepime was the most used broad-spectrum antibiotic. Patients in Group 2 (n= 349) were admitted when piperacillin/tazobactam replaced cefepime (January to December 2004) and in Group 3 (n= 250) when cefepime was reintroduced (January to September 2005). Meropenem was the alternative third-line antibiotic for all groups.

However, due to inconsistent definitions of response, variable rates of long term response have been reported. Furthermore, new medical treatment options are currently challenging the role of splenectomy. The aims {{of this study were}} to (1) analyze long term response after splenectomy according to recently defined consensus criteria, (2) identify possible predictive response factors. Methods: A case series of 72 consecutive patients with ITP undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy was retrospectively studied using univariate and multivariate analysis as well as <b>logrank</b> <b>tests.</b> Results: Median follow-up was 32 (2 – 110) months. Mortality was 0 % and morbidity was 8. 2 %. Response to splenectomy was achieved in of 63 / 72 patients (87. 5 %). Loss of response occurred in 19 / 63 (30. 2 %) in median after 3 (range 2 – 42) months. Preoperative platelet counts after boosting with steroids and immunoglobulins as well as the postoperative rise in platelet counts were statistically significant factors for response upon both univariate and multivariate analysis, whereas age, gender, body mass index, ASA classification, disease duration, accessory spleens, splenic weight, conversion to open surgery, or perioperative complications were not. Patients with a postoperative rise in platelet counts > 150, 000 /μL had a significant better chance on stable long term response than those with a smaller increment (P <  0. 001).

Clinical records were evaluated for implant failure and in reference to implant length/diameter/location, time from tooth loss to implant placement, bone condition (native/grafted), surgical protocol (two-/one-stage), loading protocol (delayed/early/immediate), type of prosthesis (removable/fixed), surgeon’s experience level (resident/trainee) and specialty (periodontist/oral surgeon). The impact of each covariate on failure was tested using the Fisher’s exact test. Kaplan-Meier survival functions were constructed and Mantel-Cox <b>logrank</b> <b>tests</b> were used to compare survival functions. To correct for possible interaction Cox proportional Hazards regression was adopted. Results: 41 / 1180 (3. 5 %) implants were lost in 34 / 461 (7. 4 %) patients (245 ♀, 216 ♂; mean age 51, range 18 - 90). Factors showing significant impact on failure on the basis of univariate analyses were implant location (p= 0. 015), surgical protocol (p= 0. 002), loading protocol (p= 0. 002), surgeon’s experience level (p= 0. 035) and specialty (p= 0. 001).

There was a significant positive correlation between CS 4 and CS 5 (r =  0. 95, P< 0. 001), CS 4 and CS 4 + (r =  0. 96, P< 0. 001), and CS 4 + and CS 5 (r =  0. 98, P< 0. 001), with the Bland-Altman plot showing an acceptable bias between all endpoints. <b>Logrank</b> <b>tests</b> showed that mice reached CS 4 24 % and 34 % faster than CS 4 + (P =  0. 046) and CS 5 (P =  0. 006), respectively. Adopting CS 4 as endpoint would spare a mouse an average of 4 days (P< 0. 001) from further neuromuscular disability and poor quality of life compared to CS 5. Alternatively, CS 5 provides information regarding proprioception and severe motor neuron death, both could be important parameters in establishing the efficacy of specific treatments. Converging ethics and discovery, would adopting CS 4 as endpoint compromise the acquisition of insight about the effects of interventions in animal models of ALS...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Renal cell cancer (RCC) has an {{incidence}} of 1200 new {{patients in the}} Netherlands each year (12. 5 per 100. 000 inhabitants). Half of these patients ultimately develop metastases and prognosis of this group is poor with a 1 -year survival of 10 %. According to literature, the liver is involved in 20 % of patients with metastatic RCC, however resection is feasible in only a minority (2 - 4 %) of patients due to concomitant widespread disease. Hence, {{little is known about}} outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with resectable liver metastases of RCC. AIM To evaluate outcomes of surgical treatment in patients with hepatic metastases from RCC in the Netherlands and to identify prognostic factors for survival after resection. METHODS Patients were retrieved from local databases of the Netherlands Task Force for Liver Surgery (14 centres) and from the Dutch collective pathology database PALGA. From these national registries, 33 patients were identified who underwent resection n=(32) or local ablation (n= 4) of hepatic metastases of RCC in the Netherlands, between 1990 and 2008. Patient and tumour characteristics, survival and prognostic factors in this specific patient population were analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and <b>logrank</b> <b>tests.</b> RESULTS The overall 1 -, 3 - and 5 -year survival rates were 78. 6 %, 45. 1 %, and 40. 6 %, respectively. Median survival was 26. 6 months. There was no operative mortality and morbidity was 18 %. At a median follow-up interval of 19. 2 (3. 45 - 188. 9) months, 28 patients showed evidence of recurrence with a median time to recurrence of 10 (0. 89 - 54) months. Metachronous metastases (n= 23, p= 0. 04) and radical resection (n= 24, p< 0. 001) were significant prognosticators of long-term survival. Size < 50 mm (n= 18, p= 0. 84), solitary metastases (n= 19, p= 0. 92) and surprisingly, presence of extrahepatic metastases (n= 11, p= 0. 21) showed no significant influence on survival. CONCLUSION The survival rates and low operative morbidity and mortality found in this nation-wide study indicate that surgical treatment of patients with hepatic metastases of RCC can benefit from radical resection with 5 -year survival rate of 40. 6 %. ...|$|R
