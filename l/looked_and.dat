5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E

25|$|The 1928 {{campaign}} {{was the first}} of Thomas's six consecutive campaigns as the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas had considerably greater influence than the typical perennial candidate. Although most upper and middle class Americans viewed socialism as an unsavory form of political thought, the well-educated Thomas—who often wore three-piece suits and <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> talked like a president—gained grudging admiration.|$|E

25|$|By 1981, {{after the}} {{formation}} of the new Human League, Oakey's trademark style of the early 1980s was complete. As well as full make up, Oakey had begun wearing androgynous clothing. The addition of teenage school girls Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall as co-vocalists to the band in 1980 complemented his look. At times, all three would wear the same eyeliner and lipstick. Oakey and Catherall, who were to enter into a relationship with each other, often <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> dressed almost identically.|$|E
25|$|The prophet asked Who came in crimson {{garments}} from Edom, mighty to save, and why God’s apparel was red {{like one}} who trod {{in the wine}} vat.

God <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> found none to help to uphold God’s will, so God trod down the peoples in anger, and poured out their blood.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the century, in keeping with the ides of the Enlightenment, the {{administration}} of Paris, particularly the police, made an effort to improve the way that the city <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> functioned. One example was the sidewalk; in mid-century sidewalks existed in London, but there were none in Paris. The first sidewalk in Paris was begun in 1781, along the new rue du Théâtre Française, now rue de l’Odéon, to protect the spectators going along the street to the new theater. The second sidewalk was begun in 1788 along rue Louvois, where another new theater was planned. The sidewalk was four feet wide (1.2 meters) and 10 to 12 inches (thirty centimeters) high, with a stone border. Before the end of the century, several more sidewalks were installed along new streets in the wealthy neighborhoods around the quarter of la Chaussée d'Antin.|$|E

500|$|After {{recruiting}} Deal, {{the band}} {{tried unsuccessfully to}} get her sister, Kelley Deal, to join as drummer. Kim's husband suggested they hire David Lovering, whom Kim had met at her wedding reception. The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word [...] "pixies" [...] randomly from a dictionary, liking how it <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> its definition as [...] "mischievous little elves". Once the band had settled on a name and line-up, they moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986. They began to play shows at bars {{in and around the}} Boston area.|$|E

500|$|The game's lack {{of variety}} {{in regard to}} weapons and {{ammunition}} was cited by reviewers. According to IGN Vince Ingenito, Alienation {{did not have enough}} weapons and was disappointed that many of the weapons <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> behaved the same way. Destuctoid Jordan Devore wrote that even with upgrades enabled, the game had few weapons available. Matt Miller was frustrated by repeatedly running out of ammunition; although the game's upgrade system was interesting, its lack of ammunition (which he described as being [...] "tediously small ammo clips") hampered enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} of the movie A Bridge Too Far began in 1975, Waddy was given six months leave by Westland to act as chief Military Advisor, an appointment that John Frost thought was ideal.

[...] Waddy confessed to being deeply concerned by the actors' quality at first, but was able to turn them into men who <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> acted the part.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, Grant was an {{appointed}} {{director of}} MGM. In 1980, {{he sat on}} the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company.

When Allan Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed how tired Grant <b>looked,</b> <b>and</b> his [...] "slightly melancholic air". Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California), and Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987).|$|E
50|$|Apple Computer was {{notable for}} its {{use of the term}} <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel in {{reference}} to their Mac OS operating system.

50|$|Swing is a {{graphical}} {{user interface}} library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel through the pluggable <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel for macOS. Where prior implementations of these <b>looks</b> <b>and</b> feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.|$|R
500|$|The {{next day}} Reitell {{invited him to}} her apartment, but he declined. They went sight-seeing, but Thomas felt unwell and retired to his bed {{for the rest of}} the afternoon. Reitell gave him half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of phenobarbitone to help him sleep and spent the night at the hotel with him. Two days later, on 23 October, Herb Hannum, a friend from an earlier trip, noticed how sick Thomas <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> {{suggested}} an appointment with Feltenstein before the performances of Under Milk Wood that evening. Feltenstein administered injections and Thomas made it through the two performances, but collapsed immediately afterwards. Reitell later said that Feltenstein was [...] "rather a wild doctor who thought injections would cure anything".|$|E
500|$|According to {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine, {{the album}} title refers to stereotypical rock stars. When {{asked about the}} matter, and an earlier comment about Axl Rose having killed the traditional rock star image, Mustaine explained that [...] "People want heroes. Most bands look like average Joes, wearing gas-station shirts, have funky hair-dos and I think people wanna {{be able to go}} 'they may not be popular, but they're MY band.'" [...] Mustaine {{went on to say that}} many of contemporary rock music groups <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> sounded the same, and that the music industry needed a hero. He then proceeded to contrast a perceived lack of image of then current music scenes with the image of 1980s metal bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{style of}} VVVVVV is heavily {{inspired}} by games released for the Commodore 64 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially Jet Set Willy which is referenced by {{the element of}} collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game [...] "that <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> felt like the C64 games I grew up with." [...] He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, who created every room name in the final version. The graphical style of VVVVVV is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on chiptune elements. Swedish composer Magnus Pålsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled PPPPPP.|$|E
50|$|Swing allows an {{application}} to specialize the <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel of widgets by modifying the default (via runtime parameters), deriving from an existing one, by creating one from scratch, or, beginning with J2SE 5.0, {{by using the}} skinnable synth <b>look</b> <b>and</b> feel, which is configured with an XML property file.

It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.|$|R
500|$|Harisu {{was born}} Lee Kyung-yeop in Seongnam, Korea, {{and is one}} of five children. Although {{assigned}} male at birth, she identified as female from an early age, recalling, [...] "I was always a girl who loved playing with dolls." [...] This did not go unnoticed by her family or school friends, who often remarked that she <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> acted like a girl. A failed relationship with a boy during her teenage years convinced Harisu of the need to change her sex, and by the time she graduated from the all-boys Naksaeng High School, she was already undergoing hormone replacement therapy. It was for this reason that she was exempted from the military service usually required of males in the Republic of Korea, being rejected on the grounds of [...] "mental illness". By the end of the 1990s, Harisu had undergone breast augmentation, sex reassignment surgery, rhinoplasty, and increase of hips, having had surgery performed in Korea and Japan.|$|E
500|$|The game's art {{style was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. Summarizing that the [...] "distinct art style and atmosphere set a cool vibe," [...] GameSpot's Nathan Meunier commended {{the atmosphere and}} visual design. Marty Sliva of IGN claimed an [...] "immense appreciation for the paper-cutout graphical style and whimsical presentation", going on to praise the threatening qualities bestowed upon mundane objects by the [...] "gothic-inspired look." [...] Game Informer writer Jeff Marchiafava stated that [...] "the cartoony art style makes exploring your massive, randomized world a joy." [...] Writing for the newspaper Toronto Sun, Steve Tilley called the art [...] "whimsical and wonderful" [...] and the presentation in general [...] "captivating." [...] Reviewing the PlayStation 4 version specifically, Jordan Devore of Destructoid said that it <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> played very well on the console, though he did note some pixelation effects when the screen zooms in on the inventory. He {{also found that the}} gamepad controls, while less efficient than a keyboard, were similarly enjoyable.|$|E
500|$|The {{titles of}} games {{have also been}} altered. The banner title for Persona was changed from Megami Ibunroku to Revelations, principally because the team thought the latter title sounded [...] "cool". The Revelations title was removed for Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment. After the {{successful}} release of Nocturne, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker {{was added to the}} series title to help with Western marketing. This has not been the case for some titles: Persona 4 Arenas original title, Persona 4: The Ultimate in Mayonaka Arena, was shortened as it sounded awkward, and the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker was dropped as it would have made the title too long. The same change was made for Persona 4 Golden, with the team also dropping [...] "The" [...] that was in the Japanese title because it would have <b>looked</b> <b>and</b> sounded odd in Western territories. Persona 5 was also released in the West without the moniker.|$|E
