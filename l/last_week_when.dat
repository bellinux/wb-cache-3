2500|$|After Sepp Blatter's sudden {{departure}} at Fifa on 2 June 2015, when Blatter {{claimed he}} was resigning for honourable reasons and to allow Fifa to move on, Dyke said," [...] I don't believe a word of this. [...] If he believes that, why not step down <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> we asked him to? [...] He was cock-a-hoop {{when he won the}} election and terribly arrogant. [...] Clearly there is a smoking gun. [...] This is nothing to do with Mr Blatter being honourable; he hasn't been honourable for years".|$|E
2500|$|I {{never even}} heard his name till <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> he made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, {{says he has a}} doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is {{interesting}} are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E
2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>when</b> attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; are you getting... brittle?" ...|$|E

50|$|On 17 July 1831, Lady Niohuru {{gave birth}} to the Daoguang Emperor's fourth son, Yizhu.

50|$|Throughout {{the general}} election, McCain {{consistently}} won the state's pre-election polls, even reaching above 50% {{in some of}} them.

2500|$|During the winter, Cepeda {{returned}} to the LBPPR, where he suffered a knee injury while training. In 1963, he played the entire MLB season with the injury, not informing the Giants {{out of concern for}} his spot in the roster. He was in constant pain, but was in the race for a batting title along with Roberto Clemente, Dick Groat and Tommy Davis, eventually finishing fifth. His batting average was [...]316, with 34 home runs and 97 RBIs. In 1964, San Francisco remained in the pennant race until the <b>last</b> <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> the St Louis Cardinals defeated the New York Mets to secure it. Cepeda led the team in batting average with [...]304 and a slugging percentage of [...]539. Cepeda attended the 1965 spring training, having limited participation. One of his friends, who was from Mexico brought in a jar with alcohol and cannabis to reduce the pain, noting that it was an [...] "old Mexican remedy". Noticing this a club house employee offered to bring him a cannabis [...] "joint", which he accepted. After this event, he consumed the drug regularly in order to [...] "relax". After experiencing swelling in the knee during the first games of the season, a group of doctors at recommended him to stop playing, however, Cepeda refused to do so since baseball was his main source of income. He received treatment from Gene Sollovief, a Russian doctor who implemented a weight and exercise regime. He {{returned to}} action, but only had 34 at-bats with an average of [...]176 and only three home runs. He returned to Puerto Rico undergoing further physical therapy. In the off-season Cepeda also brought a house in Diamond Heights while his wife was pregnant with his first son, Orlando, Jr. After recovering from the injury he attended 1966 spring training, however he wasn't placed in the team's starting lineup. In the middle of a series Cepeda was informed that he had been traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for pitcher Ray Sadecki.|$|E

60|$|Laura Waynefleet's {{face was}} very quiet, {{and he sat}} silent a moment or two, {{wondering}} somewhat uneasily what she was thinking.

Here they were on more of an equal footing", and concluded: [...] "This might be featherlight fare but sometimes handsomely produced historical fun is just the ticket for a Sunday night - see also Downton Abbey. Partners in Crime’s impressive ratings (6.5 million <b>last</b> <b>week)</b> suggest it will tide plenty of us over until Downton’s return this autumn. Jolly good show".|$|R

This version was heard during the show's opening for six more seasons. Like the previous version, this arrangement also had an instrumental version that closed every episode, and would {{continue to do so}} until season 38, outlasting the vocal version. Also during season 24, the harmonica music used {{at the beginning and end}} of each episode still remained throughout most of the season until the <b>last</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>when</b> the harmonica music was changed to calypso, accompanied by a piccolo and ukulele.|$|R
