We assessed impacts of each strategy on biodiversity, agricultural production, and other ecosystem service benefits at a landscape scale. We examined whether it was possible to achieve predetermined targets that reflect the aspirations and entitlements of diverse stakeholder groups.

40|$|Abstract. Human {{activities}} are causing a biodiversity crisis in all biomes of the Earth. As the world's population continues to grow, more land will {{be converted to}} agricultural land to meet the growing food demands, especially in the tropics where we find the most species rich habitats in the world. Many of these species and ecosystems provide valuable services to the humans living here. To best protect species richness and the people dependent on rural livelihoods in the tropics, two types of managed agricultural landscapes have been suggested: land sparing and <b>land</b> <b>sharing.</b> <b>Land</b> sparing promotes high yield agriculture {{in order to have}} as large an area as possible protected, while <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> is farming a more extensive area of the landscape, but is able to retain more species and ecosystem services by using agricultural methods such as agroforestry. The potential for conservation and retaining ecosystem services in a <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> or a <b>land</b> sparing type landscape in Uganda is addressed using data about insectivorous bats recorded with Anabat detectors in habitats from sugarcane, home garden and forest in and around Budongo forest, Uganda. Species richness, diversity, activity and species composition were determined for all habitats and used to give a picture of the conservation value of the different habitat types. As found in other studies both agricultural landscape types have a higher species richness and diversity than the forest habitat. But the higher activity and number of species related to the forest gives the home garden landscape better potential for conservation of microbats. Scattered trees and distance to the forest in the sugarcane landscape type does not add any conservation value compared to the sugarcane habitat. This study helps to demonstrate the value of <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> type agriculture for conserving species richness and retaining ecosystem services...|$|R

Upon hearing of this, Caesar suggests playing a practical joke, in which Tremensdelirius is awarded a Gaulish village in Armorica. A few days later, Tremensdelirius is drunk again and, unable to pay the innkeeper, offers his <b>land</b> <b>share.</b> Having agreed, innkeeper Orthopaedix, his wife Angina, and their daughter Influenza emigrate to the village and request a meeting with Chieftain Vitalstatistix to state their claim; but Vitalstatistix and the whole village dismiss their claim as absurd. When Angina berates her husband for selling their inn to travel to Armorica, Vitalstatistix offers Orthopaedix a building next to the fish-stall for his use as a tavern. Obelix helps the new family and soon becomes enamored of Influenza. On the opening night of the new inn, the merriment is spoiled when Vitalstatistix's wife Impedimenta quarrels with Angina over the ownership of the village and a comment about the smell of fish starts a fight. In the morning, Orthopaedix offers to quit the village and return to his wife's relatives in Lutetia; but Angina, for revenge on Impedimenta, makes a claim to the leadership of the village on behalf of her husband. Vitalstatistix has Cacofonix obtain an opinion poll of the villagers and the results are disappointing for Vitalstatistix. Soon both candidates and their families search for supporters by offering insincere support to the individual concerns of each villager. Geriatrix originally supports Vitalstatistix due to his distrust of Orthopaedix, but later tries to stand for Chief himself, and Asterix becomes worried that internal conflict could benefit the Romans. Meanwhile, Tremensdelirius arrives at the village to visit Orthopaedix and claim his <b>land</b> <b>share,</b> on grounds that all his later attempts at trade and piracy have failed. When Angina refuses, he threatens the family by drawing his sword; but is overcome by Asterix in a contest of swordsmanship. Thereafter Tremensdelirius seeks allies at a neighboring Roman legionary camp and finds his old friend Egganlettus re-enlisted as an aide-de-camp under the local centurion. With his support, Tremensdelirius makes an official request on the centurion to restore the <b>land</b> <b>share.</b> The centurion is reluctant to face the Gauls; but when the veterans threaten to report him to Caesar, he agrees to plan an attack based on siege engines, but demotes Egganlettus to the ranks.|$|E

40|$|Policy {{makers and}} housing rights {{professionals}} worldwide {{are interested in}} “land sharing ” {{as an instrument of}} slum improvement and secure tenure provision in urban areas. The technique involves partitioning a piece of land so that it can accommodate land occupants on one portion of the site, and landowners or commercial development on the other portion, thereby solving a land dispute through compromise instead of through force. The net result of <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> is that residents of informal settlements obtain the legal right to stay in the city, in new housing and on land they have occupied (often for a long time) instead of being evicted. At the same time, private development can also proceed. Several <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> schemes are currently underway in the capital city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, as pilot projects of a large-scale slum upgrading program. The results so far are mixed: a <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> agreement has been signed in the largest of the four settlements, where residents will be re-housed on site to ten, 6 -storey apartment blocks, to be built by a private developer in return for the developer’s right to develop on a portion {{of the rest of the}} site.

40|$|There is {{a lively}} debate on whether {{biodiversity}} conservation and agricultural production {{could be better}} reconciled by land sparing (strictly separating production fields and conservation areas) or by <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> (combining both, agricultural production and biodiversity conservation on the same land). The debate originates from tropical countries, where agricultural land use continues to increase {{at the expense of}} natural ecosystems. But is it also relevant for Europe, where agriculture is withdrawing from marginal regions whilst farming of fertile lands continues to be intensified? Based on recent research on farmland biodiversity we conclude that the <b>land</b> <b>sharing</b> – <b>land</b> sparing dichotomy is too simplistic for Europe. Instead we differentiate between productive and marginal farmland. On productive farmland, semi-natural habitats are required to yield ecosystem services relevant for agriculture, to promote endangered farmland species which society wants to conserve even in intensively farmed regions, and to allow migration of non-farmland species through the agricultural matrix. On marginal farmland, high-nature value farming is a traditional way of <b>land</b> <b>sharing,</b> yielding high quality agricultural products and conserving specialized species. To conserve highly disturbance-sensitive species, {{there is a need for}} nature reserves. In conclusion, land sparing is not a viable olution for Europe in both productive and marginal farmland but because of different reasons in each type of farmland...|$|R
