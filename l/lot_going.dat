Houston Press writer Shea Serrano describes the album as a [...] "new {{take on the}} traditional Southern rap sound. It's slow and fast, wonky and flimsy, lyrical and hook-driven". Tom Breihan of Pitchfork Media perceives [...] "1980s synth-funk" [...] as its predominant musical element, but also finds each track musically varied, stating [...] "New melodic elements flit {{in and out of}} tracks just as you start to notice them, and there's a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on at any given moment".

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review {{and gave it}} a B- rating. He wrote, [...] "The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie how to eat a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could have spent more time with Nellie learning how to eat a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on.

500|$|On August 26, 2014, Opeth {{released}} its eleventh studio album, titled Pale Communion. Åkerfeldt {{began working on}} new material {{as far back as}} August 2012. In January 2014 he stated, [...] "We've been looking at [...] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past." [...] Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase, when asked if it will it be heavier or softer than Heritage, Åkerfeldt said, [...] "Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs." [...] Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation, something that he became interested in doing when working on Storm Corrosion. The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating Heritage which resulted in closer relationships between them.|$|E

King's Lynn were moved into the Southern Premier League for the 201516 campaign and Bridges continued to feature regularly in the Linnets midfield during the campaign, making 39 appearances in all competitions. Bridges retired from playing in May 2016 to [...] "concentrate on his successful business ventures and spend time with his family".

Codeine have hit upon a formula so pure and righteous it would be tragic for them to deviate from it." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a mixed review, explaining that [...] "There's not a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on here, but songs such as [...] "Realize" [...] and [...] "Hard to Find" [...] are hardly nothing." [...] and that tracks such as [...] "W." [...] allow Codeine to achieve [...] "both earthly aggression and unearthly calm." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin, reviewed the single [...] "Realize", stating that the song [...] "inches along as if Codeine's still wondering whether it's worth the effort". The b-side [...] "Broken-hearted Wine" [...] was described as a song that [...] "coolly walks a delicate line between delibitating sadness and cartoon regret." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Hilary Rothing from UGO Networks enjoyed the perceived parallels to The Wire and praised the further development of Anna Torv's character Olivia; [...] "With tonight's premiere, the writing feels tighter, the pace is fast {{but not so much}} so that the story begins to trip over itself - and if that's any indication of how the rest of the season shapes up, then Fox will have my full attention every Thursday from 9-10pm". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode an A-, writing that he enjoyed how the writers made the show [...] "new-viewer-friendly without making existing fans too impatient". After receiving a DVD copy of the premiere in advance, IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.0/10, explaining [...] "Everything that made season one special is still here: Walter's still crazy and obsessed with food, Peter's still a smart-ass, and Olivia...well, there's a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on with Olivia, as usual". Isler thought newcomer Meghan Markle was [...] "cute, and spunky, but... not quite a good fit here", and praised the cliffhanger as [...] "surprising in a special way". MTV's Josh Wigler praised all the main actors' performances, and thought the episode gave the second season a [...] "strong start".|$|E

[...] There's an awful <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on in the busy dance track [...] but the trade-off chorus between Madge and Justin of 'We've only got four minutes to save the world' is hooky enough unto itself to sell the song." [...] He added that the song [...] "qualifies as an event record between superpowers [...] who not only share equal billing, but sound gangbusters together." [...] Mark Savage of BBC described the sound as [...] "so futuristic it could realistically have been beamed in {{from the end of}} the world." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent called [...] "4 Minutes" [...] one of Hard Candys saviors.

Of the three segments, Jacobson found [...] "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] to be the weakest. He wrote [...] " [...] other than a good ending, it simply doesn’t have a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> for it" [...] and added that it is the most dated of the three. He continued, [...] "'Diddily' offers a fun horror spoof, and 'Xena' is a terrific superhero bit with plenty of cleverness." [...] DVD Talk's Ian Jane gave the episode a positive review as well. Considering it to be one of the season's best episodes, Jane wrote [...] "This one, like so many that have come before and since, is a great blend of horror movie parody and Halloween themed fun in Springfield." [...] In 2007, Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal included [...] "Desperately Xeeking Xena" [...] in a list called [...] "The Ten Best Treehouse of Horror Vignettes". Although he disliked Bart and Lisa's part in the segment, Patrick wrote that it [...] "earns its stripes by being perhaps Comic Book Guy's finest hour". He also praised the segment's references, as well as Lawless' line [...] "A wizard did it", a phrase used to explain continuity errors. In 2009, The Collector's marriage proposal to Lawless was included in [...] "Line-O-Rama: Comic Book Guy", a compilation of what IGN considers to be The Comic Book Guy's best lines.|$|E

500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray {{gave the}} second part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was [...] "the {{difficult}} middle chapter {{of the first half of}} this crossover" [...] and that [...] "the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold." [...] He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a Justice League issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in Justice League 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the [...] "heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made [...] "Trinity War" [...] feel less like the big event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil," [...] but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the Justice League of America series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a <b>lot</b> <b>going</b> on, and nothing really moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein.|$|E
