50|$|In 2001, after Joaquín Guzmán Loera 'El Chapo' {{escaped from}} prison, many Juárez Cartel members {{defected}} to Guzmán Loera's Sinaloa Cartel. In 2004, Vicente's brother was killed, allegedly {{by order of}} Guzmán Loera. Carrillo Fuentes retaliated by assassinating Guzmán's brother in prison. This ignited a turf war between the two cartels, which was more or <b>less</b> put <b>on</b> <b>hold</b> from 2005 to 2006 because of the Sinaloa Cartel's war against the Gulf Cartel.|$|R
30|$|We {{used the}} typical fluid and rock {{properties}} of Bakken {{to build a}} model for that well. Different scenarios have been run until the best match obtained between the well model and the pilot test as shown in Fig.  19. Everything was identical between the model results and pilot test results which are shown in Fig.  19. However, {{there is only one}} difference. This difference is that the oil production came quickly after the soaking period in the pilot test; however, it takes longer time in the model case. We believe this is happening due to the reported conformance problems in these pilots where CO 2 produced in the offset wells. Furthermore, we believe that the conformance problems which were happening in those pilots are due to injection-induced fractures (Alfarge et al. 2017). Therefore, the produced-back CO 2 volumes in the production well were small which resulted in <b>less</b> <b>hold</b> up effect <b>on</b> produced oil. However, in our model, we have not induced injection fractures. Therefore, CO 2 in large volumes produced back during the puff process of our model.|$|R
60|$|The taper {{gave out}} so feeble a ray {{that it was}} with the {{greatest}} difficulty I could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which I now found myself. By degrees, however, my eyes became accustomed to the gloom, and I proceeded with <b>less</b> trouble, <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> to the skirts of my friend's coat. He brought me, at length, after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages, to an iron-bound box, such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware. It was nearly four feet high, and full six long, but very narrow. Two large empty oil-casks lay on the top of it, and above these, again, a vast quantity of straw matting, piled up as high as the floor of the cabin. In every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible, even up to the ceiling, a complete chaos of almost every species of ship-furniture, together with a heterogeneous medley of crates, hampers, barrels, and bales, so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box. I afterward found that Augustus had purposely arranged the stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment, having had only one assistant in the labour, a man not going out in the brig.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of corporate cash holdings in Chinese market. After examining a panel data set obtained from 207 Chinese listed companies over the period 2004 to 2015, we find evidence that firms paying dividends prefer to accumulate more cash. At the same time, larger firms, firms with larger net working capital, firms with greater capital expenditures and firms with higher level of leverage tend to <b>hold</b> <b>less</b> cash. <b>On</b> the other hand, the relationship between cash holdings and growth opportunities is ambiguous, so does the relationship between cash holdings and cash flow. Our findings are generally {{in support of the}} trade-off theory. Both transaction and precautionary motives play important roles in explaining {{the determinants of}} cash holdings for Chinese listed companies...|$|R
5000|$|With the Elizabethan English conquest, the Cromwellian {{conquest of}} Ireland, and the {{organised}} plantations of English and Scottish settlers, {{the patterns of}} land ownership in Ireland were altered greatly. The old order of transhumance and open range cattle breeding died out {{to be replaced by}} a structure of great landed estates, small tenant farmers with more or <b>less</b> precarious <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> their leases, and a mass of landless labourers. This situation continued up to the end of the 19th century, when the agitation of the Land League began to bring about land reform. In this process of reform, the former tenants and labourers became land owners, with the great estates being broken up into small- and medium-sized farms and smallholdings. The process continued well into the 20th century with the work of the Irish Land Commission. This contrasted with Britain, where many of the big estates were left intact. One consequence of this is the widely recognised cultural phenomenon of [...] "land hunger" [...] amongst the new class of Irish farmer. In general, this means that farming families will do almost anything to retain land ownership within the family unit, with the greatest ambition possible being the acquisition of additional land. Another is that hillwalkers in Ireland today are more constrained than their counterparts in Britain, as it is more difficult to agree rights of way with so many small farmers involved on a given route, rather than with just one landowner.|$|R
30|$|With {{the only}} {{exception}} of the UK, all other Member States apply lower tax levels on diesel fuel. However, due {{to the need for}} unanimous agreement in the Council of Ministers, a fiscal alignment remained highly unlikely. The European Commission can only encourage Member States to align fuel taxes according to their CO 2 content. Some countries however resisted such recommendations and have kept tax rates low in order to attract fiscal revenue by so-called ‘fuel tourism’ of road hauliers[112]. In addition, the European Parliament had rejected the proposal on grounds that a higher taxation of Diesel fuel would have significant repercussions on the automobile industry which possessed a competitive advantage in this technology (report from Piia-Noora Kauppi, A 5 - 0383 / 2003, German text). The Green Group in the European Parliament[113] was the only group to support, in principle, the Commission's proposal. We believe that ACEA felt confident to continue counting on low diesel fuel taxes even the association had <b>less</b> of a <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> those non-car-related taxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} methods of buttermaking that would yield a uniform product of good keeping quality {{led to the}} {{introduction}} of cream pasteurization and the ripening of the treated cream with selected cultures of bacteria. At about the time this procedure was developed, evidence began to accumulate which indicated that salted butter made from sweet cream deteriorated <b>less</b> <b>on</b> <b>holding</b> than salted butter made from ripened cream and, eventually, the influence of acid on certain types of chemical deterioration in butter was definitely established. The conflict between a high acidity in the cream and good keeping quality in the resulting butter has necessitated drastic changes in the methods of using butter culture in the manufacture of salted butter. Over the years, in an attempt to avoid certain types of deterioration in the butter, there has been a gradual lowering of the cream acidity at churning. Most butter plants in the United States now use a relatively low acidity in the cream. The general procedure is to hold the mixture of cream and butter culture at a low temperature in order to avoid significant increases in acidity...|$|R

50|$|This formula {{actually}} {{reflects the}} relation of the gravitational effects on the smaller body from the larger body and from the Sun. The tug-of-war figure for Saturn's moon Titan is 380, which means that Saturn's <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> Titan is 380 times as strong as the Sun's <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> Titan.
