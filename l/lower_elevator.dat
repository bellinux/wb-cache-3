50|$|The hull became slender {{towards the}} rear and curved upwards to support a biplane, {{constant}} chord horizontal tail with balanced elevators on its upper and lower planes. The <b>lower</b> <b>elevator</b> was in two parts with a central V-shaped cut-out. Between the planes were three fins, each carrying a rudder; the outer pair were trapezoidal in shape to allow elevator movement but the central one was rounded and deeper, moving in the elevator cut-out.|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} {{fuselage}} curved up to a low, curved step which supported a biplane, constant chord horizontal tail with balanced elevators on its upper and lower planes. The <b>lower</b> <b>elevator</b> was in two parts with a central V-shaped cut-out. Between the planes there was a central fin which carried a rounded rudder that reached down to the keel {{and worked in the}} elevator gap, together with two mid-span, finless rudders, which were approximately trapezoidal in shape to allow elevator movement.|$|E
50|$|Desperate, George {{suggests}} dismembering Jane's body {{to separate}} {{her from the}} bomb and throw it down the shaft. When he loses his nerve, an angry Henry takes over and promises each person $1 million if they survive. While {{they are trying to}} tear the bomb off, a security guard on the intercom tells them that the bomb squad is there and <b>lowering</b> the <b>elevator.</b> They open the doors, make a small opening, and help all but Martin escape. When only Martin is left, he knows that the opening is not big enough for him to fit through. George desperately orders the SWAT members to raise the elevator to rescue Martin. As they <b>lower</b> the <b>elevator</b> to the basement to get him out there, Martin weeps, knowing his death is imminent. Before the bomb explodes, he regains his composure and realizes he is the hero, as he helped everybody survive.|$|R

50|$|The {{empennage}} was conventional, with {{a straight}} edged, blunt topped fin and rudder. The tailplane, semi-elliptical in plan, was mounted halfway up the fin, braced on each side {{with a pair of}} struts from the <b>lower</b> fuselage.

50|$|By March 2016, {{the project}} was at 90% design and {{expected}} to reach 100% design by mid-2016, {{when it would be}} advertised for bidding. Construction was to begin in late 2016 and last through 2018. In December 2016, the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board approved a $1.6 million expansion of the project scope to include reconstruction of the <b>lower</b> busway, <b>elevator</b> replacements, additional station entrances, and other accessibility improvements. Bidding took place in May and June 2017; on June 26, the Board approved a $19.667 million construction contract (lower than the $22 million projected cost). Construction is expected to last from 2017 to 2019.|$|R

5000|$|In {{hydraulic}} elevator systems, {{emergency power}} will <b>lower</b> the <b>elevators</b> {{to the lowest}} landing and open the doors to allow passengers to exit. The doors then close after an adjustable time period and the car remains unusable until reset, usually by cycling the elevator main power switch. Typically, due to the high current draw when starting the pump motor, hydraulic elevators are not run using standard emergency power systems. Buildings like hospitals and nursing homes usually size their emergency generators to accommodate this draw. However, {{the increasing use of}} current-limiting motor starters, commonly known as [...] "soft-start" [...] contactors, avoid much of this problem, and the current draw of the pump motor is less of a limiting concern.|$|R

2500|$|Fulmars from Illustrious {{shot down}} an Italian {{aircraft}} shadowing Force A at 0930. Valiant avoided torpedoes launched by two SM.79s approaching {{under the radar}} horizon at 1230. [...] As the combat air patrol Fulmars dropped altitude to engage the SM.79s, Force A was attacked at 1235 by 18 He111s of KG 26 and 43 Ju87s of StG 1 and StG 2 escorted by 10 Bf110s of ZG 26. [...] Illustrious completed launching Fulmar and Swordfish patrol aircraft as the attack developed. Illustrious was the main target and was enveloped in waterspouts and mist of exploding bombs. Some bombers diving from an altitude of 12,000 feet delayed bomb release until they pulled-out lower than the height of Illustrious funnel. The five air patrol Fulmars had not returned from chasing the SM.79s which attacked Valiant and the four recently launched Fulmars were unable to gain altitude rapidly enough {{to break up the}} attack. The Fulmars claimed eight enemy aircraft during the bombing of Force A as they shuttled to Malta airfields to refuel and re-arm. [...] Warspite was lightly damaged by a bomb. [...] Illustrious was hit by five bombs, including one which failed to explode and a near miss disabled her rudder mechanism. A bomb striking a <b>lowered</b> <b>elevator</b> caused extensive hangar damage, with many casualties among aircraft maintenance personnel and destroyed nine Swordfish and five Fulmars. At 1530 Illustrious headed for Malta steering with engines. The bombing attacks continued. Seven SM.79s were discouraged by heavy anti-aircraft fire but an attack by six Italian Ju87s at 1600 scored another bomb hit and two near misses. Fourteen German Ju87s missed Valiant and Janus and a later attack by 14 He111s was similarly ineffective. Illustrious reached Malta at 2130 with 126 dead and 91 wounded.|$|R

5000|$|The Ca.125's {{fuselage}} was rounded {{in cross-section}} and tapered gradually to the tail. The tail surfaces were conventional, with the tailplane mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage and braced to the <b>lower</b> longerons. The <b>elevators</b> were separate so that the rounded rudder could extend {{to the base of the}} fuselage and move between them. The fin was almost triangular. The fixed undercarriage was conventional, with mainwheels in spats mounted on V-form struts fixed to the fuselage sides just forward of the wing leading edge. Half-axles joined the wheels to the central fuselage underside. A Ca.125 idro version was also flown, its wheels replaced by a pair of duralumin floats, attached by struts to the lower fuselage ...|$|R
50|$|At Oscarsborg the torpedo {{battery is}} a {{concrete}} construction inside a cave mined {{into the rock}} of the North Kaholmen island. Two torpedoes are loaded side by side, in two open steel frames. Then {{one of the two}} frames is <b>lowered</b> like an <b>elevator</b> down into the water to the tunnels below. After one shot, it took some time to swap frames and be ready for the next. When fired, the torpedo's own compressed air engine was started and it propelled itself. The battery has three torpedo tunnels which could fire six torpedoes without reloading and a total of nine torpedoes was stored and ready for use. Each weapon carried a 100 kg TNT warhead and targets were spotted from three observation bunkers just above the battery.|$|R
50|$|Mills are {{designed}} {{in different types}} of configurations, with the most basic being a two-high non-reversing, which means there are two rolls that only turn in one direction. The two-high reversing mill has rolls that can rotate in both directions, but the disadvantage is that the rolls must be stopped, reversed, and then brought back up to rolling speed between each pass. To resolve this, the three-high mill was invented, which uses three rolls that rotate in one direction; the metal is fed through two of the rolls and then returned through the other pair. The disadvantage to this system is the workpiece must be lifted and <b>lowered</b> using an <b>elevator.</b> All of these mills are usually used for primary rolling and the roll diameters range from 60 to 140 cm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A brake is {{a device}} {{by means of}} which {{artificial}} frictional resistance is applied to a moving member, in order to retard or stop the motion of a machine. In the process of performing this function, the brake absorbs either kinematic energy of moving member or potential energy given up by objects <b>lowered</b> by hoists, <b>elevators</b> etc. An emergency brake is a backup braking system designed to function even when there is total brake failure. It works through purely mechanical means, and is independent of the hydraulic system which controls the brakes normally. In addition to being used in emergency situations, an emergency brake is also used as a parking brake, to prevent the car from rolling away, should it slip into gear. Like {{all parts of the}} braking system, the emergency brake should be checked regularly to ensure that it is in good working order...|$|R
50|$|It has {{constant}} chord wings built around two wooden spars with fibreglass ribs and synthetic fabric covering. They are braced {{from the lower}} fuselage with V-struts on each side, assisted by further intermediate bracing. Three position (0°, 10° and 40°) flaps are fitted. The square sided fuselage has a stainless steel truss structure and is fabric covered apart from the glass fibre engine cowling and cabin roof. The two upward hinged cabin doors are entirely transparent blisters for optimum visibility. The empennage is formed from steel tubes with fibreglass ribs, all fabric covered. The tailplane is wire braced from above to the fin {{with a pair of}} wires on each side and similarly below to the <b>lower</b> fuselage. The <b>elevators</b> are mass balanced and the port side one has a trim tab. The rudder also has a tab. Wings and tailplane can be easily folded for transport.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} {{the technique of}} stereolithographic biomodelling and its application to a patient who was treated using orbital brachytherapy. Methods and Materials: The process uses a moving laser beam, directed by a computer, to draw cross-sections of the model {{onto the surface of}} photo-curable liquid plastic. Using a stereolithographic apparatus (SLA), solid or surface data is sliced by software into very thin cross-sections. A helium cadmium (HeCd) laser then generates a small intense spot of ultraviolet (UV) light that is moved across the top of a vat of liquid photo monomer by a computerised optical scanning system. The laser polymerises the liquid into a solid where it touches, precisely printing each cross-section. A vertical <b>elevator</b> <b>lowers</b> the newly formed layer, and a recoating and levelling system establishes the next layer 2 ̆ 7 s thickness. Successive cross-sections (0. 25 mm thick), each one adhering to the one below, are built {{one on top of the}} other, to form the part from the bottom up. The biomodel allowed the implant to be planned in detail prior to the surgery, The accurate placement of brachytherapy catheters was assured, and the dosimetry could be determined and optimised prior to the definitive procedure. Conclusions: Stereolithography is a useful technique in the area of orbital brachytherapy, It allows the implant to to be carried out with greater accuracy and confidence. For the patient, it minimises the risk to the eye and provides them with a greater understanding of the procedure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
