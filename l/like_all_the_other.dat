5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development and acceptance of plate tectonics. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also realised that <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> land birds of the Tristan Archipelago, it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium is {{the third}} member of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides cerium to its left and neodymium to its right, and above the actinide protactinium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{comparable to that of}} silver. Its 59 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f36s2; theoretically, all five outer electrons can act as valence electrons, but the use of all five requires extreme conditions and normally, praseodymium only gives up three or sometimes four electrons in its compounds. Praseodymium is the first of the lanthanides to have an electron configuration conforming to the Aufbau principle, which predicts the 4f orbitals to have a lower energy level than the 5d orbitals; this does not hold for lanthanum and cerium, because the sudden contraction of the 4f orbitals does not happen until after lanthanum, and is not strong enough at cerium to avoid occupying the 5d subshell. Nevertheless, solid praseodymium takes on the 4f25d16s2 configuration, with one electron in the 5d subshell <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> trivalent lanthanides (all but europium and ytterbium, which are divalent in the metallic state).|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900 s the Everett Mills, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Lawrence mills were staffed mainly with European {{immigrants}} who were underpaid and overworked. When a {{law was passed}} in Massachusetts reducing {{the maximum number of}} hours that could be worked weekly by women and children, the mill owners reduced their workers’ pay accordingly and the Bread and Roses strike of 1912 erupted. Believing that a workforce of women and ethnically self-segregated immigrants living paycheck to paycheck could never band together to achieve a common goal, the mill owners were proved wrong with the strike that shut down the mills for two months in the dead of winter. Originating with female Polish weavers at the Everett Mills who revolted upon receiving pay reduced by thirty-two cents, soon 20,000 millworkers were on strike. Helped by the Industrial Workers of the World labor union who organized meetings with representatives from all affected ethnic communities, fundraisers to support the millworkers while they were on strike, and highly visible protests meant to arouse nationwide support and outrage at national labor norms, the workers won pay increases and time-and-a-quarter for overtime work. The strike had far reaching consequences across the country when mill owners in other cities and states voluntarily raised pay in fear of similar uprisings by their own workers.|$|E
