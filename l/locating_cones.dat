5000|$|Numerous {{systems are}} used to secure {{containers}} aboard ships, depending on {{factors such as the}} type of ship, the type of container, and the location of the container. [...] Stowage inside the holds of fully cellular (FC) ships is simplest, typically using simple metal forms called container guides, <b>locating</b> <b>cones,</b> and anti-rack spacers to lock the containers together. [...] Above-decks, without the extra support of the cell guides, more complicated equipment is used. [...] Three types of systems are currently in wide use: lashing systems, locking systems, and buttress systems. [...] Lashing systems secure containers to the ship using devices made from wire rope, rigid rods, or chains and devices to tension the lashings, such as turnbuckles. [...] The effectiveness of lashings is increased by securing containers to each other, either by simple metal forms (such as stacking cones) or more complicated devices such as twist-lock stackers. [...] A typical twist-lock is inserted into the casting hole of one container and rotated to hold it in place, then another container is lowered on top of it. [...] The two containers are locked together by twisting the device's handle. [...] A typical twist-lock is constructed of forged steel and ductile iron and has a shear strength of 48 metric tons.|$|E

For the back projection a quasi closed-form solution is derived, while for the forward projection an itterative method is used. We then show that these formulae {{can be used to}} achieve stereo vision using only a single mirror, without strict alignment requirements between the cameras and the mirror...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{stages of}} {{keratoconus}} {{can be classified}} according {{to the degree of}} corneal conicity as either early or advanced, or morphologically by the shape of the cone. Knowledge of the different cone characteristics for the different stages of keratoconus may assist practitioners in diagnosing and managing these patients. Aim: To describe the cone characteristics for the different stages of keratoconus. Methods: In this retrospective study, a sample of 190 eyes from 106 cases of previously diagnosed keratoconic patients was analysed. The stage of keratoconus and cone characteristics, namely: cone location, cone decentration, morphology, and topographical patterns were analysed using an Oculus 3 M corneal topographer. Results: Our study revealed that for all stages of keratoconus centrally <b>located</b> <b>cones</b> were the most frequent, with corneal apical decentration between 0 mm and 2 mm. Frequency analysis revealed that nipple cones were most frequent in all stages. Topographical pattern frequencies revealed a wide distribution amongst the different corneal patterns in all stages of keratoconus. Conclusion: Cone analysis should be of consideration to the contact lens practitioner when deciding on management of the condition. It additionally serves to compliment the clinical signs such as nerve visibility, Fleischer’s ring, Vogt’s striae and corneal scarring...|$|R
