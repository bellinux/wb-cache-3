500|$|Lobatus gigas is gonochoristic, {{which means}} each {{individual}} snail is either distinctly male or distinctly female. Females are usually larger than males in natural populations, with both sexes existing in similar proportion. After internal fertilization, the females lay eggs in gelatinous strings, {{which can be}} as long as [...] These are layered on patches of bare sand or seagrass. The sticky surface of these <b>long</b> <b>egg</b> strings allows them to coil and agglutinate, mixing with the surrounding sand to form compact egg masses, the shape of which {{is defined by the}} anterior portion of the outer lip of the female's shell while they are layered. Each one of the egg masses may have been fertilized by multiple males. The number of eggs per egg mass varies greatly depending on environmental conditions such as food availability and temperature. Commonly, females produce 8–9 egg masses per season, each containing 180,000–460,000 eggs, but numbers can be as high as 750,000 eggs. L.gigas females may spawn multiple times during the reproductive season, which lasts from March to October, with activity peaks occurring from July to September.|$|E

5000|$|Nigma walckenaeri is a green {{cribellate spider}} {{up to five}} millimetres long, {{the largest of the}} family Dictynidae. While most of the body is a {{somewhat}} yellowish, the abdomen is a shining green, which makes it rather distinct and hard to confuse with other species. The green color makes it almost invisible. Males have an elevated head region. From August to October these spiders can be found in gardens or on walls - often on big leaves such as lilac or feral grapevine. The spider catches insects, sometimes larger than itself, in its web, which it builds on the surface of leaves. The female hides the 7-millimetre <b>long</b> <b>egg</b> sac on a place distant from its retreat.|$|E
50|$|Five Islands is a rural {{community}} in Colchester County Nova Scotia {{with a population}} of 300 located on the north shore of Minas Basin, home of the highest tides in the world. It is named after five small islands - Moose, Diamond, <b>Long,</b> <b>Egg,</b> and Pinnacle - located just off the coast. The islands are an exposed part of the North Mountain Basalt. Moose Island is in Colchester County. The remaining islands are in Cumberland County. Beyond Pinnacle Island is a seastack called Pinnacle Rock. The Five Islands Provincial Park includes Moose and Diamond Islands. Five Islands had a lighthouse in operation from 1914 to 1999. It was moved several times due to erosion. The lighthouse has since been preserved by a community group.|$|E

Eggs hatch into larvae after about one week; the young larvae feed on the leaves at night. They hide among the bracts of the flower bud and amongst leaves during the day.

40|$|Lumpsucker (Cyclopterus lumpus) is a {{demersal}} {{and shallow}} water spawning fish species {{with a relatively}} <b>long</b> <b>egg</b> incubation period. In case of acute oil pollution the embryos will be exposed to PAHs in the water for a relative long period. In this experiment we made a flow through rock column incubation system with oil contaminated gravel and exposed fertilized lumpsucker eggs to the water soluble fractions (WSF) of North Sea crude oil. During the incubation period we looked for differences in embryo development, mortality, hatching success, larvae length and size, embryo/larvae histology and possible abnormalities within oil exposed (High dose tPAH average 3110 µg L- 1, low dose tPAH 210 µg L- 1) and control group (Average tPAH 18 µg L- 1). We found {{no significant differences in}} either of the checked for parameters, except for the hatching success being much higher in the control treatment vs. the two oil exposed treatments. Despite the fact that we found no significant treatment effect in the oil exposed groups, the observed hatching success in the control units makes us believe that oil has an effect on the embryos ability to hatch and may thus affect the recruitment of lumpsucker in case of exposure towards oil polluted sediments or water during egg incubation...|$|E
