40|$|Global warming, {{fossil fuel}} depletion, {{the growth of}} large new economies, and the <b>latent</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> {{terrorism}} and international conflict are weaving an uncomfortable stranglehold on the world’s energy outlook. This is reflected by an extreme volatility in energy commodity prices and associated economic disruptions, superimposed over long-term environmental worries. The International Energy Agency, through its programs such as Solar Heating and Cooling*, is actively working to advance the new energy technologies and strategies needed to meet future demand while reducing dependence on the liquid fossil fuels that currently drive the planet’s economies.

40|$|Information {{ambiguity}} introduces view bias. By defining {{this view}} bias, we develop a novel reward-risk measurement framework, an extended CAPM {{a sequence of}} empirical test procedures to explain asset pricing anomalies. U. S. stock market data (1926 - 1999) implies a pessimistic view on average for people with rational risk preference; that explains the equity premium puzzle. The extended CAPM still admits a single beta representation. The amount <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> becomes the weighted average <b>of</b> systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>latent</b> <b>risk.</b> The price <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> or the expected market excess return, is adjusted by view bias. The momentum effect has two alternative explanations within this framework. Either the winner has a low systematic risk but a high <b>latent</b> <b>risk,</b> and the adjusted price <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> is positive; or the winner has a low systematic risk and a low amount <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> (a weighted average <b>of</b> systematic <b>risk</b> and <b>latent</b> <b>risk),</b> but the adjusted price <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> is negative.

40|$|To {{control the}} <b>latent</b> social <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> disease, the {{government}} usually spreads accurate information {{and attempts to}} improve the public’s attitude toward adopting prevention. However, these methods with the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) model do not always work. Therefore, we used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to understand dog owners’ behavior and distinguished the knowledge effect as objective knowledge (OK) and subjective knowledge (SK). A total of 310 dog owners completed a questionnaire based on our model. We employed structural equation modeling to verify the structural relationships and found three main results. First, our model was fit, and each path was significant. People with better attitudes, stronger subjective norms, and more perceptive behavioral control have stronger behavioral intention. Second, perceived behavioral control, not attitude, was the best predictive index in this model. Finally, on perceived behavioral control, subjective knowledge showed more influence than objective knowledge. We successfully extended TPB to explain the behavioral intention of dog owners and presented more workable recommendations. To reduce the <b>latent</b> social <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> disease, the government should not only address dog owners’ attitudes, but also their subjective norms and perceptive behavioral control. Indeed, perceptive behavioral control and SK showed the most influence in this model. It is implied that the self-efficacy of dog owners {{is the most important}} factor in such a behavior.

In the present study, utilizing the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), we searched for antidepressants (ADs) used during SCT that cause fewer suicide-related events (SRE) (Study 1). We also investigated whether VAR concomitantly administered with ADs increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> SRE (Study 2). In addition, we investigated whether the use of VAR alone is a <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factor <b>of</b> SRE. The backgrounds of cases with and without SRE were matched using the Propensity Score. In Study 1, the highest integrated Reporting Odds Ratio (iROR) was noted in concomitantly administered mirtazapine (iROR 6. 98; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 1. 57 – 30. 99), while the lowest ratio was noted in concomitantly administered amitriptyline (iROR 0. 59; iROR 95 %CI 0. 23 – 1. 50).

This phenomenon occurred not merely in the US Treasury market but across the full spectrum of financial assets. Although LTCM was diversified the nature of their strategy implied an exposure to a <b>latent</b> factor <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the price of liquidity across markets.

A 51 -year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture.

40|$|Total {{concentrations}} of metals in soils are a poor indicator of metal toxicity because metals exist in different solid phase forms which can vary greatly {{in terms of}} their bioavailability. In an attempt to acknowledge this, risk assessment procedures are moving away from totals-based approaches and towards a measure of bioavailability as an indicator of the risk. For example in aquatic systems, environmental risks are increasingly being predicted using the Biotic Ligand Model, and in soils, the use of neutral salt extractants such as 1. 0 M NH 4 NO 3 have been adopted as part of the regulatory tool-kit in several European countries. However, reliance on this approach to assess risk requires an assumption that the bioavailable pool of metals is relatively static, i. e. that metals cannot migrate between different solid-phase pools. Our results demonstrate that in fact small environmental perturbations can result in the ready conversion of apparently non-labile pools of metals into labile forms, suggesting that risk assessment procedures which depend solely on bioavailability are likely to significantly underestimate the potential risk. We have developed a new strategy ("Risk Potential Index" (RPI)) for assessing the <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> metals in these non-labile solid-phase pools. We discuss how the RPI in combination with a bioavailability assessment can be used to provide a more appropriate measure of risk. Hamon, Rebecca, Bai, Lingyu, McLaughlin, Mike[URL]...|$|E

The present study measures the preferred listening levels of a mobile phone program with subway interior noise for 74 normal-hearing participants in five age groups (ranging from 20 s to 60 s). The speakers presented the subway interior noise at 73. 45 dB, while each subject listened to three application programs [Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB), music, game] for 30 min using a tablet personal computer with an earphone. The participants′ earphone volume levels were analyzed using a sound level meter and a 2 cc coupler. Overall, the results showed that those in their 20 s listened to the three programs significantly louder with DMB set at significantly higher volume levels than for the other programs. Higher volume levels were needed for middle frequency compared to the lower and higher frequencies. We concluded that any potential risk of noise-induced hearing loss for mobile phone users should be communicated when users listen regularly, although the volume level was not high enough that the users felt uncomfortable. When considering individual listening habits on mobile phones, further study to predict total accumulated environmental noise is still needed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{effect of}} an {{intervention}} or exposure on time-to-event is most commonly estimated with the Cox model, which assumes proportional hazards. When heterogeneity in risk is present, {{the assumption of}} proportionality is violated and the Cox model's population-averaged estimate of the hazard ratio can underestimate the effect for an individual. In this dissertation, we develop Bayesian hierarchical frailty models that adjust for heterogeneity in risk {{in a way that}} reflects the sources of heterogeneity. We focus on the compound Poisson distribution, as it reflects a biological risk mechanism seen in many applications where an individual's <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an event is the result of independent, competing exposure processes and it allows that some individuals have no <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an event. In Chapter 2, we outline a hierarchical definition of the compound Poisson distribution and demonstrate Bayesian estimation of a hierarchical compound Poisson frailty model. In Chapter 3, we extend the model proposed in Chapter 2 to allow frailty distributions to vary across <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> classes, resulting in a compound Poisson mixture frailty distribution.

The Sustainable Development Goals for health envision that apart from tuberculosis, also the epidemics of AIDS and malaria will end in 2030.

40|$|Abstract Background Patient {{safety is}} one of the {{greatest}} challenges in healthcare. In the operating room errors are frequent and often consequential. This article describes an approach to a successful implementation of a patient safety program in the operating room, focussing on <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factors that influence patient safety. We performed an intervention to improve these <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factors (LRFs) and increase awareness of patient safety issues amongst OR staff. Methods <b>Latent</b> <b>risk</b> factors were studied using a validated questionnaire applied to the OR staff before and after an intervention. A pre-test/post-test control group design with repeated measures was used to evaluate the effects of the interventions. The staff from one operating room of an university hospital acted as the intervention group. Controls consisted of the staff of the operating room in another university hospital. The outcomes were the changes in LRF scores, perceived incident rate, and changes in incident reports between pre- and post-intervention. Results Based on pre-test scores and participants’ key concerns about organizational factors affecting patient safety in their department the intervention focused on the following LRFs: Material Resources, Training and Staffing Recourses. After the intervention, the intervention operating room - compared to the control operating room - reported significantly fewer problems on Material Resources and Staffing Resources and a significantly lower score on perceived incident rate. The contribution of technical factors to incident causation decreased significantly in the intervention group after the intervention. Conclusion The change <b>of</b> state <b>of</b> <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factors can be measured using a patient safety questionnaire aimed at these factors. The change <b>of</b> the relevant <b>risk</b> factors (Material and Staffing resources) concurred with a decrease in perceived and reported incident rates in the relevant categories. We conclude that interventions aimed at unfavourable <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> factors detected by a questionnaire focussed at these factors may contribute to the improvement of patient safety in the OR. </p...|$|R

Of 18 cases in which inflammation was the principal clinical cause of failure 12 presented as infectious endophthalmitis, but minor degrees of sterile uveitis were fairly common. Retinal detachment was seen in seven cases. The interval between IOL implantation and the onset of serious complications varied from one month to 29 years, indicating that the presence of prosthesis will always entail a <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an adverse tissue response, albeit slight. From rather shaky beginnings the principles and techniques of intraocular lens (IOL) implantation have developed to the level that replacement of the defective lens with a prosthesis is now seen to be the preferred way of dealing with eyes undergoing cataract surgery. Other than in children the limita-tions on the use of 1 OLs {{have more to do with}} availability and economic restraints than with surgical considerations, and yet there is a significant morbidity associated with their insertion which should not be ignored. Already a substantial number of histopatho-logical reports of the untoward effects of 1 OLs has been reported and have been well reviewed by Apple and his colleagues. ' McDonnell, Green, and Champion 2 identified at least 25 complications in eyes that had undergone apparently successful IOL inser-tion. The object of the present report is to describe our experience at the Institute of Ophthalmology in the University of London with reference to eyes wherein the prosthetic insertion was mostly unsuccessful...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{inactivity}} is a modifiable {{risk factor}} for many chronic conditions and {{a leading cause of}} premature mortality. An increasing proportion of adults worldwide are not engaging in a level of physical activity sufficient to prevent or alleviate these adverse effects. Medical professionals have been identified as potentially powerful sources of influence {{for those who do not}} meet minimum physical activity guidelines. Health professionals are respected and expected sources of advice and they reach a large and relevant proportion of the population. Despite this potential, health professionals are not routinely practicing physical activity promotion. Discussion Medical professionals experience several known barriers to physical activity promotion including lack of time and lack of perceived efficacy in changing physical activity behaviour in patients. Furthermore, evidence for effective physical activity promotion by medical professionals is inconclusive. To address these problems, new approaches to physical activity promotion are being proposed. These include collaborating with community based physical activity behaviour change interventions, preparing patients for effective brief counselling during a consultation with the medical professional, and use of interactive behaviour change technology. Summary It is important that we recognise the <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> physical inactivity among patients presenting in clinical settings. Preparation for improving patient physical activity behaviours should commence before the consultation and may include physical activity screening. Medical professionals should also identify suitable community interventions to which they can refer physically inactive patients. Outsourcing the majority of a comprehensive physical activity intervention to community based interventions will reduce the required clinical consultation time for addressing the issue with each patient. Priorities for future research include investigating ways to promote successful referrals and subsequent engagement in comprehensive community support programs to increase physical activity levels of inactive patients. Additionally, future clinical trials of physical activity interventions should be evaluated in the context of a broader framework of outcomes to inform a systematic consideration of broad strengths and weaknesses regarding not only efficacy but cost-effectiveness and likelihood of successful translation of interventions to clinical contexts. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMotivated by {{both the}} Toulouse explosion, {{and a series of}} recent {{unexpected}} handling and storage accidents in well-developed countries, the safety issues associated with the storage of fertilizer grades of ammonium nitrate (AN) are considered with a focus on low storage capacity premises. Such facilities are numerous and, in large agricultural countries, include thousands of end-users and hundreds of small distributors. The strong oxidative (sometimes explosive) properties of products containing significant amounts of AN have led to a long history of major accidents including mass explosions in large storage units and pre 1950 s, to mass explosions in ships. A major breakthrough in safety was achieved in the 1950 s, with the promotion - amongst other improvements - of better anti-caking agents. Although modem AN fertilizers complying with current standards are not considered as explosive material per se, the <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accidental detonation under specific conditions remains a real issue, and from a scientific point of view, cannot be completely ruled out-as dramatically demonstrated by the Toulouse disaster in France. The new insight provided here is derived from: (1) a literature review on hazardous properties of AN and AN-based fertilizers; (2) a review of accidents focusing more particularly on the reporting of recent new cases involving relatively small quantities of previously 'thought safe' products; (3) an examination of both the relevant regulatory framework and the level of hazard control achieved; (4) appropriate discussions of the economical, technical and organizational factors that could lead to some underestimation of the risk compared to large scale storage facilities. In terms of research requirements, the complex potential scenario 'mass explosion following a fire' requires further attention, as does the role and properties of molten ammonium nitrate, which could be the precursor for such an event to occur. Beyond research needs, reinforced legislative control by the authorities and further promotion of safe storage practices must be encouraged by the industry for end-users particularly. Such users have inherently the highest potential for undesirable situations, due both to the nature of their activities and also a possible lack of awareness of the real danger...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a unified {{methodology}} is presented for the modelling {{of the evolution}} of road safety in 30 European countries. For each country, annual data of the best available exposure indicator and of the number of fatalities were simultaneously analysed with the bivariate <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> time series model. This model {{is based on the assumption}} that the amount of exposure and the number of fatalities are intrinsically related. It captures the dynamic evolution in the fatalities as the product of the dynamic evolution in two latent trends: the trend in the fatality risk and the trend in the exposure to that risk. Before applying the <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> model to the different countries it was first investigated and tested whether the exposure indicator at hand and the fatalities in each country were in fact related at all. If they were, the <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> model was applied to that country; if not, a univariate local linear trend model was applied to the fatalities series only, unless the <b>latent</b> <b>risk</b> time series model was found to yield better forecasts than the univariate local linear trend model. In either case, the temporal structure of the unobserved components of the optimal model was established, and structural breaks in the trends related to external events were identified and captured by adding intervention variables to the appropriate components of the model. As a final step, for each country the optimally modelled developments were projected into the future, thus yielding forecasts for the number of fatalities up to and including 2020. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{a sample}} of funds and other {{securities}} each assigned a total rating score by an unknown expert entity. The scores {{are based on a}} number <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and complexity factors, each assigned a category (factor score) of Low, Medium, or High by the expert entity. A principal component analysis of the data reveals that based on the chosen risk factors alone we cannot identify a single underlying <b>latent</b> source <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> in the data. Conversely, the chosen complexity factors are clearly related to one or two underlying sources of complexity. For the sample we find a clear positive relation between the first principal component and the total expert score. An attempt to match the securities' expert score by linear projection of their individual factor scores yields a best case correlation between expert score and projection of 0. 9952. However, the sum of squared differences is, at 46. 5552, still notable...|$|R
40|$|Among rare {{neurological}} manifestations, {{a progressive}} dementia may exceptionally be the revealing clinical feature of a sarcoidosis. Diagnosis may then be difficult, especially when systemic signs are missing or <b>latent,</b> with a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> therapeutic delay. We report {{the first case}} of sarcoidosis mimicking a frontotemporal dementia. A 53 -year-old man presented with a dementia clinically suggestive of frontotemporal dementia, progressing slowly for about 2 years. However, MRI revealed unusual aspects, mainly large areas of T 2 /FLAIR hypersignal within temporal regions and cerebellum, with nodular leptomeningeal and juxtacortical Gadolinium enhancement. The patient was finally diagnosed with a systemic sarcoidosis. We discuss the differential diagnosis based on MRI aspects and review {{the literature on the}} clinical, biological, and imaging features of sarcoidosis presenting with dementia. This case demonstrates that brain imaging remains mandatory in the exploration process of a patient with dementia. Although the patient presented with rather typical features of a behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia, the MRI aspect was the key exploration that leaded to the diagnosis...|$|R
