While <b>local</b> <b>nodes</b> are assumed to remain up to date as long as they don'tcrash, non-local nodes are required to maintain a volatile witness on the same network segment as the <b>local</b> <b>nodes</b> and must poll this witness before answering any user request. To speed up recovery from a total failure, each site maintains a list of replicas that were available the last time the data were updated or a replica recovered from a crash.

An example is the Domain Name System. Local nodes are often announced with the no-export BGP community to prevent hosts from announcing them to their peers, i.e. the announcement is kept in the local area. Where both local and global nodes are deployed, the announcements from global nodes are often AS prepended (i.e. the AS is added a few more times) to make the path longer so that a <b>local</b> <b>node</b> announcement is preferred over a global node announcement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} a wireless com-munication network for both <b>local</b> <b>nodes</b> residing in densely populated hot spots and nomadic nodes roam-ing {{in a large}} area. Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are deployed in the hot spots, while a delay/ disruption tolerant network (DTN) provides services to nomadic nodes in the large area with low node density. We investigate the radio resource allocation for a DTN/WLAN integrated network, and propose a DTN-friendly medium access control (DFMAC) scheme for the hot spots supporting voice/data services. Analytical models are established to characterize the interactions between a DTN and WLANs under the proposed DFMAC. Numerical and simulation results demon-strate that our proposed MAC scheme can provide a deterministic delay guarantee for the voice services of <b>local</b> <b>nodes,</b> while achieving an efficient performance tradeoff for the data services between nomadic <b>nodes</b> and <b>local</b> <b>nodes.</b> Keywords delay/disruption tolerant network (DTN) · {{wireless local area network}} (WLAN) · integrated network · medium access control (MAC...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a QoS architecture framework with preliminary protocol specifications for next generation wireless IP networks. The architecture {{is based on}} differentiated services, in that traffic are aggregated and forwarded in backbone network based on per hop behaviors; however, it is also offers a dynamic per session QoS negotiation which is needed to efficiently support roaming users. The proposed architecture {{has at least one}} global server and many dumb <b>local</b> <b>nodes</b> in each administrative domain. The server {{is referred to as the}} QoS Global Server (or QGS), and <b>local</b> <b>nodes</b> are referred to as QoS <b>local</b> <b>nodes</b> (or QLN). QLNs are ingress nodes of the DS (Differentiated Service) domain which police traffic for agreement with the Service Level Specification (SLS). The mobile nodes do not do any negotiation with the dumb QLNs; rather they negotiate with the QGS. The QGS is basically a dynamic version of a differentiated services bandwidth broker, which stores global information of the whole domain. The QGS informs the QLNs what to do when traffic comes in. By retaining the global information in central server and separating control and transport, the architecture is flexible, easy to add new services, and efficient for mobile environment...|$|R
