25|$|The mayor, who <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> house, has {{not been}} seen for days.

25|$|The Bahá'í Faith {{emphasizes}} {{the unity of}} humanity. To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the prophets were sent by God to facilitate this.|$|E
25|$|At {{the western}} {{base of the}} Wasatch Range is the Wasatch Front, a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state. It {{stretches}} approximately from Brigham City {{at the north end}} to Nephi at the south end. Approximately 75 percent of the state's population <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> corridor, and population growth is rapid.|$|E

The bighorn sheep also <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> mountainous terrain; the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Some animals in the Yosemite Valley include bobcats, mountain lions, ring-tailed cats, the Steller's jay, California ground squirrels and the American black bear.|$|E
25|$|This {{lighthouse}} {{was planned}} in about 1850 because underwater shoals of massive granite boulders made navigation {{in the area}} dangerous. There are many accounts from the 1800s on of disasters and lost <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area of Lake Huron. The first beacon on the island (1857) was provided by a temporary fixed light which {{was replaced by the}} tower. The actual lighthouse was first lit on 1 April 1859. Valuable in its day, it still emits a bright beam, but now, buoys and modern navigational tools are more important for safe navigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{patterns}} of spawning and {{movement of the}} juveniles differs between the eastern and western populations. In the western population, unlike many co-occurring sillaginids, stout whiting do not move inshore to spawn and the juveniles do not {{make their way to}} shallower waters; instead they spawn offshore, with the fish spending their entire <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> environment. In contrast, the eastern population do use inshore nursery areas for the juveniles including bays and surf beaches, with this difference between populations attributed to increased competition between sillaginids by some authors. In both populations, spawning occurs over summer, with the fish spawning multiple times between December and March.|$|E

25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies go out to the victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{forests of}} spruce, fir, pine, and larch, collectively {{known as the}} taiga, made up the largest natural zone of the Soviet Union, an area {{about the size of}} the United States. Here too the winter is long and severe, as witnessed by the routine registering of the world's coldest temperatures for inhabited areas in the northeastern portion of this belt. The taiga zone extended in a broad band across the middle latitudes, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Verkhoyansk Range in northeastern Siberia and as far south as the southern shores of Lake Baykal. Isolated sections of taiga are found along mountain ranges, as in the southern part of the Urals, and in the Amur River Valley in the Far East. About 33 percent of the population <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> zone, which, with the mixed forest zone, included most of the European part of the Soviet Union and the ancestral lands of the earliest Slavic settlers.|$|E
25|$|About 57 {{percent of}} Russia is tundra—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia's northernmost zone, {{stretching}} from the Finnish border {{in the west to}} the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than one percent of Russia's population <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Norilsk is second in population to Murmansk among Russia's settlements above the Arctic Circle. From here you can also see the auroras (northern lights).|$|E

This nucleus was increased to ₱7,140 by donations made by Pablo Rodríguez, Andrés Hermosa, and Juan Morales. After Benavides' death, in the same year, his confreres carried on - albeit with small funds - in order to realize his idea. As Fr.

500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E
500|$|Chulip {{opens with}} a dream {{sequence}} in which the unnamed, male protagonist kisses the girl he loves under the talking [...] "Lover's Tree" [...] on a green hill. The dream takes its course, the tree ends the sequence saying they lived happily ever after. However, once the protagonist wakes up, {{he and his father}} are just moving into Long Life Town, which appears very much like a small, Japanese village. Coincidentally, the girl of his dreams <b>lives</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> town, but she flatly rejects him due to his status as coming from a very poor family. Taking his father's advice, the hero decides to kiss the odd citizens of the town in order to strengthen his heart and improve his reputation. En route to doing so, he also resolves to write a love letter to his crush. When this treasured set of papers is stolen, he must search Long Life Town for the missing pieces. The hero's journey involves numerous bizarre incidents that lead him to cheating his {{way to the top of}} a major corporation, making contact with aliens, and acting as a defense lawyer in court. Once the three pieces of the love letter (the ink, paper, and pen) are collected, he writes and mails it to the girl. The game's ending shows the two meeting and kissing beneath the Lover's Tree, as the protagonist had dreamed.|$|E
