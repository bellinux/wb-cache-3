5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E
5|$|Primitive moths (non-Glossata and Eriocranidae) have 'solid' scales {{which are}} imperforate, i.e., they <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> lumen.|$|E
5|$|Storks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked {{wading birds}} with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills and ibises use to clean off fish slime. Storks <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> pharynx and are mute.|$|E
50|$|MoodLike Proto-Oceanic language, Wuvulu also <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> tense category. Even though Wuvulu <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> tense category, {{they tend}} to use mood, aspect markers, and time phrases to express tenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} {{predominantly}} residential. When {{the area had}} 30,000 residents, it was still <b>lacking</b> <b>a</b> police station, fire station, or hospital. It <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> barber shop even by 1949.|$|R
50|$|The game <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> {{multiplayer}} server and {{is restricted}} to LAN and TC/PIP networking game play. Multiplayer also <b>lacking</b> <b>a</b> world mode (campaign multiplayer mode) and is limited to just battle mode.|$|R
5|$|The fruit bodies vaguely {{resemble}} those of the species Gymnopaxillus nudus, found in Australia growing in association with Eucalyptus. However, Gymnopaxillus fruit bodies grow underground, <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> strong odor, do not stain purple with potassium hydroxide, and have longer spores, typically 11–16µm.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E

50|$|According to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal {{religion}} and Confucianism complemented {{each other in}} ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> ideological doctrine.|$|R
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are unusual in that they <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E
5|$|In an SMC, {{only one}} {{candidate}} is elected {{to represent the}} constituency in question. Thus, if an SMC parliamentary seat is vacated and the Prime Minister exercises discretion not to call a by-election in the SMC, the constituency's residents will not only <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> representative in Parliament but will also be without a Town Council chairman.|$|E
5|$|In general, Atlus publishes Megami Tensei {{games in}} Japan and North America, {{but as they}} <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> European branch, they publish titles in the region through {{third-party}} companies such as Ghostlight and NIS America. Their latest partnership, after their deal with NIS America ended {{with the publication of}} Odin Sphere Leifthrasir, was with European publishing firm Deep Silver to publish multiple titles in the region, including Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse and Persona 5. Atlus has occasionally published titles digitally in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Potential re-use by {{conventional}} UK rail operators {{was limited to}} its electric trains equipment being unsuitable for general and diesel train operations; the site <b>lacked</b> <b>an</b> overhead crane, turntables, fuelling facilities and it <b>lacked</b> <b>a</b> connection to the GWML.|$|R

5|$|It was {{believed}} {{as late as}} 2002 that Noonan Syndrome with Multiple Lentigines (NSML) was related to neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). In fact, since both ICD9 and ICD10 <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> specific diagnosis code for NSML, the diagnosis code for NF1 is still sometimes used for diagnostic purposes, {{although it has been}} shown that the gene is not linked to the NF1 locus.|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being impregnated with calcium salts. Because they <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E
5|$|Only the aye-aye, the extinct giant aye-aye, and {{the largest}} of the extinct giant sloth lemurs <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> {{functional}} strepsirrhine toothcomb. In the case of the aye-aye, the morphology of the deciduous incisors, which are lost shortly after birth, indicate that its ancestors had a toothcomb. These milk teeth are lost shortly after birth and are replaced by open-rooted, continually growing (hypselodont) incisors.|$|E

50|$|China {{currently}} <b>lacks</b> <b>a</b> single national grid. There are 6 {{wide area}} synchronous grids. The <b>lack</b> of <b>a</b> single grid frequently creates power shortages.|$|R
5|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} the greater {{presence}} of cold-blooded (ectothermic) reptiles in warmer climates, {{the states in the}} southern half of the United States have more commonly designated a state reptile. From the twenty-four of the contiguous states roughly south of the Mason–Dixon line, only five <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> state reptile. From east to west, they are Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Utah.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often <b>lack</b> <b>a</b> context {{that would allow them to}} be understood.|$|E
