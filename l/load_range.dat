40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{multicultural}} nursing competence instrument {{for use in}} assessing undergraduate student nurses (SNs). Methods: This study enrolled 322 student nurses (SNs) employed at five hospitals in Hunan Province. The nurses were identified by the cluster sampling method. The items on the competence instrument were retained or deleted after analyzing their coefficient of variation, coefficient of correlation with the total score, t-test results. Reliability tests and correlation analysis were used to examine internal consistency, while exploratory factor {{analysis was used to}} determine construct validity. Results: After analyzing items, the final multicultural nursing competence instrument comprised a total of 49 items that evaluated five dimensions. The instrument showed good overall reliability (0. 958), and {{the internal consistency of the}} five dimensions ranged from 0. 884 to 0. 952. Furthermore, the correlations among the five dimensions were statistically significant (P <  0. 01). An exploratory factor analysis of the five dimensions showed that five items incorporated aspects of cultural cognition (factor <b>loading</b> <b>range,</b> 0. 824 – 0. 888), five items incorporated aspects of cultural attitude (factor <b>loading</b> <b>range,</b> 0. 629 – 0. 815), twenty-two items involved cultural knowledge (factor <b>loading</b> <b>range,</b> 0. 587 – 0. 792), seven items incorporated aspects of cultural skills (factor <b>loading</b> <b>range,</b> 0. 743 – 0. 860), and 10 items involved cultural encounters (factor <b>loading</b> <b>range,</b> 0. 522 – 0. 909).

2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light <b>load</b> <b>range.</b> The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E

50|$|Setting {{the correct}} {{ignition}} timing {{is crucial in}} the performance of an engine. Sparks occurring too soon or too late in the engine cycle are often responsible for excessive vibrations and even engine damage. The ignition timing affects many variables including engine longevity, fuel economy, and engine power. Modern engines that are controlled in real time by an engine control unit use a computer to control the timing throughout the engine's RPM and <b>load</b> <b>range.</b> Older engines that use mechanical spark distributors rely on inertia (by using rotating weights and springs) and manifold vacuum in order to set the ignition timing throughout the engine's RPM and <b>load</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
