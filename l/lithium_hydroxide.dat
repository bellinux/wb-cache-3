5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon sealant, often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|The {{third most}} common use of lithium is in greases. <b>Lithium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> {{is a strong}} base and, when heated with a fat, {{produces}} a soap made of lithium stearate.

5|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{electronegativity}} of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, lithium iodide (LiI) will dissolve in organic solvents, a property of most covalent compounds. Lithium fluoride (LiF) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water, and <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (LiOH) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent.|$|E

5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
40|$|The current {{generation}} of lithium-ion batteries uses LiCoO 2 or LiNiO 2 as cathodes. In contrast to LiCoO 2 and LiNiO 2 systems, {{it is easy to}} synthesize a Mn-based cathode that contains more than one Li per formula unit. LiCuO 2 is also a promising electrode material for lithium batteries {{and it seems to be}} an attractive candidate as a new electrode material. LiCoO 2 and graphite have layered structures and LiMn 2 O 4 has a tunnel-like framework and both structures are useful for the insertion and de-insertion of lithium guest ions into host materials with minimal physical alteration of the host structure. Therefore, in this work attempts have been made to mix both transition metals of copper and manganese to form mixed Lithium manganese copper oxide as cathodic materials for lithium batteries, and the lithiated intercalation cathode materials (LiM 2 O 4, M=Mn, Cu) were synthesized by the sol gel method. The elements, Mn and Cu were chosen because a Mn-based cathode can easily accommodate more than one lithium per formula unit while Cu has an advantage of lower cost and safety. Various ratios of Mn and Cu acetates, <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxides</b> were used as starting materials with tartaric acid as the gelating agent. The dried samples were calcined at 800 oC.

40|$|The authors {{present the}} design and {{preliminary}} results {{of the performance of}} a hybrid chemical/mechanical, low-lift (20 C) heat pump. Studies have indicated that this heat pump has several advantages over the traditional single fluid vapor compression (reverse Rankine) heat pump. Included in these benefits are: 1) increased COPc due to the approximation of the cycle to the Lorenz cycle and due to the availability of the heat of solution, along with the heat of vaporization, to provide cooling; and 2) ease of variation in system cooling capacity by changing the fluid composition. The system performance is predicted for a variety of refrigerant-absorbent pairs. Cooling capacity is determined for systems operating with ammonia as the refrigerant and lithium nitrate and sodium thiocyanate as the absorbents and also with water as the refrigerant and magnesium chloride, potassium <b>hydroxide,</b> <b>lithium</b> bromide, sodium <b>hydroxide,</b> and sulfuric acid as the absorbents. Early indications have shown that the systems operating with water as the refrigerant operate at 2 - 4 times the capacity of the ammonia-refrigerant-based systems. Using existing working fluids in the proposed innovative design, a coefficient-of-performance improvement of 21 percent is possible when compared to the best vapor compression systems analyzed...|$|R

30|$|To address present {{concerns}} about thickening time and high early-strength in deepwater cementing at low temperatures when using conventional accelerators, {{a new type}} of set-accelerating admixture comprising of <b>lithium</b> chloride, aluminium <b>hydroxide</b> and alkaline metal chlorides, named as LS-A, was studied in this paper. Mechanism analysis and performance tests show that the accelerator LS-A accelerated the hydration of tri- and dicalcium silicates (C 3 S and C 2 S) at low-temperatures by speeding up the breakdown of the protective hydration film and shortening the hydration induction period. Therefore, LS-A could shorten the low-temperature thickening time and the transition time of critical gel strength from 48 to 240 Pa of the Class-G cement slurry, and improve the early compressive strength of set cement at low-temperatures. It exhibited better performance than calcium chloride and had no effect on the type of hydration products, which remain the same as those of neat Class-G cement, i.e. the calcium silicate gel, Ca(OH) 2 crystals and a small amount of ettringite AFt crystals. LS-A provides an effective way to guarantee the safety of cementing operations, and to solve the problems of low temperature and shallow water/gas flowing faced in deepwater cementing.|$|R

This iron vacancy concentration is revealed as the only significant compositional variable and as the key parameter controlling the crystal structure and the electronic properties. Single crystal X-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements are used to demonstrate that superconductivity at temperatures as high as 40 K is observed in the hydrothermally synthesised samples when the iron vacancy concentration is low (y < 0. 05) and when the iron oxidation state is reduced slightly below + 2, while samples with a higher vacancy concentration and a correspondingly higher iron oxidation state are not superconducting. The importance of combining a low iron oxidation state with a low vacancy concentration in the iron selenide layers is emphasised by the demonstration that reductive post-synthetic lithiation of the samples turns on superconductivity with critical temperatures exceeding 40 K by displacing iron atoms from the Li 1 -xFex(OH) reservoir layer to fill vacancies in the selenide layerComment: 7 pages supplementary material available from Journal, Inorganic Chemistry 201...|$|R
40|$|Cobalt {{substituted}} lithium–nickel oxides were synthesized by a solid-state reaction procedure using <b>lithium</b> nitrate, nickel <b>hydroxide</b> and {{cobalt oxalate}} precursor and were characterized as cathodes for molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC). LiNi 0. 8 Co 0. 2 O 2 cathodes were prepared using non-aqueous tape casting technique followed by sintering in air. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of sintered LiNi 1 xCoxO 2 indicated that lithium evaporation occurs during heating. The lithium loss decreases {{with an increase}} of the cobalt content in the mixed oxides. The stability studies showed that dissolution of nickel into the molten carbonate melt is smaller {{in the case of}} LiNi 1 xCoxO 2 cathodes compared to the dissolution values reported in the literature for state-of-the-art NiO. Pore volume analysis of the sintered electrode indicated a mean pore size of 3 mm and a porosity of 40 %. A current density of 160 mA/cm 2 was observed when LiNi 0. 8 Co 0. 2 O 2 cathodes were polarized at 140 mV. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies done on LiNi 0. 8 Co 0. 2 O 2 cathodes under different gas conditions indicated that the rate of the cathodic discharge reaction depends on the O 2 and CO 2 partial pressures...|$|R
500|$|The {{demand for}} lithium {{increased}} dramatically during the Cold War {{with the production}} of nuclear fusion weapons. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful {{for the production of}} tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride. The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid 1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of <b>lithium</b> <b>hydroxide.</b> The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some [...] "natural sources" [...] of lithium ion which had been [...] "contaminated" [...] by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.|$|E

40|$|Natural gas may be {{used instead}} of {{hydrogen}} as fuel for the molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) by steam reforming the natural gas inside the MCFC, using a nickel catalyst (internal reforming). The severe conditions inside the MCFC, however, require that the catalyst has a very high stability. In order to find suitable types of nickel catalysts and to obtain more knowledge about the deactivation mechanism(s) occurring during internal reforming, a series of nickel catalysts was prepared and subjected to stability tests at 973 K in an atmosphere containing steam and <b>lithium</b> and potassium <b>hydroxide</b> vapours. All the catalysts prepared showed a significant growth of the nickel crystallites during the test, especially one based on ¿-Al 2 O 3 and a coprecipitated Ni/Al 2 O 3 sample having a very high nickel content. However, this growth of nickel crystallites only partially explained the very strong deactivation observed in most cases. Only a coprecipitated nickel/alumina catalyst with high alumina content and a deposition-precipitation catalyst showed satisfactory residual activities. Addition of magnesium or lanthanum oxide to a coprecipitated nickel/alumina catalyst decreased the stability.

40|$|This project {{focused on}} {{addressing}} {{the two main}} problems associated with state of art Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells, namely loss of cathode active material and stainless steel current collector deterioration due to corrosion. We followed a dual approach where {{in the first case}} we developed novel materials to replace the cathode and current collector currently used in molten carbonate fuel cells. In the second case we improved the performance of conventional cathode and current collectors through surface modification. States of art NiO cathode in MCFC undergo dissolution in the cathode melt thereby limiting the lifetime of the cell. To prevent this we deposited cobalt using an electroless deposition process. We also coated perovskite (La{sub 0. 8 }Sr{sub 0. 2 }CoO{sub 3 }) in NiO thorough a sol-gel process. The electrochemical oxidation behavior of Co and perovskites coated electrodes {{is similar to that of}} the bare NiO cathode. Co and perovskite coatings on the surface decrease the dissolution of Ni into the melt and thereby stabilize the cathode. Both, cobalt and provskites coated nickel oxide, show a higher polarization compared to that of nickel oxide, which could be due to the reduced surface area. Cobalt substituted lithium nickel oxide (LiNi{sub 0. 8 }Co{sub 0. 2 }O{sub 2 }) and lithium cobalt oxide were also studied. LiNi{sub x}Co{sub 1 -x}O{sub 2 } was synthesized by solid-state reaction procedure using <b>lithium</b> nitrate, nickel <b>hydroxide</b> and cobalt oxalate precursor. LiNi{sub x}Co{sub 1 -x}O{sub 2 } showed smaller dissolution of nickel than state of art nickel oxide cathode. The performance was comparable to that of nickel oxide. The corrosion of the current collector in the cathode side was also studied. The corrosion characteristics of both SS 304 and SS 304 coated with Co-Ni alloy were studied. This study confirms that surface modification of SS 304 leads to the formation of complex scales with better barrier properties and better electronic conductivity at 650 C. A three phase homogeneous model was developed to simulate the performance of the molten carbonate fuel cell cathode and the complete fuel cell. The homogeneous model is based on volume averaging of different variables in the three phases over a small volume element. This approach can be used to model porous electrodes as it represents the real system much better than the conventional agglomerate model. Using the homogeneous model the polarization characteristics of the MCFC cathode and fuel cell were studied under different operating conditions. Both the cathode and the full cell model give good fits to the experimental data...|$|R

The cameras flew up in launch configuration and now have been installed in an operational configuration, thus completing the JEF assembly.
