5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to influenza research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> against influenza, but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the influenza receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of influenza. He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of influenza was demonstrated.|$|E

Dukoral, an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52% {{during the first year}} after being given and 62% in the second year, with minimal side effects. It is available in over 60 countries. However, it is not currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries.

If this capsid protein {{is included in}} the DNA, the resulting vaccine can combine the potency of a <b>live</b> <b>vaccine</b> without reversion risks. In 1983, Enzo Paoletti and Dennis Panicali at the New York Department of Health devised a strategy to produce recombinant DNA vaccines by using genetic engineering to transform ordinary smallpox vaccine into vaccines that may be able to prevent other diseases. They altered the DNA of cowpox virus by inserting a gene from other viruses (namely Herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and influenza).|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, the Cuba IPV Study Collaborative Group {{reported}} in the New England Journal of Medicine that inactivated (killed) poliovirus vaccine was effective in vaccinating children in tropical conditions. The Collaborative Group consisted of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Kourí Institute, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization. This is important because countries with high incidence of polio are now using live oral poliovirus vaccine. When polio is eliminated in a country, they must stop using the <b>live</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{because it has a}} slight risk of reverting to the dangerous form of polio. The collaborative group found that when polio is eliminated in a population, they could safely switch to killed vaccine and be protected from recurrent epidemics. Cuba has been free of polio since 1963, but continues with mass immunization campaigns.|$|E

Moreover, <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{can be used as}} carrier systems for heterologous antigens or therapeutic factors. In each case, the development of a recombinant <b>live</b> attenuated <b>vaccine</b> is a complex task where properties such as targeting specificity, antigen synthesis, antigen release, and safety aspects have to be integrated. A range of such recombinant vaccine candidates have successfully been tested in the clinics, but very few have been approved so far. In many cases, further optimization of such vaccines is necessary with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles.

40|$|The review {{focuses on}} the history of the {{production}} of <b>live</b> antiviral <b>vaccines</b> and their use for the prevention of infectious diseases. It was noted that before the beginning of the 20 th century, only three <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> were developed and put into practice — against smallpox, rabies, plague. The discovery of D. Enders, T. H. Weller and F. Ch. Robins of the ability of the polio virus, and then of a number of other viruses, to reproduce in vitro in cell cultures of various types, greatly expanded the studies on the production of attenuated strains of viruses for <b>live</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The historical stages of obtaining and introducing <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> for the prevention of smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, and mumps are highlighted. Arguments in favor of the use of associated vaccine preparations for the prevention of viral infections are presented. Various variants of the strategy and tactics of using <b>live</b> <b>vaccines,</b> which are used for specific prevention of viral infections in different countries, are described. The review provides information on technological methods for obtaining antiviral vaccines. The publications testifying to the development of specific reactions in immunized vaccine strains of measles, mumps, poliomyelitis and rubella viruses, such as aseptic meningitis (vaccine strains of mumps virus), acute arthritis (vaccine rubella virus strains), temperature reactions, rash (vaccine strains of the virus Measles), vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) vaccine vaccine poliovirus. It is particularly noted that the long experience of vaccine prevention both in Russia and abroad convincingly shows that the risk of developing post-vaccination complications is incommensurably lower than the risk of causing harm to health from the corresponding infections. It is concluded that despite introduction of new third and fourth generation <b>vaccines</b> into practice, <b>live</b> attenuated <b>vaccines</b> do not lose their significance and are used in vaccine-preventable infections as the most effective immunobiological drugs...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLive {{vaccines}} {{are widely}} used in the avian industry. Such vaccines can be either injected or delivered on animal mucosa and are usually not adjuvanted. In this study we show that <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> efficacy can be improved by formulation with adjuvants in a model of mucosal delivery of <b>live</b> infectious bronchitis <b>vaccine</b> in chicken. Three adjuvant technologies have been tested using intranasal and spray delivery methods to poultry. Those technologies are water in oil in water emulsion, nanoparticles and polymer adjuvants. Intranasal delivery of polymer and nanoparticles adjuvanted <b>live</b> <b>vaccines</b> improved significantly the antibody titer and protection to challenge observed compared to a commercial non-adjuvanted reference. Moreover, spray delivery of the polymer adjuvanted vaccine showed a significantly higher protection compared to the non-adjuvanted reference.

30|$|Beginning in the 1950 s, Dr. Chu {{conducted}} research on <b>live</b> attenuated <b>vaccines.</b> Specifically, he studied forest encephalitis, measles, and influenza <b>live</b> <b>vaccines.</b> During {{his research on}} the <b>live</b> influenza <b>vaccine,</b> {{he found that the}} rate of attenuation of influenza viruses differs yearly, and he developed two methods for producing live vaccines: chick embryo passage and genetic recombination.

40|$|This {{research}} had two objectives. First, {{to determine if}} BVDV vaccines containing type I BVDV were safe and efficacious against a type II BVDV challenge in calves. Second, to determine if modified <b>live</b> BVDV <b>vaccines</b> could stimulate {{a greater degree of}} protection against BVDV reproductive syndromes as well as a longer duration of cross neutralizing antibodies than the current inactivated vaccines. One to nine week old calves were administered modified live and/or inactivated BVDV containing vaccines on various schedules. The calves were monitored for adverse effects and followed serologically for 12 weeks. BVDV challenge studies were performed in calves vaccinated with either a modified <b>live</b> or inactivated <b>vaccine</b> beginning on day 14 of age. BVDV sero-negative and sero-positive calves were included in the study. Studies were performed in BVDV sero-negative cows. Safety was determined by assessing the risk of BVDV transmission of vaccinal virus. Duration of cross neutralizing antibodies stimulated by a single modified <b>live</b> BVDV <b>vaccine</b> was determined. Finally, the ability of a modified <b>live</b> BVDV <b>vaccine</b> to provide fetal protection was assessed. 'Results'. Neither the modified <b>live</b> BVDV <b>vaccines</b> nor the inactivated BVDV vaccine used in these studies caused adverse reactions in the young calves. Calves with BVDV maternal antibody less than 1 : 64 by virus neutralization testing responded to BVDV vaccination. Calves vaccinated with modified <b>live</b> BVDV <b>vaccine</b> or with high maternal antibody against BVDV were protected from a type II BVDV challenge. Inactivated BVDV vaccine conferred only partial protection against the challenge. Cows vaccinated with one of two modified <b>live,</b> NADL-containing, BVDV <b>vaccines</b> did not transmit measurable BVDV to contact control animals.
