50|$|Shell {{scripts and}} other {{programs}} often use a strategy similar {{to the use of}} file locking: creation of <b>lock</b> <b>files,</b> which are files whose contents are irrelevant (although often one will find the process identifier of the holder of the <b>lock</b> in the <b>file)</b> and whose sole purpose is to signal by their presence that some resource is <b>locked.</b> A <b>lock</b> <b>file</b> is often the best approach if the resource to be controlled is not a regular file at all, so using methods for <b>locking</b> <b>files</b> does not apply. For example, a <b>lock</b> <b>file</b> might govern access to a set of related resources, such as several different files, directories, a group of disk partitions, or selected access to higher level protocols like servers or database connections.|$|R

This body was responsible for overseeing {{each of the seven}} organizational subdivisions of the Church of Scientology. She {{played a central role in}} the financial management of the Church of Scientology's two principal corporations, the Church of Scientology of California and the United Kingdom Church of Scientology. She was a sole signatory to the Church of Scientology's trust accounts and was also a director of the Operation Transport Corporation (OTC), a company established in 1968 that served as a conduit for cash transfers from the Church of Scientology to L. Ron Hubbard personally; it was characterized by US Tax Court as a [...] "sham corporation" [...] whose role was the enrichment of the Hubbards. She personally handled large quantities of cash on Hubbard's behalf. In the summer of 1972, Hubbard ordered that around $2 million in cash be transferred from OTC bank accounts in Switzerland to the Apollo, where it was stored for the next three years in a <b>locked</b> <b>file</b> cabinet to which Mary Sue Hubbard had the only set of keys.
