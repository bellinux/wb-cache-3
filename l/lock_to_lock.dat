25|$|If {{the driver}} {{released}} the steering wheel, then the steering would center {{back to the}} straight ahead position. It was geared for minimal steering input - with 2 turns from <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock,</b> often described as like a go kart.|$|E
25|$|The Augustów Canal, {{consisting}} of 18 locks and 22 sluices, {{is divided into}} two major sections: the West— from the merger of the Biebrza lock Augusta (0.0 – 32.50km); and the East section— from <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> Niemnowo Augusta Belarus (32.50 – 101.20km).|$|E
25|$|The {{steering}} {{was also}} made faster, only 1.7 turns from <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> compared to 2.1 in normal models. The GTA had also larger brakes (Brembo), at front 305 millimetres (12in) discs and rear 276 millimetres (10.8in). The front discs were later upgraded to 330 millimetres (13in) {{to cope with}} the performance potential.|$|E

50|$|In {{firearms}} operating systems, {{the term}} roller <b>locked</b> refers <b>to</b> <b>locking</b> the bolt with rollers. Notable examples of firearms using this method are the MG42 and Rheinmetall MG3 machineguns, and the CZ 52 pistol.|$|R
2500|$|Compression Lock – A {{variant of}} the Liner Lock, it uses {{a small piece of}} metal {{at the tip of the}} <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> into a small {{corresponding}} impression in the blade. [...] This creates a lock that doesn't disengage when the blade is torqued, instead becoming more tightly locked. [...] It is released by pressing the tab of metal to the side, to allow the blade to be placed into its groove set into the handle.|$|E

The rest of the journey to Villevorde, we still spread our canvas to the unfavouring air; and with {{now and then a}} puff, and now and then a spell of paddling, drifted along from <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock,</b> between the orderly trees.|$|E

5000|$|On September 27, 2009, the 1,200-foot lock {{failed and}} the gates [...] "mismitered" [...] {{due to a}} solenoid malfunction. The lock was {{repaired}} and reopened on March 1, 2010. The 1,200-foot lock chamber remained closed for 155 days, but the 600-foot <b>lock</b> continued <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> traffic albeit with delays.|$|R
50|$|ESE {{supports}} a concurrency control mechanism called multi-versioning. In multi-versioning, every transaction queries a consistent {{view of the}} entire database as {{it was at the}} time the transaction started. The only updates it encounters are those made by it. In this way, each transaction operates as though it was the only active transaction running on the system, except in the case of write conflicts. Since a transaction may make changes based on data read that has already been updated in another transaction, multi-versioning by itself does not guarantee serializable transactions. However, serializability can be achieved when desired by simply using explicit record read <b>locks</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> read data that updates are based upon. Both read and write locks may be explicitly requested with the GetLock operation.|$|R
50|$|There were 2.2 turns <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> for the {{power-assisted}} steering or 2.5 for unassisted.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 {{the stretch}} of canal from Abergarwed <b>locks</b> <b>to</b> Tyn-yr-Heol <b>lock</b> at Tonna was {{polluted}} when iron-bearing water began discharging from a mine adit of the Ynysarwed coal mine. This turned the water orange, and deposited ferruginous sediment along the canal. A treatment plant and reedbeds were installed to clean the mine water, and this £1.6million project was commissioned in 1999.|$|R
50|$|The {{conflicting}} interests of bargees and millers continued. As {{the river was}} important for trade, the engineer John Smeaton was asked to recommend improvements in 1765. He produced a report in 1766, in which he suggested a cut from Bow <b>Locks</b> <b>to</b> Limehouse, to provide a better route to the Thames than that through the gates and Bow Creek, and the conversion of flash <b>locks</b> <b>to</b> pound <b>locks.</b> The Limehouse Cut was built, opening in its final form in 1777, but the lock was not altered.|$|R
5000|$|The locks at {{the upper}} end of the river, from St John's <b>Lock</b> <b>to</b> King's <b>Lock,</b> are {{manually}} operated. All other locks on the Thames are hydraulically operated. All locks, except Teddington, can be operated by boat crews outside manning hours, using the adapted system of [...] "public power", which allows boaters to use the hydraulic machinery at reduced power, except during the hours of darkness.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{mounting}} {{of the engine}} meant that the steering could be highly geared while remaining relatively light; in the early cars, only 2¼ turns were needed from <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock.</b> The unusually direct steering no doubt delighted some keen drivers, but road tests of the time nonetheless included warnings to take great care with the car's handling on wet roads. In due course, the manufacturer switched from one extreme to the other, and on later cars 4½ turns were needed to turn the steering wheel from <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electric power {{steering}} is fitted, with 2.43 turns <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> and a turning circle of 11.86 m. The electric {{power steering}} system allows the Discovery Sport to feature an automatic parking system.|$|E
5000|$|The Majestic Major's {{turning circle}} was 42 ft. The car {{was not one}} for {{manoeuvering}} in tight spaces; 4.5 turns <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> were required. Power steering, initially optional, became standard after October 1964.|$|E
50|$|Passing under Tom Benson Way, and {{immediately}} under the local railway line bridge the Ribble Link comes <b>to</b> <b>Lock</b> 4 with a weir. The sculpture 'Fire' by Thompson Dagnall is found here. From <b>Lock</b> 4 <b>to</b> <b>Lock</b> 5, complete with weir, {{to the north}} is a quiet public park, again worth visiting on foot or bicycle. Between <b>Locks</b> 4 and 5, <b>to</b> the south is the 'hay meadow' part of the Ribble Link Development, identified as 'national significance'. Public access is approved and welcomed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{stretch of}} canal between locks {{is called a}} level. Canalers called these levels by their lengths; for instance, the longest level was the 14 mile level, which was about 14 miles long, and ran from Lock 50 (at 4 <b>locks)</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lock</b> 51 in Hancock. Some levels had {{additional}} nicknames (since some had similar lengths), e.g. [...] "Four Mile Level below Dam 6", [...] "Four Mile Level Big Slackwater", or [...] "Four Mile Level of the Log Wall" [...] (which is between locks 14 and 15, includes Widewater, Anglers, Carderock, Billy Goat Trails B, and C, and the downstream entrance to Trail A, all connect on that level) Levels {{less than a mile}} between locks were called short levels. Waste weirs and bypass flumes at the locks helped control the height of water in the levels (see below about waste weirs).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{generation of}} FD lenses featured a silver colored locking ring at the base. Only the <b>locking</b> ring turns <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> the lens <b>to</b> the camera body; the lens body remains stationary. The later New FD lenses {{have a black}} mount which includes a lens release button.|$|R

50|$|The {{guard lock}} is {{situated}} at the upriver end of the canal at The Confluence. From the guard <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>Lock</b> 9 was a tow embankment that closely paralleled the river. The tow embankment was protected by a long and massive stone wall, much of which is still visible today.|$|E

50|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal {{follows the}} Dun valley through Froxfield parish, passing within 550 yard m of the village.

50|$|The term remote keyless system (RKS), {{also called}} keyless entry or remote central <b>locking,</b> refers <b>to</b> a <b>lock</b> that uses an {{electronic}} remote control {{as a key}} which is activated by a handheld device or automatically by proximity.|$|R
50|$|The HS package {{includes}} Delphi MagneRide magnetorheological dampers controlled by an ECU with 50% faster response time running patented Ferrari software, stiffer springs for more precise body control and a steering rack with a 9 per cent quicker steering ratio (2.3 turns <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock</b> {{as opposed to}} the standard rack's 2.5).|$|E
50|$|In {{a parking}} situation, the {{computer}} varies the ratio {{so that the}} steering wheel needs fewer than two full turns to move the wheels <b>lock</b> <b>to</b> <b>lock.</b> As vehicle speeds increase, the steering ratio increases, so it takes larger movements of the steering wheel to move the wheels and that lessens the usually increasing vehicle response resulting from increased speed.|$|E
