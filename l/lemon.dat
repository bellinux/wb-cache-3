5|$|Bill Pugh, {{the chief}} {{plastics}} designer at Cascelloid, based in Leicester, and former Royal Air Force pilot, created {{a prototype of}} the blown lemon-shaped plastic shaped container based upon Hack's idea sometime in the 1950s, {{as well as other}} types of blown containers. Pugh's experimented with the initial design until he was satisfied with its appearance. This plastic <b>lemon</b> product was then used for Hax <b>lemon</b> juice. Edward Hack, Ltd. produced and marketed Hax brand squeezable plastic <b>lemon</b> containers filled with two ounces of Sicilian <b>lemon</b> juice. Per Edward Hack, Ltd., the juice was unfiltered, had no water added to it, and contained a preservative to prevent spoilage. Retailers could purchase the product in packs of six bags that contained 12 squeeze packs each, totalling 72 units. Upon introduction to the marketplace, Hax juice and the plastic <b>lemon</b> design received some press coverage. The Hax logo used on Hax <b>lemon</b> juice dates back to at least 1935, at which time it was used in advertisements for Hax brand iodine pencils and Hax brand aspirin.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} <b>lemon</b> juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand <b>lemon</b> juice in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand <b>lemon</b> juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax <b>lemon</b> juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the <b>lemon</b> juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for <b>lemon</b> juice in plastic <b>lemon</b> containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E

50|$|The label {{began as}} <b>Lemoned</b> and {{was part of}} a wider range of {{businesses}} under the same name; such as the <b>Lemoned</b> Shop. <b>Lemoned</b> was created as a venue for unsigned musicians that Matsumoto watched perform in local clubs in Japan. The first band signed to this label was Zeppet Store. A compilation album simply titled <b>Lemoned</b> was released on May 22, 1996 by MCA Victor, it includes songs by hide, Zeppet Store, Trees of Life, and Vinyl (band of former D'erlanger vocalist Dizzy).|$|R

5|$|The plastic <b>lemon</b> {{container}} {{and the idea}} of marketing <b>lemon</b> juice in this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner's plastic <b>lemon</b> was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for a <b>lemon</b> juice product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax <b>lemon</b> juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design.
