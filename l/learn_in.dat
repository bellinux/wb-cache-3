As they progress, Avery Coonley students participate in vocal music, playing Orff instruments and recorders, dancing, and public performance. In middle school, students develop music literacy by reading and writing music, playing choir chimes, and choral singing. The study of music in culture {{and the history of}} jazz and opera are taught alongside theory and performance.|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between category and perceptual learning, we examined both category and perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> patients with treated Wilson's disease (WD), whose basal ganglia, known to be important <b>in</b> category <b>learning,</b> were damaged by the disease. We measured their learning rate and accuracy in rule-based and information-integration category learning, and magnitudes of perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide range of}} external noise conditions, and compared the results with those of normal controls. The WD subjects exhibited deficits in both forms of category <b>learning</b> and <b>in</b> perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise. However, their perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> low external noise was relatively spared. There was no significant correlation between the two forms of category learning, nor between perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> low external noise and either form of category <b>learning.</b> Perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise was, however, significantly correlated with information-integration but not with rule-based category learning. The results suggest {{that there may be a}} strong link between information-integration category learning and perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise. Damage to brain structures that are important for information-integration category learning may lead to poor perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise, yet spare perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> low external noise. Perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high and low external noise conditions may involve separate neural substrates...|$|R
40|$|This book defines Cooperative <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> {{physical}} education and examines how to implement Cooperative <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> a variety of educational settings. It explores Cooperative <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> {{physical education}} from three main perspectives. The first, context of learning, provides descriptions of Cooperative <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> different levels of education (elementary school, secondary school, and university physical education). The second, Cooperative <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> the curriculum, offers case studies from teachers and researchers of their experiences of implementing Cooperative Learning within their own national context. The third perspective, key aspects of Cooperative Learning, examines how the different elements of the model have been foregrounded in efforts to enhance <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> physical education...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the companion volume Researching <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Worlds in 2010, there has been a growth not only in the range and number of educational initiatives taking place in virtual worlds, but also in the depth of analysis of the nature of that education. Understanding <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Worlds reflects those changes through a collection of chapters that are extended versions of research presented at the second Researching <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Environments conference (ReLIVE 11), an international conference hosted by the Open University UK. Included in this book are chapters that explore the philosophical and methodological underpinnings of understanding <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> virtual worlds, identify and analyse the factors that support <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> these environments, and present case studies that demonstrate some of the various ways in which virtual worlds can be applied to facilitate learning and teaching. The links between <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> a virtual world and <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> the physical world are made apparent throughout, and the authors reveal how understanding <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> one informs the other. Understanding <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Worlds is an important book not only to those who teach in virtual worlds, but to anyone for whom understanding <b>learning,</b> <b>in</b> all its forms, is of interest...|$|R
5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each participant was infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E

FIU's School of Music embraces an evolving world for its possibilities and the new opportunities and challenges that it affords, while providing the tools necessary to empower young musicians in their quest to carve out careers. FIU School of Music's concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, early music, chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{went into}} {{quarters}} at Morristown {{during the winter}} of 1779–1780, which represented the worst suffering for the army during the war. The temperatures fell to 16 below zero, the New York Harbor was frozen over, and snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, with the troops again lacking provisions for a time as at Valley Forge. In late 1779, Clinton moved his forces south to Charleston for an offensive against the patriots led by Benjamin Lincoln. After his success there, Clinton returned victorious to New York, leaving Cornwallis in the south. Congress replaced Lincoln with Gates, despite Washington's recommendation of Greene. Gates failed in South Carolina and was then replaced by Greene. The British at the time seemed to have the South almost in their grasp. Despite this news, Washington was encouraged to <b>learn</b> <b>in</b> mid-1780 that Lafayette had returned from France with additional naval assets and forces.|$|E

40|$|In 10 {{experiments}} spatial <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> computer-simulated environments was investigated. Part 1 of {{the thesis}} examined whether navigational <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> real and computer-simulated environments is comparable. Two methods {{were used to}} fulfil this aim. First, <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> equivalent real and computer-simulated environments was directly compared. Second, the properties of mental representations from <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> a simulated environment were investigated {{in an attempt to}} examine whether they are similar to the properties of mental representations from comparable <b>learning</b> experiences <b>in</b> the real world. The results of both methods indicated that the cognitive processes involved <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> real and computer-simulated environments are similar. Part 2 of the thesis was concerned with the effect of landmarks on <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> large-scale and small-scale computer-simulated environments.

A positive effect of landmarks on route-learning was found to be dependent on a successsful suppression of alternative learning strategies. With respect to <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> small-scale environments, landmarks were shown to aid people's memory for spatial locations.
