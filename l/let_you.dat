25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, you could say it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world and <b>let</b> <b>you</b> escape your normal life for a few minutes. I like to cloak things in a little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E

All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls.
