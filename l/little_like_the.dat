500|$|His {{redesign}} in Mortal Kombat: Deception {{was praised}} by GameSpot for {{being one of}} the best ones from the title, and was featured in GamesRadar's list of the [...] "greatest zombie triumphs" [...] in 2009, but was also ranked as the ninth-worst Mortal Kombat character by ScrewAttack in 2011. Additionally, GamesRadar used Liu Kang {{as an example of a}} stereotype of gaming heroes who reveal an evil alter ego that ruins the character's appealing traits, and considered him to be [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Shaolin version of Goku, in that he's saved his world countless times and come back from the dead even more frequently." [...] GamesRadar featured him the article about [...] "kickass Bruce Lee clones" [...] citing his similarities with Bruce Lee and with one of his shouts featured in famous quotes. Liu Kang's darker characterization starting with Deception and in the reboot were received with good critical response as Den of Geek listed him as the 22nd best Mortal Kombat character due to this aspect.|$|E
500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>The</b> Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster. They tell you it's a kids' book, but take my word for it, no one who reads it is ever the same. No hype." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Pissarro's son, Lucien, {{his father}} painted {{regularly}} with Cézanne beginning in 1872. He recalls that Cézanne walked {{a few miles}} to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger Cézanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro's eyes, as he admired Pissarro's landscapes from the 1860s. Cézanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> good Lord." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emmaus (Emmaüs in French) {{was started}} in 1949. Its name is a {{reference}} to a village in Israel appearing in the Gospel of Luke, where two disciples extended hospitality to Jesus just after his resurrection without recognizing him. In that way, Emmaus's mission is to help poor and homeless people. It is a secular organization. In 1950 the first community of Emmaus companions was created in Neuilly-Plaisance close to Paris in France. The Emmaus community raises funds for the construction of housing by selling used goods. [...] "Emmaus, it's a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> wheelbarrow, the shovels and the pickaxes coming before the banners. A sort of social fuel derived from salvaging defeating men." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1873 {{he helped}} {{establish}} a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the [...] "pivotal" [...] figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the [...] "dean of the Impressionist painters", {{not only because}} he was the oldest of the group, but also [...] "by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality". Cézanne said [...] "he was a father for me. A man to consult and a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> good Lord," [...] and he was also one of Gauguin's masters. Renoir referred to his work as [...] "revolutionary", through his artistic portrayals of the [...] "common man", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without [...] "artifice or grandeur".|$|E
2500|$|Gans {{described}} {{the concept of}} the town's connection to the child Alessa and the cult: [...] "It's a town of people trapped in dark dreams, and she inflicts onto the town what those people did to her body. That is, to me, the meaning of the darkness. The appearance of the town is corrupted in the way that her own flesh was wounded." [...] He furthers expands on Alessa's connection to the alternate reality seen in the film, saying that the alternate reality is [...] "in [...] head". [...] "It's interesting because the town itself mirrors this fractured psychology—different dimensions, different doubles of the same person." [...] In speaking about the creatures in Silent Hill, Gans said that [...] "these monsters are , with the poetic direction of the term: they are a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Japanese phantoms, i.e. residues of forgotten feelings as strong as hatred or [...]" [...] "The monsters in the game are not really monsters, but rather a mockery of human beings. The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I knew {{that it was impossible to}} represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{organization}} aims {{that millions}} of Ukrainians will become members. According to co-head of the organization Arseniy Yatsenyuk, [...] "it will be a <b>little</b> bit <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Solidarity movement in Poland".|$|R
5000|$|... "Space They Cannot Touch" [...] is {{the third}} single to be taken from Kate Miller-Heidke's debut album <b>Little</b> Eve. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> second single, [...] "Space They Cannot Touch" [...] failed to chart.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I am come {{to ask if}} {{you will}} kindly give me a dinner. My father is gone to the book-club meeting, so I thought we would try to revive old times,' he said, smiling, but sadly, for the present scene was <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> No. 5 of old times.|$|E
6000|$|... "Treachery!" [...] he cried, {{and letting}} the garment fall to the ground, he turned upon La Boulaye a face so transfigured by anger that it looked <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> usually good-humoured countenance of Captain Tardivet [...] "My keys have been stolen. By St. Guillotine, I'll have the thief hanged." ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{even among}} school-buildings, school-teachers, and school-pupils, all {{according}} to pattern and all engendered {{in the light}} of the latest Gospel according to Monotony, the older pattern into which so many fortunes have been shaped for good and evil, comes out. It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering her flowers, as Mr Bradley Headstone walked forth. It came out in Miss Peecher the schoolmistress, watering the flowers in the little dusty bit of garden attached to her small official residence, with <b>little</b> windows <b>like</b> <b>the</b> eyes in needles, and <b>little</b> doors <b>like</b> <b>the</b> covers of school-books.|$|R

Two are produced by in-house Wu-Elements producers True Master and Mathematics: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{object was}} nothing more than a part of a fallen tree, the trunk resting half in and half out of the water and several {{branches}} sticking out in as many directions.

6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] {{she said}} to John, [...] "there is {{something}} which I can only describe as biblical about your brother, something a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> prophets of the Old Testament, {{in the way he}} sees only one issue and clings to it.

6000|$|... "Hope," [...] said Leland gravely, [...] "is a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> germ in the wheat. It lies dormant; but, {{while its}} husk lasts, {{it will not}} die.

60|$|That was no easy task. They {{all stood}} looking from one road {{to another in}} perplexity. The paths {{radiated}} from <b>the</b> <b>little</b> clearing <b>like</b> <b>the</b> rays of the midday sun, and each path seemed <b>like</b> all <b>the</b> others.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you <b>like</b> <b>the</b> voyages long? I {{begin to}} see, sir. Just as they're getting near {{to where the}} {{treasure}} ain't, a <b>little</b> accident <b>like</b> <b>the</b> loss of their water-supply sends them into port and out again to start hunting all over." ...|$|R

60|$|Argument seemed child's babble indeed {{under the}} smile of Night.

500|$|In 2013 Stephen Moore, {{a member}} of the {{editorial}} forward of the Wall Street Journal said, [...] "Quoting the most-revered champion of free-market economics since Adam Smith has become a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> quoting <b>the</b> Bible."

5000|$|The Basque rosary is {{a simple}} piece of jewelry, gold or silver, 1 to 4 cm diameter. Worn with a little chain around the neck. The central opening is then often {{replaced}} by a <b>little</b> figure <b>like</b> <b>the</b> [...] Basque cross Lauburu.|$|R
60|$|Rio {{is a small}} Mediterranean; {{and what}} was fabled of the {{entrance}} to that sea, in Rio is partly made true; for here, at the mouth, stands one of Hercules' Pillars, the Sugar-Loaf Mountain, one thousand feet high, inclining over a <b>little,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Leaning Tower of Pisa. At its base crouch, like mastiffs, the batteries of Jose and Theodosia; while opposite, you are menaced by a rock-founded fort.|$|E

"If it weren't that Nora is so {{entirely a}} disciple of our cause, Tallente," [...] he said, [...] "I think I should feel a <b>little</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{man in the}} 'Pilgrim's Progress,' who stopped to pick flowers by the way.

6000|$|... 237. I {{must stop}} {{to tell you}} that 'cobbled' or 'coupled' verses mean rhymes, as opposed to the dull method of Latin verse; for we have now got an ear for jingle, and know that dove rhymes to love. Also, [...] "songs of great sentences" [...] mean didactic songs, {{containing}} much in <b>little,</b> (<b>like</b> <b>the</b> new didactic Christian painting,) of which an example (though of a later time) will give you a better idea than any description.|$|E
60|$|In Massachusetts, at Fall River, the Hon. J.F.

5000|$|The Niger River is a {{relatively}} [...] "clear" [...] river, carrying only a tenth as much sediment as the Nile because the Niger's headwaters lie in ancient rocks that provide <b>little</b> silt. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> Nile, the Niger floods yearly; this begins in September, peaks in November, and finishes by May.|$|R
60|$|About {{the going}} back to Virginia, George frankly owned that he <b>little</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> notion of {{returning}} to be entirely dependent on his mother. He gave General Lambert an idea of his life at home, and explained how little to his taste that slavery was. No. Why should he not stay in England, write more tragedies, study for the bar, get a place, perhaps? Why, indeed? He straightway began to form a plan for another tragedy. He brought portions of his work, from time to time, to Miss Theo and her sister: Hetty yawned over the work, but Theo pronounced it to be still more beautiful and admirable than the last, which was perfect.|$|R
