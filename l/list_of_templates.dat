40|$|A {{physicist}} analysing {{data from}} the LHC experiments {{will have to deal}} with data and computing resources that are distributed across multiple locations and have different access methods. Ganga helps by providing a uniform high-level interface to the different low-level solutions for the required tasks, ranging from the specification of input data to the retrieval and post-processing of the output. For LHCb and ATLAS the goal is to assist in running jobs based on the Gaudi/Athena C++ framework. Ganga is written in python and presents the user with a single GUI rather than a set of different applications. It uses pluggable modules to interact with external tools for operations such as querying metadata catalogues, job configuration and job submission. At start-up, the user is presented with a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> for common analysis tasks, and information about ongoing tasks is stored from one invocation to the next. Ganga can also be used through a command line interface. This closely mirrors the functionality of the GUI, allowing easy transition from one to the other. This paper describes the Ganga design and functionality, and illustrates its use in the distributed analysis systems of the LHCb and ATLAS experiments in the context of their 2004 data challenges...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{accurate}} {{prediction of}} ligand binding residues from amino acid sequences {{is important for}} the automated functional annotation of novel proteins. In the previous two CASP experiments, the most successful methods in the function prediction category were those which used structural superpositions of 3 D models and related templates with bound ligands in order to identify putative contacting residues. However, whilst most of this prediction process can be automated, visual inspection and manual adjustments of parameters, such as the distance thresholds used for each target, have often been required to prevent over prediction. Here we describe a novel method FunFOLD, which uses an automatic approach for cluster identification and residue selection. The software provided can easily be integrated into existing fold recognition servers, requiring only a 3 D model and <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> as inputs. A simple web interface is also provided allowing access to non-expert users. The method has been benchmarked against the top servers and manual prediction groups tested at both CASP 8 and CASP 9. Results The FunFOLD method shows a significant improvement over the best available servers and is shown to be competitive with the top manual prediction groups that were tested at CASP 8. The FunFOLD method is also competitive with both the top server and manual methods tested at CASP 9. When tested using common subsets of targets, the predictions from FunFOLD are shown to achieve a significantly higher mean Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) scores and Binding-site Distance Test (BDT) scores than all server methods that were tested at CASP 8. Testing on the CASP 9 set showed no statistically significant separation in performance between FunFOLD and the other top server groups tested. Conclusions The FunFOLD software is freely available as both a standalone package and a prediction server, providing competitive ligand binding site residue predictions for expert and non-expert users alike. The software provides a new fully automated approach for structure based function prediction using 3 D models of proteins. </p...|$|E
40|$|Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), {{also known}} as {{sleeping}} sickness, is a fatal chronic disease that is caused by flagellated protozoans, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. HAT is spread by a bite from an infected tsetse fly of the Glosina genus. Up to 60 million people in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are at a risk of infection from HAT with up to 30 000 deaths reported every year. Current chemotherapy for HAT is insufficient since the available drugs exhibit unacceptable side effects (toxicity) and parasite resistance. Novel treatments and approaches for development of specific and more potent drugs for HAT are therefore required. One approach is to target vital proteins that {{are essential to the}} life cycle of the parasite. The main interest {{of this study is to}} explore Trypanosoma brucei cathepsin B-like protease (TbCatB) structural and functional properties with the primary goal of discovering non peptide small molecule inhibitors of TbCatB using bioinformatics approaches. TbCatB is a papain family C 1 cysteine protease which belongs to clan CA group and it has emerged as a potential HAT drug target. Papain family cysteine proteases of Clan CA group of Trypanosoma brucei (rhodesain and TbCatB) have demonstrated potential as chemotherapeutic targets using synthetic protease inhibitors like Z-Phe-Ala-CHN 2 to kill the parasite in vitro and in vivo. TbCatB has been identified as the essential cysteine protease of T. brucei since mRNA silencing of TbCatB killed the parasite and resulted in a cure in mice infected with T. brucei while mRNA silencing of rhodesain only extended mice life. TbCatB is therefore a promising drug target against HAT and the discovery and development of compounds that can selectively inhibit TbCatB without posing any danger to the human host represent a great therapeutic solution for treatment of HAT. To understand protein-inhibitor interactions, useful information can be obtained from high resolution protease-inhibitor crystal structure complexes. This study aims to use bioinformatics approaches to carry out comparative sequence, structural and functional analysis of TbCatB protease and its homologs from T. congolense, T, cruzi, T. vivax and H. sapien as well as to identify non-peptide small molecule inhibitors of TbCatB cysteine proteases from natural compounds of South African origin. Sequences of TbCatB (PDB ID: 3 HHI) homologs were retrieved by a BLAST search. Human cathepsin B (PDB ID: 3 CBJ) was selected from a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> for homology modelling found by HHpred. MODELLER version 9. 10 program was used to generate a hundred models for T. congolense, T, cruzi and T. vivax cathepsin B like proteases using 3 HHI and 3 CBJ as templates. The best models were chosen based on their low DOPE Z scores before validation using MetaMQAPII, ANOLEA, PROCHECK and QMEAN 6. The DOPE Z scores and the RMSD (RMS) values of the calculated models indicate that the models are of acceptable energy (stability) and fold (conformation). Results from the different MQAPs indicate the models are of acceptable quality and they can be used for docking studies. High throughput screening of SANCDB using AutoDock Vina revealed nine compounds, SANC 00 478, 479, 480, 481, 482, 488, 489, 490 and 491, having a strong affinity for Trypanosoma spp. cathepsin B proteases than HsCatB. SANC 00488 has the strongest binding to Trypanosoma spp. cathepsin B proteases and the weakest binding to HsCatB protease. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that the complexes between SANC 00488 and TbCatB, TcCatB, TcrCatB and TvCatB are stable and do not come apart during simulation. The complex between this compound and HsCatB however is unstable and comes apart during simulation. Residues that are important for the stability of SANC 00488 -TbCatB complex are Gly 328 of the S 2 subsite, Phe 208, and Ala 256. In conclusion SANC 00488 is a good candidate for development of a drug against HAT...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Reciprocal tutoring, where peers {{take turns}} to tutor each other, is an {{interesting}} style of social learning. In the Reciprocal Tutoring System (RTS), three computational cognitive tools were designed to facilitate reciprocal tutoring of Lisp programming on the network. The first is a Petal-style of code–chunk interface, with which a tutee can enter Lisp code without making syntactic errors. The second tool is Diagnosis-Hint Tree, with which a tutor can diagnose and comment on the errors in the tutee’s program. The third one is a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> dialogue <b>templates,</b> with which the tutee and the tutor can communicate during the tutoring process. A three-phase experiment was conducted, with each phase using different cognitive tools. In addition, {{with the help of}} the cognitive tools, RTS provides a virtual learning companion that can play tutor or tutee. Evaluation results reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of peer-based learning and intelligent tutoring, with supports of different cognitive tools. Peer-based learning supported by cognitive tools is a practical and attractive alternative to intelligent tutoring systems. Exactly which type of tutor is preferred depends on the tutee’s cognitive, communication, and emotional needs in the tutorial context...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for rank level fusion which gives improved performance gain verified by experimental results. In the absence of ranked features and instead of using the entire template, we propose using K partitions <b>of</b> the <b>template.</b> The approach proposed in the paper is useful for generating sequential ranks and survivor <b>lists</b> on partitions <b>of</b> <b>template</b> to boost confidence levels by incorporating information from partitions. The proposed algorithm iteratively generates ranks for each partition <b>of</b> the user <b>template.</b> Ranks from template partitions are consolidated to estimate the fusion rank for the classification. This paper investigates rank level fusion for palmprint biometric using two approaches: (1) fixed threshold and resulting survivor list, and (2) iterative thresholds and iteratively refined survivor list. The above approaches achieve similar performances as related manifestations of fusion architecture. The experimental results support the proposition of high in-template similarity of palmprint for a user and its relevance to the intra-modal fusion framework. Experimental results using proposed approach on real palmprint data from 100 users show superior performance with recognition accuracy of 99 % as compared to recognition accuracy of 95 % achieved with the conventional approach.

The M CNP data is presented without accounting for the statistical uncertainty (although this is typically less than 0. 001) or bias and, as such, the application of a reasonable safety margin is required. The data that follows pertains to the uranyl nitrate and plutonium nitrate spheres, infinite cylinders, and infinite slabs of varying isotopic composition, reflector thickness, and molarity. Each of the cases was modeled in MCNP (version 5. 1. 40), using the ENDF/B-VI cross section set. Given a molarity, isotopic composition, and reflector thickness, the fissile concentration and diameter (or thicknesses {{in the case of the}} slab geometries) were varied.

Molecular scale pattern precision along with low cost processing promotes DSA technology as a great candidate for complementing conventional photolithography.

The DB integration eliminates the need to move large photometric datasets outside a database for redshift estimation, and utilizes the computational capabilities of DB hardware. The code is able to perform both maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, and can handle inputs of variable photometric filter sets and corresponding broad-band magnitudes. It is possible {{to take into account}} the full covariance matrix between filters, and filter zero points can be empirically calibrated using measurements with given redshifts. The <b>list</b> <b>of</b> spectral <b>templates</b> and the prior can be specified flexibly, and the expensive synthetic magnitude computations are done via lazy evaluation, coupled with a caching of results. Parallel execution is fully supported. For large upcoming photometric surveys such as the LSST, the ability to perform in-place photo-z calculation would be a significant advantage. Also, the efficient handling of variable filter sets is a necessity for heterogeneous databases, for example the Hubble Source Catalog, and for cross-match services such as SkyQuery.

This book reveals the mathematical background <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> and shows interesting findings for improving the practical use <b>of</b> <b>templates.</b> First, a framework to determine the necessary computational power for the template metalanguage is prese...|$|R

We describe the templates used for posting act tagging in the context <b>of</b> <b>template</b> selection. We extend traditional approaches used in part-of-speech tagging and dialogue act tagging by incorporating regular expressions into our templates. We close with a presentation of results that compare favorably with the application of TBL in dialogue act tagging...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCiliates are {{unicellular}} organisms, some {{of which}} perform complicated rearrangements of their DNA. Template-guided recombination (TGR) is a formal model for the DNA recombination which occurs in ciliates. TGR {{has been the subject}} of much research in formal language theory, as it can be viewed as an operation on formal languages. In TGR, a set <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> serves as a parameter to a language operation which controls which rearrangements can take place; thus, a set <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> is itself a language. Recently, the concept of equivalence in TGR has been considered: given two sets <b>of</b> <b>templates,</b> do they define the same language operation? This paper considers the related question of minimality: given a set <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> T, what is the smallest set <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> (with respect to inclusion) equivalent to T? We show that the minimal set <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> is unique, and consider closure properties and decidability questions related to minimality. We define an operational characterization for equivalence which is useful for results on minimality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} theoretical {{properties of}} the template-guided recombination operation. In particular, we consider the decidability of whether two sets <b>of</b> <b>templates</b> are equivalent, that is, whether their action {{is the same for}} all operands. We give a language-theoretic characterization of equivalence which leads to decidability results for common language classes. In particular, we show a positive answer for regular sets <b>of</b> <b>templates.</b> For context-free sets <b>of</b> <b>templates,</b> the answer is negative. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a fast {{algorithm}} for {{speeding up the}} process <b>of</b> <b>template</b> matching that uses M-estimators for dealing with outliers. We propose a particular image hierarchy called the p-pyramid that can be exploited to generate a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> ascending lower bounds of the minimal matching errors when a non-decreasing robust error measure is adopted. Then, the set of lower bounds {{can be used to}} prune the search of the p-pyramid, and a fast algorithm is thereby developed in this paper. This fast algorithm ensures finding the global minimum <b>of</b> the robust <b>template</b> matching problem in which a non-decreasing M-estimator serves as an error measure. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Index Terms —Template matching, robust template matching, M-estimator, fast algorithm. I...|$|R
