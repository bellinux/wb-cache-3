5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the first {{hour of the day}} three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Pakistan cricket {{spot-fixing}} scandal, news of which broke on the <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> of the 2010 Lord's Test match, the presentation ceremony {{at the end of the}} match (and series) was held in the Long Room, rather than on the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Francis {{then hit}} a 125-ball century as Somerset battled {{to save the}} draw and avoid {{becoming}} {{the first team to}} lose to Derbyshire for 14 months. But Francis went early on the <b>last</b> <b>morning,</b> the last man out in a collapse that started with 173 for 2 in the morning (Arul Suppiah had been dismissed with the score 172 for 1) and ended on 174 for 5. Somerset captain Ian Blackwell took seventeen fours and two sixes off Derbyshire's bowling in a 67-ball ton, but Welch came back, taking the last three wickets as Derbyshire broke their duck of 21 matches without a win and completed their Championship win since July 2004.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand, {{with only}} four front-line bowlers, {{were able to}} contain England's batsmen but {{struggled}} to dismiss them. Centuries by Len Hutton and Denis Compton ensured a large score, but England made only 307 runs on the first day, Cowie taking five wickets, and Burtt mopped up the tail on the Monday morning to claim five also. Trevor Bailey, in his first Test, troubled the early batsmen with his pace, and the fourth wicket was down at 80. But Donnelly and Smith put on 120 and Smith went on to score 96. A last-wicket partnership between Mooney and Cowie put on 57 {{and went into the}} <b>last</b> <b>morning,</b> but Cowie was injured and could not bowl in England's second innings. Fast scoring by Bill Edrich and George Mann, and less fast by an injured Cyril Washbrook, who scored 103, led to a declaration. But 299 to win in 150 minutes was too much to ask and Sutcliffe, Scott and Smith got batting practice as the game petered out.|$|E
25|$|Tasmania {{was much}} weaker {{than the other}} states in the 1960s and would not play in the Sheffield Shield until 1976–77, so {{the arrival of the}} MCC from the {{mainland}} was greeted with much anticipation. The captain of Tasmania was the wicketkeeper Len Maddocks, who had moved there from Victoria, but he lost the toss and M.J.K. Smith who rested some of his best players and decided to open the batting with Bob Barber. Smith top-scored with 96 and Jim Parks 91, though fellow-keeper John Murray was out for a duck. Colin Cowdrey made 63 and Barry Knight a quick-fire 45 not out. The fast-medium bowler Harold Allen took 3/63 and the leg-spinner Ken Flint suffered with 3/133. Smith declared on 371/9 and put Tasmania in to bat {{at the end of the}} first day, but they lost no wickets before stumps. They made steady progress, Kevin Brown and John Archer added 49 for the first wicket, Brian Richardson (112) made his maiden First Class century and Brian Patterson 67 not out, adding 48 for the last wicket with Flint (4) in a total of 322. Ken Higgs took 3/57 and Dave Allen 3/41. This was only a three-day game and Smith opened with Peter Parfitt late on the <b>last</b> <b>morning.</b> They added 46 for the first wicket, then Cowdrey (108), Parks (58) and Knight (51 not out) batted out the day with 289/7. It was the first tour match in which the MCC had not gone for a win, a policy which continued for the last few games and this rubbed some of the shine off their earlier bright cricket.|$|E
500|$|Despite his waning powers, Bradman {{compiled}} 11 centuries on the tour, amassing 2,428 runs (average89.92). His highest {{score of}} the tour (187) came against Essex, when Australia compiled a world record of 721 runs in a day. In the Tests, he scored a century at Trent Bridge, but the performance most like his pre-war exploits came in the Fourth Test at Headingley. England declared on the <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> of the game, setting Australia a world record 404 runs to win in only 345minutes on a heavily worn wicket. In partnership with Arthur Morris (182), Bradman reeled off 173 not out and the match was won with 15minutes to spare. The journalist Ray Robinson called the victory [...] "the 'finest ever' in its conquest of seemingly insuperable odds".|$|E

500|$|Constantine {{worked in}} India as a cricket coach during 1934, playing two matches in the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament. He {{was invited to}} play in the 1935 Test series against England in the West Indies, and {{although}} he arrived too late for the first Test, won by England, he played in the remaining three games of the series. In a match for Trinidad before the second Test, he and his brother Elias appeared together for the only time in a first-class match, and shared a partnership of 93. In the next Test Constantine scored 90, his highest Test score. England needed 325 to win in the fourth innings, but [...] lost early wickets. In the final stages of the match [...] Constantine was warned by the umpire for bowling Bodyline, and Grant withdrew him from the bowling attack. After the crowd protested, Constantine returned to bowl; [...] with two balls of the match left, took the final English wicket. The West Indies won by 217 runs, with Constantine taking three for 11; in the match as a whole he scored 121 runs and took five wickets. The third Test was drawn, leaving the final Test to decide the series. After making a large total, the West Indies bowled England out twice to win by an innings and record their first Test series victory. As well as taking six wickets in the game, Constantine captained the team to victory after Grant injured an ankle on the <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> and asked Constantine to assume the leadership. Peter Mason writes: [...] "Given the measures that the West Indian authorities had taken to ensure that no black man would ever captain a regional side, it was a great irony and a huge source of delight to Constantine that he should be the man to lead the team at the moment of their greatest achievement so far." [...] Once more, the press praised Constantine and hailed his achievements. In the series, he scored 169 runs at an average of 33.80 and took 15 wickets at 13.13.|$|E
2500|$|Venus and Adonis is a {{narrative}} poem by William Shakespeare {{that was published}} in 1593 and is probably Shakespeare's first publication. [...] As noted by Erwin Panofsky, the poem certainly has similarities with Titian's painting, general ones in that Venus has difficulty attracting the very young Adonis, and in specific details. [...] On his <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> she tries to physically restrain him from going hunting, but he pulls himself away, as in the Titian.|$|E
2500|$|The Adelaide Oval had {{produced}} another draw {{to leave the}} series tied on 1-1, but the three hours lost on Australia Day would have probably have given England enough {{time to make the}} extra 133 runs required for victory, {{but it would have been}} an historic victory if they had. Ted Dexter said afterwards [...] "Australia never had a hope of bowling us out - [...] not on this pitch and with their attack so depleted". This took some of the heat off Richie Benaud whose reputation for [...] "go-ahead", entertaining cricket had taken a severe blow by his refusal to declare on the <b>last</b> <b>morning.</b> The truth was that the Australian bowling attack depended heavily on the injury-prone Alan Davidson and Benaud with the young McKenzie and two batting all rounders in support. Without any turn in the pitch to help Benaud or Simpson Australia were in great trouble. With the retirement of their two premier bowlers Garth McKenzie would have to carry the Australian bowling through the 1960s.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the match}} against Leicestershire at Leicester, Jones batted at No 9 as Somerset made 190 {{in the first}} innings, to which Leicestershire replied with 358 to lead by 168 on first innings. When Jones went in, again at No 9, in Somerset's second innings, the score was 123 for seven wickets, still 45 behind. A further wicket fell early on the <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> of the match with the score at 140, still needing 28 to make Leicestershire bat again. But Jones and the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes then put on a {{partnership}} of 146 for the ninth wicket, and when Jones was out for 106, Luckes {{then went on to}} add a further 70 runs for the last wicket with Horace Hazell, enabling Somerset to save the game. The ninth wicket partnership of 146 was a record for Somerset in first-class cricket at the time, though it has been overtaken since. At 18 years and 104 days, Jones was the youngest century-maker in Somerset's history, and though there were few other runs for Jones in the 1938 season, Wisden noted in its 1939 edition that [...] "if able to spare the time he should, with greater experience, develop into a first-class batsman".|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, the {{newspaper}} consolidated its position by acquiring and merging with its <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> rival, the Washington Times-Herald. (The combined paper was officially named The Washington Post and Times-Herald until 1973, although the Times-Herald {{portion of the}} nameplate became less and less prominent after the 1950s.) The merger left the Post with two remaining local competitors, the afternoon Washington Star (Evening Star) and The Washington Daily News, which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981. The Washington Times, established in 1982 by Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon (1920–2012) under his company News World Communications, has been a local conservative rival with a circulation (...) about one-seventh that of the Post. In the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with {{the foundation of the}} tabloid-format daily The Washington Examiner by the new owners of the old Hearst paper, the San Francisco Examiner who engineered a swap trading the larger, more prosperous San Francisco Chronicle for the former Hearst [...] "flagship" [...] paper. They also started several other tabloid-format Examiners in several American cities, including briefly for two years the Baltimore Examiner which competed against the 170-year-old Baltimore Sun. The Washington Examiner ceased publication of its local newspaper on June 14, 2013, still publishing a weekly magazine and an online website focused on national politics.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{on the evening of}} the 14th of Nisan, Jews searched for leavened food in the house by candlelight. Any place into which one did not bring leavened food did not require checking. The Sages taught that one needed to check two rows in a wine cellar, as it was a place into which one brought leavened food. The House of Shammai taught that one needed to check the two front rows of the entire wine cellar, but the House of Hillel taught that one needed to check only the two outer rows that were uppermost.. Brooklyn: Mesorah Publications, 1997[...] They did not worry that perhaps a weasel had dragged leavened bread from house to house, or from place to place, for if they had, {{they would have had to}} worry that the weasel had dragged leavened bread from {{courtyard}} to courtyard and from city to city, and there would have been no end to the matter.. Rabbi Judah taught that they searched for leavened foods on the evening of the 14th, and on the morning of the 14th, and at the time that they destroyed the leavened foods (in the sixth hour – between 11 a.m. and noon). But the Sages maintained that if they did not search on the evening of the 14th, they needed to search on the 14th; if they did not search in the morning of the 14th, they needed to search at the time that they destroyed the leavened foods; if they did not search at that time, they needed to search after that time. And what they left over for the <b>last</b> <b>morning</b> meal before the Festival, they needed to put away in a hidden place, so that they should not need to search after it. Rabbi Meir taught that they could eat leavened foods through the fifth hour of the morning, and needed to burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour. Rabbi Judah taught that they could eat it through the fourth hour of the morning, needed to keep it in suspense during the fifth hour, and needed to burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour. Rabbi Judah also told that they used to put two unfit loaves of the thank offering on the roof of the Temple portico, and as long as the loaves lay there, all the people would eat leavened foods. When they would remove one loaf, the people would keep leavened foods in suspense, neither eating nor burning it. And when they removed both loaves, the people began burning their leavened foods. Rabban Gamaliel taught that unconsecrated leavened bread ( [...] , chullin) could be eaten through the fourth hour of the morning, and leavened bread that was a heave-offering ( [...] , terumah) could be eaten through the fifth hour, and they burned them at the beginning of the sixth hour. The Mishnah taught that during the entire time that one was permitted to eat leavened food, one was allowed to feed it to cattle, beasts, and birds; sell it to a gentile; and otherwise to benefit from it. When its period had passed, benefit from it was forbidden, and one was not even allowed to fire an oven or a pot range with it. Rabbi Judah taught that there was no destruction of leavened food except by burning. But the Sages maintained that one could also crumble it and throw it to the wind or casts it into the sea.|$|E
