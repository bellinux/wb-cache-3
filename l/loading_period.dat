40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the survival and success rates of Korean Osstem implants US II Plus, GS II following <b>loading</b> <b>period.</b> Materials and Methods: Dental records were obtained in total 201 patients who were treated with Korean Osstem implants US II Plus, GS II on both maxillary and mandibular anterior and posterior areas in six different clinics for 2 years from January 2007 to December 2008. Total 430 implants were evaluated clinically and radiographically using predefined success criteria prospectively and following results were obtained. Result: US II Plus, GS II implants showed high survival rates of more than 99 % and high success rates more than 90 % independent of <b>loading</b> <b>period.</b> As a result of cross analysis to evaluate clinical significance between implant <b>loading</b> <b>period</b> and success rate, the P-value of US II Plus was 0. 10 (P> 0. 05), and the P-value of GS II was 0. 17 (P> 0. 05), which showed no statistical significance. Bone quality, smoking, and edentulous state are factors that can affect the survival and success rates following differently loaded implants, but did not significantly affect in this study. Conclusion: These results suggest that selection of <b>loading</b> <b>period</b> of Korean Osstem implants US II Plus, GS II would be done carefully considering implant install area, the quality alveolar bone, the state of edentulous ridge and experience of operator, though they showed clinically good results on both maxillary and mandibular anterior an...|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we could}} not find a {{significant}} relationship between insertion torque value and ISQ value. However, insertion torque value is an important indicator for predicting the progress of implant treatment, and ISQ value is considered to be an important indicator for observing the treatment state of the implant. Currently, the insertion torque value is used as the major decision index for the determination of the <b>loading</b> <b>period</b> on the implant body. Lozano-Carrascal et al. explained that if the insertion torque value shows between 32 to 50  N cm, the implant treatment with immediate loading protocol is able to apply [40]. Also, Anitua et al. applied immediate loading protocol when the insertion torque value was 40 to 65  N cm (the average insertion torque value is 55 [*]±[*] 3.48  N cm) [29]. As described above, the insertion torque value used as a decision index of the <b>loading</b> <b>period</b> of the implant is yet undefined. Therefore, the <b>loading</b> <b>period</b> of the implant should not be determined immediately after insertion but should be determined after careful follow-up observation. When deciding to load period, the ISQ value will be an important decision index.|$|E

However, Taiwan has not finished the relevant legislative procedure so far, the power market is still engaged in without competition by Taiwan Power Company, so rate is stipulated and still needed to be checked and ratified by the government. In design of rate, in order to implement the load management strategy, the Taipower adopts the time-of-use rate to reduce the growth of peak load. For lack of base-load generation units, a certain portion of the system demand is supplied by LNG-fired and oil-fired units.

Thus hydro power stations are ending up to cater base load instead of peak load in non-monsoon months also (ex: Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, HP, J&K, Uttarakhand, etc.). TSO is responsible to ensure the provision of reserves (including spinning reserve for base load power plants by operating in frequency follow mode with upper & lower generation caps) that will allow for sudden contingencies by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each grid trading period.

In addition, a local deformation threshold for damage was found, which was similar for each of the loading regimes applied in this study. For short loading periods, these results imply that local tissue deformations determine whether muscle damage will develop and the exposure time influences the amount of tissue damage. Temporary load reliefs were inefficient in reducing deformation-induced damage, but may still influence the development of ischemia-induced damage during longer loading periods...|$|E

Both cases improved within 3 weeks after reduction of the dose, although amiodarone was continued.

Ergon Energy has identified voltage regulation as one of the key issues being faced in this area, as loads continue to grow in rural distribution networks. These voltage regulation issues cause capacity limitations on the SWER feeders. Voltage drop during peak <b>load</b> <b>periods</b> is one issue, but high voltages during low <b>load</b> <b>periods</b> caused by the Ferranti effect is another key factor on long SWER feeders. Currently, Ergon uses fixed shunt reactors to control line overvoltages during low <b>load</b> <b>periods,</b> but these reactors add to the line load during peak load conditions.

Both options aim to reduce the steady state voltage range between peak load and low load, thus freeing up additional capacity on the SWER feeder for growing load.
