Domain refinement techniques like mechanical scratching, <b>laser</b> <b>scribing</b> or plasma flame can be applied after the process of rolling {{in order to reduce}} the core losses due to mechanical or thermal stress that refines the magnetic domains. The most commonly used techniques is <b>laser</b> <b>scribing</b> due to its no-contact nature and the slight damage to the surface coating [1].

However, after the annealing of laser domain refined material, the induced thermal stress is removed and the effect of the improvement of the {{magnetic properties}} is reduced dramatically [2]. Hence, such methods cannot be used for material in e. g. wound-core transformers. In this article we report about heat-resistant <b>laser</b> <b>scribing</b> of grain oriented electrical steel.

Recent development of <b>laser</b> <b>scribed</b> graphene electrodes exhibiting a high electrical conductivity have enabled a green technology platform for supercapacitor-based energy storage, resulting in cost-effective, environment-friendly features, and consequent readiness for on-chip integration. Due to the limitation of the ion-accessible active porous surface area, the energy densities of these supercapacitors are restricted below ∼ 3 × 10 - 3 Whcm - 3.

40|$|AbstractMonolithical series {{connection}} of silicon thin-film solar cells modules performed by <b>laser</b> <b>scribing</b> plays {{a very important}} role in the entire production of these devices. Therefore a good characterization of the laser process, along with the assessment of different laser sources is compulsory. The current approach for <b>laser</b> <b>scribing</b> processes used in thin-film a-Si:H photovoltaic technology forces the use of transparent substrates [1]. In order to be able of keeping using laser for the module interconnection with other kind of substrates such as metal foil or plastic, the laser process must be performed in a direct scribing configuration, where the laser has to remove selectively the layers which make up the devices. In that sense, it is important to characterize the <b>laser</b> <b>scribing</b> process for different laser sources, owing to the different behaviour of the materials {{as a function of the}} laser parameters (wavelength, pulse width and pulse energy). In the current approach, the use of green wavelength (532 nm) is forced due to the strong dependency of the a-Si:H with this wavelength. This fact is leveraged for the two last laser steps of the monolithical interconnection of the cells, always in back-scribing configuration. On the other hand, for direct scribing configuration, the patterning must be obtained by means of selective ablation of the layers, and the morphologically affected area plays here an important role as well as the heat-affected zone. Thus, this work focuses on the use of UV laser sources working at two different temporal ranges of pulsewidth (nanosecond and picosecond) in order to eliminate the thermal affectation and improve the morphological quality of the groove...|$|E
