50|$|The Pattern 1848 {{featured}} other minor improvements, {{and used}} an improved bayonet latch with the <b>locking</b> <b>notch</b> located halfway along the bayonet bar on its upper side. Only a few batches of rifles produced for the British Army were fitted with this improvement.|$|E
50|$|The SVT-38 was {{equipped}} with a bayonet and a 10-round detachable magazine. The receiver was open-top, which enabled reloading of the magazine using five round Mosin-Nagant stripper clips. Fairly advanced features for the time were the adjustable gas system, muzzle brake, and telescopic sight rails milled into the receiver. The sniper variant had an additional <b>locking</b> <b>notch</b> for a see-through scope mount and {{was equipped}} with a 3.5× PU telescopic sight. This instrument was slightly shorter than the otherwise similar PU scope used on the Mosin-Nagant M1891/30 sniper rifle.|$|E
50|$|To load this weapon {{the hammer}} is cocked. As the hammer rotates on its axis pin, it acts upon the trigger, and the sear snaps into the cocking notch, holding the hammer. The hammer axis pin also {{supports}} the center {{arm of the}} barrel holding lever, which arm emerges and is raised high enough by its spring to press into a slot under the barrel. The rising thumbpiece {{on top of the}} barrel over the breech is then pushed forward. The barrel moves forward until its muzzle emerges from the barrel housing, compressing the recoil spring. The barrel holding lever is snapped into the <b>locking</b> <b>notch</b> in the underside of the barrel, thereby holding it in forward position for charging as shown in the drawing from Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947, page 189.|$|E
50|$|Richard F. Smith, the designer, {{created the}} <b>lock</b> <b>notch</b> welded system. Charleston Dry Dock & Machine {{was the sole}} licensee. The design {{consisted}} of steel plates with notches that allowed easy fit-up and welding. Only nine workmen were required to assemble the hull. This design saved one-quarter of the cost, and 85,000-lbs of rivets. The welding required a mere 8,000-lbs of welding wire by comparison.|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} {{implants}} {{may be used}} to treat iliac fractures in dogs, of which osteosynthesis with plate is the most described and recommended in the literature. The type of plate and screw are major factors in osteosynthesis success. The use of locking plates has been advocated for this purpose, as they do not allow the plate-bone-screw unit to shift, providing angular stability and rigidity to the system. The present study aimed to describe the unprecedented use of a <b>locking</b> <b>notched</b> head T-plate in the treatment of a caudal body of ilium fracture. A two year old male mongrel dog was attended after falling from a third floor height, with two days of evolution. The animal was in standing position, and during orthopedic examination non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb, instability, and crepitus in the right body of ilium, with considerable swelling and pain. The radiographic examination allowed diagnosing a complete fracture of the caudal body of ilium with decrease of the pelvic canal diameter. The patient underwent surgery, and the fracture was stabilized with an LCP notched head T-plate. The patient evolved satisfactorily, with good weight-bearing of the affected limb within 24 hours of surgery, and complete recovery with medical discharge after 60 days of postoperative period, with consolidation of the fracture...|$|R
5000|$|The Security-Six and its {{variants}} {{were more}} or less identical in basic design, with minor differences in sights (fixed or adjustable) and frame (round or square butt). Although medium-framed in size, the Security-Six was somewhat stronger than competing guns like the Smith & Wesson Model 19 as the Ruger featured a thicker frame without a sideplate cutout, a stronger barrel shank support, That reported catastrophic barrel failure in the six inch model revolvers, larger, stronger internal parts, and an increased diameter cylinder with offset bolt <b>locking</b> <b>notches.</b> The new revolvers were initially manufactured in a blued carbon steel finish; in 1975 stainless steel versions of all models were added to the lineup. Featuring six-round cylinders, the Security-Six series represented one of the first modern revolver designs to feature a hammer powered by a coil spring utilizing a transfer-bar firing system, and was chambered for a variety of centerfire ammunition cartridges including [...]38 Special and [...]357 Magnum, as well as [...]38 S&W and 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger). All Security-Six series revolvers came with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplied service-style wooden grips. [...] The wood grips were all manufactured for Ruger by W.F. Lett Manufacturing in New Hampshire, a now-defunct contractor. Most of these wood grips featured a diamond-shaped panel of pressed checkering, though smooth walnut grips with uncheckered panels were shipped with some commemorative models. Oversized walnut target/combat grips were also available as a factory option. During the 1980s, some of the Speed- and Service-Six models were also shipped with rubber Pachmayr grips containing the silver Ruger emblem.|$|R
40|$|Two new genera (Derrisemys and Plastomenoides) {{and three}} new species (D. sterea, P. lamberti, P. tetanetron) of plastomenine trionychids from Montana and Wyoming are described. They are unique within the Trionychidae in having the entoplastron <b>locked</b> into <b>notches</b> in the hyoplastra and restricting midline kinesis. D. sterea {{occurs in the}} Lancian NALMA (North American Land Mammal Age) of Montana and Wyoming and Puercan NALMA of Montana. P. tetanetron occurs in the Puercan NALMA of Montana. P. lamberti occurs in the Torrejonian NALMA of Montana and Tiffanian NALMA of Wyoming and Utah. Plastomenus acupictus Hay 1907 from New Mexico is {{referred}} to Derrisemys. The age of D. acupictus is uncertain but is likely from early Paleocene (Torrejonian NALMA) ...|$|R
40|$|DE 10101327 A UPAB: 20020919 NOVELTY - The vehicle has a {{frame with}} two {{deflector}} units, {{one of which}} has a motor drive, and a continuous transport element, e. g. a toothed belt, passing over the deflector units. The belt has grab-shaped holders on the side facing away from the deflector units. These engage positively and/or non-positively on rails, so that the vehicle can move along the track, and are released automatically. The grabs <b>lock</b> into <b>notches</b> etc. in the rails, which are located at the same relative distances as the grabs. The rail track is a pilaster strip on a building front, USE - Esp. climbing robot on front of buildings. ADVANTAGE - Can move automatically over flat, curved, horizontal vertical fronts...|$|R
40|$|The {{posterior}} {{portion of}} the ulnar collateral ligament, which arises from the posterior surface of the medial epicondyle, is taut in maximal flexion. The anterior portion, which takes its origin from the anterior and inferior surfaces of the epicondyle, contains three functional fibre bundles. One of these is taut in maximal extension, another in intermediate positions between middle position and full flexion while the third bundle is always taut {{and serves as a}} guiding bundle. Movements of the elbow joint are checked by the ligaments well before the bony processes forming the jaws of the trochlear <b>notch</b> <b>lock</b> into the corresponding fossae on the humerus...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} load the 2100, the Repeater Magazine spring must be pulled back and <b>locked</b> into its <b>notch</b> {{to keep it in}} place, and then, after loading the BB reservoir, shaking the rifle up and down or in a {{twisting}} motion until the magazine is fully loaded, and then snapping the magazine spring back into the normal position. Then, when the action is worked, the magnetic bolt automatically loads a round into the chamber. Working the action multiple times will put more ammunition into the barrel, but they will roll out of it because only the first round is magnetically held in place.|$|R
50|$|The block (B) is {{hollowed}} {{along its}} upper surface (I) {{to assist in}} inserting a cartridge into the firing chamber (J). To explode the cartridge the block is raised to position the firing mechanism (K) against the cartridge. The firing mechanism consists of a helical spring around a pointed metal striker, the tip of which passes {{through a hole in}} the face of the block to impact the percussion-cap of the inserted cartridge. As the lever (E) is moved forward the tumbler (G) revolves and one of its arms engages and draws back the spring until the tumbler is firmly <b>locked</b> in the <b>notch</b> (H) and the spring is held by the rest-piece (L) which is pushed into a bend in the lower part of the tumbler.|$|R
25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded <b>locks</b> had special <b>notches</b> and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break into the bank using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.|$|R
50|$|Stealths {{restraint}} system {{consists of a}} thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints. Because the over-the-shoulder portions of the restraint are not rigid, the hand grips are mounted to the lap bar.These restraints use a hydraulic locking system (rather than a ratchet system) which allows them to be pulled down to any position; when locked, they can move down to any position but not up. In contrast, a ratchet-based restraint only <b>locks</b> at each <b>notch,</b> and will often be too loose or uncomfortably tight. Stealths restraints are also held down by a belt in case the main locking system fails. In order to speed up loading, riders are asked to secure their own restraints if they are able to.This {{restraint system}} is identical to many Intamin Launch coasters, including Kingda Ka and Rita at Alton Towers.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{closes the}} breech {{end of the}} barrel and {{contains}} the firing pin. The bolt is held in place with a lever that fits into a notch. Moving this lever out of the notch will release the restraint on the bolt, allowing it to be drawn back. An extractor removes the spent cartridge, which is then ejected through the lever slot. A spring {{at the bottom of}} the magazine pushes up the reserve rounds, positioning the topmost between the bolt and the chamber at the base of the barrel. Pushing the bolt lever forward chambers this round and pushing the lever into the <b>notch</b> <b>locks</b> the bolt and enables the trigger mechanism. The complete cycle action also resets the firing pin. The Mauser rifle of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is the most famous of the bolt action types, with most similar weapons derived from this pioneering design, such as the M1903 Springfield and the Karabiner 98 Kurz rifle (abbreviated often as Kar98k or simply K98). The Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle, the British Lee-Enfield, and the Norwegian Krag-Jørgensen are examples of alternate bolt-action designs.|$|R
