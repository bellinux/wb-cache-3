25|$|Latching on {{refers to}} how the baby fastens onto the breast while breastfeeding. A good <b>latch</b> <b>means</b> that {{the bottom of the}} areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or is too close to the tip. This can cause cracked nipples and a {{reluctance}} to continue to breastfeed.|$|R
50|$|The {{charging}} {{power can}} {{be connected to the}} car in two ways. The first is a direct electrical connection known as conductive coupling. This might be as simple as a mains lead into a weatherproof socket through special high capacity cables with connectors to protect the user from high voltages. The modern standard for plug-in vehicle charging is the SAE 1772 conductive connector (IEC 62196 Type 1) in the US. The ACEA has chosen the VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2 (IEC 62196 Type 2) for deployment in Europe, which, without a <b>latch,</b> <b>means</b> unnecessary extra power requirements for the locking mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The latch {{refers to}} how the baby fastens onto the breast while breastfeeding. How the baby latches is more {{important}} than how the baby is held during nursing. A good <b>latch</b> <b>means</b> that the bottom of the areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is back inside his or her mouth, where it's soft and flexible. A shallow, or poor, latch happens when the baby does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or is too close to the tip. A shallow latch causes the sensitive nipple skin to press against the bones {{in the top of the}} baby's mouth. That can cause the the development of cracked nipples. The nipples are sore, and bleed.|$|R

It is a great pity though that it wasn't his wife who did it, instead of him. That would have been a blessing to all of us.

40|$|The requirements, capabilities, {{and unique}} design {{features}} of the instrument payload subsystem payload clamp assembly (PCA) are presented. The PCA is designed to have the flexibility to accommodate a wide payload range varying from 0. 5 m to 3 m in diameter and from 500 kg to 3000 kg mass. This is achieved by modular clamp design in connection with replaceable struts. The design features include clamping of payload in a statically determined way and actuation of clamp <b>latches</b> by <b>means</b> of single linear actuator via ropes. The vibration and TV environmental conditions for the mechanism are extremely severe. A structural and prototype model was built. Test results of the operating characteristic are presented. In addition, problems of tribology are highlighted...|$|R

The highly sophisticated devices were planted by the Soviets between 1976 and 1984, and were hidden inside a metal support bar. Information was intercepted by detecting the movements of metal bars inside the typewriter (the so-called <b>latch</b> interposers) by <b>means</b> of magnetometers. The data was then compressed and transmitted in bursts.|$|R

The authors tested the {{validity}} of the LATCH breastfeeding assessment tool, controlling for intervening variables in 133 dyads. LATCH scores, mother's evaluation of an index feed, and intended duration of breastfeeding were assessed postpartum and followed 6 weeks. Women breastfeeding at 6 weeks postpartum had higher <b>LATCH</b> scores (<b>mean</b> +/- SD = 9. 3 +/- 0. 9) than those who weaned (mean +/- SD = 8. 7 +/- 1. 0), due to only one measure, breast/nipple comfort. Women who weaned before 6 weeks reported lower breast/nipple comfort (1. 5 +/- 0. 5) than those who were still breastfeeding at 6 weeks (1. 7 +/- 0. 5, P <. 05). Total LATCH scores accounted for 7. 3 % of variance in breastfeeding duration. Total LATCH scores positively correlated with duration of breastfeeding (n = 128; r =. 26, P =. 003) and to mothers' scores (n = 132; r =. 58, P =. 001). Correlations among LATCH measures ranged from. 02 to. 51.

40|$|Background: It {{is known}} that {{breastfeeding}} offers numerous benefits for the mothers and their babies. In this sense, “Promotion of Breast Milk and Baby Friendly Hospital” initiation was started in 1992 all over the world. Systematically trainings are provided at the baby friendly hospitals {{in order to promote}} breastfeeding and to continue breastfeeding behavior. However, the efficacy of the planned counseling services for breastfeeding provided following the birth at the baby friendly hospitals reduces due to the early discharge. The present research was conducted {{in order to determine the}} effect of counseling provided on the second post partum day through home visits on breastfeeding success. Methods: Design: Randomized-controlled. The research was consisted of 100 women (intervention group= 50, control group= 50) who resided in Çorum Province, Turkey. Women of the intervention group were provided with trainings and counseling related to breastfeeding at the hospital after birth and at home following the discharge (on the second postpartum day). The data were collected using Descriptive Data Collection Form used to obtain information about mothers’ characteristics, Breastfeeding Evaluation Forms used to analyze the aspects about breastfeeding and LATCH Breastfeeding Charting System. Results: The <b>mean</b> <b>LATCH</b> scores and LATCH subscale scores of the intervention group were higher on the second postpartum day than those in the control group. Moreover, the rate of babies fed only with breast milk by the women in the intervention group during the last 24 hours was higher than those in the control group. The difference between intervention and control group was significant in terms of breastfeeding success on the second postpartum day, in favor of intervention group (p Conclusions: Counseling given through home visits on the second postpartum day affected breastfeeding success positively.  </p...|$|R
