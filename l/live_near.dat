50|$|The {{portrait}} of the hero is often decorated with peacock feathers. Some poems refer to spears and shields erected around the planted stones. Offering of Naravam (toddy = alcohol) {{to the spirit of}} the fallen hero, represented in the planted stone, is mentioned in some verses. In time these “nadukals” became Ayyanar shrines. Other warrior gods include Madurai Veeran (who <b>lived</b> <b>near</b> Madurai), Kaathavarayan (who <b>lived</b> <b>near</b> Tanjavore) and Annammar swamigal (who <b>lived</b> <b>near</b> karur).|$|R

5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} <b>live</b> <b>near</b> areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, as they do not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E

5|$|Riley {{returned}} to <b>live</b> <b>near</b> Indianapolis later in 1893, boarding {{in a private}} home in the Lockerbie district, then a small suburb. He developed a close friendship with his landlords, the Nickum and Holstein families. The home became a destination for local schoolchildren to whom Riley would regularly recite poetry and tell stories. Riley's friends frequently visited his home, and he developed a closer relationship with Eugene Debs.|$|E

5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that <b>live</b> <b>near</b> the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Estimates {{identify}} {{anywhere from}} 230 to 282 different folks and linguistic groups in Cameroon. The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into {{northern and southern}} divisions. The northern peoples are Sudanese groups, {{who live in the}} central highlands and the northern lowlands, and the Fulani, who are spread throughout northern Cameroon. A small number of Shuwa Arabs <b>live</b> <b>near</b> Lake Chad. Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of Bantu and Semi-Bantu languages. Bantu-speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones, while speakers of Semi-Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields. Some 5,000 Gyele and Baka Pygmy peoples roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small, roadside settlements. Nigerians make up the largest group of foreign nationals.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to <b>live</b> <b>near</b> the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E

She returned to <b>live</b> <b>near</b> her mother in Independence, swapping land for a nearby property that became known as the Mrs. Sam Houston House. The Texas legislature eventually gave Margaret an amount equivalent to her husband's unpaid gubernatorial salary; nevertheless, in order to afford Sam Jr.'s enrollment at medical school at the University of Pennsylvania, she rented out the Ben Lomond plantation.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{above the}} rank of {{minister}} are allowed to fly the flag at their residence provided they do not <b>live</b> <b>near</b> the capital. The tradition of flying the national flag in front of government offices had not existed in Bhutan prior to 1968 but was decreed standard practice by the Druk Gyalpo after his Secretariat was moved {{from the city of}} Taba to Tashichho Dzong in that year. The only flag day prescribed in the 1972 rules is National Day, which is held annually on December 17. National Day commemorates the crowning of Ugyen Wangchuck as the first king of Bhutan on December 17, 1907.|$|E

It was here that Smart received an intensive education in Latin and Greek. He did not complete his education at Maidstone however, as his father died on 3 February 1733, and his mother took Smart and his siblings to <b>live</b> <b>near</b> relatives in Durham after selling off {{a large portion of the}} estate to pay off Peter Smart's debts.|$|E

5|$|As {{with various}} other ethnic {{minorities}} {{who lived in}} the Soviet Union under Stalin, tens of thousands of Armenians were executed or deported. In 1936, Beria and Stalin worked to deport Armenians to Siberia in an attempt to bring Armenia's population under 700,000 in order to justify an annexation into Georgia. Under Beria's command, police terror was used to strengthen the party's political hold on the population and suppress all expressions of nationalism. Many writers, artists, scientists and political leaders, including the writer Axel Bakunts and the celebrated poet Yeghishe Charents, were executed or forced into exile. Additionally, in 1944, roughly 200,000Hamshenis (Sunni Muslim Armenians who <b>live</b> <b>near</b> the Black Sea coastal regions of Russia, Georgia and Turkey) were deported from Georgia to areas of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Further deportations of Armenians from the coastal region occurred in 1948, when 58,000 alleged supporters of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and Greeks were forced to move to Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|Over 40 {{species of}} mammals have been documented, {{including}} the black bear, coyote, cougar, bobcat, beaver, river otter, black-tailed deer, and elk. Along the coastline, California sea lions, Steller sea lions and harbor seals <b>live</b> <b>near</b> {{the shore and}} on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River. Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats, such as the big brown bat, and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel {{spend most of their}} lives well above the forest floor.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in the rain forests of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, this is the most common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata <b>live</b> <b>near</b> running water and where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at the back to much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to direct sunlight for part of the day. In Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E

5|$|While Elaine is {{depressed}} {{about the}} low quality of her apartment, Jerry overhears Harold (Glenn Shadix) and Manny (Tony Plana), {{the managers of}} his apartment building, discussing a death that makes an apartment available. Shocked by the low rent, Jerry immediately tells Elaine {{that he will be}} able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited to hear this, as s{{he will be able to}} <b>live</b> <b>near</b> Jerry. Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, <b>live</b> <b>near</b> government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} {{potential}} transfers to West Ham and Torquay, because {{neither he nor}} his wife wanted to live in either place, Irvine decided to sign for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in December 1972. Despite taking a considerable pay cut, he chose Halifax to enable his family to return to <b>live</b> <b>near</b> Burnley. Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1–0 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not trying and not deserving his wage. At the end of the 1972–73 season, the team avoided relegation to the Fourth Division on goal difference. After failing to report for the away game at Walsall on 1May 1973, to play in a testimonial match for Burnley defender John Angus, he was fined two weeks' wages and forced into extra training sessions. In the summer of 1973, Irvine left Halifax Town by mutual consent, his professional football career over at the age of 29. Despite having the option to sign for Rochdale, he joined semi-professional side Great Harwood, who played in the Northern Premier League. At Great Harwood, he played alongside two former Burnley teammates; goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw and midfielder Les Latcham. Irvine remained at the club for a number of months, before leaving midway through the 1973–74 season and retiring from football altogether.|$|E
