40|$|One’s <b>life</b> can <b>be</b> meaningful, but {{not worth}} living, or worth living, but not meaningful, which {{demonstrates}} that {{an evaluation of}} whether <b>life</b> <b>is</b> worth living differs from an evaluation of whether one’s <b>life</b> <b>is</b> meaningful. But how do these evaluations differ? As I will argue, an evaluation of whether <b>life</b> <b>is</b> worth living is a more comprehensive evaluation than the evaluation of whether one’s individual <b>life</b> <b>is</b> meaningful. In judging whether one finds life worth living, one takes into account, not only whether one’s <b>life</b> <b>is</b> meaningful, but undesirable aspects of life such as chronic pain and suffering. For example, {{a person who is}} suffering greatly, but who has lived a meaningful life, might still conclude that his or her <b>life</b> <b>is</b> not worth living. Although the famed question about the meaning of life has received most of the attention, I argue that the better and more fruitful question <b>is</b> “Is <b>life</b> worth living?” One should want, not just for one’s <b>life</b> to <b>be</b> meaningful, but for it to be worth living...|$|R
