5|$|In {{the context}} of the Austrian Empire's war with the Ottoman Empire, and similar Russian Empire's war, Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{attempted}} to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E
5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E

5|$|Events in {{the world}} {{appeared}} to play into the reformers' hands. Poland's neighbors were too occupied with wars to intervene forcibly in Poland, with Russia and Austria engaged in hostilities with the Ottoman Empire (the Russo-Turkish War and the Austro-Turkish War); the Russians also found themselves fighting Sweden (the Russo-Swedish War). At first, King Poniatowski and some reformers hoped to gain Russian support for the reforms; they attempted to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans {{as an opportunity to}} strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to another potential ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski. With the new Polish-Prussian alliance seeming to provide security against Russian intervention, King Poniatowski drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party. This alliance was also helped as the 1790 elections were more supportive of the royal faction then Potocki's; and the conservative faction gained enough new seats to threaten the reformers if they were to stay divided. With the mediation of Scipione Piattoli, Potocki and Poniatowski begun to reach a consensus on a more constitutional monarchy approach, and started to draft a constitutional document.|$|E

We trace collaborative learning as an interactive, layered building of understanding among learners. We present a study of four students who participate in collaborative, mathematical problem solving within the online environment of Virtual Math Teams-Chat (VMT Chat). Similar to other computer-meditated communication systems, VMT Chat presents communicative affordances and constraints to users that influence their discursive interactions. We are interested in how students use the affordances of the virtual environment and what mathematical ideas and <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> are evidenced in their interactions. Correspondingly, VMT Chat presents methodological affordances and constraints to researchers such as us interested to investigate how students exchange and develop emergent mathematical ideas and <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning.</b> In this chapter, we also explore an analytic approach for inquiring into the archived interactions of students collaborating through VMT Chat on mathematical problem solving...|$|R

25|$|To {{establish}} a mathematical statement as a theorem, a proof is required, that is, a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> from axioms {{in the system}} (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated. However, the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement. Although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish {{the status of a}} statement as a theorem. The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.|$|E
25|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} and foreign correspondent Jonathan Steele {{published an article}} based on this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning.</b> In an in-depth study of Iranian attitudes to Jews {{and the state of}} Israel, Hamburg professor of Islamic studies, Katajun Amirpur has argued that, in context, Ahmadinejad had been quoting Ayatollah Khomeini's words about the imminent appearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and had tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. It follows, in her view, that the text could not imply any intention to destroy Israel or annihilate the Jewish people, since Khomeini's quoted statement preceding it prophesied that the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime would disappear, not that the Russian or Iranian people would thereby be extinguished.|$|E
25|$|Implicit {{references}} are quotation from Paul, especially indirect or unattributed, or expressing ideas and phrases {{that appear in}} his works. This use or reference implies the material quoted was in existence {{at the time the}} external evidence was created. For example, the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians is named by Irenaeus in the mid-2nd century, as well as Justin Martyr and Ignatius of Antioch; it is impossible for this letter to have been written after their time. On the other hand, lack of witness by ancient sources suggests a later date, an argument from silence. However, use of this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> is dangerous, because of the incompleteness of the historical record: many ancient texts are lost, damaged, or have been revised.|$|E

40|$|This article {{goes back}} to museification as a {{particular}} way of construction and legitimation of collective memory. Museification generally refers to political and cultural actions deployed by institutions and civil servants that are aimed at selecting and placing an "object"—whether cultural or natural, as well as individuals or communities— within <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> and speeches that "petrify" the historical and cultural meanings of these objects. In this paper, we understand museums as institutional places par excellence in which memorial state activities tend to converge. In particular, the article explores two {{cases in which the}} museification process can be clearly identified. First, the controversy surrounding the proposal of including the towel of the recognized guerrilla leader Manuel Marulanda Vélez, (Tirjofijo), in the collections of the National Museum of Colombia in early 2001. Secondly, the article explores the case of some indigenous communities located in the country's southern jungles, in which the state <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>of</b> the territorial control seem to conceive indigenous people and their lands as analogous to "eco-museums". We try to argue how state initiatives on social memory are essentially a field of paradoxes and social struggles. To do this, we rely on a theoretical discussion about memory studies and their relation to specific categories of the museological theory...|$|R
50|$|The Dakota Sioux of Minnesota {{believed}} {{in a water}} monster called Unktehi, which was thought to resemble a giant buffalo.

25|$|If Hecate's cult {{spread from}} Anatolia into Greece, it is {{possible}} it presented a conflict, as her role was already filled by other more prominent deities in the Greek pantheon, above all by Artemis and Selene. This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> lies behind the widely accepted hypothesis {{that she was a}} foreign deity who was incorporated into the Greek pantheon. Other than in the Theogony, the Greek sources do not offer a consistent story of her parentage, or of her relations in the Greek pantheon: sometimes Hecate is related as a Titaness, and a mighty helper and protector of humans. Her continued presence was explained by asserting that, because she was the only Titan who aided Zeus in the battle of gods and Titans, she was not banished into the underworld realms after their defeat by the Olympians.|$|E
25|$|Chief Justice Roberts' dissent {{focused on}} whether the process afforded the Guantanamo detainees in the Detainee Treatment Act were an {{adequate}} substitute for the Habeas protections the Constitution guaranteed. By arguing in the affirmative, he implied {{that the issue of}} whether the detainees had any Suspension Clause rights was moot (since, if they did, he found that those rights were not violated anyway). This <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> was arguably more in line with the plain reading of Johnson v. Eisentrager (1950) (which denied German prisoners of war habeas rights primarily due to both practical logistical concerns and the determination that they had been afforded an adequate substitute: traditional military war crimes trials, which complied with the Geneva Conventions) than that of Justice Scalia, and also avoided the more controversial and complicated issue of whether the detainees were entitled to file habeas petitions in the first place.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Steinberg was estopped from defending his copyright {{on the grounds that}} he had taken no action over a period of eight years to stop others from counterfeiting his posters and adapting his idea to other locations, and had not acted in response to newspaper ads promoting the movie. The court rejected this argument, holding that the defendants had not proved any of the elements of estoppel: (1) a representation in fact; (2) reasonable reliance thereon; and (3) injury or damage resulting from denial by the party making the representation. While the defendants argued that Steinberg had made a representation of his acquiescence to their use of his image in the movie poster by not complaining about the ads in the newspaper, the judge rejected this <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>reasoning</b> and noted that the defendants had continued to use the infringing advertisements even after becoming aware of Steinberg's objections. Further, there was no existing relationship between the parties that could give rise to estoppel.|$|E
