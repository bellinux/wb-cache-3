40|$|Which {{government}} functions {{should be}} decentralized (resp. centralized) once <b>lobbying</b> behavior <b>is</b> taken into account? We {{find that the}} answer largely depends on how {{the interests of the}} regional <b>lobbies</b> <b>are</b> positioned with respect to the function to be decentralized (resp. centralized). When regional lobbies have conflicting interests, then <b>lobbying</b> <b>is</b> less damaging for social welfare under centralization than under decentralization. On the contrary, when regional lobbies have aligned interests, then <b>lobbying</b> <b>is</b> less damaging for social welfare under decentralization, provided that policy spillovers on the non-organized groups are not too strong.

For the most part, the individuals and groups that comprise it are only doing what other special interest groups do, but doing it very much better. By contrast, pro-Arab interest groups, in so far as they exist at all, are weak, which makes the Israel Lobby’s task even easier.|$|E
