The {{goal is to}} be able to describe the principal components using a compact set of time-frequency parameters using Gabor <b>logons</b> as the dictionary elements. The proposed algorithm is similar to the original matching pursuit [12] and the discrete Gabor decomposition [58], except that it is directly implemented in the time-frequency domain rather than in the time domain. This implementation is preferred over the standard MP for two reasons. First, the principal components are already in the time-frequency domain, and inverting them back to the time domain would increase the computational complexity. Second, this offers a way of directly modeling the time-frequency energy distribution.|$|R
