5|$|At {{the time}} there were two {{suburban}} tramways on the east side, the Ekeberg Line (opened in 1919) and the Østensjø Line (1923). Only the latter would {{be connected to the}} T-bane; the Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway, but three new lines were to be built—the Grorud <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> the north side and the Furuset <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> the south side of Groruddalen and the Lambertseter <b>Line</b> <b>on</b> the east of Nordstrand. These areas were all chosen as new suburbs for Oslo, and would quickly need a good public transport system; suburban lines would first be built out extending from the existing tramway, and later a final section with tunnel to the central station would be built. The Lambertseter Line was opened in 1957, from Brynseng to Bergkrystallen while the Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler in 1958.|$|E

5|$|The RTA, by then renamed to Sound Transit, began {{a series}} of public {{hearings}} in late 1997 to determine the routing of the line. Tukwila leaders preferred a route serving the Southcenter Mall that would add six to seven minutes of travel time and $150 million in project costs. The Sound Transit Board chose an at-grade <b>line</b> <b>on</b> International Boulevard as their preferred routing in February 1999, which the city argued would interfere with their near-term plans to revamp the street. The board's preferred route, selected in November 1999, included an at-grade <b>line</b> <b>on</b> International Boulevard through Tukwila and an elevated station at South 154th Street with a park and ride facility.|$|E

5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard <b>line.</b> <b>On</b> the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
