40|$|Abstract. Autonomous {{underwater}} <b>lurk</b> {{vehicle is}} {{a new type of}} autonomous underwater vehicle, and the advantages of autonomous underwater <b>lurk</b> vehicle are intelligent, long-term working, covert, high-performance and recyclables, etc. It leads great contribution to the civilian and military application. In this paper, the frames were built first. Then, based on rigid body momentum and moment of momentum theorem, the dynamics equation of autonomous underwater <b>lurk</b> vehicle was built. At last, the landing motion of the autonomous underwater <b>lurk</b> vehicle was simulated. The simulation results show preliminarily that the autonomous underwater <b>lurk</b> vehicle can steady complete the required landing motion...|$|R

At the camp, they start singing songs, but are soon attacked by an unseen figure <b>lurking</b> in the woods, and their fates are left unknown.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish <b>lurking</b> in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials when the body was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E

5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to hold it together, and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were <b>lurking</b> on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E
5|$|The German colony at Madang on Kaiser-Wilhelmsland (the New Guinea mainland) was {{occupied}} on 24 September, although the German armed merchant raider SMS Cormoran—which was <b>lurking</b> nearby—escaped undetected. Over {{the next two}} months the remaining outposts were also occupied. Meanwhile, the German East Asiatic Squadron steamed across the Pacific before surprising and sinking a British force off Coronel on 1 November. After rounding Cape Horn into the Atlantic and attempting a raid on the Stanley naval station, the squadron was itself destroyed by a more powerful British force during the Battle of the Falkland Islands on 8 December 1914. Later it was alleged that widespread looting and destruction of civilian property by Australian troops occurred during this period. Indeed, ill-discipline among the Australian force appears to have been an issue—perhaps due to the haste with which the AN had been raised and the poor character of some of those that were enlisted. Claims in the Australian media of criminal behaviour caused considerable controversy at the time, and later led to a parliamentary enquiry. In the end a number of soldiers were court martialled and imprisoned for looting and theft, although more serious allegations, including rape, also arose.|$|E

50|$|Lurkers <b>lurk</b> {{rather than}} {{participate}} {{for a variety}} of reasons. A majority of lurkers profess that they <b>lurk</b> simply because they think that browsing is enough for them. Users also choose to <b>lurk</b> in order to find examples to follow when they decide to participate, avoid making redundant posts or contributions, and learn more about the topics of conversation. A lurker’s need to learn about the community before contributing also explains why almost twice as many users <b>lurk</b> on technical support communities where more information is required to post as compared to health support communities. Researchers have shown that different motivations underlie reading, contributing, and moderating web forums. Pure lurkers more often are motivated {{by the fact that the}} community is the only place to find a certain kind of content, while moderators and contributors are motivated by either duty or feelings of attachment.|$|R
