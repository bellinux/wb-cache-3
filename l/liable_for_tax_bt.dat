25|$|Several charges {{described}} as taxes are not, in the literal sense, actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> {{on the full}} amount, but can set the withholding against his overall tax liability. If the amount withheld {{is less than the}} tax payable, the recipient is still <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the tax payable, the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a withholding tax, discharges the entire tax liability of the recipient.|$|R

50|$|In {{the later}} 1770s, the Weekly Magazine {{was brought to}} the notice of the London {{exchequer}} for carrying news articles, making it <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax.</b> As a result, in 1777, Ruddiman created a new distinct title, Ruddiman's Weekly Mercury, for news and the Magazine, which became free of news content, became non-liable for stamp duty. In December 1779, from the 47th volume, it was retitled the Edinburgh Magazine, or, Weekly Amusement.

50|$|Between 1988 and 1996, A Beka Book held {{tax exempt}} status, because its profits were channeled into PCC as a tax-exempt {{religious}} organization or educational institution.

50|$|The {{level of}} ACT {{was linked to}} the basic rate of income tax between 1973 and 1993. The March 1993 Budget of Norman Lamont cut the ACT rate and tax credit to 22.5% from April 1993, and 20% from April 1994. These changes were {{accompanied}} with a cut of income tax on dividends to 20%, while the basic rate of income tax remained at 25%. Persons <b>liable</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> were lightly affected by the change, because income tax liability was still balanced by the tax credit received, although higher rate tax payers paid an additional 25% tax on the amount of the dividend actually received (net), as against 20% before the change.|$|R
