5|$|There are 53 {{municipalities}} of Finland in which Finnish {{is not the}} sole official language. In Finland, as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak Finnish, 5.3% Swedish and 0.04% Sami languages. Both Finnish and Swedish are official languages of Finland. Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers. A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the <b>linguistic</b> <b>minority</b> proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, {{it is possible for}} the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years. Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital Helsinki and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, Turku. On the Åland archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in Ostrobothnia.|$|E

40|$|How is the {{development}} and revitalization of the languages of <b>linguistic</b> <b>minorities</b> officially addressed in India? What policies deal with multilingual education and what impact have they had on <b>linguistic</b> <b>minorities?</b> The number of languages in India remains a political question and census categorization of minority languages impacts that number. Within the Indian Constitution there are many safeguards for <b>linguistic</b> <b>minorities.</b> How have their rights, both linguistic and educational, been addressed? Over the years, national education policies have recommended such strategies as the Three Language Formula and considered education for <b>linguistic</b> <b>minorities.</b> One important question: What actually happens in education for <b>linguistic</b> <b>minorities</b> in India? This paper examines {{the development}} over time of India’s language policies pertaining to <b>linguistic</b> <b>minorities</b> as revealed in the census, constitution and national education policies, and citing the work of current Indian socio-linguists. Issues include national versus state jurisdiction, positive rights versus negative rights, <b>linguistic</b> versus relative <b>minorities,</b> the transitions from one language to another in the school, standardization’s impact, and natural bilingualism versus planned bilingualism...|$|R

The current Official Languages Act was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's efforts to address two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of <b>linguistic</b> <b>minority</b> communities.

The Polish minority has been decreasing substantially since World War II as education in Polish was difficult to obtain, while Czech authorities did not permit bilingual signs to maintain Polish awareness among the population.|$|E
25|$|Lombards of Sicily are a <b>linguistic</b> <b>minority</b> {{living in}} northern-central Sicily who speak an {{isolated}} variety of Gallo-Italic dialects, the so-called Gallo-Italic of Sicily.

Because of linguistic differences among the Gallo-Italic dialects of Sicily, it is supposed that there were independent immigration routes.

25|$|Since 1982, both parliaments {{have had}} {{to comply with the}} Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalized a number of {{fundamental}} human rights and educational rights of minorities in all provinces (education is a provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Prior to this, Quebec was effectively the sole province required constitutionally to finance the educational needs of its <b>linguistic</b> <b>minority.</b> Ontario and Quebec are both required to finance schools for their principal religious minorities (Roman Catholic in Ontario, Protestant in Quebec), but only in Quebec is the minority almost completely composed of speakers of the minority language. (Quebec also provided English schools for anglophone Roman Catholics.) In 1997, an amendment to the constitution allowed for Quebec to replace its system of denominational school boards with a system of linguistic school boards.|$|E
500|$|Article 30 confers {{upon all}} {{religious}} and linguistic minorities {{the right to}} set up and administer educational institutions of their choice in order to preserve and develop their own culture, and prohibits the State, while granting aid, from discriminating against any institution {{on the basis of the}} fact that it is administered by a religious or cultural minority. The term [...] "minority", while not defined in the Constitution, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean any community which numerically forms less than 50% of the population of the state in which it seeks to avail the right under Article 30. In order to claim the right, it is essential that the educational institution must have been established as well as administered by a religious or <b>linguistic</b> <b>minority.</b> Further, the right under Article 30 can be availed of even if the educational institution established does not confine itself to the teaching of the religion or language of the minority concerned, or a majority of students in that institution do not belong to such minority. This right is subject to the power of the State to impose reasonable regulations regarding educational standards, conditions of service of employees, fee structure, and the utilisation of any aid granted by it.|$|E
