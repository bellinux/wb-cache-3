50|$|Engine-driven {{fans are}} often {{regulated}} by a viscous-drive clutch from the drivebelt, which slips {{and reduces the}} fan speed at low temperatures. This improves fuel efficiency by not wasting power on driving the fan unnecessarily. On modern vehicles, further regulation of cooling rate is provided by either variable speed or cycling radiator fans. Electric fans are controlled by a thermostatic switch or the engine control unit. Electric fans also {{have the advantage of}} giving good airflow and cooling at <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> or when stationary, such as in slow-moving traffic.|$|E

5000|$|The Rhythm, three door or five door, this trim added remote central locking, {{colour coded}} wing mirrors, two side airbags and an <b>engine</b> <b>rev</b> counter. The 1.4 HDi diesel and the 1.0i petrol engines were both {{available}} with this trim.|$|R
25|$|Throughout the 2000s (decade), Formula One {{cars had}} become {{extremely}} complex, efficient and reliable, {{so much so}} that actual racing between drivers began to become less and less common. 2009 saw the introduction of many new rules and regulations (including <b>engine</b> <b>rev</b> limits, an adjustable front wing and disproportionate wing sizes) to encourage overtaking. <b>Engines</b> were <b>revving</b> up to 20,000 rpm and were initially limited to 19,000 rpm for 2009; but then this was lowered to 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.|$|R
2500|$|The ballet {{begins with}} the sound of a car <b>engine</b> <b>revving.</b> In the Prologue, Luca, a drifter, arrives in the town of Harmony somewhere in the USA with a {{rucksack}} on his back. A billboard reads: [...] "Welcome to... Harmony. Population 375. Drive safely!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{base engine}} was the [...] inline-six in all models except the Gran Torino Squire station wagon and the Gran Torino Sport which both had a 302-2V small-block V8 as standard. Available engines {{included}} the 302-2V, a 351-2V [...] "Windsor" [...] or [...] "Cleveland", a 351C-4V [...] "Cobra Jet" [...] (CJ), a 400-2V, and a 429-4V. The 400-2V {{was a new}} engine to the Torino line-up, and {{was part of the}} 335 series engine family like the 351 Cleveland. The 429-4V was not a high-performance engine like the Cobra Jets of previous years; instead, it was a high torque, <b>low</b> <b>revving</b> <b>engine.</b> Emissions, <b>low</b> lead and fuel economy requirements had become more strict for 1972. To meet these requirements, compression ratios on all Torino engines were dropped to at least 8.5:1, and all engines ran on regular gasoline. These engines generally produced less power than their predecessors in 1971, although this was exaggerated due to the switch to the new SAE net bhp ratings from the SAE gross figures used in 1971. As a result, the figures are not directly comparable. [...] All models came equipped with a three-speed manual transmission as a standard equipment. The Cruise-O-Matic remained optional, but was a mandatory option for the 351-2V, 400-2V and 429-4V. The 351-4V CJ required either the 4-speed or the Cruise-O-Matic as mandatory options.|$|R

50|$|Despite their OHV pushrod design, the <b>engines</b> can <b>rev</b> to 6,500 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Wroooom is an onomatopoeia that {{represents}} {{the sound of an}} <b>engine</b> <b>revving</b> up. It also describes the act of purposefully operating a motor vehicle at high speeds so as to create loud engine noises. The word is a common early childhood sound, and is used in speech therapy techniques. It is also an example of a cross-linguistic onomatopoeia.|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the more}} {{advanced}} standalone/race E.C.U.s include functionality such as launch control, operating as a rev limiter while the car is at the starting line to keep the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> in a 'sweet spot', waiting for the clutch to be released to launch the car as quickly and efficiently as possible. Other examples of advanced functions are: ...|$|R
25|$|The CSR, has {{a variety}} of other {{features}} which enhance its performance. There are no power brakes or power steering, making the CSR extremely responsive and extremely agile. The clutch also engages extremely high, allowing for quick shifts while racing. In addition, the flywheel is very light. This makes heel-and-toeing extremely quick and easy as the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> up very quickly with little momentum.|$|R

Total pressures in the rotor exit flow field were measured by pitot probe at up to 8 radial locations between 10 % and 90 % channel height. 2 D-velocity vectors and turbulence intensities in the tator-rotor gap and in the rotor exit field were measured by a Laser- 2 -Focus (L 2 F) anemometer at 20 %, 50 % and 90 % height. Investigations were performed for a low and high pressure ratio, covering at least one period of <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> order (up to 9 stator passages). Only time averaged results are presented and evaluated. A Fourier analysis reveals the harmonic contents of the <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> order flow field.

50|$|One of Burden’s most {{reproduced}} and cited pieces, Trans-Fixed {{took place}} on April 23, 1974 at Speedway Avenue in Venice, California. For this performance, Burden lay face up on a Volkswagen Beetle and had nails hammered into both of his hands, {{as if he were}} being crucified on the car. The car was pushed out of the garage and the <b>engine</b> <b>revved</b> for two minutes before being pushed back into the garage.|$|R
50|$|Fifth on {{the grid}} was the Stuck/Boutsen/Bouchut Kremer K8, then came {{the first of the}} GT1 cars: three Ferrari F40s, headed by the Ennea Ferrari Club #41 of Ayles/Monti/Mancini, {{shocking}} the McLaren teams by beating out the Kokusai McLaren and the works Venturi. The EuroMotorsport Ferrari prototype was kept out of most of the qualifying while the ACO argued with the team about checking the maximum <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> - {{in the end it was}} 17th {{on the grid}}.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 the Pelland Mk II Steam Car was built, {{this time}} by Pelland Engineering in the UK. It had a three-cylinder {{double-acting}} engine in a 'broad-arrow' configuration, mounted in a tubular steel chassis with a Kevlar body, giving a gross weight of just 1050 lb. Uncomplicated and robust, the steam engine was claimed to give trouble-free, efficient performance. It had huge torque (...) at zero <b>engine</b> <b>revs,</b> and could accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in under 8 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The Venom GT {{is powered}} by a twin {{turbocharged}} 427 cuin L GM LSX engine. The LSX architecture incorporates specific design features such as reinforced internal components and additional head bolts with aluminum heads including twin Precision dual ball bearing turbochargers.

30|$|Drivers of {{cars with}} <b>low</b> <b>engine</b> {{capacity}} {{and with an}} annual kilometrage of less than 15.000  km, never or rarely exceed speed limits on motorways.|$|R
50|$|When {{a car is}} {{in first}} gear, small {{variations}} in engine speed translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking. However, {{with a combination of}} clutch control and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the clutch plate allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine.|$|R
5000|$|The GV4s {{also became}} {{powerful}} enough to contest for overall wins in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Oreca Dallaras running the GV4 finishing fifth and sixth in [...] {{as well as an}} overall victory for Doran Lista at the Rolex 24 at Daytona the same year. The engine's reliability record at Le Mans was still patchy and, while it could challenge for pole in Domes and Dallaras, the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> had to be reduced to ensure it survived the race.|$|R
5000|$|The Advance V4 {{aero engine}} {{was made from}} two V-twin engines bolted {{together}} back-to-back. One of the engines would have been running backwards {{and it is not}} known how the crankshafts were joined. The carburettor was a Brown & Barlow type 65DU or GU as used by cars of the time and fed a one-into-two-into-four manifold. With an output of [...] and a capacity of 2290 cc, the flywheel was 9.25 in in diameter and weighed 36 lb. The <b>engine</b> <b>revved</b> to 1,800 rpm.|$|R
25|$|Variable-geometry or variable-nozzle turbochargers use {{moveable}} vanes {{to adjust}} the air-flow to the turbine, imitating a turbocharger of the optimal size throughout the power curve. The vanes are placed {{just in front of}} the turbine like a set of slightly overlapping walls. Their angle is adjusted by an actuator to block or increase air flow to the turbine. This variability maintains a comparable exhaust velocity and back pressure throughout the <b>engine’s</b> <b>rev</b> range. The result is that the turbocharger improves fuel efficiency without a noticeable level of turbocharger lag.|$|R
25|$|Another {{addition}} is the Media Nav system, already introduced {{earlier in}} the same year on the Lodgy, consisting of a 7-inch touchscreen display with multimedia functions and a navigation software included. Other new features are speed limiter, cruise control, rear parking sensors, and front and side airbags, as well as ABS and ESP, as standard. The interior has been significantly revised, with new chromed elements added, and the hood is now supported with a strut. A new Eco button, placed on the dashboard, limits the <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> to 4,000 rpm.|$|R
50|$|Under the bonnet {{only the}} {{original}} engine block and head must remain from the production car but <b>engine</b> <b>revs</b> {{are limited to}} 8500 RPM to aid reliability and reduce costs. Racing transmissions and suspensions could be incorporated, but the suspension had to remain true to the original design of the road going model. Closer racing was also engineered into the rules by having different weight limits for front- and rear-wheel drive, and by limiting overall wheel and tyre sizes and by restricting each car to only six tyres per event.|$|R
