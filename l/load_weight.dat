50|$|A {{curtain wall}} system is an outer {{covering}} {{of a building}} in which the outer walls are non-structural, but merely keep the weather out and the occupants in. As the curtain wall is non-structural {{it can be made}} of a lightweight material, reducing construction costs. When glass is used as the curtain wall, a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall façade does not carry any dead <b>load</b> <b>weight</b> from the building other than its own dead <b>load</b> <b>weight.</b> The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and seismic forces acting on the building, and its own dead <b>load</b> <b>weight</b> forces.|$|E

50|$|The M809 Series 5-ton 6x6 truck (G908) was {{a family}} of heavy {{tactical}} trucks built for the United States Armed Forces. The basic cargo version was designed to transport a 5-ton (4,500 kg), 14 ft long load over all terrain in all weather. In on-road service the <b>load</b> <b>weight</b> was doubled.

5000|$|For {{many types}} of trucks, knowing the <b>loaded</b> <b>weight</b> is {{important}} for operating safely and maximising payload whilst avoiding fines for overloading. There are two ways that a driver can determine the approximate <b>loaded</b> <b>weight</b> [...] - [...] either by driving to an in-ground scale, or using on-board scales. On-board scales use either load cell technology or pressure readings from air suspension to calculate the weight on the vehicle axles. Operating the truck at its optimal payload ensures that the owner minimises his running costs whilst maximising his profit.|$|R

50|$|Anti-roll bars provide {{two main}} {{function}}s. The first function is {{the reduction of}} body lean. The reduction of body lean {{is dependent on the}} total roll stiffness of the vehicle. Increasing the total roll stiffness of a vehicle does not change the steady state total <b>load</b> (<b>weight)</b> transfer from the inside wheels to the outside wheels, it only reduces body lean. The total lateral load transfer is determined by the CG height and track width.|$|E
5000|$|Counterbalance valves, {{also called}} load holding valves or {{over-center}} valves, serve as hydraulic {{resistance to the}} actuating cylinder when the <b>load</b> <b>weight</b> is required {{to be held in}} position for a period of time. These come in two distinct configurations, both highly effective in improving load handling safety during a loss of hydraulic pressure: essentially locking the lift/dump cylinder in-place, preventing potential free fall of the load in the event of hydraulic failure.|$|E

The front-mounted engine drove {{the rear wheels}} via a four-speed gear box and a rotating steel drive-shaft. The truck came with steel wheels, which were doubled at the back, and shod with solid rubber tyres. The maximum usable <b>load</b> <b>weight</b> was reckoned at 4,000 kg.|$|E
