40|$|Ultrafiltration is an {{attractive}} process for virus removal from bioproducts owing to its high throughput {{as well as the}} fact that the operation is carried out under ambient conditions (damage to proteins is highly limited). The principal concern regarding the adoption of conventional ultrafiltration membranes for virus removal is the possibility of the virus passing through abnormally large pores or surface imperfections on the membrane surface. The chief principle behind the present work is to pretreat the membrane by blocking the abnormally large pores using latex particles. Experimental work was conducted to validate this pretreatment using the bacteriophage phi x 174 as a model virus. The results attained were highly encouraging. Different sizes of latex particles were tested by treating a 100 KD molecular weight cut-off membrane, and the transmission of phage (suspended in buffer) through this membrane assessed. In the absence of any particle pretreatment, a virus clearance of 4. 78 <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>value</b> was observed for this membrane. The transmission of phage through the membrane could be reduced by an order of magnitude using 0. 11 micron latex particles, or two orders of magnitude using a combination of 0. 11 and 0. 50 micron particles.

40|$|Background: Biofilms are {{aggregates}} of microbial cells {{enclosed in}} an extracellular polymeric substance {{and attached to}} surfaces. Biofilm formation and its resistance to antimicrobials is becoming a serious challenge in food industries and hospital settings. The aim of this work was to study the formation of biofilm by E. coli on Stainless steel (SS) and Polystyrene Tissue Culture Plate (TCP) at 10 and 27 and deg;C, and also to assess the action Hydrogen Peroxide (HP), Para Acetic Acid (PAA), Sodium Hypochlorite (SH) and mixture of PAA + SH disinfectants against the biofilm. Methods: 200 and micro;L of 108 suspension of E. coli ATCC 29922 was inoculated on the SS and into the wells of TCP, incubated at 10 and 27 and deg;C for 24, 48 72 and 168 hours. Biofilm developed at each incubation hour above was quantified by bead-vortex method followed by agar plating. The action of disinfectants was tested on 168 hours biofilm. The surfaces {{were exposed to the}} disinfectants and incubated at 27 and deg;C for 10 minutes, followed by deactivation for 5 minutes. Cells that resisted disinfectants action were vortexed and enumerated by agar plating. Results: From the results E. coli developed higher biofilm on SS than TCP at 72 hours and 27 and deg;C.

Application of {{dressing}} material is generally aimed {{to maintain a}} moist environment at the wound interface, allow gaseous exchange, prevent the wound directly contact to microorganisms and remove excess exudates. The wound dressing synthesized from biocompatible materials are of interest due to the desired properties such as non-toxic, non-allergenic, non-adherent, and easily removed without trauma. The objective {{of this research is}} to synthesize a multifunctional peptide dressing which could provide an antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa planktonic bacteria and biofilms and help tissue regeneration. Sample suspensions of the 6 % (w/v) BSA and 8 % (w/v) peptide extract heated for 30 minutes were used for hydrogel dressing preparation. For gel pad casting, 8 % (w/v) BSA also heated to 100 °C for 20 minutes followed by rapid cooling in cold water. To crosslink their structure, 0. 25 % (w/v) NaCl solution was added. The suspensions were later cooled down at 4 °C for 2 hours. Both hydrogel dressings contained either 10 µg/ml of ciprofloxacin or 10 µg/ml of tobramycin and 10 µM of astaxanthin. The antimicrobial test indicated that the BSA hydrogel had the activity against planktonic cells with the <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>value</b> of 6. 19 ± 0. 12 for ciprofloxacin and 6. 50 ± 0. 51 for tobramycin.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Food pathogens are of great public health significance, but the spoilage bacteria cause tremendous loss to the food industry. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of selected bioprotectants on the quality and microbial characteristics of vacuum-packaged turkey sausage at 4 ⁰C over a period of 14 days. The bioprotectant used in this study was MicroGARD[TM] 510 (MG 510) which is essentially cultured dextrose and MicroGARD[TM] 300 (MG 300) which is cultured skim milk. Finely comminuted sausages were made with typical curing and seasoning ingredients and seven treatments were created using MG 510 and MG 300 at concentrations of 0. 2 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 45 % and 0. 4 %, 0. 7 % and 0. 9 %, respectively, plus one control without bioprotectant treatment. The sausages were cooked, vacuum packaged, and stored in a refrigerator at 4 ⁰C for evaluation at 0, 7 and 14 days. Samples were tested for pH, water holding capacity, a[w] [subscript], color, texture profile, puncture resistance and microbial content. The microbial analysis was done by plating on yeast and mold (YM) agar, MRS media, and plate count agar (PCA) to determine the effectiveness of the treatments. The <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> due to cooking were significant (P [lesser than] 0. 05) for all the treatments.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop an integrated process lethality model for pressure-assisted thermal processing (PATP) taking into consideration the lethal contribution of both pressure and heat on spore inactivation. Assuming that the momentary inactivation rate was dependent on the survival ratio and momentary pressure-thermal history, a differential equation was formulated and numerically solved using the Runge-Kutta method. Published data on combined pressure-heat inactivation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spores were used to obtain model kinetic parameters that considered both pressure and thermal effects. The model was experimentally validated under several process scenarios using a pilot-scale high-pressure food processor. Using first-order kinetics in the model resulted in the overestimation of <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> compared to the experimental values. When the n th-order kinetics was used, the computed accumulated lethality and the <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> were found to be in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Within the experimental conditions studied, spatial variation in process temperature resulted up to 3. 5 log variation in survivors between {{the top and bottom of}} the carrier basket. The predicted <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> of B. amyloliquefaciens spores in deionized water and carrot purée had satisfactory accuracy (1. 07 - 1. 12) and regression coefficients (0. 83 - 0. 92).

40|$|Products {{of human}} and animal origin (biologicals and pharmaceuticals) and {{drinking}} water pose unique health and safety problems, especially due to viral contaminations, and have traditionally been a key concern both for regulators and industrial operations. They have also {{proven to be a}} stumbling block for early product research and development and inexperienced small start-up firms. Membrane filtration, being non-invasive, non-destructive and a robust technique, {{is one of the most}} preferred choices for virus filtration with ultrafiltration being an efficient process for removing macromolecules, colloids, endotoxins, viruses, and bacteria. The challenge, in virus filtration, is to remove virus particles from products to close to zero levels especially in emerging water and heavily regulated multi-billion biopharmaceutical industries. In virus capture or clearance operations, the virus particles are distributed in the range of 15 nm - 300 nm depending upon their protein coat and family, hence it is critical to study impact of particle size in ultrafiltration. A number of previous studies have been concerned with particle characteristics and their relation to flux decline behavior. However the relationship between, on one hand, particle properties of the feed and operating parameters like transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate and on the other hand, the filtration efficiency (<b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>value),</b> are still not adequately established. This thesis investigates the effect of feed particle size, transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate on the filtration efficiency for tangential flow ultrafiltration. An empirical model is developed to quantify the dependencies of the above said parameters. For this study, a cross flow ultrafiltration rig (built in-house) is used with 30 and 100 kDa polyether sulphone membranes for three different particle sizes of silica (model virus particles) at three different transmembrane pressures (20 - 60 kPa) and three cross flowrates (0. 3 - 1. 0 L/min). The investigation shows that among feed particle size, transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate, feed particle size and transmembrane pressure are significant parameters in controlling the filtration efficiency. In the studied experimental range, higher log reduction values are obtained at lower transmembrane pressure (20 kPa) and at higher cross flowrate (1 L/min). The experimental statistical analysis also gives an insight on the cross interactions of the feed particle size, transmembrane pressure and cross flowrate. It shows that the effect of transmembrane pressure and feed particle size seems to be more significant than that of the interaction of cross flowrate with feed particle size. The experimental investigations identified that feed particle size is one of the key influential factors on the filtration efficiency. Far less attention is given to this effect in the literature both experimentally and theoretically. This thesis attempts to fill this gap by developing a rigorous model formulation for tangential flow ultrafiltration to predict the evolution of particle size in the filtered stream. Population balance theory is employed to describe the population density of each particle size class in the output streams. In this formulation, the population balance equation is coupled with filtration kinetic constitutive relations and with mass balance equations and solved using discretisation method. The model predicts permeate particle size distribution and the <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>value</b> as primary model outputs. A novel approach in the form of optimization-based parameter estimation is employed to estimate filtration kinetic parameters. This approach which directly uses the population balance model, as well as particle size data, represents a stark deviation from previous filtration kinetic calculations that only utilize flux data and no models that describe the particle state. As such, this approach offers more comprehensive description of filtration kinetics incorporating the effects of particle size. The model is validated and is found to be in good agreement with experimental results. The model serves as a predictive tool for filtration efficiency and filtrate particle size distribution. Overall, this model-based prediction and estimation capability serves well and facilitates the design, operation and scale-up of ultrafiltration processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and characterize the polyethersulfone (PES) incorporated with silver (Ag) as an antibacterial membrane which can remove and disinfect bacteria in a single step for environmental application. The PES-Ag membrane was developed from PES, silver nitrate as an antibacterial agent and 2, 4, 6 -triaminopyrimidine (TAP) as compatibilizer. The influence of AgNO 3 loading, molecular weights (MW) of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as dispersant and type of compatibilizer have been investigated. The resulting membranes were characterized based on their thermal, tensile and structural properties which were used in correlation with the membrane antibacterial properties. The incorporation of Ag in PES membrane has increased the tensile strength doubled as compared to the unmodified PES. Furthermore, it was observed that the highest AgNO 3 loading (2 wt%) and the highest MW (360, 000) of PVP as dispersant has led to higher silver content on membrane surfaces. This is evidenced from energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These properties have induced a better antibacterial activity in a disc-diffusion test against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The structural characterization by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) revealed that by incorporating TAP as compatibilizer, smaller Ag particles size with improved distribution and average pore size of 0. 174 um was obtained. In addition, the silver residue during fabrication monitored by inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was significantly reduced (62. 6 %). These parameters have led to E. coli removal of <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>value</b> (LRV) 3. 59 and 100 % growth inhibition tested on E. coli suspension of 1 x 106 colony forming unit (CFU/mL).

40|$|BACKGROUND The variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease {{incidence}} peaked {{a decade}} ago and has since declined. Based on epidemiologic evidence, the causative agent, pathogenic prion, has not constituted a tangible contamination threat to large-scale manufacturing of human plasma-derived proteins. Nonetheless, manufacturers have studied the prion removal capabilities of various manufacturing steps to better understand product safety. Collectively analyzing the results could reveal experimental reproducibility and detect trends and mechanisms driving prion removal. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies collected more than 200 prion removal studies on plasma protein manufacturing steps, including precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and filtration, as well as combined steps. The studies used a range of model spiking agents and bench-scale process replicas. The results were grouped based on key manufacturing variables to identify factors impacting removal. The <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> of a group are presented for comparison. RESULTS Overall prion removal capacities evaluated by independent groups were in good agreement. The removal capacity evaluated using biochemical assays was consistent with prion infectivity removal measured by animal bioassays. Similar <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> were observed for a given step using various spiking agents, except highly purified prion protein in some circumstances. Comparison between combined and single-step studies revealed complementary or overlapping removal mechanisms. Steps with high removal capacities represent the conditions where the physiochemical differences between prions and therapeutic proteins are most significant. CONCLUSION The results support the intrinsic ability of certain plasma protein manufacturing steps to remove prions {{in case of an}} unlikely contamination, providing a safeguard to products...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} how seasonal variability in the removal efficacy of enteric viral pathogens from an MBR-based water recycling system might affect risks to human health if the treated product were to be used for the augmentation of potable water supplies. Samples were taken over a twelve month period (March 2014 - February 2015), from nine locations throughout a water recycling plant situated in East London and tested for faecal indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms, intestinal enterococci n= 108), phages (somatic coliphage, F-specific RNA phage and Bacteroides phage (GB- 124) n= 108), pathogenic viruses (adenovirus, hepatitis A, norovirus GI/GII n= 48) and a range of physico-chemical parameters (suspended solids, DO, BOD, COD). Thermotolerant coliforms and intestinal enterococci were removed effectively by the water recycling plant throughout the study period. Significant mean <b>log</b> <b>reductions</b> of 3. 9 - 5. 6 were also observed for all three phage groups monitored. Concentrations of bacteria and phages did not vary significantly according to season (P< 0. 05; Kruskal-Wallis), though recorded levels of norovirus (GI) were significantly higher during autumn/winter months (P= 0. 027; Kruskal-Wallis). <b>Log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> for norovirus and adenovirus following MBR treatment were 2. 3 and 4. 4, respectively. However, both adenovirus and norovirus were detected at low levels (2000 and 3240 gene copies/L, respectively) post chlorination in single samples. Whilst phage concentrations did correlate with viral pathogens, the results of this study suggest that phages may not be suitable surrogates, as viral pathogen concentrations varied to a greater degree seasonally than did the phage indicators and were detected on a number of occasions on which phages were not detected (false negative sample results) ...|$|R

The introduction of antimicrobial nanocoatings with active ingredients provides alternative measures for active killing of microorganisms, through a preventive hygiene approach. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of a panel of antimicrobial coatings available on the European market. Methods: A comparative, biased selection of commercially available antimicrobial coatings was tested for antimicrobial efficiency. Suppliers were contacted to deliver their coatings on glass and/or stainless steel substrates. In total, 23 coatings from eleven suppliers were received, which were investigated for their effect on the growth of Escherichia coli, using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 22196 protocol. Results: The majority of nanomaterial-containing coatings (n= 13) contained nanosilver (n= 12), while only one had photocatalytic TiO 2 as the active particle. The differences in antimicrobial activity among all of the coatings, expressed as <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>values,</b> varied between 1. 3 and 6. 6, while the variation within the nanomaterial-based group was between 2. 0 and 6. 2. Although nanosilver coatings were on average very effective in reducing the number of viable bacteria after challenge, the strongest <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> (6. 6) was seen with a coating that has immobilized, covalently bound quaternary ammonium salt in its matrix. Besides these two compounds, coatings containing TiO 2, poly(dimethylsiloxane), triclosan, or zinc pyrithione evoked 100 % killing of E. coli. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that nanosilver dominates the nanoparticle-based coatings and performs adequately. However, considering the unknowns in relation to ecotoxicological emission and effects, it needs further consideration before widespread application into different environments.

40|$|Ceramic water {{filters are}} used in many {{developing}} countries as a household water treatment technology, often produced locally using regionally-available materials, and constructed in various forms (i. e., as discs, candles, or pots) that all rely on similar mechanisms of filtration and inactivation. A common production technique involves application of an anti-microbial, colloidal silver coating to the porous ceramic filter. The silver coating has shown improvements in microbial <b>log</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> over uncoated ceramic filters both in the laboratory and in the field. However, a more complete understanding of the silver coating requires knowledge of specific characteristics of the colloidal silver solution, including particle size, composition, and charge, and to understand how these characteristics affect silver particle deposition, anti-microbial activity, and potential optimization of the silver coating. Additionally, as water passes through the ceramic filter, the silver coating will release from the ceramic surface, decreasing the effectiveness of the filter by reducing the presence of silver. A colloidal silver solution was prepared according to procedures recommended for ceramic pot filter production. The solution was then characterized for particle size distribution, trace contaminants, and zeta potential. Silver nanoparticles were adsorbed onto a silica substrate and assessed with a quartz crystal microbalance. Preliminary experiments showed adsorbed silver releasing from an unmodified quartz sensor (gold electrode surface) into flowing 10 % (v/v) influent solution of tryptic soy broth at approximately 50 times the rate of release of adsorbed silver caused by flowing Millipore ultrapure water alone. Experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} water quality, including pH, turbidity, ionic strength, and natural organic matter, on the release of silver nanoparticles from the silica substrate. The most significant release was caused by waters containing sodium hypochlorite, suggesting that cleaning of silver-containing ceramic filters should be performed with caution...|$|R

However, pathogen-specific performance guidelines and regulations have only recently been recommended; practical means to assess performance are missing. Here we examine the efficacy of Staphylococcus spp. as an endogenous surrogate for greywater pathogen reduction performance testing, by evaluating UV-C irradiation of hand-rinse greywater, and the variability in UV resistance between different wild Staphylococcus species. Hand-rinse greywater samples were collected from five participants, and a collimated UV-C beam (256 nm) {{was used to assess}} <b>log</b> 10 <b>reductions.</b> Assays of colony-forming units on tryptic soy agar (TSA) were compared to mannitol salt agar (MSA) using LysostaphinTM to confirm Staphylococcus spp. After irradiating raw hand-rinse samples to a dose of 220 mJ·cm− 2, <b>log</b> 10 <b>reductions</b> of Staphylococcus spp. were similar (2. 1 and 2. 2, respectively, p = 0. 112). The similarity of the reduction based on TSA and Staphylococcus-specific culture assays following UV irradiation and the dominating presence of Staphylococcus spp. suggests that Staphylococcus spp. could be used as an endogenous performance surrogate group for greywater treatment testing. Suspended wild Staphylococcus isolates were irradiated with 256 nm UV-C to compare the variability of different Staphylococcus species. Staphylococcus isolates exhibited significant variance in <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> when exposed to 11 mJ·cm− 2 of UV-C.

40|$|Abstract. Interventions {{to improve}} water quality, {{particularly}} when deployed at the household level, are {{an effective means}} of preventing endemic diarrheal disease, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developing world. We assessed the microbiologic performance of a novel water treatment device designed for household use in low-income settings. The device employs a backwashable hollow fiber ultrafiltration cartridge and is designed to mechanically remove enteric pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and protozoan cysts from drinking water without water pressure or electric power. In laboratory testing through 20, 000 L (~ 110 % of design life) at moderate turbidity (15 nephelometric turbidity unit [NTU]), the device achieved <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> <b>values</b> of 6. 9 for Escherichia coli, 4. 7 for MS 2 coliphage (proxy for enteric pathogenic viruses), and 3. 6 for Cryptosporidium oocysts, thus exceeding levels established for microbiological water purifiers. With periodic cleaning and backwashing, the device produced treated water at an average rate of 143 mL/min (8. 6 L/hour) (range 293 to 80 mL/min) {{over the course of the}} evaluation. If these results are validated in field trials, the deployment of the unit on a wide scale among vulnerable populations may make an important contribution to public health efforts to control intractable waterborne diseases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Guidelines for hand hygiene {{recommend}} {{the use of}} alcohol-based hand rubs containing humectants {{in order to improve}} dermal tolerance. However, the bactericidal efficacy of pre-surgical hand rubs is negatively affected by the WHO-recommended humectant glycerol, especially the 3 -h efficacy. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether replacing glycerol as humectant increases the bactericidal efficacy of surgical hand rubs based on isopropanol (75 %, wt/wt). Material and methods The efficacy of 3 and 5  min applications of a modified WHO II-formulation (containing lower glycerol concentrations) and the TPH 5766 hand rub which contains a new humectant (containing ethylhexylglycerin, dexpanthenol and a fatty alcohol) were compared to the European Norm 12, 791 reference (n-propanol, 60 %, vol/vol) immediately following and 3  h after application. Results Immediately after application both isopropanol-based surgical rubs approximated the performance of the reference. The 3 -h effect of the modified WHO II-formulation was found to be less efficacious than the EN 12791, showing a 30 % decrease in <b>log</b> 10 <b>reduction</b> <b>values.</b> The 3 -h post application effect for the TPH 5766 hand rub was found to not be different from EN 12791. Conclusion Based on our data, the bactericidal efficacy of isopropanol-based surgical hand rubs can best be obtained if glycerol is not used in the formulation. Unlike glycerol, a humectant comprised of ethylhexylglycerin, dexpanthenol and a fatty alcohol was found not to decrease hand rub effectiveness. Further investigation of the bactericidal efficacy of other humectants is necessary and may prove useful...|$|R

Intermediate susceptibility breakpoints {{for members of}} the family Enterobacteriaceae were used. When results were analyzed as MICs for 50 and 90 % of the strains tested and percentages of strains susceptible at the breakpoint, good correlation between the methods was observed, with ticarcillin-clavulanate clearly the most active beta-lactam by all four methods. However, when the various methods were compared with the agar dilution methodology by regression analysis, poor r 2 values (0. 3 to 0. 7) were obtained for compounds with sufficient on-scale values to permit analysis. When the number of strains with log 2 ratios of reference agar dilution MICs to test MICs of + 3 to - 3 were analyzed, correlation was also poor, with many major and very major discrepancies for all methods tested.
