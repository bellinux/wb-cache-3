Joan Foggin and John Wilson were the first paid staff, while Eleanor Fisher, already working in the library became the first full-time staff member in 1952. She remained the in-charge librarian until her retirement nineteen years later. By 1955 there was a part-time <b>library</b> <b>assistant</b> as well; and soon a fulltime junior was being considered. Growth in library use and opening hours continued, so that by 1968 there were 3 fulltimers and a part-timer to help on Friday nights.|$|E

All <b>Library</b> <b>Assistants</b> were taken through staff orientation and on the job training. They also received instruction in user/reader services. Over 89 % of the <b>Library</b> <b>Assistants</b> {{were satisfied with the}} in-service training given. Only 29 % of them had enjoyed study leave with pay, while over 55 % were desirous to be granted study leave to pursue further studies in Library and Information related programmes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify the need to train and retrain <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> in academic <b>libraries.</b> The researchers however used Babcock University Library to ascertain the impacts of training of <b>library</b> <b>assistants.</b> A descriptive design was adopted for this study. A total enumeration sampling method was used. The instrument used for data collection was a structured questionnaire. The population was made up of 30 respondents who were <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> at the Babcock University Library, Nigeria. A total number of 30 questionnaires were administered. All the questionnaires were retrieved and were found useful giving a return rate of 100 % used for this study. The result shows that <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> were not given training in the area of system management and web searching. In addition, 27 (90 %) of the respondents agreed that training will enhance their job performance while 30 (100 %) of the respondents agreed that training will improve their skills to support library users in searching for information electronically. Based on the findings the researchers recommend that <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> should be trained on electronic information technology usage as this will impact the overall service delivery in meeting the goals of the academic library...|$|R
25|$|In 1966, the Tutus {{left the}} UK and travelled, via Paris and Rome, to East Jerusalem. Spending {{two months in}} the city, Tutu studied Arabic and Greek at St George's College. He was shocked {{at the level of}} tension between the city's Jewish and Arab citizens. From there, the family {{returned}} to South Africa, spending Christmas with family in Witwatersrand. They found it difficult readjusting to a society where they were impacted by segregation and pass laws. He explored the possibility on conducting a PhD at UNISA, on the subject of Moses in the Quran, but this project never materialised. In 1967 they proceeded to Alice, Eastern Cape, where the Federal Theological Seminary (Fedsem) had recently been established, an amalgamation of training institutions from different Christian denominations. There, Tutu was employed teaching doctrine, the Old Testament, and Greek. Tutu was the college's first black staff-member, with most of the others being European or American expatriates. The campus allowed a level of racial-mixing which was absent in most of South African society. Leah also gained employment there, as a <b>library</b> <b>assistant.</b> They sent their children to a private boarding school in Swaziland, thereby ensuring that they were not instructed under the government's Bantu Education syllabus.|$|E

40|$|The {{school library}} {{situation}} in the schools of Newfoundland is far from ideal. Many school libraries are staffed by teacher/librarians who are also responsible for teaching and supervisory duties. There {{is little or no}} free time for the many tasks which must be carried out routinely if the school library is to function efficiently. Many of these tasks require little or no professional training and can be carried out by trained <b>library</b> <b>assistants.</b> [...] The aim of this project was to prepare a simple handbook for the use of teacher/librarians and <b>library</b> <b>assistants.</b> The handbook was designed to be used by the teacher/librarian for instructional purposes during the initial stages of the training programme and by the <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> themselves during and after the training period is completed. Accompanying the handbook is an introductory section for teacher/librarians. The teacher/librarian section outlines the philosophy behind the use of student assistants in the school library, establishes general guidelines for the setting up of a <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> programme and introduces the student handbook. [...] A preliminary draft of the library assistants' handbook was sent to professional people directly involved in school library service. These individuals were asked to examine the handbook, respond to the accompanying questionnaire and suggest changes. [...] All of those contacted were favourably impressed with the handbook. All agreed that it would benefit both teacher/librarians and <b>library</b> <b>assistants.</b> There were no substantial changes suggested. [...] In order to obtain student response to the handbook, specific sections were used with a group of Junior High students. Exercises which presented some difficulty for the students were revised. [...] Based on a search of related literature, the handbook reflects the opinions of school library consultants, teacher/librarians and students of the age group for whom it is intended. Designed for Junior High School students, it can be adapted {{to meet the needs of}} individual teacher/librarians in specific school situations...|$|R

40|$|Between 1995 and 1996, the Annette and Irwin Eskind Biomedical Library (EBL) at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) radically {{revised the}} model of service it {{provides}} to the VUMC community. An in-depth training program was developed for librarians, who began to migrate to clinical settings and establish clinical librarianship and information brokerage services beyond the library's walls. To ensure that excellent service would continue within the library, EBL's training program was adapted for <b>library</b> <b>assistants,</b> providing them with access to information about {{a wide variety of}} work roles and processes over a four to eight-month training period. Concurrently, customer service areas were reorganized so that any question [...] whether reference or circulation [...] could be answered at any of four service points, eliminating the practice of passing customers from person to person between the reference and circulation desks. To provide an incentive for highly trained <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> to remain at EBL, management and <b>library</b> <b>assistants</b> worked together to redesign the career pathway based on defined stages of achievement, self-directed participation in library-wide projects, and demonstrated commitment to lifelong learning.
