40|$|Modern {{powerful}} {{techniques in}} plant biotechnology {{have been developed}} in <b>lilies</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.,</b> Liliaceae) to propagate, improve and make new phenotypes. Reliable in vitro culture methods are available to multiply lilies rapidly and shorten breeding programs. Lilium is also an ideal model plant to study in vitro pollination and embryo rescue methods. Although lilies are recalcitrant to genetic manipulation, superior genotypes are developed with improved flower colour and form, disease resistance and year round forcing ability. Different DNA molecular markers {{have been developed for}} rapid indirect selection, genetic diversity evaluation, mutation detection and construction of Lilium linkage map. Some disease resistance-QTLs are already mapped on the Lilium linkage map.

40|$|Vernalization is {{a process}} {{required}} by certain plant species, including <b>lilies</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.),</b> to enter the reproductive phase, through an exposure to low, non-freezing temperatures. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate a nonlinear vernalization response function for the "Snow Queen" lily. An experiment was carried out in Santa Maria, RS, Brazil, to provide an independent data set to evaluate the performance of the model. Lily bulbs were vernalized at - 0. 5, 4. 0, and 10 ºC during two, four, six, and eight weeks. The daily vernalization rate (fvn) for each treatment was calculated with a beta function, and the effective vernalization days (VD) were calculated by accumulating fvn. The thermal time from plant emergence to visible buds at different VD treatments was used as the observed response to VD. Lily plants were not vernalized at values less than eight effective vernalization days and were fully vernalized at values greater than 40 days. The generalized nonlinear vernalization function described well the "Snow Queen" lily developmental response to VD, with a root mean square error of 0. 178...|$|E
40|$|Homeotic {{changes in}} floral organs of <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.)</b> are {{described}} in this chapter. Usually, lily flowers show similar organs in their first and second whorls called tepals. They constitute the appealing colourful features determining flower appearance. Stamens and the carpel appear as {{the third and fourth}} whorls, respectively. A double lily flower shows replacement of stamens by tepals and of its carpel by a new flower in a reiterated manner, similar to what is seen in the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis. A novel floral phenotype of lily, denominated festiva here, has never been reported in other species so far and shows a complete homeotic change of stamens into tepals, but keeps the carpel identity. We tried to explain these phenotypes taking into consideration all the evidence on the genetic mechanisms involved in flower development gathered over the last 15 years.

40|$|Anthocyanins are {{secondary}} metabolites {{that contribute}} to colors of flowers, fruits and leaves. Asiatic hybrid <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.)</b> accumulates cyanidin anthocyanins in flower tepals, tepal spots and leaves of juvenile shoots. To clarify their regulation mechanisms of anthocyanin pigmentation, two full-length cDNA of R 2 R 3 -MYB (LhMYB 6 and LhMYB 12) were isolated from the anthocyanin-accumulating tepals of cultivar 'Montreux'. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated they have a homology with petunia AN 2, of which homologous sequences had not been isolated in species of monocots. Yeast two-hybrid analysis showed that LhMYB 6 and LhMYB 12 interacted with the Lilium hybrid basic helix-loop-helix 2 (LhbHLH 2) protein. Transient expression analysis indicated that co-expression of LhMYB 6 and LhbHLH 2 or LhMYB 12 and LhbHLH 2, introduced by a microprojectile, activated the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in lily bulbscales. Spatial and temporal transcription of LhMYB 6 and LhMYB 12 was analyzed. The expression of LhMYB 12 corresponded well with anthocyanin pigmentation in tepals, filaments and styles, and that of LhMYB 6 correlated with anthocyanin spots in tepals and light-induced pigmentation in leaves. These results indicate that LhMYB 6 and LhMYB 12 positively regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis and determine organ- and tissue-specific accumulation of anthocyanin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Color {{patterns}} in angiosperm flowers {{are produced by}} spatially and temporally restricted deposition of pigments. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for restricted pigment deposition is a topic of broad interest. Some dicots species develop bicolor petals, which are often caused by the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes. An Asiatic hybrid <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.)</b> cultivar Lollypop develops bicolor tepals with pigmented tips and white bases. Here, we analyzed the global transcription of pigmented and non-pigmented tepal parts from Lollypop, to determine the main transcriptomic differences. Results: De novo assembly of RNA-seq data yielded 49, 239 contigs (39, 426 unigenes), which included a variety of novel transcripts, such as those involved in flavonoid-glycosylation and sequestration and in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Additionally, 1258 of the unigenes exhibited significantly differential expression between the tepal parts (false discovery rates 2 -fold higher in the pigmented parts. Thus, LhMYB 12 {{should be involved in}} the transcriptional regulation of the biosynthesis genes in bicolor tepals. Other factors that potentially suppress or enhance the expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, including a WD 40 gene, were identified, and their involvement in bicolor development is discussed. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the bicolor trait of Lollypop tepals is caused by the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes and that the transcription profile of LhMYB 12 provides a clue for elucidating the mechanisms of the trait. The tepal transcriptome constructed in this study will accelerate investigations of the genetic controls of anthocyanin color patterns, including the bicolor patterns, of <b>Lilium</b> <b>spp...</b>|$|R
30|$|Endogenous {{organic acids}} are both {{a source of}} carbon skeletons for other {{biochemical}} pathways {{as well as an}} energy source for cells in the respiratory cycle [22]. In plants, malic acid (MA) is metabolized in mitochondria, acts as a common reserve anion in the plant vacuole, and is a counter ion for K and Ca cations, especially in nitrate-dependent plants [23 – 25]. Citrate and malate extruded by roots of calcicole plants (plants growing in alkaline soils) facilitate the extraction of phosphorus and iron from such soils [26]. Citric acid (CA) alone or in combination with iron sources has been sprayed on the foliage of plants for successful recovery from iron chlorosis [27 – 30]. Use of CA alone or in combinations with salicylic acid (SA) and MA increased the essential oil production of Ocimum basilicum L. and Anethum graveolens L. [31, 32]. Foliar application of CA extended the vase life of <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.)</b> and tuberose (Polianthes tuberosa L.) while improving drought tolerance in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) [30, 33, 34]. Combination of 1  mM SA with 7  mM CA was superior to others for improving flowering and essential oil production in Ocimum basilicum L. [35]. The level of CA inside plant tissue is increased by exogenous application of CA and beneficial effects were observed, which were attributed to observed protective effects on peroxidation-linked membrane deterioration, free radical scavenging, maintenance of membrane stability, an increase in root activity, and activation of an antioxidant response [36]. The increase in peroxidase activity from CA application, which is responsible for H 2 O 2 metabolism, has been documented [37]. IBA is responsible for an H 2 O 2 increase, which promotes the formation of adventitious roots, possibly via a change in antioxidant enzymes activity; the same rooting response is reported with the addition of either ascorbic acid or H 2 O 2 [38].|$|R

Phylogenetic {{analysis of the}} deduced LhSorP 5 CS amino acid sequence by comparison with other P 5 CS proteins in plants indicated that LhSorP 5 CS {{was a member of}} the P 5 CS family. We investigated the expression of LhSorP 5 CS in different tissues and in response to salt, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) stresses by means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To our knowledge, LhSorP 5 CS is the first P 5 CS gene that has been functionally characterized in Lilium.|$|R
40|$|<b>Lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{is among}} the most {{traditional}} and beloved ornamental flowers worldwide. The genus Lilium comprises almost one hundred species, among which is the primary subject of our research, described in this thesis, the species Lilium longiflorum (Thunb.), known as trumpet lily or Easter lily. Despite the great economic importance of ornamental lily species, little is known about its biology at the molecular level so far. In a time when two genomes are fully sequenced, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, only a few genes have been characterized in <b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.</b> yet. Possible reasons for this are discussed throughout this thesis. This work intends to be a contribution to bridging the fundamental research concerning transcription factors involved in development of flower morphology in model species and the applied objectives of molecular breeding for manipulating flower morphology, endeavouring to create new cultivars with specific and novel features, more specifically in <b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.</b> The ABC model for floral development was proposed more than 10 years ago and since then many studies have been performed in model species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus, petunia and many other species in order to confirm this model. This investigation has led to additional information on flower development and to more complex molecular models. In the first chapter of this thesis, notions of molecular floral development, the difficulties of working with molecular biology of lily, the state-of-the-art in lily transformation are introduced, as well as general overviews of transcription factors, MADS-box genes, the ABCDE model for flower development and functional characterization of genes in heterologous systems. These concepts will guide the reader throughout the work we present here. AGAMOUS (AG) is the only C type gene found in Arabidopsis and it is responsible for stamen and carpel development as well as floral determinacy. In the second chapter, we describe the isolation of LLAG 1, a putative AG orthologue from lily (L. longiflorum) by screening a cDNA library derived from developing floral buds. The deduced amino acid sequence of LLAG 1 revealed the MIKC structure and a high homology in the MADS-box among AG and other orthologues. Phylogenetic analysis indicated close relationship between LLAG 1 and AG orthologues from monocot species. Spatial expression data showed LLAG 1 transcripts exclusively in stamens and carpels, constituting the C domain of the ABC model. Functional analysis was carried out in Arabidopsis by overexpression of LLAG 1 driven by the CaMV 35 S promoter. Transformed plants showed homeotic changes in the two outer floral whorls with some plants having the second whorl completely converted into stamens. Altogether, these data indicate a functional relationship between LLAG 1 and AG. (SEP 3) is a MADS-box homeotic gene possibly determining the E function in the ABCDE model. This function is essential for proper development of petals, stamens and carpels. In order to gain further information on <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> longiflorum) flower development at the molecular level, the cDNA library constructed from developing floral buds was screened again and our findings are reported in the chapter three. A clone (LLSEP 3) was isolated with high similarity to the SEP 3 transcription factor from Arabidopsis. LLSEP 3 belongs to the AGL 2 subfamily of MADS-box genes and shares its closest relationships with DOMADS 1 and OM 1, from the orchid species Dendrobium grex and Aranda deborah, respectively. Expression analysis by Northern hybridisation showed that LLSEP 3 was expressed throughout lily flower development and in tepals, stamens and carpel tissues of mature flowers, whereas no expression was detected in leaves. Overexpression of LLSEP 3 in Arabidopsis under the CaMV 35 S promoter induced early flowering but did not induce any floral homeotic changes, which is in accordance with the effect of SEP 3 overexpression in this species. Altogether, these data are consistent with the putative role of LLSEP 3 as an E functional gene in lily flower development. Drawbacks found during our work on functional characterisation of LLAG 1, by means of complementing the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana are described and critically discussed in chapter four. Such difficulties are, on the one hand, the nature of the AGAMOUS gene, of which the loss of function induces sterility and, on the other hand, the unavailability of the defective ag- 1 allele in another Arabidopsis background than the Landsberg erecta ecotype, which is recognisably difficult to transform by the floral dip method. Even though we did not manage to complement the AG function with LLAG 1 in a defective ag genotype so far, we could observe clear floral homeotic changes in those Arabidopsis plants ectopically overexpressing LLAG 1, which together with our data on sequence identities and expression profile described in the previous chapter of this thesis, indicated that LLAG 1 is a strong candidate to control the C function in L. longiflorum. This work also contributes towards the improvement of lily transformation procedures. In the chapter five we describe a transformation of bulblet slices by particle bombardment using a vector carrying the ArabidopsisSUPERMAN gene driven by the petunia flower-specific FLORAL BINDING PROTEIN 1 promoter and the bialaphos resistance gene phosphinothricin acetyltransferase under the CaMV 35 S promoter. Our intentions were improving the transformation parameters for lily transformation in order to reach higher efficiency, and creating novel phenotypes in lily flowers using transcription factors originating from dicot plants. We were capable of obtaining transgenic lines expressing in vitro resistance to bialaphos. The transgenic plants were transferred to the greenhouse, grown and monitored for two flowering seasons. Flowers derived from these plants appeared normal and indistinguishable from wild-type flowers and the possible reasons for this are currently under investigation. Homeotic changes in floral organs of <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.)</b> are described in chapter six. Usually, lily flowers show similar organs in their first and second whorls called tepals. They constitute the appealing and colourful features determining flower appearance. Stamens and the pistil appear as the third and fourth whorls, respectively. A double lily flower shows replacement of stamens by tepals and of its carpel by a new flower in a reiterated manner, similar to what is seen in the agamous mutant of Arabidopsis. A novel floral phenotype of lily, denominated festiva here, has never been reported in other species so far and shows a complete homeotic change of stamens into tepals, but keeps the carpel identity. We tried to explain these phenotypes taking into consideration all the evidence on the genetic mechanisms involved in flower development gathered over the last 15 years. This work launches challenges and encouragement for exploiting the molecular mechanisms involved in flower development of lily. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system has shown to be of great potential in reverse plant genetics. Advantages of VIGS over other approaches, such as T-DNA or transposon tagging, include the circumvention of plant transformation, methodological simplicity and robustness, and speedy results. These features enable VIGS as an alternative instrument in functional genomics, even in a high throughput fashion. The system is already well established in Nicotiana benthamiana, but efforts are being addressed to improve VIGS in other species, including monocots. Current research is focussed on unravelling the silencing mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and VIGS, as well as finding novel viral vectors in order to broaden the host species spectrum. In chapter seven, we discuss the advantages of using VIGS to assess gene functions in plants. We address the molecular mechanisms involved in the process, present the available methodological elements such as vectors, inoculation procedures, and we show examples in which the system was applied successfully to characterize gene function in plants. Moreover, we analyse the potential application of VIGS in assessing genetic function of floral transcription factors from monocots. Analyses of gene functions involved in lily flower development and generation of useful information on the molecular breeding potential of this species were the main objectives of the work described in this thesis. The field for studying the molecular aspects of lily flower development is now wide open and the future may uncover very interesting aspects that will produce new tools for ornamental breeders as well as reveal particular features of monocots and the Liliaceae plant family...|$|R

40|$|Because <b>lily</b> (<b>Lilium</b> longiflorum Thunb.) is an {{important}} cut-flower crop, molecular characterisation of genes {{that are involved in}} flower morphology could help breeders to develop novel floral architectures in this species.

Since then, floral identity genes have been studied in many other species as well and the studies evolved to the so-called ABCDE model. However, the lily ABCDE genes have only been studied in the last four years. Here, we review the current status of the molecular model of flower development in model species and lily, and present two homeotic floral mutants that we have found in <b>Lilium</b> <b>spp.,</b> one of which is a newly identified phenotype, festiva, never reported earlier, not even in the model species Arabidopsis.
