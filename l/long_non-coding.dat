25|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{is carried}} out by a single type of RNA polymerase, which needs a DNA sequence called a Pribnow box {{as well as a}} sigma factor (σ factor) to start transcription. In eukaryotes, transcription is performed by three types of RNA polymerases, each of which needs a special DNA sequence called the promoter and a set of DNA-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding RNAs (e.g., snRNAs, snoRNAs or <b>long</b> <b>non-coding</b> RNAs). Pol II includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is rich in serine residues. When these residues are phosphorylated, the CTD binds to various protein factors that promote transcript maturation and modification. RNA polymerase III transcribes 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and some small non-coding RNAs (e.g., 7SK). Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the terminator.|$|E

Utilizing whole-genome tiling arrays, we analyzed the transcription across the entire genome in both normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) and NHBE cells exposed to the tobacco carcinogen NNK. Our efforts focused on the characterization of non-coding transcripts that were greater than 300 nucleotides in length and whose expression was increased in response to NNK. We identified 12 <b>Long</b> Stress-Induced <b>Non-coding</b> Transcripts that we term LSINCTs. Northern blot analysis revealed that these transcripts were larger than predicted from the tiling array data. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR performed across a panel of normal cell lines indicates that these transcripts are more abundantly expressed in rapidly growing tissues or in tissues that are more prone to cellular stress. These transcripts that have increased expression after exposure to NNK also had increased expression in a number of lung cancer cell lines and also in many breast cancer cell lines. Collectively, our results identified a new class of <b>long</b> stress responsive <b>non-coding</b> transcripts, LSINCTs, which have increased expression in response to DNA damage induced by NNK.

40|$|Characteristics of {{mitochondrial}} (mt) DNA such as gene {{content and}} arrangement, {{as well as}} mt tRNA secondary structure, are frequently used in comparative genomic analyses because they provide valuable phylogenetic information. However, most analyses do not characterize the relationship of tRNA genes from the same mt genome and, in some cases, analyses overlook possible novel open reading frames (ORFs) when the 13 expected protein-coding genes are already annotated. In this study, we describe the sequence and characterization of the complete mt genome of the silver-lip pearl oyster, Pinctada maxima. The 16, 994 -bp mt genome contains the same 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs) and two ribosomal RNA genes typical of metazoans. The gene arrangement, however, is completely distinct from that of all other available bivalve mt genomes, and a unique tRNA gene family is observed in this genome. The unique tRNA gene family includes two trnS(-AGY) and trnQ genes, a trnM isomerism, but it lacks trnS(-CUN). We also report the first clear evidence of alloacceptor tRNA gene recruitment (trnP [...] >trnS(-AGY)) in mollusks. In addition, a novel ORF (orfUR 1) expressed at high levels {{is present in the}} mt genome of this pearl oyster. This gene contains a conserved domain, "Oxidored_q 1 _N", which is a member of Complex I and thus may {{play an important role in}} key biological functions. Because orfUR 1 has a very similar nucleotide composition and codon bias to that of other genes in this genome, we hypothesize that this gene may have been moved to the mt genome via gene transfer from the nuclear genome at an early stage of speciation of P. maxima, or it may have evolved as a result of gene duplication, followed by rapid sequence divergence. Lastly, a 319 -bp region was identified as the possible control region (CR) even though it does not correspond to the <b>longest</b> <b>non-coding</b> region in the genome. Unlike other studies of mt genomes, this study compares the evolutionary patterns of all available bivalve mt tRNA and 148 genes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Malat 1 RNA is expressed in numerous tissues and is highly abundant in neurons. It is enriched in nuclear speckles only when RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription is active. Knock-down studies revealed that Malat 1 modulates the recruitment of SR family pre-mRNA-splicing factors to the transcription site of a transgene array. DNA microarray analysis in Malat 1 -depleted neuroblastoma cells indicates that Malat 1 controls the expression of genes involved not only in nuclear processes, but also in synapse function. In cultured hippocampal neurons, knock-down of Malat 1 decreases synaptic density, whereas its over-expression results in a cell-autonomous increase in synaptic density. Our results suggest that Malat 1 regulates synapse formation by modulating the expression of genes involved in synapse formation and/or maintenance...|$|R
