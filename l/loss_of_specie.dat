5000|$|The primary {{regulatory}} {{task of the}} Second Bank of the United States, as chartered by Congress in 1816, was {{to restrain}} the uninhibited proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private lenders, which was highly profitable to these institutions. [...] In this capacity, the bank would preside over this democratization of credit, contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion. [...] Historian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the Bank exerted its anti-inflationary influence: [...] Receiving the checks and notes of local banks deposited with the BUS by government collectors of revenue, the BUS had constantly to come back on the local banks for settlements of the amounts which the checks and notes called for. It had to do so because it made those amounts immediately available to the Treasury, wherever desired. Since settlement by the local banks was in specie i.e. silver and gold coin, the pressure for settlement automatically regulated local banking lending: for the more the local banks lent the larger amount of their notes and checks in use and the larger the sums they had to settle in specie. This <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> reduced their power to lend. [...] Under this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated. It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury. The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions - from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837 - meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration.|$|E
40|$|Experiments with {{realistic}} {{scenarios of}} species loss from multitrophic ecosystems may improve {{insight into how}} biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning. Using 1000 L mesocoms, we examined effects of nonrandom species loss on community structure and ecosystem functioning of experimental food webs based on multitrophic tropical floodplain lagoon ecosystems. Realistic biodiversity scenarios were developed based on long-term field surveys, and experimental assemblages replicated sequential loss of rare species which occurred across all trophic levels of these complex food webs. Response variables represented multiple components of ecosystem functioning, including nutrient cycling, primary and secondary production, organic matter accumulation and whole ecosystem metabolism. Species richness significantly affected ecosystem function, even after statistically controlling for potentially confounding factors such as total biomass and direct trophic interactions. Overall, loss of rare species was generally associated with lower nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, and whole ecosystem metabolism when compared with more diverse assemblages. This pattern was also observed for overall ecosystem multifunctionality, a combined metric representing the ability of an ecosystem to simultaneously maintain multiple functions. One key exception was attributed to time-dependent effects of intraguild predation, which initially increased values for most ecosystem response variables, but resulted in decreases over time likely due to reduced nutrient remineralization by surviving predators. At the same time, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>specie...</b>|$|E
40|$|Decreased plant {{diversity}} {{is expected to}} reduce ecosystem function. Although many studies have examined eff ects of plant species on trophic interactions, information regarding eff ects of native or non-native plant diversity on performance of individuals of higher trophic levels is limited. We reared larval American toad Anaxyrus americanus tadpoles in outdoor mesocosms containing litter of 1, 3, 6 or 12 plant species drawn randomly {{from a pool of}} 24 (15 native, 9 nonnative) species. Tadpole performance varied signifi cantly among litter types in single litter treatments and pH and litter C:N were signifi cant predictors of tadpole performance. Metamorphs were larger in mixtures than expected based on performance in single species treatments, suggesting a non-additive eff ect of diversity. Litter diversity did not aff ect probability of survival or probability of metamorphosis. Plant origin (native or non-native) had no signifi cant eff ect on amphibian performance. Our study suggests some benefi ts to tadpole development at low levels of plant diversity, but questions assumed benefi ts of increased plant diversity and assumed detrimental eff ects of nonnative plant species for a common larval amphibian. Presence of specifi c plant species with strong negative eff ects on tadpole performance may outweigh diversity benefi ts in brown food webs.

Although {{the system was}} {{reasonably}} successful, the Swiss experience has been almost entirely neglected {{in the debate over}} free banking. In its more advanced state of development, the stability of the Swiss free banking system deteriorated, since (1) all assumptions underlying the so-called law of adverse clearings were more or less violated, and (2) the note-issuing banks were prevented by their non-issuing rivals from increasing their discount rates, even if some of them were faced with heavy <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>specie.</b> In 1907, therefore, free banking had to be abandoned. ...|$|R

40|$|A long-standing but {{unsettled}} controversy concerning monetary {{experiences in}} colonial America {{has recently been}} reopened with considerable vigor. Ignoring doctrinal aspects, the main substantive issue concerns the relationship between money holdings and price levels during episodes in which various colonial governments issued paper currency (bills of credit) in large amounts. In several instances, large and rapid increases in the stock of outstanding paper currency led to negligible changes in price levels. But alternative interpretations are possible, since colonial money included specie as well as paper currency. According to the "quantity theory" or classical hypothesis, total money stock magnitudes did not rise sharply during the disputed episodes; instead, the sharp paper currency increases led to corresponding <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> [...] as suggested by standard commodity-money analysis. According to the "backing theory" or anti-classical hypothesis, by contrast, there was little specie present so money stock magnitudes could and did rise sharply (in percentage terms). This fundamental factual disagreement has eluded resolution because data on both stocks and flows <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> are almost nonexistent. The present study develops and applies a strategy for circumventing the unavailability <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> data by exploiting conflicting implications of the two hypotheses regarding magnitudes of real per capita holdings of paper currency, relative to normal real money balances, at dates of maximum paper issue. A major feature of the analysis is a new method for the estimation of normal real money holdings, one that relies on paper currency data for a few inflationary episodes. ...|$|R

40|$|Scholars have {{traditionally}} {{argued that the}} stock <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> in circulation in France in the 19 th century was considerable and that this "financial backwardness" accounted for France's slower economic growth in that century. Scholars have also claimed that the French bimetallic system was inherently unstable. It is true that until the 1880 's, gold and silver coinage formed the main portion of French monetary stock, {{perhaps as much as}} 52 % in 1885, but the supposition that this somehow hindered French industrialization requires correction. This is especially true given the fact that no precise figures for the annual monetary stock had existed until recently. As a result of new estimates, two periods <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> can be detected: 1830 - 52 (predominant silver coinage) and 1853 - 66 (predominant gold coinage {{as a result of the}} depreciation of gold).

50|$|Each year, {{the supply}} <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> {{in the colonies}} {{decreased}} due to international factors. The dearth <b>of</b> <b>specie</b> rendered it ineffective {{as a means of}} exchange for day-to-day purchases. Colonists frequently adopted a barter system to acquire the goods and services they required. Essentially, this method proved to be ineffective and a commodity system was adopted in its place. Tobacco was used as a monetary substitute in Virginia as early as 1619. A major shortcoming of this system was that the quality of the substitutes was inconsistent. The poorer qualities ended up in circulation while the finer qualities were inevitably exported. This commodity system became increasingly ineffective as colonial debts increased.|$|R
