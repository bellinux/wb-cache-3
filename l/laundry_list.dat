Her lyrics are alternately overtly political and deeply personal, interlaced with Five Percenter notions and references to the Nation of Islam. Badu expresses a motherly perspective and feelings of dismay and empathy for {{the subjects in the}} songs. Charles Aaron commented that [...] "a sense of history and maternal compassion ... grounds even her most oblique forays." [...] Abebe wrote similarly, [...] "her keen writing about people" [...] gives songs [...] "much of their shape" [...] and views that her candor helps communicate the album's [...] "social concerns, which could otherwise sound like a <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> of black-community struggles".|$|E

In {{his review of}} Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, [...] "Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment."

By the end of August 2006, 5000 additional fans had signed it. The petition requested the clip to be taped again because it {{was considered to be}} [...] "an underwhelming representation of the talent and quality of previous music-video projects of Ms. Beyoncé". Included in the <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> of offenses were [...] "a lack of theme, dizzying editing, over-the-top wardrobe choices, and unacceptable interactions" [...] between Beyoncé and her now-husband, Jay-Z. Beyoncé's dance moves were also called into question by the petition, qualifying them [...] as [...] "erratic, confusing and alarming at times". Additionally, fans complained about sexual theme depicted in the video, describing that some scenes as [...] "unacceptable interactions [...] " [...] while also complaining of a [...] "non-existent sexual chemistry" [...] between the two. The music video was awarded Best Video at the 2006 MOBO Awards. It also received two nominations for Sexiest Video and Best Hook-Up at the 2007 MTV Australia Video Music Awards.|$|E

However, Laberge wrote that the book would be useful for {{undergraduates}} in Asian American studies, Japanese studies, cultural studies, and film history, and also in gender studies and cross-cultural studies. Additionally, {{he felt that the}} book was short. Duke magazine Edward M.

[...] He praised the single-player campaign and the storyline. However, he cited numerous bugs, including no support for Windows 95, despite the box claiming otherwise, and compatibility issues with Windows XP. He was also critical {{of the absence of}} Vengeance, despite the box stating it was included, and the fact that multiplayer mode had only five maps and no TCP/IP support. He concluded [...] "If you need your new Myth fix and can't wait for a patch, then the best option is to buy the game from a store that accepts returns in case the game doesn't like your particular system setup. If you can play it, focus your efforts on the campaign - it's fun, {{and for the most part}} works as advertised.

However, he favors it for cases in which [...] "the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage." [...] Speaking as a state senator about the Illinois legislature's constant additions to the list of factors that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty, Obama said, [...] "We certainly don't think that we should [...] have this <b>laundry</b> <b>list</b> that does not make any distinctions between the run-of-the-mill armed robbery that results in death and systematic killings by a terrorist organization. And I think essentially what the reduction of aggravating factors does is, it says, 'Here's a narrower set of crimes that we think potentially at least could deserve the death penalty.'" [...] In his own words, [...] "While the evidence tells me that the death penalty does little to deter crime; I believe there are some crimes – mass murder, the rape and murder of a child – so heinous that the community is justified in expressing the full measure of its outrage by meting out the ultimate punishment. On the other hand, the way capital cases were tried in Illinois at the time was so rife with error, questionable police tactics, racial bias, and shoddy lawyering, that 13 death row inmates had been exonerated." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the high}} waste places {{of the world}} Clyde roamed and hunted and dreamed, death-dealing and gracious as some god of Hellas, moving with his horses and {{servants}} and four-footed camp followers from one dwelling ground to another, a welcome guest among wild primitive village folk and nomads, a friend and slayer of the fleet, shy beasts around him. By the shores of misty upland lakes he shot the wild fowl that had winged their way to him across half the old world; beyond Bokhara he watched the wild Aryan horsemen at their gambols; watched, too, in some dim-lit tea-house one of those beautiful uncouth dances that one can never wholly forget; or, making a wide cast down to {{the valley of the}} Tigris, swam and rolled in its snow-cooled racing waters. Vanessa, meanwhile, in a Bayswater back street, was making out the weekly <b>laundry</b> <b>list,</b> attending bargain sales, and, in her more adventurous moments, trying new ways of cooking whiting. Occasionally she went to bridge parties, where, if the play was not illuminating, at least one learned {{a great deal about the}} private life of some of the Royal and Imperial Houses. Vanessa, in a way, was glad that Clyde had done the proper thing. She had a strong natural bias towards respectability, though she would have preferred to have been respectable in smarter surroundings, where her example would have done more good. To be beyond reproach was one thing, but it would have been nicer to have been nearer to the Park.|$|E

She frightened me horribly once at a private view by saying mysteriously, 'I oughtn't to be here, you know; {{this is one of my}} days.' I thought she meant that she was subject to periodical outbreaks and was expecting an attack at any moment. So embarrassing if she had suddenly taken it into her head that she was Cesar Borgia or St. Elizabeth of Hungary. That sort of thing would make one unpleasantly conspicuous even at a private view. However, she merely meant to say that it was Wednesday, which at the moment was incontrovertible. Well, she's on quite a different tack to the Klopstock. She doesn't visit anywhere very extensively, and, of course, she's awfully keen for me to drag in an incident that occurred at one of the Beauwhistle garden-parties, when she says she accidentally hit the shins of a Serene Somebody or other with a croquet mallet and that he swore at her in German. As a matter of fact, he went on discoursing on the Gordon-Bennett affair in French. (I never can remember if it's a new submarine or a divorce. Of course, how stupid of me!) To be disagreeably exact, I fancy she missed him by about two inches--over-anxiousness, probably--but she likes to think she hit him. I've felt that way with a partridge which I always imagine keeps on flying strong, out of false pride, till it's the other side of the hedge.

40|$|The {{guidelines}} {{proposed in}} the World Commission on Dams (WCD) final report were vehemently rejected by several Asian governments, and dam building has continued apace in most Asian countries. This reaction {{is in line with}} the simplistic dam debate, where dam critics offer <b>laundry</b> <b>lists</b> of socioeconomic and environmental costs, and dam proponents highlight the benefits while underestimating associated costs. Whereas the WCD sought to evaluate dams in terms of 'costs and benefits', this approach is self-defeating due to the very subjectivity of such measurements. This paper argues that the way ahead must be to move beyond a consensus evaluation of dams, and instead examine the shifting asymmetries and discursive flows that sustain and promote dam building over time. However, such an analysis of the dam discourse must incorporate an understanding of the multiple actors and driving forces, as well as the underlying power relations within this politicised environment. We therefore suggest that a post-structural political ecology approach provides a suitable framework for the future examination of large dams in Asia...|$|R

To remedy this, this article suggests a framework for sorting out the lengthy <b>laundry</b> <b>lists</b> of possible goals commonly associated with reorganization. According to this framework, reorganizations can be distinguished according to whether their primary objective is (1) economy and efficiency; (2) policy effetiveness; or (3) tactical advantage. Each of these three major types of reorganizations has its own basic characteristics, political and administrative dynamics, underly ing theory, and advantages and disadvantages. While no particular reorganization may fall ex-clusively into an y one of these categories, this framework can help clarify discussions of organizational reform and improve our understandmg of the objectives such reform can accomplish. We have got to get over the notion that the purpose of re-organization is economy. -President Franklin D.

But regardless of focus, purpose, or complexity, all checklists share in common a basic mnemonic function: they remind (or inform) us what we are supposed to do, check, look for, etc. (Scriven, 2000, ¶ 2) Shortly after we 1 set up the Evaluation Checklists Web site, 2 I read a chapter by Ernest House and Kenneth Howe (2000) on their Deliberative Democratic Evaluation Model. In concluding the chapter, they wrote that the principles upon which the model is based—inclusion, dialogue, and deliberation—“are too important to leave to chance or intuition all the time. ” They continued, “It may help to have a justification and checklist to remind evaluators caught in the complexities of difficult evaluations what evaluation in democratic societies should aim for ” (p. 421). The point here is that many aspects of evaluation are “too important to leave to chance or intuition all the time. ” And this is why even the lowly laundry-list-type checklist can be extremely useful in the complex world of evaluation...|$|R
