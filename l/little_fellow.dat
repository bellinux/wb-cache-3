Notice the jerry-hat, the open but determined, never-say-die, countenance, the polished boots, the burnished spurs, the tight-fitting breeches, the long waistcoat, creaseless coat, and general ′get-up′ of that wiry-looking, ten-stone, five-feet-five specimen of humanity, and tell me if he is a ′character′ when once seen that will never be forgotten.″ Charlie Canavan differs on one point - he states his weight 'when at man's age' did not exceed 9stone (126lb or 57kg).|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{recommendation}} of a German woman in Kullavik he gained admittance in 1931 to The Industrial Arts School in Gothenburg, with Hjalmar Eldh as a teacher. Billman studied book illustration at the school. A good example of woodcut making from this period is A Fiddlers Burial (1931), inspired by a poem from collection of verse Black Ballades by the Swedish poet Dan Andersson. He also made five linoleum cuts (linocut) with which he illustrated Upton Sinclair's novel Jimmie Higgins (unpublished illustrations). A sympathy for the <b>little</b> <b>fellow</b> and the underprivileged is a pervading characteristic of all his graphic work from that time on.|$|E

[...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon.

500|$|Chaplin's silent films {{typically}} {{follow the}} Tramp's efforts {{to survive in}} a hostile world. The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying his social position, he strives {{to be seen as a}} gentleman. As Chaplin said in 1925, [...] "The whole point of the <b>Little</b> <b>Fellow</b> is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity." [...] The Tramp defies authority figures and [...] "gives as good as he gets", leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an [...] "everyman turned heroic saviour". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with [...] "the homeless and lonely Tramp [...] optimistically... into the sunset... to continue his journey".|$|E
500|$|The {{final game}} of the season, to decide the Western Conference championship, matched Michigan against Amos Alonzo Stagg's Chicago Maroons on Thanksgiving Day. Michigan lost the game, which was {{described}} as [...] "one of the most desperately contested games ever played in Chicago," [...] by a score of 7–6. The game featured [...] "few trick plays," [...] as both teams relied on [...] "straight, hard football." [...] Hazen Pingree, Jr. (whose father, Hazen S. Pingree, had been elected Governor of Michigan three weeks earlier) was the star of the game for Michigan, as one newspaper reported that Pingree's effort [...] "in the first half was the 'whole thing,' the plucky <b>little</b> <b>fellow</b> seldom failing to make the required distance." [...] Pingree was unable to play in the second half, and Gustave Ferbert, who later became a millionaire in the Klondike Gold Rush, took over in the second half and [...] "was equally effective." ...|$|E

An advertisement for these concerts announced that [...] "the girl" [...] would play [...] "the most difficult pieces by the greatest masters", while [...] "the boy" [...] would play a concerto on the violin and also repeat his Vienna trick of playing with the keyboard completely covered by a cloth.

[...] Those who have seen Maulbetsch in action marvel at the great momentum he can get up {{in two or three}} steps." [...] Noted football writer Walter Eckersall said: [...] "Mauly is a <b>little</b> <b>fellow,</b> being built close to the ground. [...] They say that when he plunges at the line his head is almost on a level with his shoe tops – that he hits so low that it's well nigh impossible to stop him."

He has run away from his father, and trudged through the streets, alone, to rejoin his mother. The woman clasped her child in her arms and decides to live for him in the future. The mother takes her child to humble lodgings, the whereabouts of which are unknown even to her husband. There she tries to make a living for herself and him by sewing, but is unable to do so. She has given the last crust of bread to the little one, and is herself in a starving condition, when the baby boy himself comes to the rescue by starting out on a business career, selling papers in the street. In this way the wolf is kept from the door for a little while longer, and the <b>little</b> <b>fellow,</b> while applying his trade on the street corner, is met and recognized by his father. With his son as his guide, the repentant husband, who now realizes his unjust action, goes to his wife, and with the baby as a mediator, the two become reconciled." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Nazis on the {{one hand}} would jam {{transmissions}} from the Allies' stations, {{but on the other hand}} would also copy them. The band Charlie and His Orchestra is considered as a negative example, also called Mr. Goebbels Jazz Band. Several of Germany’s most talented swing musicians, such as saxophonist Lutz Templin and vocalist Karl “Charlie” Schwedler, were active in a Jazz band. Here the Nazis replaced the original texts with their own provocative propaganda texts that were pro-Nazi and anti-American/British. For example, the lyrics for “Little Sir Echo” has anti-American/British appeal with lyrics such as “German U-boats are making you sore, You’re always licked, not a victory came through…You’re nice, <b>little</b> <b>fellow,</b> but by now you should know that you can never win this war!” [...] Goebbels’ propaganda was broadcast over pirated short-wave frequencies into America, Britain, and Canada in order to spread fear and weaken the morale of Germany’s enemies (WFMU Staff).|$|E
2500|$|Zelica {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a buggy horse with her colt running freely alongside until he was weaned at around five or six months. At first, the young horse showed little promise. [...] "The only redeemable feature about the <b>little</b> <b>fellow</b> was that he was friendly and cute" [...] recalled Messner. [...] "I honestly thought the colt's future would be confined to hauling a delivery wagon." [...] However, a close friend named John Wattles, the owner of the livery stable in which Dan Patch was foaled, saw potential in the colt. Wattles received permission from Messner to train Dan Patch and gradually developed the horse's abilities. By late 1898, Messner was able to use Dan Patch as his buggy horse since Zelica was again in foal, and even hooked the horse up to his sleigh over the winter. The locals were increasingly impressed by the almost black colt, who loved to move fast but was biddable enough to pull young boys behind him on the sleigh.|$|E

2500|$|Gaza, {{where the}} First Intifada broke out, {{has had a}} long history of stone-throwing, which, {{according}} to Oliver and Steinberg, goes back at least to an incident where Alexander the Great, while laying siege to the city, was hit by a stone, and almost lost his life. The medieval Christian pilgrim Fabri wrote that 1483 pilgrims took care to arrive in Gaza at dusk to avoid being stoned by “the little Muslim boys”. According to historian Benny Morris the practice of throwing stones at Jews is a venerable one in the Middle East, symbolic of Jewish degradation under Muslim rule. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: [...] "I have seen a <b>little</b> <b>fellow</b> of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [...] to throw stones at a Jew." [...] William Shaler, American Consul to Arab Algiers from 1815 to 1828, reported that the practice of Muslims throwing rocks at Jews was commonly seen. The practice of Arab rioters throwing stones at Jews was seen in the 1948 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania, Libya. It {{has been used as a}} weapon against colonialism in other Arab countries.|$|E
