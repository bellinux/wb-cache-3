50|$|On July 28, 2011, Grenada Railway {{filed an}} embargo, {{due to a}} bridge problem, which took a portion their <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> This embargo, which {{included}} the part of their line which connected to KSRY, meant that no traffic would be accepted to or from points within that section. On September 20, 2011, Grenada Railway filed a formal petition to abandon that segment which included the KSRY interchange. That petition was later withdrawn, but the embargo remains in effect as of early 2013.|$|E

50|$|Most {{heritage}} streetcar lines use overhead trolley {{wires to}} power the cars, {{as was the case}} with the vast majority of original streetcar lines. However, on the Galveston Island Trolley heritage line, which opened in 1988, using modern-day replicas of vintage trolleys, the cars were powered by an on-board diesel engine, as local authorities were concerned that overhead wires would be too susceptible to damage from hurricanes. In spite of that precaution, damage in 2008 from Hurricane Ike was heavy enough to put the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> indefinitely, and as of 2014 it has yet to reopen.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1994, WE created Akron Barberton Cluster Railway (ABCR) {{from the}} former ABB assets. It also {{included}} the former Erie main line from Barberton to Rittman and from Kent to Ravenna, Ohio sold by Conrail. In 1997, ABCR was granted permission to tear out 45% the former ABB [...] "Loop" [...] line which looped from the grade in Barberton and Firestone Park to the WE's Brittain Yard in Akron. In 1999, ABCR took the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> and in 2001, they tore the line out completely with expenses paid off by parent railroad company, WE.|$|E
50|$|In 1927, the B&M {{abandoned}} {{the line between}} Stevens Station in North Andover and Danvers Junction. The line continued to operate until Stevens Mills closed in the 1960s and freight service to the North Andover Machine Shop ended in 1981. The line was formally abandoned later that year. Commuter service between Danvers Jct and Salem picked up and remained strong until 1958, when passenger service stopped. In 1985, the Waters River Bridge caught fire and took the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Customers north of the bridge were serviced via the Newburyport branch until all service on that line was suspended around 2000. The line south of the bridge remains open for freight today and the MBTA has preliminary plans to reopen passenger service between Salem and Danvers Jct, replacing the old bridge {{to gain access to}} Danvers.|$|E

5000|$|The Heart of Georgia Railroad [...] is a shortline {{railroad}} {{created in}} 1999 to lease and operate 177 mi of track {{owned by the}} Georgia Department of Transportation between Mahrt, Alabama and Vidalia, Georgia, in the United States. The railroad has since expanded to include more than 219 mi of track, reaching as far as Midville, Georgia. Initially only the portion from Rochelle to Preston, Georgia was utilized, with the Preston-Mahrt and Rochelle-Vidalia <b>lines</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> The Heart <b>of</b> Georgia also hosts the SAM passenger excursion train and is owned by parent company Atlantic Western Transportation Company.|$|R
5000|$|On September 19, 1986, SEPTA ended service west of Elwyn. Ridership on that segment had dwindled, {{a process}} {{accelerated}} by bustitution used while the deteriorating tracks were closed for repair. In addition, Chester County officials preferred to expand Exton Station on SEPTA's Paoli/Thorndale Line. SEPTA only had funds {{for one of}} the two projects, so service to West Chester was terminated. SEPTA did not officially place the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> until late 1991. At the time, Delaware County officials were pushing to restore service {{at least as far as}} Wawa, but Chester County officials were unenthusiastic and SEPTA General Manager Louis Gambaccini said service restoration between Wawa and West Chester was [...] "not cost-effective." [...] Nonetheless, SEPTA studied the possibility of restoring service on the 3 miles from Elwyn to Wawa later in the decade.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent studies, hierarchically {{distributed}} non-intrusive agent aided {{transmission line}} distance relaying protection scheme has been proposed. This scheme {{is meant to}} provide the distance relays with situational awareness and improve their robustness against hidden failures. Distance relaying protection scheme {{is a part of}} safety critical cyber physical system (in particular, power system) and it operates with stringent timing requirements to remove the faulted <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Before putting into practice, it is better to formally verify that the agent based relay supervisory scheme meets the specifications and its usage gives intended results and doesn’t carry any negative side effects. Therefore, in this paper agent based relay supervision scheme is formally modelled, validated and its properties are verified using UPPAAL- a timed automata based formal verification tool. ...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{services}} {{have to be}} provided as a separate item in a de-regulated or vertically restructured electricity supply industry. Though the primary function of a transmission line is to transmit power from source point(s) to loading point(s), major lines also {{play an important role}} in security. Sometimes a particular transaction cannot take place if a particular line is unavailable and, moreover, a specific line may be more important for the security of a particular transaction than it is for others. Clearly reliability is a relevant consideration in equitable cost allocation. A method for transmission line embedded cost allocation among transmission transactions accounting for both line capacity-use and reliability benefit is presented. Line capacity-use is determined by the amount of power transmitted, while the reliability benefit is calculated as the increment of the total probability of system failure, with the <b>line</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> compared to when the line is in service. Capacity-use is determined using a full AC power flow and hence the effects of reactive power can also be investigated. The cost allocation to each transaction according to the capacity-use and reliability benefit patterns throughout an accounting period during which system loading and line failure probability are varying are studied.
