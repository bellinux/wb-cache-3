5|$|Model's {{decision}} to burn all his personal papers {{at the end}} of World War II means relatively little is known about his early years. Born to a music teacher in Genthin, Saxony, he belonged to a <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class,</b> non-military family. Following schooling at the Bürgerschule (citizen school) in Genthin, he graduated with his Abitur from the , a humanities oriented secondary school, on Easter 1909. He entered the army officer cadet school (Kriegsschule) in Neisse (now Nysa, Poland) in 1909, where he was an unexceptional student, and was commissioned a lieutenant (Leutnant) in the 52nd Infantry Regiment von Alvensleben in 1910. He made few friends among his fellow officers and soon became known for his ambition, drive, and blunt outspokenness. These were characteristics that would mark his entire career.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{first went}} to the St Ann's Government School in Port of Spain, then {{attended}} St Ann's Roman Catholic School until 1917. He displayed little enthusiasm for learning and never reached a high academic standard, but showed prowess at several sports and was respected for his cricketing lineage. He played for the school cricket team, which he captained in his last two years, by which time he was developing a reputation as an attacking batsman, a good fast-medium bowler and an excellent fielder. His father prohibited him from playing competitive club cricket until 1920 for fear of premature exposure to top-class opposition while too young; in addition, he first wanted his son to establish a professional career. Upon leaving school Constantine joined Jonathan Ryan, a firm of solicitors in Port of Spain, as a clerk. This was a possible route into the legal profession; however, {{as a member of}} the black <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class,</b> he was unlikely to progress far. Few black Trinidadians at this time became solicitors, and he faced many social restrictions owing to his colour.|$|E
5|$|Janet Jackson {{was born}} in Gary, Indiana, the {{youngest}} of ten children, to Katherine Esther (née Scruse) and Joseph Walter Jackson. The Jacksons were <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> and devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Jackson would later refrain from organized religion. At a young age, her brothers began performing as The Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, the group signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated {{to pursue a career}} in entertainment, and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio. At age seven, Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino. A biography revealed her father, Joseph Jackson, was emotionally withdrawn, and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976. In 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times. She later starred in A New Kind of Family and later got a recurring role on Diff'rent Strokes, portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame, but expressed indifference towards the series.|$|E

A small, largely unincorporated southeastern {{section of the city}} is represented by Republican John Davis (District 129), who also represents the NASA Johnson Space Center. Hernandez's district is also home to Galena Park and Jacinto City, which also have large Hispanic populations who favor Democrats.|$|E
25|$|The social {{origins of}} Islamists changed after the 1952 Revolution. In the 1940s and early 1950s, the Muslim Brotherhood had appealed {{primarily}} to urban civil servants {{and white and}} blue-collar workers. After the early 1970s, the Islamic revival attracted followers from {{a broad spectrum of}} social classes. Most activists were university students or recent graduates; they included rural-urban migrants and urban middle-class youth whose fathers were middle-level government employees or professionals. Their fields of study—medicine, engineering, military science, and pharmacy—were among the most highly competitive and prestigious disciplines in the university system. The rank-and- file members of Islamist groups have come from the middle class, the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class,</b> and the urban working class.|$|E
50|$|Gulf migrants, many of {{whom were}} from the working and the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> {{gradually}} gained social status. A myth was in the making: that of the 'Gulf man'. Gulf migrants were highly sought after as bridegrooms. Their attractive earnings, irrespective of their shortcomings, enabled them to marry into wealthy and respected families when they returned home.|$|R
50|$|By {{the turn}} of the century a strong sense of civic pride had been created and many local {{residents}} looked with a sense of achievement at the size which Harringay had reached in such a short period of time.

50|$|Originally, Lunfardo was a slang used by {{criminals and}} soon {{by other people}} of the lower and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes.</b> Later, many of its words and phrases were {{introduced}} in the vernacular and disseminated the Spanish of Argentina, and Uruguay. Nevertheless, since the early 20th century, Lunfardo has spread among all social strata and classes by habitual use or because it was common in the lyrics of tango.|$|R
25|$|Dominated by {{the giant}} Samson and Goliath cranes of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, the {{constituency}} is socially mixed. There are large expanses of small Victorian terraced housing near Belfast City Centre {{and around the}} shipyard in Ballymacarrett. These areas have seen significant refurbishment, and in some places demolition and redevelopment, in recent years sparking a sharp rise in house prices. This is contrasted by {{a large amount of}} solidly <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> housing and some exclusive residential districts such as the much mocked Cherryvalley. This social polarisation is to a large degree reflected by the political polarisation, at least within the broader unionist family, in the seat. The small Catholic population is split between the largely working class Short Strand enclave and minorities in the more middle-class parts of the seat.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} academic models split {{the middle class}} into two sections. Yet, it remains common for the term middle class to be applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio-economic strata. The middle class is then often sub-divided into an upper-middle, middle-middle, and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class.</b> In colloquial descriptions of the class system the middle-middle class may be described as consisting {{of those in the}} middle of the social strata. Politicians and television personalities such as Lou Dobbs can be seen using the term middle class in this manner, especially when discussing the middle-class squeeze. The wide discrepancy between the academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated professionals together in the same class with secretaries may lead to the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|The first notable work {{of realism}} {{focusing}} on the urban <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> is Manuel Antônio de Almeida's Memórias de um sargento de milícias (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works. The most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was Machado de Assis, who is also {{widely regarded as the}} greatest writer of Brazilian literature and considered the founder of Realism in Brazil, with the publication of The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas (1881). He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from Empire to Republic with his numerous chronicles published in newspapers of the time. Many of his short stories and novels, like Quincas Borba (1891) and Dom Casmurro (1899), are placed in Rio.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very large}} number of Kenyan English {{speakers}} often use [...] "My names are…" [...] when introducing themselves instead of [...] "My name is…". For example, a person named John Omondi would introduce himself by saying [...] "My names are John Omondi" [...] instead of [...] "My name is John Omondi". Again, this is especially prevalent in the rural areas and among the lower and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> but also depends on the ethnic origin of the speaker.|$|R
50|$|With {{the rise}} of the Irish Free State and the Republic of Ireland, more novelists from the lower social classes began to emerge. Frequently, these authors wrote of the narrow, {{circumscribed}} lives of the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes</b> and small farmers. Exponents of this style range from Brinsley MacNamara (1890-1963) to John McGahern (1934-2006). Other notable novelists of the late 20th and early 21st century include John Banville, Sebastian Barry, Seamus Deane, Dermot Healy, Jennifer Johnston, Patrick McCabe, Edna O'Brien, Colm Tóibín, and William Trevor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{primary meaning}} of the term is now a {{political}} or sociological one (as is also the case for the term [...] "Middle America" [...] or [...] "Middle Australia"). It principally indicates the middle <b>classes</b> or <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes</b> of non-urban Britain, but also carries connotations of [...] "Deep England". John Major’s 1993 speech to the Conservative Group for Europe is often cited, evoking romantic imagery of rural cricket matches, warm beer, suburban gardens, and “old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist” (itself a quote from George Orwell).|$|R
25|$|Moneylending {{during this}} period was largely a matter of private loans {{advanced}} to persons persistently in debt or temporarily so until harvest time. Mostly, it was undertaken by exceedingly rich men prepared {{to take on a}} high risk if the profit looked good; interest rates were fixed privately and were almost entirely unrestricted by law. Investment was always regarded as a matter of seeking personal profit, often on a large scale. Banking was of the small, back-street variety, run by the urban <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> of petty shopkeepers. By the 3rd century, acute currency problems in the Empire drove such banking into decline. The rich who were in a position {{to take advantage of the}} situation became the moneylenders when the increasing tax demands in the last declining days of the Empire crippled and eventually destroyed the peasant class by reducing tenant-farmers to serfs. It was evident that usury meant exploitation of the poor.|$|E
25|$|Meeting the {{criteria}} of seditious literature were the Negro Worker, publications of the International Committee of Negro Workers and the League against Imperialism, and all works by George Padmore and Nancy Cunard. Attached to the seditions legislation was a waterworks bill, which would tax the municipalities of Accra, Sekondi, and Cape Coast. These bills sparked political agitation by the social elite, who didn't want their {{freedom of speech and}} expression to be restricted, and by the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class,</b> who had resisted the government's prior attempts to levy direct taxes. Mass meetings were held, protests were organised, resolutions were passed and delegation to address the issues was proposed to be sent to England. However, Wallace-Johnson urged the populace not to send the delegation to England. He believed that more could be accomplished if people launched a grassroots movement by organising protests and demonstrations in their home towns. Then, English people sympathetic to the colonies' problems could apply pressure on their government to get the laws revoked. Wallace-Johnson's plan worked: two members of Parliament, who felt that the new laws were unreasonable, questioned the colonial secretary about the Sedition Act.|$|E
500|$|Although {{its initial}} public {{reception}} was muted, the Diary {{came to be}} recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and {{it has never been}} out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The Diary {{has been the subject of}} several stage and screen adaptations, including Ken Russell's [...] "silent film" [...] treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.|$|E
40|$|Through the {{existence}} of a large, politically-aware middle class and the Repeal press, Dublin {{played a central role in}} the national movement. Dublin Repealers were mainly Catholics, hoping to improve their social position and restore prosperity. Dublin provided substantial funds for the Repeal Association, and set the pattern for organisation; its residents did much of the committee and electoral work. The leading Young lrelanders were mainly Dublin-resident professional men; support from Dublin's <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes</b> provided a basis for the Irish Confederation. Latent interest in Repeal outside Dublin, stemming from religious and agrarian grievances, was stimulated and organised by the capital...|$|R

[...] John Eidsmoe, in his book Legalized Gambling: America's Bad Bet, claims that it is actually gamblers from the lower and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes</b> in the United States that provide much of the gambling money. [...] "The occasional wealthy 'high roller' does indeed exist, but he is the exception, not the standard. The fact that more than 50% of Nevada's gambling income comes from slot machines as opposed to the card tables should be an indication high rollers are not the main source of revenue." ...|$|R

The upper-middle classes desire clothing more [...] "corresponding to wealth and high living".

500|$|The {{opposition}} Labour party protested at Home's appointment; its leader, Hugh Gaitskell, {{said that}} it was [...] "constitutionally objectionable" [...] for a peer {{to be in charge of}} the Foreign Office. Macmillan responded that an accident of birth should not be allowed to deny him the services of [...] "the best man for the job– the man I want at my side". Hurd comments, [...] "Like all such artificial commotions it died down after a time (and indeed was not renewed with any strength nineteen years later when Margaret Thatcher appointed another peer, Lord Carrington, to the same post)." [...] The Home–Heath partnership worked well. Despite their different backgrounds and ages– Home an Edwardian aristocrat and Heath a <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> meritocrat raised in the inter-war years– the two men respected and liked one another. Home supported Macmillan's ambition to get Britain into the EEC, and was happy to leave the negotiations in Heath's hands.|$|E
500|$|Keith Waterhouse's Mrs Pooter's Diary of 1983 is an {{adaptation}} of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for Bridget Jones's Diary, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The New York Times critic wrote that it [...] "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to {{be all things to}} all men." [...] This diary began as a weekly column in The Independent, and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine Private Eye lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in [...] "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with The Diary of a Nobody, which made much fun of Major's <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> origins.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bailey, in {{his study}} [...] "White Collars, Gray Lives" [...] (1999), traces the {{beginnings}} of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the [...] "disquieting irruption of {{a new breed of}} petty bourgeois shop and office workers" [...] that faced Victorian writers {{in the last quarter of}} the 19th century. The Grossmiths' Diary was a typical satire of its time; it probed the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the Diary [...] "a sharp analysis of social insecurity". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: [...] "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, [...] "has long been the intellectual's blood sport". However, the quarter-century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. [...] Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as [...] "Denry Machin", [...] "Mr Polly" [...] or [...] "Mr Lewisham", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. [...] In cases such as these, writes Bailey, [...] "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis." ...|$|E
5000|$|Joe was {{a popular}} {{magazine}} published in Kenya in the 1970s, {{at the height of}} what acclaimed publisher Henry Chakava described as the [...] "fat years" [...] of Kenyan publishing. Joe magazine was one in a number of popular publications aimed at the new urban middle and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes.</b> What set Joe magazine apart was its subversive use of humour, as well as its use of art and fiction as a narrative frame for cultural, social and political analysis. This strategy was seminal not only in educating and activating its readers but also in providing a platform for new fiction writers and artists to develop their talents.|$|R
50|$|With {{the rise}} of the Irish Free State and the Republic of Ireland, the terms of the 'national question' shifted. The issue of land {{ownership}} had been more or less resolved and the real question now was how to build a nation state. Inevitably, novelists from the so-called lower social classes began to dominate. Frequently, these authors wrote of the narrow, circumscribed lives of the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes</b> and small farmers. Exponents of this style range from Brinsley MacNamara (1890-1963) (real name John Weldon), whose 1918 The Valley of the Squinting Windows could be said to have created the genre, to John McGahern (born 1934), whose first novel, The Dark (1965), a portrayal of child abuse in a rural community, cost him his job as a teacher.|$|R
5000|$|The Commune {{resulted}} {{in part from}} growing discontent among the Paris workers. This discontent {{can be traced to}} the first worker uprisings, the Canut Revolts, in Lyon and Paris in the 1830s (a Canut was a Lyonnais silk worker, often working on Jacquard looms). Many Parisians, especially workers and the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> supported a democratic republic. A specific demand was that Paris should be self-governing with its own elected council, something enjoyed by smaller French towns but denied to Paris by a national government wary of the capital's unruly populace. They also wanted a more [...] "just" [...] way of managing the economy, if not necessarily socialist, summed up in the popular appeal for [...] "la république démocratique et sociale!" [...] ("the democratic and social republic!").|$|R
500|$|At {{about the}} time that Waugh was {{discovering}} his affection for the Diary another writer, J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar of English humour; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: [...] "oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart". In a 1943 essay, George Orwell considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who [...] "constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly". In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; Osbert Lancaster deemed it [...] "a great work of art", and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the Diary [...] "the best comic novel in the language", and lauded Pooter as [...] "the presiding shade" [...] of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: [...] "Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [...] than the <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class</b> Charles and Carrie Pooter?" [...] Wilson also observed {{the extent to which the}} Pooters had become recognised as [...] "arbiters of the greatest good taste", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted [...] "period" [...] homes. A Spectator article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as [...] "The Laurels", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms [...] "banker land".|$|E

2500|$|In its {{earliest}} days, the cinematograph {{was perceived as}} an attraction for upper class audiences, but the novelty of moving pictures did not last long. Soon, trivial short films were being shown as fairground attractions aimed at the working class and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>class.</b> The booths in which these films were shown were known in Germany somewhat disparagingly as Kintopps. Film-makers with an artistic bent attempted to counter this view of cinema with longer movies based on literary models, and the first German [...] "artistic" [...] films began to be produced from around 1910, an example being the Edgar Allan Poe adaptation [...] "The Student of Prague" [...] (1913) which was co-directed by Paul Wegener and Stellan Rye, photographed by Guido Seeber and starring actors from Max Reinhardt's company.|$|E
50|$|The Czech {{are closely}} related to the {{neighbouring}} Slovaks (with whom they constituted Czechoslovakia 1918-1993). The Czech-Slovak languages form a dialect continuum rather than being two clearly distinct languages. Czech cultural influence in Slovak culture is noted as having been much higher than the other way around. Czech (Slavic) people {{have a long history of}} coexistence with Germanic people. In the 17th century, German replaced Czech in central and local administration; upper classes in Bohemia and Moravia were Germanized, and espoused a political identity (landespatriotismus), while Czech ethnic identity survived among the lower and <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes.</b> The Czech National Revival took place in the 18th and 19th centuries aiming to revive Czech language, culture and national identity. The Czech were the initiators of Pan-Slavism.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s were {{particularly}} lucrative for the bank, mostly {{due to its}} near-monopoly on savings {{for the poor and}} <b>lower-middle</b> <b>classes,</b> the management of Brazilian state (federal) lotteries and being the only lawful pawn broker in Brazil.In the 1990s, however, the scenario changed and the bank underwent a serious downsizing, in which thousands of employees lost their jobs. Part of the problem was caused by the modernization of the Brazilian banking system in the 1980s, with many other banks introducing savings accounts to their portfolios, Brazilian states being granted rights to explore lotteries (alongside the federal government), a series of corruption scandals regarding lottery fraud, and the opening of the national market for foreign banks. The control of inflation also hampered Caixa's financial performance by making savings accounts less attractive.|$|R
