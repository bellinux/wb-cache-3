5|$|All birds <b>lay</b> amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Hole and burrow nesting species tend to <b>lay</b> white or pale eggs, while open nesters <b>lay</b> camouflaged eggs. There are many {{exceptions}} to this pattern, however; the ground-nesting nightjars have pale eggs, and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage. Species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite's egg, which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts.|$|E
5|$|All dinosaurs <b>lay</b> amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often <b>lay</b> eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and <b>lay</b> one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might <b>lay</b> a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E
