25|$|A phase {{detector}} compares two input signals and produces an error signal which {{is proportional to}} their phase difference. The error signal is then <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> and used to drive a VCO which creates an output phase. The output is fed through an optional divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output phase drifts, the error signal will increase, driving the VCO phase {{in the opposite direction}} so as to reduce the error.Thus the output phase is locked to the phase at the other input. This input is called the reference.|$|E
2500|$|The first-order hold (FOH) is a {{mathematical}} model of the practical reconstruction of sampled signals {{that could be done}} by a conventional digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and an analog circuit called an integrator. [...] For the FOH, the signal is reconstructed as a piecewise linear approximation to the original signal that was sampled. [...] A mathematical model such as the FOH (or, more commonly, the zero-order hold) is necessary because, in the sampling and reconstruction theorem, a sequence of Dirac impulses, xs(t), representing the discrete samples, x(nT), is <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> to recover the original signal that was sampled, x(t). [...] However, outputting a sequence of Dirac impulses is impractical. Devices can be implemented, using a conventional DAC and some linear analog circuitry, to reconstruct the piecewise linear output for either the predictive or delayed FOH.|$|E

50|$|In the {{classical}} {{implementation of a}} Costas loop, a local voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) provides quadrature outputs, one to each of two phase detectors, e.g., product detectors. The same phase of the input signal is also applied to both phase detectors and the output of each phase detector is passed through a <b>low-pass</b> <b>filter.</b> The outputs of these <b>low-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are inputs to another phase detector, the output of which passes through noise-reduction filter before being used to control the voltage-controlled oscillator.

5000|$|Sample rate {{reduction}} (also called down-sampling) intentionally reduces the sample rate to degrade {{the quality of}} the audio. As the sample rate is reduced, high frequencies are aliased or, if the digital signal is first <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered,</b> they are lost. If a primitive step-wave DAC is used, or if the DAC filter cutoff frequency is not adjustable to track with the sample rate, but instead is fixed at half the Nyquist frequency for the maximum supported sample rate, then waveforms also become more [...] "coarse" [...] sounding. At extreme reductions, the waveform becomes metallic sounding as a result of severe aliasing and perhaps nonlinear distortion from poorly tuned digital-to-analog conversion. (Note that all of these effects are avoidable if the signal is <b>low-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> before being downsampled and if the DAC parameters for playback are proper to the reduced sample rate; then the waveform just sounds band-limited like a telephone, an AM radio with clear reception, or a magnetic tape recorder at a slow tape speed.) ...|$|E
