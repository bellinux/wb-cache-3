Consultation guidance from the regulator indicated that although the former postal county data is obsolete, it was the <b>last</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> set to be in routine use and was therefore {{the most likely to}} be used by corporate customers for their address databases. It was also recognised that residential customers in some areas were not happy with this situation. The Royal Mail reconfirmed its preference for eliminating counties altogether from addressing, but also invited comments on providing a new and updated county data field, reflecting boundary changes. Postcomm found that many respondents objected to the use of obsolete counties. In May 2010 Postcomm decided to advise Royal Mail to [...] "discontinue provision of such information at the earliest opportunity". However, because some existing software included the use of counties, Royal Mail was advised not to implement the change before 2013. The timetable announced by Royal Mail in July 2010 indicates this is likely to happen between 2013 and 2016.|$|E

There is no evidence that entrepreneurs postponed conversions during the short period between the announcement and the full implementation of the program or that they reduced the conversion rate after the funds were terminated; we also fail to find evidence that the impact is due to substitution between eligible and non-eligible workers.

40|$|An {{index for}} {{severity}} of illness {{that may be}} used as a prediction of outcome was developed retrospectively by a multivariate analysis of cardiorespiratory data from 113 critically ill postoperative general surgical patients and was tested prospectively in a new series of 105 patients. The severity (predictive) index was heuristically developed using an algorithm that generates a severity score from the observed value for each cardiorespiratory variable and the frequency distributions of survivors' and nonsurvivors' values of that variable at each stage of postoperative shock. An overall or global severity index was developed from the sum of the severity scores of each variable weighted according to their capacity to predict outcome. The difference in the mean values of the predictive index for survivors and nonsurvivors was statistically significant (P<. 001) during each stage of shock. In a prospective study of 105 new patients, there was 93 % accuracy for the values of the <b>last</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> set. The usefulness of this index was demonstrated by tracking the clinical course of the critical illness of the prospective series.

30|$|To {{check for}} the {{robustness}} of our results, we rely on a single country, Italy, and on microdata on firms and workers. In particular, we focus on how wage growth responds to the local province-level unemployment rate. 6 Data on wages consist of social security payments made by all private-sector firms {{with at least one}} employee to the Italian National Social Security Institute (INPS). From this master data, INPS extracts two datasets. The first consists of the universe of firms, and for each firm, it includes the average number of employees and firms’ wage bill, together with a firm unique identifier and the province where the firm is located. It is then possible to calculate average wages. The <b>last</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> refer to year 2013. The second consists of the employment histories of all workers born on the 1 st or the 9 th day of each month (6.5 % of total workforce in the Italian private sector). The worker extraction, updated to 2014, provides information on demographics, the annual gross wage, the number of days worked, the main characteristics of the contract and maternity and sick leaves, as well as whether the worker benefits from the Italian wage supplementation scheme, Cassa integrazione guadagni (CIG). The province-level unemployment rate is released by the Italian National Statistical Institute (Istat) since 2004.|$|E

Until this point, there has been little information about first time offenders as a group, but it is known that offenders typically are not first time drink drivers but rather ‘first time apprehended’, in that most have engaged in drink driving in the years leading to the first offence.

It represents about 6, 5 % of all olive area in Portugal. In order to describe main techniques followed by farmers in the Mediterranean Region, an international research network with MAICh co-ordination was done in several countries, including Portugal. In this country 12 questionnaires were made on farm, concerning ecological olive production. Main conclusions were the following ones:- most of ecological olive area are at the east regions of Portugal (99, 8 %), because there are less pests and diseases, witch allow a good olive oil production without spraying;- most of olive growers don’t control any pest or disease;- {{quality and quantity of}} organic olive oil is varying with pest and disease pressure, witch depends on climate conditions and different regional varieties;- most of olive growers don’t apply any organic fertiliser from outside of the farm;- some of the growers make cover crops, but not all of them;- soil erosion is a problem in some of the cases because of excessive tillage in the weed control; Key-words: organic olive growing / Portugal organic olive oil 1.

40|$|In {{the last}} hundred years there have been a steady decline in {{mortality}}. When we are going to project how mortality {{is going to be in}} the future, we need a model who takes this decline in consideration. We have traditionally used a Lee-Carter model with time parameters described by a random walk. The main purpose of this thesis is to find out if we can use an autoregressive model instead. With data from 1950 to the <b>last</b> <b>available</b> <b>data</b> year in Human Mortality Database (HMD) for Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Japan, France, Italy, Spain, Great Britain and the United States of America, we estimate the time parameters in the Lee-Carter model. When we are looking at the autocorrelation function for the time parameters, we see that they are not independent, but negatively correlated. It's therefore natural to use an autoregressive process with a negative coefficient instead of a random walk when we are estimating the time variables. To see how well the autoregressive model fits, we use data up to 1997 and Monte Carlo simulations to predict the mortality in 2007. It seems like the autoregressive model is a good fit, but there are some exceptions. Generally it's more difficult to predict the mortality for men than for women. The consequences of using an autoregressive process instead of a random walk is that we get narrower confidence intervals when we predict mortality. This will again have economic consequences, because narrower confidence intervals gives us less insecurity in our predictions. An insurance company will need less money to have solvency when we use an autoregressive model versus a random walk...|$|E
