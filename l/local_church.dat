5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the <b>local</b> <b>church</b> hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the <b>local</b> <b>church</b> was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E

Specifically, they note the decline in violence among tribe members, numerous conversions to Christianity, and growth of the <b>local</b> <b>church.</b>|$|E
