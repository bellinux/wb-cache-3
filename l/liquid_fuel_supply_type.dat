However, a disruptive approach - The 3 node structure model to permanently solve the problem of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> and distribution is proposed in this study. Using system dynamics, factors challenging the Nigerian petroleum downstream industry were stated. Current state system dynamic loops with powerful positive and negative feedback effects to the economy of the country were captured and used as the basis for policy recommendations.

40|$|Converting coal to a liquid, {{commonly}} known as coal-to-liquids (CTL), can <b>supply</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> and has been successfully used in several countries, particularly in South Africa. However, it has not become {{a major contributor to}} the global oil supply. Increasing awareness of the scarcity of oil and rising oil prices has increased the interest in coal liquefaction. This paper surveys CTL technology, economics and environmental performance. Understanding the fundamental aspects of coal liquefaction technologies is vital for planning and policy-making since future CTL production will be integrated in a much larger global energy and <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> production system. The economic analysis shows that many CTL studies assume conditions that are optimistic at best. In addition, the strong risk for a CTL plant to become a financial black hole is highlighted. This helps to explain why China has recently slowed down the development of its CTL program. The technical analysis investigates the coal consumption of CTL. Generally, a yield of between 1 – 2 barrels/ton coal can be achieved while the technical limit seems to be 3 barrels/ton coal. This puts a strict limit on future CTL capacity imposed by future coal production, regardless of other factors such as economic viability, emissions or environmental concern. For example, assuming that 10 % of world coal production can be diverted to CTL, the contribution to the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> will be limited to only a few million barrels per day (Mb/d). This prevents CTL from becoming a viable mitigation plan for <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> shortage on a global scale. However, it is still possible for individual nations to derive a significant share of their <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> from CTL but those nations must also have access to equally significant coal production capacity.

40|$|Three {{approaches}} are commonly identified for controlling automobile greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions: reducing travel demand, improving vehicle efficiency and using alternatively (non-petroleum) fueled vehicles (AFVs). Similarly, sector emissions can be decomposed by travel distance, vehicle fuel intensity and fuel GHG ("carbon") intensity. Normalized {{analysis of these}} three factors offers valuable insights. For a broad set of conditions, any stringent GHG emissions limit for the automobile sector implies a limit of comparable stringency for fuel carbon intensity. However, carbon intensity is an abstraction of complex supply systems rather than an observable property of fuels (physical energy carriers) themselves. Carefully considering the locations and current magnitudes of fuel-related emissions implies that the proper policy focus is on upstream sectors that <b>supply</b> <b>fuel</b> rather than the choice of fuels downstream in the auto sector. Therefore, other than fundamental R&D, programs to promote AFVs are not currently warranted for climate protection. In addition to managing travel demand and improving vehicle efficiency, the implied climate policy priority is limiting net GHG emissions in <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> sectors.

Second, the economics of CTL plants are clearly prohibitive, but are better for GTL. Nevertheless, large scale GTL plants still require very high upfront costs, and for three real world GTL plants out of four, the final cost has been so far approximately three times that initially budgeted.

40|$|Mitigating a {{long-term}} shortfall of world oil production The timing of {{a long-term}} or irreversible shortfall in supply is a contentious subject that may be impossible to agree on, but the effects are not. Mitigating these effects is crucial to economic well-being. What they are, and how to manage the risks, should find widespread agreement. Robert L. Hirsch, SAIC, Project leader; Roger Bezdek and Robert Wendling, MISI A peak in world oil production would subject the world to its first-ever sustained discontinuity in energy- a commodity essential to {{the functioning of the}} world economy. A number of knowledgeable experts forecast that peaking of conventional oil production will occur sometime within the next 20 years. Given today's oil demand levels and usage patterns, such a forced disruption would have severe negative impacts on the economies of all oil-importing nations, perhaps the exporting ones as well. Viable mitigation options exist, but the timing of their implementation will be critical.

Biofuels (primarily ethanol, methanol, diesel and hydrogen) are viewed as a critical part of the solution, already playing a significant part of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> in a number of major economies. Examples include; ethanol from cornstarch in the USA, ethanol from sugar in Brazil and diesel from rapeseed in Europe [1]. Increasingly, however, ethical and environmental concerns over biofuels and other bioenergy crops have been questioned, and interest has shifted to development of a second-generation biofuel industry (i. e., one based on nonedible fibrous or woody plant biomass – cellulosic and lignocellulosic feedstock) [2 – 6]. Nonfood feedstocks have advantages in energy balance, environment and economic perfor-mance criteria compared with food-based feedstocks such as corn- and other starch-based biofuels. Any large-scale development of biomass production will require the selection and development of bioenergy crops and cropping systems that do not compromise food production [2, 7].

40|$|The {{adequate}} <b>supply</b> {{of transport}} <b>fuel</b> {{has been a}} continuous concern ever since the automobile and individual modes of travel began the so far impetuous penetration into the transport sector.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the economics of}} coal-to-liquid (CTL) conversion, a polygeneration technology that produces <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels,</b> chemicals, and electricity by coal gasification and Fischer-Tropsch process. CTL is more expensive than extant technologies when producing the same bundle of output. In addition, the significant carbon footprint of CTL may raise environmental concerns. However, as petroleum prices rise, this technology becomes more attractive especially in coal-abundant countries such as the U. S. and China. Furthermore, including a {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) option could greatly reduce its CO 2 emissions at an added cost. To assess the prospects for CTL, we incorporate the engineering data for CTL from the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) into the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model of the global economy. Based on DOE's plant design that focuses mainly on <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> production, we find that without climate policy, CTL has the potential to account for up to a third of the global <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> <b>supply</b> by 2050 and at that level would supply about 4. 6 % of global electricity demand. A tight global climate policy, on the other hand, severely limits the potential role of the CTL even with the CCS option, especially if low-carbon biofuels are available. Under such a policy, world demand for petroleum products is greatly reduced, depletion of conventional petroleum is slowed, and so the price increase in crude oil is less, making CTL much less competitive.

This valve-less pump prevents the pump corrosion and serves appropriately to reduce the volume and weight of fuel cell systems. It comprises an amber latex rubber tube, connected at both ends to rigid stainless steel tubes of different acoustic impedance, and a simple actuation mechanism which combines a small DC motor and a cam. The motor activated cam periodically compresses the elastic tube at a position asymmetric from the tube ends. Traveling waves, emitted from the compression, combine with reflected waves at the impedance-mismatched rubber tube/stainless tube interfaces. The resulting wave interference creates a pressure gradient and generates a net flow. A DBHPFC with the active area of 25 cm 2 is constructed. It is shown that the maximum pumping rate can achieve 30 ml/min with the DBHPFC connected. The corresponding maximum power and current are 13. 0 W and 25. 5 A, respectively.

To buy the necessary {{time to develop}} domestic supplies, energy transport systems and to extend the time life of energy reserves, we have embarked on an energy conservation program which aims at a 2 % growth rate in energy use by the year 1990. The primary objective of the Industry Energy Conservation Program is to achieve {{a high degree of}} energy efficiency in manufacturing and process industries. Reduced energy costs in industry achieved through intelligent investment and operating practice is central to the program strategy. The industry program has been developed in consultation with Canadian industry and is completely voluntary on their part. The program has five main elements: 1.

By selecting the voluntary approach to deal with energy conservation we have maintained the traditional cooperative relationship between government and industry in Canada and have been able to manage a successful energy conservation program with a minimum of government intervention and bureaucracy. Industry sets the energy conservation goals, identifies the opportunities to conserve energy, and finally reports on the improvements in energy efficiency.

The objectives of this study were: (1). Develop an integrated system model for production of FT <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> from woody biomass; 2) Finding an optimum plant configuration by using energy and exergy analyses; 3) Performing techno-economic analysis on the plant. The integrated system models for conversion of woody biomass to FT <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> (BTL) were developed based on two different scenarios. Scenario I included biomass pretreatment (chipping and drying), biomass gasification in a dual fluidised bed (DFB) gasifier with steam as the gasification agent, producer gas cleaning and gas conditioning, and FT <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> synthesis. Scenario II included biomass pretreatment (chipping, drying and grinding), biomass densification through fast pyrolysis, entrained flow gasification of bio-slurry, gas cleaning and gas conditioning, and FT <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> synthesis. For Scenario I, it was assumed that woody biomass chips were transported from the biomass field to the processing plant where the chips were dried and then fed to the DFB gasifier. For Scenario II, the wood chips were firstly converted to bio-slurry by fast pyrolysis reactors in the biomass field, and then the bio-slurry was transported to the main process plant. The scale of the fast pyrolysis plant was fixed at 20 MWth thus when the main process plant had greater capacity, more than one such pyrolysis systems were operated simultaneously in different biomass fields. The unit operations of each scenario were modelled in a UniSim simulation environment by using a combination of built-in and user-defined unit operations. In the modelling, energy and mass balances in each operation unit were considered. In addition, chemical reactions in pyrolysis, gasification and FT reactors were also modelled using quasi-equilibrium and kinetic approaches. The system models were solved, and the results were compared with reported data. Finally, the system models were applied for a 100 MWth (based on the lower heating value of biomass feed) plant to analyse energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and economic returns. Parametrical analysis was also performed to investigate the effects of feedstock and operational conditions on the system performance. As part of the energy analysis, the pinch analysis was performed to optimise the heat recovery of the system and steam generation. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency of the BTL plant based on Scenario I varies from 55 % to 61. 5 % while it is 53 % for the BTL plant based on Scenario II. For improving the energy efficiency, the exhaust heat should be entirely used for biomass drying and steam generation, and the FT off gas should be used for electricity generation. Also, the steam-methane reforming reactor should be chosen over the high-temperature shift converter for the gas conditioning method in Scenario I in order to achieve higher energy efficiency. The model simulation results also indicate that the exergy efficiency of the BTL plant based on Scenario I varies between 38 % and 48 % while it is 33 % for the BTL plant based on Scenario II. Power generation is identified as the largest source of exergy loss in the system. It is proposed to maximise the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> yields and minimise the power generation capacity for improving the exergy efficiency of the system. Also, the number of process steps should be minimised in a plant configuration. The developed system models were also applied for techno-economic analysis on the BTL plant based on the two scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of various parameters on production cost and total capital investment of the BTL plant based on each scenario. These parameters included plant scale, feed biomass moisture content, unit operations’ conditions, and transportation distance between the biomass field and the BTL plant. From the feasibility analysis, {{it was found that the}} capital investment required for the BTL plant based on Scenario I was $NZ 187 million which was considerably less than that of $NZ 248. 5 million required for the BTL plant based on Scenario II. The production costs of FT <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> produced from the Scenario I BTL plant were at $NZ 1. 34 /litre for diesel and $NZ 1. 27 /litre for gasoline. These costs were lower than the costs of corresponding products produced from the Scenario II BTL plant ($NZ 1. 95 /litre for diesel and $NZ 1. 85 /litre for gasoline). The key factor for the higher production costs in the Scenario II BTL plant is the additional cost for biomass pyrolysis to produce bio-slurry that cannot be compensated by the cost of biomass transportation. At the scale of 100 MWth, the Scenario I BTL plant is competitive for commercialisation considering the actual market prices of petroleum-derived diesel and gasoline at $NZ 1. 3 /litre and $NZ 1. 23 /litre, respectively. However, the extra costs of production of bio-slurry may be paid by the cost of biomass transportation at large scale of plant (> 150 MWth) when more biomass needs to be transported over a long distance. It should be emphasised that at the time of the study in October 2013, the BTL plant was economically feasible. Unfortunately, the plant is not feasible currently as the price of crude oil has been declined significantly to $US 62. 5 /barrel from $US 105. 5 /barrel in October 2013. Therefore, the FT <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> production has to compete against the conventional <b>liquid</b> <b>fuels</b> unless some subsidies are provided by the government...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reviews the}} literature on the subject of "peak oil', the hypothesized peaking in world oil production. For Western societies dependent on supplies of cheap oil and gas, a rapid and unplanned for discontinuity in supply could be disastrous, affecting everything from food distribution to transportation. Some writers call for a "wartime mobilisation' engagement on a societal scale as the only appropriate response given the scale and severity of the challenge. The dissertation explores the literature relating to the likelihood, timing and implications of the peak, what might emerge from it, and how a transition can be facilitated to minimise its disruptive effects. The purpose of the work was to provide a synthesis that might inform how such a mobilisation might be brought about. Although far from undisputed, it was concluded that peak oil offers a plausible theory of how oil production functions and assessment of the scale and implications of the potential energy crisis. It found that despite much uncertainty, the exact date of the peak itself is of lesser importance than the timescale required for mitigation and adaptation. Evaluation of a range of postpeak scenarios suggests likely disruptions in <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> may lead to a more localized approach to the provision of essentials, such as food and energy. Within the literature, a significant number of people see economic relocalisation as inevitable and as a positive opportunity to create more sustainable production and consumption patterns rather than as a crisis. There is, however, a lack of structured literature on how such a transition could be brought about. Three perspectives are examined to assess the insights they might provide: sustainable consumption, transition management, addiction studies. The literature on addiction and dependency offers some useful, though not unproblematic, analogies with society's relationship with oil, in particular with regards to how change occurs and also how to manage resistance to change. A model is also devised to collate different post-peak scenarios in the literature and arrange them around a spectrum to clarify underlying paradigms and worldviews. Insights from the field of addictions are explored, and the FRAMES model for dealing with dependency is found to be a useful tool for understanding approaches to a collective 'weaning' from fossil fuels. From this T a number of stages are hypothesized as part of a community-led process of designing a response to peak-oil impacts. It is concluded that peak oil represents a challenge unique both in its scale and implications, and that a new synthesis of approaches and thinking is required to deal with it.

Incentive for the development of the modified burner have been the need to increase the flame stability over the operating range for the burner, especially for the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> but also the gaseous fuel operation. Foundation for modifications to the baseline burner was placed by a theoretical analysis of the processes and demands, which directs the LPP burner operation. Numerical simulations were performed to establish the flow field of the existing burner and to evaluate principles for possible modifications. Based on the analysis proposal and the restrictions put by the existing hardware, a number of modifications were proposed. Modifications adapted to the burner included the introduction of a central body, a diffusion type gas pilot at the central lance tip, a quarl-diffuser burner outlet and the application of new main- and pilot <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injectors. To serve as a basis for the evaluation of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> performance of the modified burner the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> injector’s isothermal spray characteristics were evaluated using PDA and water spray visualisation. The fuel injectors and the modifications flame stability and operation range for gaseous and <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> operation at atmospheric conditions were evaluated in comparison to the existing baseline burner. Introduction of the geometrical changes to the baseline burner with the central body and quarl outlet has changed the internal aerodynamics of the burner so that at atmospheric operation the introduced modifications were able to suppress the pressure oscillations over the load range, and to decrease the Lean Blow Off limit (LBO) by a factor 1. 5 for the gaseous fuel operation. By positioning the central body end at the beginning of the diffuser quarl the firm attachment of the forward stagnation point and the recirculation zone to the central body was achieved for the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> operation. This <b>supplied</b> a stable aerodynamics to the flame. Introduction of the <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> spray inside the swirl generator, slightly downstream half the height of the swirl generator gave a good balance between the radial transport of the spray to provide an even distribution of the burner cross section, while reducing the risk of droplets impacting on the swirl generator vanes and burner wall. The <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> operation with the new injection nozzle positioned in the central body have proven to be able to supply a stable main flame operation from a normalised flame temperature 30 % below the design flame temperature. NOx emissions performance was found to be more or less solely dependent on the positioning of the spray within the swirl generator in contrast to the injection at the swirler/mixing tube transitio...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} proposal for a new model to replace the Petroleum Market Model (PMM) currently used in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) by the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. The new <b>Liquid</b> <b>Fuels</b> Market Module (LFMM) prototype proposed here will incorporate some of the same model structure and use similar data inputs as the PMM, but with modifications and additions to reflect more current <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> market trends. Like the current PMM, the proposed LFMM will incorporate a linear programming structure to model petroleum-based fuels production – both a model block diagram and general equation sets are provided in this documentation for the prototype. The inputs to the model (both NEMS and exogenous) as well as desired outputs from the model (projections of <b>liquid</b> <b>fuel</b> production costs, petroleum and alternative <b>fuels</b> <b>supplies,</b> refinery energy consumption, refinery and alternative fuel plant capacity and utilization, capacity additions and retirements) are also very {{similar to those of the}} current PMM.
