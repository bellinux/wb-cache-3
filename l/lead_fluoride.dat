The calorimeters measure the energy and time of arrival (relative to the injection time) of the decay positrons (and their count) from the muon decay in the storage ring. After a muon decays into a positron and two neutrinos, the positron doesn’t end up with sufficient energy to fly along the magic orbit in the ring.

For mathematical description of the effect that lead and fluorine doses produced alone or in combination, we used a response surface regression model containing linear and cross terms (hyperbolic paraboloid).

This method, when adopted for the fluorination of sulphuryl chloride [6], it is observed that a mixture of sulphuryl fluoride and sulphuryl chloro fluoride is obtained. On the other hand, when <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> is substituted for sodium fluoride, pure sulphuryl chloro fluoride is evolved.

40|$|International audienceErbium L(3) -edge {{extended}} x-ray absorption {{fine structure}} (EXAFS) measurements {{were performed on}} rare earth doped fluorosilicate and fluoroborate glasses and glass ceramics. The well known nucleating effects of erbium ions for the crystallization of cubic <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> (based on x-ray diffraction measurements) {{and the fact that}} the rare earth ions are present in the crystalline phase (as indicated by Er(3 +) emission spectra) seem in contradiction with the present EXAFS analysis, which indicates a lack of medium range structural ordering around the Er(3 +) ions and suggests that the <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> crystallization does not occur in the nearest neighbor distance of the rare earth ion. Molecular dynamics simulations of the devitrification process of a <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> glass doped with Er(3 +) ions were performed, and results indicate that Er(3 +) ions lower the devitrification temperature of PbF(2), in good agreement with the experimental results. The genuine role of Er(3 +) ions in the devitrification process of PbF(2) has been investigated.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the nature of}} ion {{mobility}} in cryolite and <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> based compounds is investigated by computer simulation. The phase transition of cryolite is characterised in terms of rotation of AIF_ 6 octahedra, and the conductive properties are shown to result from diffusion of the sodium ions. The two processes appear to be unrelated. Very good agreement with NMR experimental results is found. The Pb" 2 "+ ion has a very high polarisability, yet treatment of this property in previous simulations has been problematic. In this thesis a more physically accurate method is used) and the methods of overcoming problems associated with highly polarisable anions and cations in close proximity are discussed, leading to a successful model for the representation of <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride.</b> The ion hopping processes detected by NMR in the #alpha# form of <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> are reproduced in simulation, and the analysis of this motion is greatly assisted by {{the application of a}} new method of lattice site definition. The effects of potassium and yttrium dopants on the structure and conduction are investigated in detail, and their roles both above and below the superionic transition temperature are contrasted. By observation of clusters in low temperature heavily yttrium doped simulations a structure for the short lived defect clusters in superionic <b>lead</b> <b>fluoride</b> is proposed. Very good agreement with the experimental observables is found; in particular the diffuse scattering, which experimentally gives an indication of the correlations between nearby defects is well-reproduced. The most stringent test of simulation model transferability is presented in the studies of lead tin fluoride, in which significant 'covalent' effects are apparent. Other similarly-structured compounds are also investigated, and the reasons behind the adoption of such an unusual layered structure, and the mobility and site occupation of the anions is quantified.
