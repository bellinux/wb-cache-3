5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates a <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would be able to stay airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
25|$|Newton updated {{the second}} edition of Optics (1717) with another mechanical-ether theory of gravity. Unlike his first {{explanation}} (1675 - see Streams), he proposed a stationary aether which gets thinner and thinner nearby the celestial bodies. On the analogy of the <b>lift</b> (<b>force),</b> a force arises, which pushes all bodies to the central mass. He minimized drag by stating an extremely low density of the gravitational aether.|$|E

25|$|Micro {{wind turbine}} {{are used to}} harvest wind energy readily {{available}} in the environment {{in the form of}} kinetic energy to power the low power electronic devices such as wireless sensor nodes. When air flows across the blades of the turbine, a net pressure difference is developed between the wind speeds above and below the blades. This will result in a <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> generated which in turn rotate the blades. Similar to photovoltaics, wind farms have been constructed on an industrial scale and are being used to generate substantial amounts of electrical energy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cephalopods}} {{are able}} to fly through the air for distances of up to 50m. While cephalopods are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these impressive ranges by jet-propulsion; water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism is in the air. The animals spread their fins and tentacles to form wings and actively control <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> with body posture. One species, Todarodes pacificus, has been observed spreading tentacles in a flat fan shape with a mucus film between the individual tentacles while another, Sepioteuthis sepioidea, has been observed putting the tentacles in a circular arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The wasps {{within the}} Vespidae family exhibit {{a wide range}} of body sizes, and S. septentrionalis is one of the larger wasps within the family. As a result, they are able to {{generate}} a <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> that is able to maintain flight in the presence of their large muscle mass. In order for this to occur in the most efficient manner possible, these wasps have enlarged wings and veins that are distally extended. The elongated wings will allow for flying that is more energetically efficient, in order to compensate for their large body size and muscle mass, while the distally-organized veins will prevent bending of the wings, which would result in a loss of energy.|$|E

25|$|A bird or bat {{flying through}} the air at a {{constant}} speed moves its wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of its wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing.

The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping the body in the air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole. Pterosaur flight likely worked in a similar manner, though no living pterosaurs remain for study.|$|E
25|$|Gravity is {{the primary}} {{obstacle}} to flight. Because {{it is impossible for}} any organism to have a density as low as that of air, flying animals must generate enough lift to ascend and remain airborne. One way to achieve this is with wings, which when moved through the air generate an upward <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> on the animal's body. Flying animals must be very light to achieve flight, the largest living flying animals being birds of around 20 kilograms. Other structural adaptations of flying animals include reduced and redistributed body weight, fusiform shape and powerful flight muscles; there may also be physiological adaptations. Active flight has independently evolved at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Insects were the first taxon to evolve flight, approximately 400 million years ago (mya), followed by pterosaurs approximately 220 mya, birds approximately 160 mya, then bats about 60 mya.|$|E
500|$|While Project Y continued, Frost had {{meanwhile}} {{become interested}} in the Coandă effect, where fluid flows will follow strongly convex shapes, {{something that might be}} unexpected at first glance. Frost felt the effect could be used with his engine design to produce a more practical VTOL aircraft, the exhaust flowing outward over the upper surface of the aircraft and then being directed downward over a flap-like arrangement. This would produce a <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> around the entire edge of the aircraft, allowing it to land [...] "flat". He produced a number of small experimental designs using compressed air in place of an engine in order to select a suitable airframe shape, and eventually decided that a disk was the best solution.|$|E

However, because {{the walls of}} the balloon must be able to remain rigid without imploding, the balloon is impractical to construct with all known materials. Despite that, sometimes there is discussion on the topic.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{hypothesis}} that shallow edge <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> in high-level rock climbers is more strongly related to fingertip soft tissue anatomy than to absolute strength or strength to body mass ratio. Fifteen experienced climbers performed repeated maximal single hand lifting exercises on rectangular sandstone edges of depth 2. 8, 4. 3, 5. 8, 7. 3, and 12. 5 mm while standing on a force measurement platform. Fingertip soft tissue dimensions were assessed by ultrasound imaging. Shallow edge (2. 8 and 4. 3 mm) <b>lifting</b> <b>force,</b> in newtons or body mass normalized, was uncorrelated with deep edge (12. 5 mm) <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> (r <. 1). There was a positive correlation (r =. 65, p <. 05) between <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> in newtons at 2. 8 mm edge depth and tip of bone to tip of finger pulp measurement (r <. 37 at other edge depths). The results confirm the common perception that maximum <b>lifting</b> <b>force</b> on a deep edge ("strength") does not predict maximum force production on very shallow edges. It is suggested that increased fingertip pulp dimension or plasticity may enable increased deformation of the fingertip, increasing the skin to rock contact area on very shallow edges, and thus increase the limit of force production. The study also confirmed previous assumptions of left/right force symmetry in climbers. status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, {{intended}} as a lightweight and agile aerial platform with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the rear stabilizer producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag. [...] Being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves maneuverability, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. [...] A pair of air brakes are located {{on the sides of}} the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance. It is capable of flying at a 70–80 degrees angle of attack.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{turbulent}} and {{laminar airflow}} contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates {{from the surface}} of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the separation point moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side. [...] On the turbulent flow side it remains towards the back, inducing a greater <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> on the turbulent airflow side of the ball. [...] The calculated net <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> is not enough to account for the amount of swing observed. Additional force is provided by the pressure-gradient force.|$|E
2500|$|Bernoulli's {{principle}} {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> on an airfoil, if the behaviour of the fluid flow {{in the vicinity of the}} foil is known. [...] For example, if the air flowing past the top surface of an aircraft wing is moving faster than the air flowing past the bottom surface, then Bernoulli's principle implies that the pressure on the surfaces of the wing will be lower above than below. This pressure difference results in an upwards lifting force. Whenever the distribution of speed past the top and bottom surfaces of a wing is known, the lift forces can be calculated (to a good approximation) using Bernoulli's equations – established by Bernoulli over a century before the first man-made wings were used for the purpose of flight. Bernoulli's principle does not explain why the air flows faster past the top of the wing and slower past the underside. See the article on aerodynamic lift for more info.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tail section}} of the {{aircraft}} was redesigned as well. The rudder was slightly reduced in area and the symmetrical fin section changed to an airfoil shape, producing a sideways <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> that swung the tail slightly to the left. This helped increase {{the effectiveness of the}} rudder, and reduced the need for application of right rudder on takeoff to counteract torque effects from the engine and propeller. The conspicuous bracing struts were removed from the horizontal tailplanes which were relocated to slightly below and forward of their original positions. A semi-retractable tailwheel was fitted and the main undercarriage legs were raked forward by six degrees to improve the ground handling. An unexpected structural flaw of the wing and tail section was revealed when the first F-1s were rushed into service; some aircraft crashed or nearly crashed, with either the wing surface wrinkling or fracturing, or by the tail structure failing. In one such accident, the commander of JG 2 [...] "Richthofen", Wilhelm Balthasar, lost his life when he was attacked by a Spitfire during a test flight. While making an evasive manoeuvre, the wings broke away and Balthasar was killed when his aircraft hit the ground. Slightly thicker wing skins and reinforced spars dealt with the wing problems. Tests were also carried out to find out why the tails had failed, and it was found that at certain engine settings a high-frequency oscillation in the tailplane spar was overlapped by harmonic vibrations from the engine; the combined effect being enough to cause structural failure at the rear fuselage/fin attachment point. Initially, two external stiffening plates were screwed onto the outer fuselage on each side, and later the entire structure was reinforced.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to the {{rotational}} effect mentioned above, {{the phenomena}} associated with flapping wings {{are not completely}} understood or agreed upon. Because every model is an approximation, different models leave out effects that are presumed to be negligible. For example, the Wagner effect says that circulation rises slowly to its steady-state due to viscosity when an inclined wing is accelerated from rest. This phenomenon would explain a lift value that is less than what is predicted. Typically, the case has been to find sources for the added lift. It {{has been argued that}} this effect is negligible for flow with a Reynolds number that is typical of insect flight. The Wagner effect was ignored, consciously, in at least one recent model. One of the most important phenomena that occurs during insect flight is leading edge suction. [...] This force is significant to the calculation of efficiency. The concept of leading edge suction first was put forth to describe vortex lift on sharp-edged delta wings. At high angles of attack, the flow separates over the leading edge, but reattaches before reaching the trailing edge. Within this bubble of separated flow is a vortex. Because the angle of attack is so high, a lot of momentum is transferred downward into the flow. These two features create a large amount of <b>lift</b> <b>force</b> as well as some additional drag. The important feature, however, is the lift. Because the flow has separated, yet it still provides large amounts of lift, this phenomenon is called stall delay. This effect was observed in flapping insect flight and it was proven to be capable of providing enough lift to account for the deficiency in the quasi-steady-state models. This effect is used by canoeists in a sculling draw stroke.|$|E

40|$|Two {{competing}} {{models have}} been presented {{to explain how the}} heterocercal tail functions during locomotion in sharks. First, the classical model of locomotion in sharks proposes that the heterocercal tail functions by transmitting posteroventral momentum to the water during steady horizontal swimming, thereby producing an anterodorsal reaction force (Alexander, 1965; Ferry and Lauder, 1996; Lauder, 2000). Since this reaction force is directed above the center of mass, it produces a torque around the center of mass that must be counteracted by <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> generated at the anterior end of the body. According to the classical model, the pectoral fins are thought to be upwardly inclined and are believed to generate the <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> countering the torque produced by the heterocercal tail in order to achieve rotational equilibrium. Wilga and Lauder (2000, 2001) have shown experimentally that the pectoral fins of two species of shark do not in fact generate <b>lift</b> <b>forces</b> during steady horizontal locomotion, although they do play an active hydrodynamic role during maneuvering.
