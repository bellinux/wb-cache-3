5000|$|Tallow or lard {{was used}} as a {{lubricant}} to ease the insertion of muzzle loaded bullets. [...] Elongated rifle bullets were designed to be cast with grooves encircling the bullet to provide a reservoir for lubricant. These lubricants softened the black powder fouling for easier removal and reduced the tendency of bullets to leave deposits of lead in the barrel as they were fired. The latter advantage continued to be significant with smokeless powder. Attempts to obtain satisfactory high-velocity performance with cast bullets have included experimentation with a variety of lubricant mixtures including such things as beeswax, carnuba wax, Japan wax, bayberry wax, paraffin, petroleum jelly, sperm oil, castor oil, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, graphite, molybdenum disulphide, mica, zinc oxide, Teflon, cup <b>grease,</b> <b>lithium</b> <b>soap,</b> water pump <b>grease,</b> and a variety of more modern lubricating materials.|$|R

The tribotracks after friction test was investigated with Raman Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and 3 D optical profilometry to understand the action mechanism. The status of the soap particles on a tribotrack changes with time, contact pressure and sliding speed. At low pressure and speed, individual solid undeformed soap particle stand proud of the surface and the topography shows marginal difference with sliding time. In these conditions, no frictional difference between the performance of grease with and without the nanoparticles is observed. Increasing the contact pressure and temperature (low speed and high speed) has a dramatic effect as the soap particles melt and the liquid soap flows over the track releasing the hitherto encapsulated nanoparticles. Consequently, the soap smears the track like a liquid, and the nanoparticles now come directly into the interface and are sheared to generate a low-friction tribofilm. At high particle concentration, the sliding time required for melting of the soap and release of MoS 2 is reduced, and the tribofilm is more substantial and uniform consisting of smeared MoS 2 and carboxylate soap as observed by SEM and 3 D optical profilometry.

With {{the use of a}} bouncing ball apparatus, the pressure coefficient of the limiting shear stress of the greases was determined. It is related to friction in EHL and the results verified the friction reducing properties of the soap thickeners of the grease. Film thickness in EHL of a grease lubricated point contact was measured in a ball and disc apparatus. The initial film thickness was thicker than the film thickness given by the base oil. After some seconds of running the film thickness dropped far below the base oil film thickness, because of insufficient replenishment. Replenishment was studied by looking at the distribution and flow of lubricant around the contact in the ball and disc apparatus. Primary reservoirs and primary bands close to the track of the contact, on the ball and the disc, contained small amounts of grease that constituted a potential supply of lubricant to the inlet of the contact. The majority of the grease was pushed away from the contact initially and seemed no to participate in the lubrication. Soap thickener formations were observed entering the contact in the ball and disc apparatus and cause a local increase in the film thickness that disturbed the normally horseshoe-shaped film thickness map. For lithium greases, the amount and size of the film disturbances were found to be connected with the manufacturing process of the <b>grease</b> and the <b>soap</b> thickener content.
