The digitised version had its premiere at the Woodlands Theater in Royapettah, Chennai. Despite being a re-release, the film earned public acclaim and was a commercial success.

[...] The review also compared the use of the holodeck in the episode as the Star Trek equal of the ninth season of Dallas, which was revealed to be a dream of Pam Ewing in the finale.

500|$|Gough and Millar {{had always}} wanted Marsters {{for the role of}} Milton Fine/Brainiac. The pair wrote a draft for the major story arc of season five, knowing they wanted a new villain on the show to fight Clark. With the arrival of the black ship at the end of season four, Gough and Millar decided to {{introduce}} Brainiac. To them, Marsters was the only actor they could envision that could fit the [...] "menace, intelligence, and sexiness" [...] Brainiac was going to embody. Had Marsters declined the role, Gough and Millar would have rethought introducing Brainiac, as they could not think of any other actor who could fill those shoes. Marsters felt excited playing a character that was completely intentional; he likened the intention to that of a shark. As Marsters explains, [...] " [...] was just composed of his intent. And that's exciting—it's <b>like</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> shark. You don't really ask how a shark is feeling—it's pure." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{received}} a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were {{more critical of}} the show.

[...] Despite Chase and Hawn's best efforts to liven up the broadcast, he commented, [...] "The lumbering procedure completely defeated them." [...] Television critic Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "As usual, the Academy Awards show was marked by missed cues, noisy moving scenery, plunging necklines, inane scripted chatter and, as has often happened in recent years, few galvanizing or gratifying surprises." [...] He also quipped that the segment showcasing the Best Costume Design nominees slowed down the ceremony's pace. The Philadelphia Inquirers film critic Carrie Rickey observed, [...] "As pace goes, the Academy Awards show was <b>like</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> race between slugs and snails." [...] She later wrote, [...] "Oscarsclerosis is the show's most critical condition, the result of a telecast larded, once again, with too many Vegas-style production numbers." ...|$|E

[...] After going on to Mendoza they were returning by a different pass when they found a petrified forest of fossilised trees, crystallised in a sandstone escarpment showing him {{that they had been}} on a Pacific beach when the land sank, burying them in sand which had been compressed into rock, then had gradually been raised with the continent to stand at [...] in the mountains. On returning to Valparaiso with half a mule's load of specimens he wrote to his father that his findings, if accepted, would be crucial to the theory of the formation of the world. After another gruelling expedition in the Andes while the Beagle was refitted he rejoined it and sailed to Lima, but found an armed insurrection in progress and had to stay with the ship. Here he was writing up his notes when he realised that Lyell's idea that coral atolls were on the rims of rising extinct volcanoes made less sense than the volcanoes gradually sinking so that the coral reefs around the island kept building themselves close to sea level and became an atoll as the volcano disappeared below. This was a theory he would examine when they reached such islands.|$|E
500|$|Lionel {{also has}} a key {{relationship}} with Martha Kent, Clark Kent's adoptive mother. This relationship first develops in season two when Lionel hires Martha to be his assistant; it is further developed in season five. Glover felt Lionel's attraction to Martha grows in season five when Jonathan Kent dies because he now sees Martha as a single woman and is now more attainable; Glover believes Lionel was seeking to attain Martha's [...] "goodness" [...] and the attraction {{is not based on}} lust. When Lionel is in Martha's company he tries to present himself as a man she could be with; he consciously attempts to change years of selfish behavior. Writer Holly Harold said his relationship with Martha parallels Lex's relationship with Lana; both men believe these two women will be their saving grace and pull them back from the dark side. Annette O'Toole said Martha's interest in Lionel is <b>like</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> dangerous animal; [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] O'Toole also said she believes Martha's motivation is to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When Martha left the show, writer Todd Slavkin said they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on screen. Slavkin said they could do nothing equivalent to what they gave John Schneider because there were so many storylines by the season six finale they could fit nothing else in. The writers realized they could not kill off the character so they sent her to the U.S. Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage. O'Toole and Al Gough said Martha has a small attraction to Lionel and that nothing serious would come from it.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was <b>like</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E

Actor Sylvester Stallone at ringside said it was <b>like</b> <b>watching</b> <b>an</b> autopsy on {{a man who is}} still alive. Ali's trainer Angelo Dundee finally stopped the fight in the eleventh round, the only fight Ali lost by knockout. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali's Parkinson's syndrome.

60|$|The one {{who came}} up the line looked {{impatient}} {{and put his hand}} on his companion's arm, as if to urge him away. The other stepped back, and his gesture implied that he refused to go. The train was long, the passengers were asleep, and the men, no doubt, imagined nobody saw them. Lister thought the fellow who got down did not know the girl was gone and did not mean to leave the train without her. The light touched the men's faces, and it was obvious that one was angry and the other disturbed. The scene intrigued Lister.

2500|$|Toriyama {{has stated}} that {{the aim of the}} linear game design used {{in the first half of}} Final Fantasy XIII was to feel <b>like</b> <b>watching</b> <b>a</b> film. This was done to absorb the player into the story and to {{introduce}} them to the characters and their battle abilities without becoming distracted or lost. Toriyama explained that the amount of memory and processing power needed to produce impressive graphics was the main reason not to have a seamless battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. He is interested in using first-person shooter games for inspiration rather than Western role-playing video games, as he believes they give a better sense of tension during battles. Toriyama would later use games such as Red Dead Redemption and [...] as inspirations for Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, respectively. He feels that his role of director marked a shift from creating a game world based on his own vision to unifying a team's ideas into a cohesive whole.|$|E
