5|$|Although {{many people}} believe this owl has {{exceptional}} night vision, its retina is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing.

5|$|Susan's accident-proneness is {{commonly}} used throughout the series to provide comic relief.

Susan's poor cooking skills have also become a running gag in the series.|$|E
5|$|Brock had a {{successful}} pre-war military career and a quick rise through the ranks, which many commented on at the time. Some credited <b>luck</b> <b>and</b> others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions even when the nation was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E

5|$|Many Indonesian batik {{patterns}} are symbolic. Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols {{designed to bring}} the child <b>luck,</b> <b>and</b> certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, {{as well as their}} families. Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore. Further study to the geometry of symbolism in Indonesian batik showed the applicability of fractal geometry in traditional designs.|$|E

The primary users of this traditional medicine are urban, middle-aged women who are reluctant to consider alternatives.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of the Bengal slow loris, every part—including the brain, urine, and skin—is used in {{traditional}} medicine in order to heal wounds and rheumatism. With the Sunda slow loris, people trade the skin, feet, skeletons, and skulls. The fur is reported to heal wounds, the flesh to cure epilepsy, eyes are used in love potions, and the meat is reported to cure asthma and stomach problems. The pygmy slow loris is primarily valued for the medicinal use of its hair, but it is also used to make bone glue of monkey, a medicine used mostly by local people, but sometimes sold to visitors. In general, wearing slow loris bones is considered good <b>luck</b> <b>and</b> the meat is sometimes thought to cure leprosy.|$|E

The Big Bucks documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master tapes, that had been edited out of the episodes for their initial broadcast.

5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and antithesis of Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, <b>luck</b> <b>and</b> beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{second drive}} {{of the half}} began at its 41-yard line after a 31-yard kickoff return by Wilson. On the first play of the drive, Taylor was sacked for a 13-yard loss. He made good the lost yardage on the next play, however, {{completing}} a 42-yard throw to Danny Coale. From the Stanford 40-yard line, Taylor gained fiveyards on a running play, then attempted a long pass downfield. The throw was intercepted by Stanford's Delano Howell at the Cardinal 3-yard line, returning <b>Luck</b> <b>and</b> the Stanford offense to the field. Luck needed only two plays to drive {{the length of the}} field and score a touchdown. A 56-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by a 41-yard touchdown pass to Coby Fleener, and the following extra point kick was good, making the score 26–12 with 5:49 remaining.|$|E
