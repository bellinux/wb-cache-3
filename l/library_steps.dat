William went to the drawing-room to write a letter.

60|$|The face, {{from its}} indecent expression, had {{particularly}} animated the zeal of our iconoclast; {{and it was}} against the face that he began his operations. The great height of the demigod--for he stood a fathom and half in his stocking-feet--offered a preliminary obstacle to this attack. But here, in the first skirmish of the battle, intellect already began to triumph over matter. By means {{of a pair of}} <b>library</b> <b>steps,</b> the injured householder gained a posture of advantage; and, with great swipes of the coal-axe, proceeded to decapitate the brute.|$|E

But at that moment a servant entered to inquire whether he would or would not prefer to have his lunch brought in to him there; upon his replying in the affirmative a large tray arrived on the stomach of a footman, and Swithin was greatly surprised to see a whole pheasant placed at his disposal.|$|E

[...] Even the girls who knew {{that they were going to}} be married pretended to be considering important business positions; even they who knew that they would have to work hinted about fabulous suitors. As for Carol, she was an orphan; her only near relative was a vanilla-flavored sister married to an optician in St. Paul. She had used most of the money from her father's estate. She was not in love--that is, not often, nor ever long at a time. She would earn her living.|$|E

6000|$|A {{weary and}} way-worn little bird was Prince Ricardo when he fluttered into the royal study window, {{in the palace}} of Pantouflia. The king was out at a council meeting; knowing that Ricardo had the right things, all in good order, {{he was not in}} the least anxious about him. The king was out, but Semiramis was in--Semiramis, the great grey cat, sitting on a big book {{on the top of the}} <b>library</b> <b>steps.</b> Now Semiramis was very fond of birds, and no sooner did Ricardo enter and flutter on to a table than Semiramis {{gathered}} herself together and made one fell spring at him. She just caught his tail feather. In all his adventures the prince had never been in greater danger. He escaped, but no more, and went flying round the ceiling, looking for a safe place. Finally he perched on a chandelier that hung from the roof. Here he was safe; and so weary was he, that he put his head under his wing and fell fast asleep. He was awakened by the return of the king, who threw himself on a sofa and exclaimed: ...|$|E
6000|$|Books of {{theology}} and controversial divinity, commentaries, and polyglots, sets of the Fathers, and sermons which might each furnish forth ten brief discourses of modern date, books of science, ancient and modern, classical authors in their best and rarest forms--such formed the late bishop's venerable library, and over such the eye of Dominie Sampson gloated with rapture. He entered them in the catalogue in his best running hand, forming each letter with the accuracy of a lover writing a valentine, and placed each individually on the destined shelf with all the reverence which I have seen a lady pay to a jar of old china. With all this zeal his labours advanced slowly. He often opened a volume when halfway up the <b>library</b> <b>steps,</b> fell upon some interesting passage, and, without shifting his inconvenient posture, continued immersed in the fascinating perusal until the servant pulled him by the skirts to assure him that dinner waited. He then repaired to the parlour, bolted his food down his capacious throat in squares of three inches, answered ay and no at random to whatever question was asked at him, and again hurried back to the library, {{as soon as his}} napkin was removed, and sometimes with it hanging round his neck like a pinafore;-- ...|$|E
60|$|Adeline {{was very}} different; her fair and {{brilliant}} complexion, her deep {{blue eyes and}} golden ringlets, made her a very lovely little creature; her quietness was a relief after her sister's boisterous merriment, and her dislike of dirt and brambles, continually contrasted with poor Phyllis's recklessness of such impediments. Ada readily learnt lessons, which cost Phyllis and her teacher hours of toil; Ada worked deftly when Phyllis's stiff fingers never willingly touched a needle; Ada played with a doll, drew on scraps of paper, or put up dissected maps, while Phyllis was in mischief or in the way. A book was the only chance of interesting her; but very few books took her fancy enough to occupy her long;--those few, however, she read over and over again, and when unusual tranquillity reigned in the drawing-room, she was sure to be found curled {{up at the top}} of the <b>library</b> <b>steps,</b> reading one of three books--Robinson Crusoe, Little Jack, or German Popular Tales. Then Emily blamed her ungraceful position, Jane laughed at her uniform taste, and Lily proposed some story about modern children, such as Phyllis never could like, and the constant speech was repeated, 'Only look at Ada!' till Phyllis considered her sister as a perfect model, and sighed over her own naughtiness.|$|E

(Bogunović et al. "Anatomical Labeling of the Circle of Willis Using Maximum A Posteriori Probability Estimation. " IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 32 (9) (2013) : 1587) We first prune the centerline model to a region around the CoW. “FeatureGenerating/data/skeleton”. Step 1 : FeatureGenerating(C/C++) : To generate a feature matrix “FeatureGenerating/feature” from the skeleton data “FeatureGenerating/data/skeleton” that has been marked with Ground Truth“FeatureGenerating/data/cood. txt”. We employed the NURBS curve with features calculate available in NURBS open-source library. To compile the code, you also need to include the <b>library.</b> <b>Step</b> 2 : Pre_ML (C/C++) : To Separate feature matrix “FeatureGenerating/feature” into the training set “data/ML/XXX/train. txt” and corresponding test set “data/ML/XXX/test. txt”. Step 3 : XGBoost(Python) : To train model based on the training set in “data/ML”, and predict the results ”data/res_XGBoost” of corresponding test set. To compile the code, you also need to include the XGBoost <b>library.</b> <b>Step</b> 4 : Chain(C/C++) : To “sort” the bifurcation and construct observation sequences “data/obs_list” and status sequences “data/GT_list” {{based on the results of}} XGBoost.

Row 1 in “seg/XXX” is the sequence of state, and Row 2 in “data/seg/XXX” is its corresponding sequence of observations. Step 6 : HMM(Python) : Hidden Markov Process. Input:”data/seg/XXX”, “data/obs”, “data/trans” In the file “data/res_topo”, Row 1 is the results, and Row 2 is its corresponding Ground Truth. To compile the code, you also need to include the hmmlearn <b>library.</b> <b>Step</b> 7 : Result analysis: Metrics. In the file”data/matrix_XGBoost”and ”data/matrix_topo”, the first part is TP, FN, FP, TN value, the second part is A, P, R, S value, the last part is the confusion matrix. The project contains the implementation of the method described in: Wang et al., "Automatic labeling of vascular structures with topological constraints via HMM", MICCAI 2017. We propose a novel graph labeling approach to anatomically label vascular structures of interest. Our algorithm can handle different topologies, like circle, chain and tree.

60|$|It was half-past {{nine in the}} evening, and {{the wedding}} over--Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth gone, and the guests departed, the drawing-room had {{returned}} to its usual state. It was a very large room, so spacious {{that it would have}} been waste and desolate, had it not been well filled with handsome, but heavy old-fashioned furniture, covered with crimson damask, and one side of the room fitted up with a bookcase, so high that there was a spiral flight of <b>library</b> <b>steps</b> to give access to the upper shelves. Opposite were four large windows, now hidden by their ample curtains; and near them was at one end of the room a piano, at the other a drawing-desk. The walls were wainscoted with polished black oak, the panels reflecting the red fire-light like mirrors. Over the chimney-piece hung a portrait, by Vandyke, of a pale, dark cavalier, of noble mien, and with arched eyebrows, called by Lilias, in defiance of dates, by the name of Sir Maurice de Mohun, the hero of the family, and allowed by every one to be a striking likeness of Claude, the youth who at that moment lay, extending a somewhat superfluous length of limb upon the sofa, which was placed commodiously at right angles to the fire.|$|E
60|$|With these amusements, {{in rather}} too great plenty, {{it must not}} be assumed that Pen {{neglected}} his studies altogether.

It was only when they forced {{his head into the}} waters of knowledge, that he refused to drink. He devoured all the books at home from Inchbald's Theatre to White's Farriery; he ransacked the neighbouring book-cases. He found at Clavering an old cargo of French novels, which he read with all his might; and he would sit for hours perched upon the topmost bar of Doctor Portman's <b>library</b> <b>steps</b> with a folio on his knees, whether it were Hakluyt's Travels, Hobbes's Leviathan, Augustini Opera, or Chaucer's Poems. He and the Vicar were very good friends, and from his Reverence, Pen learned that honest taste for port wine which distinguished him through life. And as for that dear good woman, Mrs. Portman, who was not in the least jealous, though her Doctor avowed himself in love with Mrs. Pendennis, whom he pronounced to be by far the finest lady in the county--all her grief was, as she looked up fondly at Pen perched on the book-ladder, that her daughter, Minny, was too old for him--as indeed she was--Miss Myra Portman being at that period only two years younger than Pen's mother, and weighing as much as Pen and Mrs. Pendennis together.|$|E
