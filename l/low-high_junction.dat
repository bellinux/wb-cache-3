40|$|Recent use of {{alloying}} {{techniques for}} rear contact formation has yielded {{a new kind}} of silicon solar cell, the back surface field (BSF) cell, with abnormally high open circuit voltage and improved radiation resistance. Several analytical models for open circuit voltage based on the reverse saturation current are formulated to explain these observations. The zero SRV case of the conventional cell model, the drift field model, and the <b>low-high</b> <b>junction</b> (LHJ) model can predict the experimental trends. The LHJ model applies the theory of the <b>low-high</b> <b>junction</b> and is considered to reflect a more realistic view of cell fabrication. This model can predict the experimental trends observed for BSF cells. Detailed descriptions and derivations for the models are included. The correspondences between them are discussed. This modeling suggests that the meaning of minority carrier diffusion length measured in BSF cells be reexamined...|$|E
40|$|A {{measurement}} technique employing the {{scanning electron microscope}} is described in which values of the true bulk diffusion length are obtained. It is shown that surface recombination effects can be eliminated {{through the application of}} highly doped surface field layers. The influence of high injection level effects and <b>low-high</b> <b>junction</b> current generation on the resulting measurement was investigated. Close agreement is found between the diffusion lengths measured by this method and those obtained using a penetrating radiation technique...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} a measuring technique employing the {{scanning electron microscope}} in which values of the true bulk diffusion length are obtained. It is shown that surface recombination effects can be eliminated through application of highly doped surface field layers. The effects of high injection level and <b>low-high</b> <b>junction</b> current generation are investigated. Results obtained with this technique are compared to those obtained by a penetrating radiation (X-ray) method, and a close agreement is found. The SEM technique is limited to cells that contain a back surface field layer...|$|E
40|$|A {{physical}} model {{taking into consideration}} the effects of finite collector minority carrier lifetime and minority carrier blocking property of the <b>low-high</b> (n−n+) <b>junction</b> is proposed for predicting the bipolar transistor dc characteristics covering saturation and quasi-saturation operations. Solution for the electron and hole carrier profiles, recombination, drift and diffusion current densities, electric field distributions and voltage drops {{as a function of}} the collector current density is presented. The low-level injection model neglecting collector minority carrier recombination current within the injection region is also present. The validity of the complete model is verified by comparing the results obtained by the present analysis with experimental results available in the literature...|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, yet complete {{analytical model}} for predicting {{the performance of}} illuminated or unilluminated (dark) pn diodes with arbitrary doping profiles is developed and presented in this dissertation. It {{can be used to}} calculate the saturation current, minority carrier density, short circuit current, spectral response, and effective <b>low-high</b> (p-p⁺) <b>junction</b> recombination velocities of such diodes. The model is applied to dark or illuminated n⁺-p-p⁺ diodes {{as a function of the}} front and back surface recombination velocities and the bulk doping profiles. The analysis includes heavy doping effects. The results predicted by this model are compared with those predicted by numerical simulation programs. Both results agree well with each other and with the experimental data available. The complete analytical expressions produced by the model can be reduced to simpler forms for the transparent and quasi-transparent cases. These forms agree with the special case expressions developed by others. The new model is a substantial contribution leading to improved understanding of such devices...|$|R
40|$|A chopped {{electron}} beam induced current (EBIC) technique for the chacterization of back-surface field (BSF) solar cells is presented. It is {{shown that the}} effective recombination velocity of the <b>low-high</b> <b>junction</b> forming the back-surface field of BSF cells, {{in addition to the}} diffusion length and the surface recombination velocity of the surface perpendicular to both the p-n and low-high junctions, can be determined from the data provided by a single EBIC scan. The method for doing so is described and illustrated. Certain experimental considerations taken to enhance the quality of the EBIC data are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer-aided-design}} {{study on}} the dependence of the efficiency peak of a back-surface field solar cell on the concentrations of the recombination and dopant impurities is presented. The illuminated current-voltage characteristics of more than 100 cell designs are obtained using the transmission line circuit model to numerically solve the Shockley equations. Using an AM 1 efficiency of 17 % as a target value, it is shown that the efficiency versus thickness dependence has a broad maximum which varies by less than 1 % over more than a three-to-one range of cell thicknesses from 30 to 100 microns. An optically reflecting back surface will give only a slight improvement of AM 1 efficiency, about 0. 7 %, in this thickness range. Attention {{is given to the}} dependence of the efficiency on patchiness across the back-surface field <b>low-high</b> <b>junction</b> in thin cells...|$|E
