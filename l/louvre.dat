5|$|The <b>Louvre</b> is {{slightly}} askew of the Historic Axis (Axe historique), a roughly eight-kilometre (five-mile) architectural line bisecting the city. It begins {{on the east}} in the <b>Louvre</b> courtyard and runs west along the Champs-Élysées. In 1871, the burning of the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune revealed that the <b>Louvre</b> was slightly askew of the Axe despite past appearances to the contrary. The <b>Louvre</b> {{can be reached by}} the Palais Royal– Musée du <b>Louvre</b> Métro or the Louvre-Rivoli stations.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Louvre</b> {{employs a}} staff of 2,000 led by Director Jean-Luc Martinez, who reports to the French Ministry of Culture and Communications. Martinez {{replaced}} Henri Loyrette in April 2013. Under Loyrette, who replaced Pierre Rosenberg in 2001, the <b>Louvre</b> has undergone policy changes that allow it to lend and borrow more works than before. In 2006, it loaned 1,300works, which enabled it to borrow more foreign works. From 2006 to 2009, the <b>Louvre</b> lent artwork to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, and received a $6.9million payment {{to be used for}} renovations.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum is}} housed in the <b>Louvre</b> Palace, {{originally}} built as a fortress in the late 12thcentury under PhilipII. Remnants of the fortress are visible {{in the basement of}} the museum. Due to the urban expansion of the city, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and, in 1546, was converted by Francis I into the main residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present <b>Louvre</b> Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the <b>Louvre</b> primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the <b>Louvre</b> for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the <b>Louvre</b> should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.|$|E

The Parisian <b>Louvre</b> will also be providing management advice to its Middle Eastern counterpart, at a cost of US$214.5 million. An additional US$253.5 million will be paid for various special exhibitions. A total of four exhibitions will be hosted per year over a period of fifteen years.

5|$|By 1874, the <b>Louvre</b> Palace had {{achieved}} {{its present form}} of an almost rectangular structure with the Sully Wing to the east containing the Cour Carrée (Square Court) and the oldest parts of the Louvre; and two wings which wrap the Cour Napoléon, the Richelieu Wing {{to the north and}} the Denon Wing, which borders the Seine to the south. In 1983, French President François Mitterrand proposed, as one of his Grands Projets, the Grand <b>Louvre</b> plan to renovate the building and relocate the Finance Ministry, allowing displays throughout the building. Architect I. M. Pei was awarded the project and proposed a glass pyramid to stand over a new entrance in the main court, the Cour Napoléon. The pyramid and its underground lobby were inaugurated on 15 October 1988; the pyramid was completed in 1989. The second phase of the Grand <b>Louvre</b> plan, La Pyramide Inversée (The Inverted Pyramid), was completed in 1993. As of 2002, attendance had doubled since completion.|$|E
5|$|During the Third Republic (1870–1940) the <b>Louvre</b> {{acquired}} new pieces mainly via {{donations and}} gifts. The Société des Amis du <b>Louvre</b> donated the Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon, and in 1863 an expedition uncovered the sculpture Winged Victory of Samothrace in the Aegean Sea. This piece, though heavily damaged, has been prominently displayed since 1884. The 583-item Collection La Caze donated in 1869, included works by Chardin; Fragonard; Rembrandt – such as Bathsheba at Her Bath – and Gilles by Watteau.|$|E

In 2001, the IMA collaborated with the Armory Museum in Moscow to organize Gifts to the Tsars, 1500–1700: Treasures from the Kremlin. The show helped the IMA form partnerships with local arts organizations, gain international exposure, and attracted a record 70,704 visitors. Another important exhibit {{to travel to the}} IMA was Roman Art from the <b>Louvre,</b> which attracted 106,002 visitors during its 2008 run.
