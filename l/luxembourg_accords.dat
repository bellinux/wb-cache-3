500|$|From {{as early}} as 1904, Alfred von Schlieffen of the German General Staff began {{to draw up a}} {{military}} strategy, known as the Schlieffen Plan, which could be put into action if Germany found itself involved in a two-front war against France and Russia. The core of the plan was a rapid attack on France on the outbreak of war, forcing a quick victory in the west before the Russians had time to fully mobilize their forces. The Schlieffen Plan took advantage of the French military's concentration and fortifications along the Franco-German border by prescribing an invasion of neutral Belgium and <b>Luxembourg.</b> <b>According</b> to the plan, the German army would rapidly overwhelm the Belgian military and then move quickly through the country and then towards Paris.

40|$|It {{is a key}} aim of the EU 2020 {{strategy}} and of the Luxembourg government to promote research and innovation (“smart growth”). The 2014 - 2020 programming period of the Structural Funds offers an opportunity to support projects in this field at national, cross-border and transnational levels. This leaflet synthesises {{the results of a}} consultation process organised by the ESPON Contact Point of Luxembourg in summer and autumn 2013 in the framework of the USESPON project. First, it aimed at analysing the relevance of ESPON results in the field of research, development and innovation (RDI) in Luxembourg. Second, this process reflected on possible priorities for the future operational programmes of the structural funds. This process involved either experts in the field of RDI or those responsible for drafting operational programmes. The consultation process has been framed by a Delphi technique. First, participants received “support material” presenting the situation of <b>Luxembourg</b> <b>according</b> to the ESPON results. Second, they participated in a workshop on 11 th July 2013. Third, a synthesis {{based on the results of}} the workshop was provided together with a questionnaire giving the experts the opportunity to deepen and concretise their contribution. By summarising this consultation process, this leaflet aims at 1) working out a profile of Luxembourg on the basis of ESPON results in the field of RDI and 2) developing recommendations of how future-oriented innovation strategies can be implemented in the context of European Territorial Cooperation.

50|$|De Brosse greatly {{influenced}} the sober and classicizing direction that French Baroque architecture was to take, especially in designing his most prominent commission, the Luxembourg Palace, Paris (1615-1624), for Marie de' Medici, whose patronage had {{been extended to}} his uncle. Salomon de Brosse simplified the crowded compositions of his Androuet du Cerceau heritage and contemporary practice, ranging the U-shaped block round an entrance court, as Carlo Maderno was doing at Palazzo Barberini, Rome, about the same time. The impetus for the plan is often traced to Palazzo Pitti, Florence, where the Medici queen had spent her youth, but the formal plan of Anet could also be adduced. He clad the building wholly in stone, avoiding the lively contrast of brick and stone that was the more familiar idiom. Though de Brosse was forced to relinquish his post on 24 March 1624, construction of the <b>Luxembourg</b> proceeded <b>according</b> to his plan and elevations; extensions made {{in the nineteenth century}} have not obscured his external elements.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of the metabolic syndrome (MS) {{has been determined}} in many countries worldwide but never in Luxembourg. This research aimed to 1) establish the gender- and age-specific {{prevalence of}} MS and its components in the general adult population of <b>Luxembourg,</b> <b>according</b> {{to the most recent}} Joint Interim Statement (JIS) definition, by using both the high and low cut-off points to define abdominal obesity, and 2) compare and assess the degree of agreement with the Revised National Cholesterol Education Programme-Adult Treatment Panel III (R-ATPIII) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definitions. Methods A representative stratified random sample of 1349 European subjects, aged 18 - 69 years, participated to ORISCAV-LUX survey. Logistic regression and odds ratios (OR) were used to study MS prevalence with respect to gender and age. The Framingham risk score (FRS) to predict the 10 -year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was calculated to compare the proportion of MS cases below or above 20 %, according to both high and low waist circumference (WC) thresholds. Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) was utilized to measure the degree of agreement between MS definitions. Results The prevalence of the MS defined by the JIS was 28. 0 % and 24. 7 % when using the low (94 / 80) and the high (102 / 88) WC cut-off points, respectively. The prevalence was significantly higher in men than in women (OR = 2. 6 and 2. 3 for the low and high WC thresholds), as were all components of the MS except abdominal obesity measured by both thresholds. It also increased with age (OR values in age categories ranging from 2. 7 to 28 when compared to the younger subjects for low WC and from 3. 3 to 31 for the high WC cut-offs). The 10 -year predicted risk of CHD by FRS did not depend on the threshold used. Globally, excellent agreement was observed between the three definitions of MS (κ= 0. 89), in particular between JIS and IDF (κ = 0. 93). Agreement was significantly higher in women than in men, and differed between age groups. Conclusion Regardless of the definition used, the adult population of Luxembourg reveals a high MS prevalence. Our findings contribute to build evidence regarding the definitive construct of the MS, to help selecting the waist circumference thresholds for Europid populations, and to support the need to revise the guidelines for abdominal obesity levels. </p...|$|R
50|$|From 1935 to 1938 the Cathedral was {{enlarged}} and expanded. This enlargement, which {{influence the}} silhouette of the fortress city of <b>Luxembourg,</b> went ahead <b>according</b> to plans by and {{under the supervision of}} the Luxembourgish architect Hubert Schumacher. The expanded area, which connects to the two choir bays of 1613-1621, characterises the image of the former Jesuit church both due to its spaceousness and through the architectural unity. The rebuilding of the exterior architecture on the Gothic-style cathedral presented a challenge, since the goal was to harmoniously integrate the church with the surrounding buildings, such as the former Athénée building from the 17th century, the national library, the old church of St. Maximin (1751) (now the Foreign Ministry), as well as the old residential houses.|$|R
30|$|However, with {{a strong}} belief that Luxembourg is a highly literate society, {{there has not been}} enough {{attention}} to adult literacy education as well as immigrants’ L 2 literacy education. There are no statistics available on low literacy or illiteracy in Luxembourg that the public can access (Ewerling: Illiteracy in Luxembourg: reading and writing difficulties of adults in <b>Luxembourg,</b> unpublished). <b>According</b> to our own investigation, adult literacy education is offered mainly by the private sector. INL hosts only one literacy course in French. In addition, a handful of literacy courses are offered at municipalities through non-profit organizations. Due to lack of the relevant statistics, {{it is hard to know}} how many people are registered in the literacy classes and who they are. However, Ewerling importantly observes that German literacy courses usually have Luxembourgish natives while most foreign literacy learners register for French literacy courses. That is, even though no literacy courses explicitly target immigrant L 2 literacy learners, the multilingual landscape of Luxembourg spontaneously leads those immigrants to choose to learn French literacy as the lingua franca of Luxembourg. We will see in Section ‘A case study’ that Ewerling’s observation holds for our case study, where only immigrant learners were found to be participating in the French literacy course that we observed.|$|R

She met Gertrude Stein while sketching in the <b>Luxembourg</b> Gardens. <b>According</b> to Charlotte Rubinstein in American Women Artists, Goldthwaite explained that Stein [...] "looked something like an immense dark brown egg. She wore, wrapped tight around her, a brown kimono-like garment and a large flat black hat, and stood on feet covered with wide sandals." [...] Stein invited Goldthwaite to visit her home, yet she hesitated due to Stein's [...] "shabby" [...] appearance.

She later said, [...] "Fate gave me several years in Paris at the most exciting time: during the great reconstruction from art to modern art." [...] During her time in Paris, Goldthwaite drifted to different studios in an attempt to find the right teacher. After much difficulty, she joined a small group of young artists who worked at 86 Notre Dame des Champs. Their work was periodically critiqued by Charles Guerin, a disciple of Cézanne.
