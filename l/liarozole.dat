40|$|Abstract Background <b>Liarozole</b> fumarate (<b>liarozole</b> – R 85246) {{is a novel}} {{compound}} with {{characteristics of}} both aromatase inhibitor (AI) and a retinoic acid metabolism blocking agent (RAMBA). Our objective {{was to determine the}} effects of <b>liarozole</b> alone or in combination with tamoxifen on the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) -induced rat mammary carcinoma model, as well as on the uterus in ovariectomized immature rats. Methods (1) Tumor burden experiments: Animals bearing one or more tumors greater than 10 mm in diameter were treated for 56 consecutive days with 20 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg of <b>liarozole</b> by oral gavage, tamoxifen 100 μg/kg by subcutaneous injection, or a combination of <b>liarozole</b> and tamoxifen. At the end of the treatment period, total cumulative tumor volume as well as retinoic acid levels were measured. (2) Uterotrophic assay and proliferation experiments: 21 -day-old ovariectomized (OVX) Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 20 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg of <b>liarozole</b> by oral gavage, tamoxifen 1 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection, and combination of both for 4 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment period, uterine weight, epithelial lining cell height and indices of proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were measured. Results The tumor burden experiments in rats bearing estrogen receptor (ER) positive mammary tumours showed that <b>liarozole</b> has a marked anti-tumour effect. In combination with tamoxifen, <b>liarozole</b> had neither an additive nor an antagonistic effect. However, <b>liarozole</b> markedly reduced the uterotrophic effects induced by tamoxifen. Conclusion Liarozole's antitumor effects on ER positive mammary tumors and its protective effect on the uterus merit further studies to confirm its clinical value in combination with tamoxifen in ER positive postmenopausal breast cancer. <b>Liarozole</b> and other retinomimetics might also be suitable chemoprevention drugs in combination with tamoxifen because of their favorable toxicity profile. </p...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{inactivation}} of all-trans {{retinoic acid}} to 4 -hydroxy retinoic acid occurs via a cytochrome P- 450 enzyme. We investigated {{the effects of}} <b>liarozole</b> on the retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity of human epidermis {{and its ability to}} modify in vivo human skin responses to retinoic acid and all-trans retinol. Retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity induced in vivo by 4 d treatment with retinoic acid (0. 1 %) was inhibited in vitro by <b>liarozole</b> in a concentration-dependent manner. Comparable micromolar concentrations of <b>liarozole</b> were extracted from stratum corneum-free epidermis treated with 3 % <b>liarozole.</b> Retinoic acid levels in liarozole-treated skin increased to 19 ± 5 ng/g wet wt (mean ± SEM, p< 0. 002,n= 17) at 18 h and to 6 ± 2 ng/g wet wt (p= 0. 38, n= 17) at 48 h as compared to vehicle (not detectable). At 48 h, retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase activity was induced 9 -fold over vehicle (p< 0. 03, n= 8). At 96 h, no significant erythema or increased epidermal thickness was found when either retinoic acid (0. 001 %), all-trans retinol (0. 025 %), or <b>liarozole</b> (3 %) was applied individually, but when 0. 001 % retinoic acid and 3 % <b>liarozole</b> were applied together, both erythema and increased epidermal thickness occurred. In contrast, 0. 025 % all-trans retinol and 3 % <b>liarozole</b> together caused increased epidermal thickness but no erythema. These data demonstrate that, at doses used here, <b>liarozole,</b> although an effective inhibitor of retinoic acid 4 -hydiroxylase, cannot function alone like a retinoid in vivo, probably because of retinoic acid 4 -hydroxylase induction. In the presence of a low dose retinoic acid or all-trans retinol, however, <b>liarozole</b> can amplify human skin responses to each retinoid in a manner characteristic of the retinoid at a higher dose (erythema and hyperplasia with retinoic acid; no erythema but hyperplasia with all-trans retinol) ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether 2 -hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) can be used as transdermal absorption enhancer for <b>liarozole.</b> Therefore, we used an in vivo model where transdermal drug absorption in rats can be studied under physiological conditions by cannulating the peripheral skin vein draining the area of the skin which is used for drug application, and collecting the blood (Vollmer et al., 1992 a). We compared <b>liarozole,</b> applied as a 1 % aqueous solution, in different formulations. We varied the pH, the concentration of HPbetaCD and tested another cyclodextrin derivative (2, 6 -dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin, DIMEB). In addition, we compared the absorption with a formulation of 40 % propylene glycol/ 10 % oleic acid (PG/OA) and after stripping the stratum corneum. HPbetaCD was a moderate enhancer at a concentration of 20 % (4. 9 % HPbetaCD was ineffective) and increased the flux of <b>liarozole</b> at pH 4 from 0. 138 - 0. 151 (control) to 0. 421 - 0. 487 nmol per h (i. e., 3 -fold) after a lag time of 84 - 104 min (95 % limits of confidence), whereas the same formulation at pH 7 did not reach steady state during 4. 5 h. The absorption of <b>liarozole</b> in 20 % aqueous solution of DIMEB was slightly decreased (by a factor of 0. 6), in PG/OA it increased by a factor 1. 7 and the flux after stripping the stratum corneum reached 91. 4 - 101. 4 nmol/h with a lag time of 10 - 16 min. Therefore, a 20 % aqueous solution of HPbetaCD appears to be a suitable transdermal absorption enhancer for <b>liarozole...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{testicular}} {{gene expression}} of the retinoic acid receptors, RAR alpha, -beta, and -gamma, was studied in normal mice and in vitamin A-deficient mice after the administration of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). All three types of RARs were expressed in normal and/or vitamin A-deficient testes. Only the expression of RAR beta messenger RNA was transiently induced within 24 h after ATRA injection. ATRA-induced RAR beta expression was also found in purified Sertoli cells, suggesting that these cells mediate {{at least part of}} the effect of retinoids on germ cells. When an equimolar amount of retinol was administered instead of ATRA, no induction of RAR beta was seen at the point of maximal induction by ATRA, suggesting that the effect of retinol was delayed and probably less. The related nuclear receptors, RXR alpha, -beta, and, for the first time, gamma, were also shown to be present in the mouse testis. Upon administration of ATRA, messenger RNA expression of RXR alpha and -beta did not change significantly. The expression of RXR gamma was too low to allow quantification. Finally, the effect of the retinoid metabolism inhibitor <b>liarozole</b> on ATRA-induced proliferation of A spermatogonia was examined. The labeling index of A spermatogonia, 24 h after the administration of 0. 25 mg ATRA, was significantly lowered by <b>liarozole</b> due to a shift of the maximal 5 -bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation to an earlier point (20 h). This indicates that <b>liarozole</b> delays retinoid metabolism, thereby increasing the actual ATRA concentration, and more importantly, that ATRA by itself is an active retinoid in spermatogenesis.

40|$|Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells, the {{somatic cells}} of the seminiferous tubule, support growth and {{differentiation}} of developing germ cells. This action strictly depends {{on the availability of}} in situ synthesized retinoic acid and we have previously documented the ability of Sertoli, but not peritubular cell extracts, to support the oxidation of retinol to retinoic acid. Using primary cultures of somatic cells treated with a physiological concentration of free retinol, we show here that the same is essentially true also for whole cultured cells. Sertoli cells are capable of producing not only retinoic acid, but are also the major site of retinyl ester (mainly, retinyl palmitate) formation. Compared with retinyl palmitate accumulation, retinoic acid synthesis was both faster and positively influenced by prior exposure to retinol. This increase in retinoic acid synthesis was further augmented by treatment with the retinoic acid catabolic inhibitor <b>liarozole,</b> thus indicating that enhanced synthesis, rather than reduced catabolism, is responsible for such an effect. Myoid cells had a higher capacity to incorporate exogenously supplied retinol, yet retinoic acid synthesis, and even more so retinyl palmitate formation, were considerably lower than in Sertoli cells. Retinoic acid synthesis in myoid cells was not only depressed, but also very little influenced by prior retinol exposure and totally insensitive to <b>liarozole.</b> These data further support the view that myoid cells are involved in retinol uptake from the blood and its transfer to other cells, rather than in metabolic interconversion or long-term storage of vitamin A, two processes that mainly take place in Sertoli cells...|$|E

40|$|Retinoic Acid Metabolism Blocking Agents (RAMBAs) {{increase}} the endogenous levels of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) by inhibiting CYP 26 enzymes. Thus they {{are believed to}} mimic the effects of retinoid treatment. Their mechanism of action and effects on vitamin A metabolism in keratinocytes are however uncertain. To explore this and the function of CYP 26 in human skin was {{the main purpose of}} the project. The effects of two RAMBAs (talarozole and <b>liarozole)</b> on the expression of retinoid biomarkers in epidermis were studied in vivo and in vitro. Normal human skin (n= 16) exposed to topical talarozole for 9 days showed similar response as previously reported for topical RA, even though no skin inflammation occurred. Lamellar ichthyosis patients (n= 11) treated systemically with <b>liarozole</b> showed variable clinical improvement after 4 weeks with only mild effects on the retinoid biomarkers and the expression did not always correlate at the protein and mRNA levels. In these studies the proinflammatory transcripts IL- 1 α and TNFα were down-regulated by RAMBAs. In vitro, using an organotypic epidermis model we first studied how the RA metabolism was affected by adding RA and/or RAMBAs. We next examined the effects of the same agents on the expression of vitamin A metabolising enzymes in monolayer cultures of proliferating and differentiating keratinocytes. The results show among other things that CYP 26 A 1 and B 1 are both involved in the catabolism of RA, and that talarozole potently increases the level of endogenous RA, primarily by inhibiting CYP 26 B 1. However the drug´s biological effects cannot be solely attributed to increased RA levels. In conclusion, RAMBAs are promising new drugs for treatment of skin disorders, but further studies on their mechanism of action are needed...|$|E
40|$|Retinoic acid {{stimulates the}} {{expression}} of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in vascular endothelial cells in vitro and enhances t-PA levels in plasma and tissues in vivo. Compared with the in vivo situation, high retinoic acid concentrations are required to induce optimally t-PA expression in vitro. These findings led us to study retinoic acid metabolism in cultured human endothelial cells. For comparison, these studies were also performed in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG 2, and key experiments were repeated with human primary hepatocytes. Both hepatocyte cultures gave very similar results. Human endothelial cells were shown to possess an active retinoic acid metabolizing capacity, which is quantitatively {{comparable to that of}} hepatocytes, but different from that of hepatocytes in several qualitative aspects. Our results demonstrate that all-trans-retinoic acid is quickly metabolized by both endothelial cells and hepatocytes. All trans-retinoic acid induces its own metabolism in endothelial cells but not in hepatocytes. 9 -cis-Retinoic acid is degraded slowly by endothelial cells. whereas hepatocytes metabolize 9 -cis-retinoic acid very quickly. Furthermore, our data show that hepatocytes, but not endothelial cells, detectably isomerise all-trans-retinoic acid to 9 -cis-retinoic acid and vice versa. In both endothelial cells and hepatocytes all-trans-retinoic acid metabolism was inhibitable by the cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors <b>liarozole</b> (10 μM) and ketoconazole (10 μM), albeit to different extents and with different specificities. In the presence of the most potent retinoic acid metabolism inhibitor in endothelial cells, <b>liarozole,</b> at least 10 -fold lower all trans-retinoic acid concentrations were required than {{in the absence of the}} inhibitor to obtain the same induction of t-PA. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that all-trans-retinoic acid and 9 -cis retinoic acid are actively but differently metabolized and isomerised by human endothelial cells and hepatocytes. The rapid metabolism of retinoic acid explains the relatively high concentrations of retinoic acid required to induce t-PA in cultured endothelial cells.

Northern analysis showed that this novel human CYP 26 is induced within I h upon RA treatment in RA-sensitive T- 47 D breast carcinoma cells but not in RA-resistant MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cells and HCT I 16 colon cancer cells. Stable introduction of different RA receptor (RAR) subtypes in HCT I 16 cells showed that CYP 26 expression is dependent on RARa and RAR’y and, to a lesser extent, on RARI 3 and closely paralleled RA metabolism, suggesting that it represents the major RA 4 -hydroxylase in these human cells. Furthermore, stable introduction of all three RAR subtypes in HCT I 16 cells resulted in restored RA sensitivity as assayed by growth inhibition.

The use of ATRA or prodrugs as pharmacological agents is limited by a short half-life in vivo resulting from the activity of specific ATRA hydroxylases, CYP 26 enzymes, induced by ATRA in liver and target tissues. For this reason retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs) have been developed for treating cancer and a wide range of other diseases.

The adhesion of cancer cells to the endothelium is {{an important}} preliminary event that underlies cancer matastasis. Within the this study, the development of assays for the enzymes; CYP 17 and 17 [beta]-HSD 3 and the evaluation of a series of compounds which were designed to inhibit these enzymes have been considered. The preliminary screening of the compounds showed good inhibition of 17 [alpha]=OHase and 17, 20 lyase components of the CYP 17 enzyme in comparison to the reference drug, ketoconazole (KTZ). The IC[sub] 50 of compounds 31, 34, 38, 41, 48 and 51 and KTZ was calculated as 14. 40 [Mu]M, 5. 82 [Mu]M, 0. 18 [Mu]M, 1. 35 [Mu]M, 1. 21 [Mu]M, 0. 50 [Mu]M and 5. 65 [Mu]M respectively. However, {{only a few of the}} compounds designed to inhibit 17 [beta]-HSD 3 showed ap potent inhibitory activity. Compound 132 showed the highest percentage inhibition (40. 51 [plus or minus] 0. 14...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{retinoic acid}} binding protein II (CRABP II) mRNA is {{selectively}} induced by all-trans retinoic acid in human skin and dermal fibroblasts. In {{order to determine}} whether this response {{can be used as}} a reliable measure of retinoid potency and activity, we treated human skin fibroblasts for 24 h with increasing concentrations of several natural and synthetic retinoids. CRABP II mRNA levels were measured by quantitative Northern blotting and compared, when possible, with those obtained after topical application of the same retinoids to human skin. All eight active retinoids tested induced a concentration-dependent CRABP II mRNA response in the fibroblast assay. In contrast, one known inactive retinoid (meta-carboxy TTNPB), differing from the active form only in the position of the carboxyl substituent, failed to evoke a response. The fibroblast and human skin bioassays agreed with respect to relative potency and response amplitude for three of the three retinoids tested. Retinoic acid was approximately 10 -fold more potent than retinal in both assays, suggesting that oxidation to retinoic acid underlies the activity of retinol in fibroblasts as well as in intact skin. In support of this hypothesis, treatment with <b>liarozole,</b> an inhibitor of P 450 -mediated retinoic acid oxidative catabolism, significantly increased fibroblast CRABP II mRNA levels and potentiated the effects of retinol by 1. 5 -fold at concentrations at which it had no effect on its own. Taken together, these results identify the fibroblast CRABP II response as a reproducible measure of retinoid bioactivity with promise as a predictor of human skin responses and further suggest that metabolism is an important determinant of retinoid bioactivity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|In recent studies, we have {{identified}} several highly potent all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs). On the basis of previous effects of <b>liarozole</b> (a first-generation RAMBA) on the catabolism of ATRA and on growth of rat Dunning R 3227 G prostate tumours, we assessed the effects of our novel RAMBAs on human prostate tumour (PCA) cell lines. We examined three different PCA cell lines to determine their capacity to induce P 450 -mediated oxidation of ATRA. Among the three different cell lines, enhanced catabolism was detected in LNCaP, whereas it was not found in PC- 3 and DU- 145. This catabolism was strongly inhibited by our RAMBAs, the most potent being VN/ 14 - 1, VN/ 50 - 1, VN/ 66 - 1, and VN/ 69 - 1 with IC 50 values of 6. 5, 90. 0, 62. 5, and 90. 0 [*]nM, respectively. The RAMBAs inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells with IC 50 values in the μM-range. In LNCaP cell proliferation assays, VN/ 14 - 1, VN/ 50 - 1, VN/ 66 - 1, and VN/ 69 - 1 also enhanced by 47 -, 60 -, 70 -, and 65 -fold, respectively, the ATRA-mediated antiproliferative activity. We then examined the molecular mechanism underlying the growth inhibitory properties of ATRA alone and in combination with RAMBAs. The mechanism appeared to involve the induction of differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis (TUNEL), involving increase in Bad expression and decrease in Bcl- 2 expression. Treatment of LNCaP tumours growing in SCID mice with VN/ 66 - 1 and VN/ 69 - 1 resulted in modest but statistically significant tumour growth inhibition of 44 and 47 %, respectively, while treatment with VN/ 14 - 1 was unexpectedly ineffective. These results suggest {{that some of our}} novel RAMBAs may be useful agents for the treatment of prostate cancer...|$|E
40|$|Ketoconazole (keto) or <b>liarozole</b> (liaro), inhibitors of the {{cytochrome}} P 450 {{enzymes that}} mediate vitamin D and A hydroxylations, could potentiate the antiproliferative effects of 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3] and its analogs. Proliferation of MCF- 7 and T 47 -D human breast cancer cells, MG- 63 human osteosarcoma cells and HL- 60 human promyeloid leukemia cells was concentration dependently inhibited by 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. The vitamin D analogs KH 1060 [20 -epi- 22 -oxa- 24, 26, 27 -trihomo- 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3], RO 23 - 6010 [16 -ene- 23 -yne- 26 -trifluoro- 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 2 D 3], ZXY 835 [20 -epi- 23 -yne- 25, 26 -epoxy- 1 alpha(OH) D 3], and CD 99 [11 alpha-methyl- 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3] were 150 -, 58 -, 16 - and 7 -fold more potent than 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 in inhibiting {{the proliferation of}} MCF- 7 cells, respectively. A similar rank order of potency was observed in other cell lines. The antiproliferative effects of the vitamin D hormone and analogs was enhanced in MCF- 7 cells when coincubated with 1 microM keto (7 -, 10 -, 5 -, 25 - and 1. 3 -fold more potent than {{in the absence of}} keto), respectively. The antiproliferative effect was less enhanced when 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 or its analogs KH 1060, ZXY 835 and RO 23 - 6010 were combined with liaro (3 -, 7 -, 2 - and 3 -fold, respectively). Keto and liaro did not markedly potentiate the activity of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 or its analogs in MG- 63 or HL- 60 cells. These results suggest that differences in cellular metabolism can at least partially explain the different potency of vitamin D analogs. Moreover, the metabolism of vitamin D analogs is cell-type specific. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|All-frans-retinoic acid ATRA {{has shown}} {{spectacular}} {{success in the}} treatment of cancer and leukaemia, however ATRA is rapidly metabolised by the P 450 enzyme CYP 26. In order to enhance endogenous levels of ATRA and/or to extend the half life of externally administered ATRA, a CYP 26 inhibitor is required. Two series of CYP 26 inhibitors were synthesised a series of 4 -alkyl/aryl-substituted 1 -joeiizofuran- 2 -yl-phenylmethyl- 1 -triazoles and a series of benzoxazol- 2 -yl-phenylinn lazol The triazole derivatives were prepared using methodology previously described by our group. The aminobenzoxazole derivatives were envisaged from a docking experiment using a CYP 26 A 1 homology model based on CYP 3 A 4 template docking experiments were performed with MOE. The molecular docking of the amino-benzooxazole imidazole derivatives indicated multiple hydrogen bonding in addition to coordination between the imidazole nitrogen and the P 450 haem transition metal. The triazole derivatives were evaluated for CYP 26 A 1 inhibitory activity using a MCF- 7 cell-based assay. The 4 -ethyl-l, 2, 4 -triazole and the 4 -phenyl-l, 2, 4 -triazole derivatives displayed inhibitory activity ICso 4. 5 and ICso 7 uM respectively comparable with <b>liarozole</b> ICso 7 uM. On the other hand the aminobenzooxazole imidazole derivatives were only moderate inhibitors of the CYP 26 A 1 enzyme in MCF- 7 cells and did not achieve the promise shown in docking studies. The most potent inhibitor was the unsubstituted derivative IC 5 o 0. 9 uM. Studies of the interaction of some of these inhibitors with hemin and TPP were also performed using different spectroscopic techniques mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, H NMR and UV/VIS spectroscopy and the binding constant was determined from the UV/VIS data for the unsubstituted compound of the aminobenzoxazole derivative with both hemin Km 1 - 69 0. 31. 105 M 1 and TPP Kt 2 1. 08 0. 18. 107 M 2.

40|$|Prostate {{and breast}} cancer are {{a leading cause of}} death all over the world. Retinoic acid and vitamin D 3 play an {{important}} role in cellular proliferation and differentiation and as such have potential therapeutic value as differentiating agents in the treatment of cancer and hyperkeratinising diseases. The focus on the development of differentiation agents for the treatment of solid tumours, e. g. prostate {{and breast cancer}}, was stimulated by the ability of ATRA to inhibit cellular growth and restore normal differentiation of neoplastic cells, ATRA was also shown to be successful in the treatment of acute promelocytic leukemia. The use of differentiating agents to suppress prostate and breast cancer cell proliferation is now one of the new therapeutic strategies. However, the use of ATRA and vitamin D 3 as differentiating agents is limited by their rapid metabolism through the self induction of the cytochrome P 450 enzymes that are involved in their catabolism. The P 450 enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ATRA and la, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3 (calcitriol) are cytochrome P 450 26 (CYP 26 A 1) and cytochrome P 450 24 (CYP 24 A 1) respectively. Therefore the use of potent and selective inhibitors of CYP 26 A 1 or CYP 24 A 1 with ATRA or la, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3 respectively may be a new strategy for the treatment of prostate and breast cancer. To date, the crystal structures of human CYP 26 A 1 or CYP 24 A 1 have not been resolved and there is no single theoretical model published. Homology models of cytochrome P 450 RA 1 (CYP 26 A 1) and cytochrome P 450 24 (CYP 24 A 1) were constructed using three human P 450 structures, CYP 2 C 8, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4 as templates for the model building. Using MOE software the lowest energy CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 24 A 1 models were then assessed and showed good stereochemical quality and side chain environment comparable with the templates. Further active site optimisation of the CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 24 A 1 models built using the CYP 3 A 4 template was performed by molecular dynamics using Gromax software to generate final CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 24 A 1 models. The docking studies carried out on the final models showed that the models accommodated the natural substrates ATRA and vitamin D 3 as well as the potent inhibitors Rl 15866 and () -VID- 400 for CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 24 A 1 respectively. To design inhibitors as potent as Rl 15866 and VID- 400, for CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 24 A 1 respectively, the virtual screening of a designed library of compounds based on the structure of potent inhibitors, natural substrate and intuition was performed. The results revealed good interaction with the active site of several compounds and therefore potentially good CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 24 A 1 inhibition activity. Two series were synthesised for CYP 26 A 1 inhibition, including a substituted 4 -(l, 2, 4) triazol- and imidazol-l-ylmethylphenylaryl and heteroarylamine and aryl and heteroaryl substituted 3 -(4 -aminophenyl) - 3 -imidazol-l-yl- 2, 2 -dimethylpropionic acid methyl ester derivatives. The synthesised compounds were biologically evaluated using a MCF- 7 breast cancer cell assay, from which some have shown potent inhibitory activity, with IC 5 O in the low nanomolar range (20 nM), and others less active but still much more active then the well known inhibitor <b>liarozole.</b> A series of 4 or 5 substituted l-(3 -benzenesulfonyl propyl) -l, 1 -indoles was synthesised and biologically tested for CYP 24 A 1 inhibition. The series showed moderate inhibition activity with a good structure-activity relationship, for further evaluation...|$|E
