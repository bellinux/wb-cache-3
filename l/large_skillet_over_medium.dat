50|$|Drinking Ethiopian coffee, {{especially}} {{in the place of}} coffee's origin, is a cultural experience. The process for making the coffee, known as Bunna, takes over an hour. First the beans are washed in water, and then placed into a <b>skillet</b> <b>over</b> a fire. Once the beans have burst from their skins, they are ground with a metal stick. The grounds are placed into a jebena, an Ethiopian pot, with hot water and served in a cini cup.|$|R

50|$|The Hamburger Wagon {{is a small}} wagon, {{large enough}} for only two people to work side by side; one cooks while the other one prepares the buns and handles the money. The wagon, still at {{approximately}} the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly. The establishment has changed ownership hands several times throughout the years, most recently bought by Jack Sperry in September 2008 from Michelle Lyons. Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil in a <b>large</b> <b>skillet</b> and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper. The burgers have a crispness on the outside due to being deep fried.|$|R

5000|$|A hoard of {{gold and}} silver objects was found in 1812, {{supposedly}} near Backworth and, according to Haverfield, was sold to a Newcastle silversmith. He resold [...] "all, or nearly all" [...] to Mr. J. Brumell, a Newcastle collector, from whom most of the objects passed in 1850 to the British Museum. The hoard consisted of: a silver skillet in which were a pair of silver-gilt trumpet brooches, one silver and five gold rings, one gold bracelet, two gold chains with wheel-shaped pendant, and a crescent attached, three silver spoons, another silver skillet, 280+ Roman denarii, and two first brass coins of Antoninus Pius. A white bronze mirror {{had served as a}} cover. The date of deposition is thought likely to be A.D. 140. The <b>larger</b> <b>skillet</b> and one of the gold rings each have an inscription, a dedication to the mother-goddesses. This list does not wholly accord with Haverfield's: in particular he suggests that an oval silver dish 18 inches long and 2 pieces of a silver bridle bit never reached the British Museum.|$|R

30|$|The patch size {{found in}} our study {{overlaps}} with that found by one other study that examined spatial autocorrelation in fire temperature during low-intensity surface fires. Franklin et al. (1997) found that fire temperatures in upland oak forests were spatially autocorrelated <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> scales (13 to 46 m). These comparisons {{lend support to the}} idea that low-intensity surface fires in longleaf pine are patchy <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> scales, as opposed to the finer scales that may be typical of high intensity fires. Therefore, while the fires examined in our study did not have a narrowly definable patch size, it may be possible that the patch size of fires can be predicted based on fuel type and stand characteristics over more broadly defined scales (< 10 m, 10 – 200 m, > 200 m). More comparative studies that report spatial autocorrelation are needed to examine this.|$|R
