40|$|An age-hardening type Auminium {{casting alloy}} (JIS AC 8 A Lo-Ex) was aged after the {{solution}} treatment, {{and given a}} peening or a <b>liquid</b> <b>honing</b> treatnient. Then {{the effect of a}} peening on the fatigue strengths of such treated specirmns was examined. The results obtained were as follows:　(1) In order to improve the fatigue strength of this material, the peening and the <b>liquid</b> <b>honing</b> after T_ 7 treatment, i. e. solution treatment followed by ageing for 8 hours at 225 +- 5 ℃ are very effective. The fatigue strength of the shot-peened specimem was increased by about 30 % as compared with the not-treated one, and that of the liquid-honed specimen, by about 25 %. 　(2) The increase of the fatigue strength may be greatly affected by the residual stress in the surface layer of the specimen. 　(3) From the decrease of the hardness near the fatigue fracture, it is found that the residual compressive stress caused by the peening is reduced as the specimen fatigues, and that the age-hardening is also reduced as if the over-ageing occurs. 　(4) An increase in fatigue life can be caused by the age-hardening and the residual compressive stress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recently, wet {{blasting}} is generally used such as <b>liquid</b> <b>honing</b> and water jet machining in surface before plating of stainless steel. The outstanding feature of {{wet blasting}} {{is to prevent}} generation of static electric charge, to use micro abrasive grain, and to have cushioning for workpiece. On the other hand, the disadvantage of wet blasting is to generate corrosion of equipment and liquid waste under processing. Moreover, the using abrasive grain is available on a limited basis. In particular, improvement disposal of liquid waste under processing is crucial in the near future. This paper makes proposal for improvement of surface texture by utilizing dry blasting, and it conducts improvement of surface texture about martensite stainless steel (SUS 420 J 2 In JIS), which is used in material for scale applications. As a result, it is cleared that relationship between surface texture and blasting conditions. Furthermore, based on these results, it reports relationship between surface texture and wettability...|$|E
