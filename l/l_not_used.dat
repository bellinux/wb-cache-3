Light-grown seedlings of normal maize and the maize mutant orange pericarp were shown to contain the necessary enzymes to convert [14 C]indole to IAA. The reaction was not inhibited by unlabeled Trp and neither [14 C]Trp nor [14 C]serine substituted for [14 C]indole in this in vitro system. The reaction had a pH optimum greater than 8. 0, required a reducing environment, and had an oxidation potential near that of ascorbate.

40|$|Reoviruses are {{a leading}} model for {{understanding}} cellular mechanisms of virus-induced apoptosis. Reoviruses induce apoptosis in multiple cell lines in vitro, and apoptosis {{plays a key}} role in virus-induced tissue injury of the heart and brain in vivo. The activation of transcription factors NF-κB and c-Jun are key events in reovirus-induced apoptosis, indicating that new gene expression is critical to this process. We used high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze cellular transcriptional alterations in HEK 293 cells after infection with reovirus strain T 3 A (i. e., apoptosis inducing) compared to infection with reovirus strain T 1 L (i. e., minimally apoptosis inducing) and uninfected cells. These strains also differ dramatically in their potential to induce apoptotic injury in hearts of infected mice in vivo—T 3 A is myocarditic, whereas T 1 <b>L</b> is <b>not.</b> <b>Using</b> high-throughput microarray analysis of over 12, 000 genes, we identified differential expression of a defined subset of genes involved in apoptosis and DNA repair after reovirus infection. This provides the first comparative analysis of altered gene expression after infection with viruses of differing apoptotic phenotypes and provides insight into pathogenic mechanisms of virus-induced disease...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the reproductive dynamics and gonadal morphology of piaparas (Leporinus obtusidens) captured downstream from the Funil Hydroelectric Power Station. The 107 piaparas evaluated were captured monthly from Sep 2006 to Aug 2007. The data were stratified among the seasons to evaluate gonad maturation and the reproductive period {{was determined by}} assessing the gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, abdominal fat index (AFI), weight:length ratio, condition factor and sexual proportion. The reproductive period lasted from winter to summer (Jul-Mar) in females and from spring to autumn (Sept-Jun) in males.

The highest HIS values for males and females were obtained in spring and summer (Sept-Mar). The females observed did not spawn and showed follicular atresia.

Our analysis has shown that this verb was very frequent in the language of some writers (e. g. F. Dostoyevsky), while <b>L.</b> Tolstoy did <b>not</b> <b>use</b> it at all.

The method used to detect apatite was particle-size fractionation and particle-density fractionation followed by element mapping using an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microprobe equipped with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In order to increase the solubility of the Mt. Pinatubo apatite, low pH, such as 4. 5, or less and/or chelating reagents, such as oxalate or citrate, are needed.
