The State Examination Commission appreciated the thesis. The results of his research paper became the basis for an article “The Fundamentals of the <b>Linear</b> <b>Selection</b> Theory”, which was used for his thesis “The Linear Methods of Selection and the Problem of the Ether’s Bandwidth”. The LEIS Scientific Council had no right to take the defense of doctoral dissertations, but they conferred a PhD degree on D. V. Ageev, giving him the right to defend the dissertation as a doctoral. However, {{he did not want to}} use this work twice. He wrote and defended his doctoral dissertation “A New Method of Multi-Channel Wiring” in just one year. Ageev proposed and investigated a new principle of multicast signals and their processing, which allowed reducing the influence of impulse noise.|$|E

40|$|The pronotum is {{the most}} {{distinctive}} and representative structure in treehoppers. Although several functions have been proposed for this structure, its involvement in fitness has not been formally evaluated. Given {{the high degree of}} maternal investment exhibited by the subsocial membracid Alchisme grossa (Hoplophorionini), the pronotum has been suggested as a shield for offspring protection. We performed selection gradient analyses on A. grossa in order to evaluate how natural selection is acting upon two traits associated with this structure considering three different fitness proxies: (1) number of eggs, (2) the ratio between the number of first-stage nymphs and the number of eggs (early survival), and (3) the number of third-stage nymphs (late survival). Since A. grossa feeds, oviposits and mates on two alternative host-plants (Brugmansia suaveolens and Solanum ursinum, both Solanaceae), we also evaluated and compared selection gradients between these host-plants. We found positive <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> acting upon pronotum length considering the number of eggs and the late survival fitness proxies and positive <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> acting on the distance between the suprahumeral horns considering the early survival proxy on females ovipositing on both host-plants. These results highlight the importance of the pronotum in treehoppers females' fitness and suggest that maternal care appears to have a greater importance in the way that natural selection is operating than the host-plant where oviposition occurs.

40|$|Demographic {{parameters}} including operational {{sex ratio}} (OSR) and population density {{may influence the}} opportunity for, and strength of sexual selection. Traditionally, male-biased OSRs and high population densities have been thought to increase the opportunity for sexual selection on male sexual traits due to increased male competition for mates. Recent experimental evidence, however, suggests that male-biased OSRs might reduce the opportunity for sexual selection due to increased sexual coercion experienced by females. How OSR, density, and any resultant changes in the opportunity for sexual selection actually affect selection on male sexual traits is unclear. In this study, we independently manipulated OSR and density in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) without altering the number of males present. We recorded male and female behavior and used DNA microsatellite data to assign paternity to offspring and estimate male reproductive success. We then used <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> analyses {{to examine the effects}} of OSR and density on directional sexual selection on male behavioral and morphological traits. We found that females were pursued more by males in male-biased treatments, despite no change in individual male behavior. There were no differences in sexual behavior experienced by females or performed by males in relation to density. Neither OSR nor density significantly altered the opportunity for sexual selection. Also, Although there was significant multivariate <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> operating on males, neither OSR nor density altered the pattern of sexual selection on male traits. Our results suggest that differences in either OSR or density (independent of the number of males present) are unlikely to alter directional evolutionary change in male sexual traits...|$|E

A simulation manipulated the linearity or nonlinear inflection point of predictor-criterion relationships, and several selection approaches were implemented that varied in level of congruence with these relationships. Results indicate that incongruence can produce notable decrements in mean performance under some conditions.

40|$|Strategies {{for optimal}} {{metamorphosis}} are key adaptations in organisms with complex life cycles, and {{the components of}} the larval growth environment causing variation in this trait are well studied empirically and theoretically. However, when relating these findings to a broader evolutionary or ecological context, usually the following assumptions are made: (1) size at metamorphosis positively relates to future fitness, and (2) the larval growth environment affects fitness mainly through its effect on timing of and size at metamorphosis. These assumptions remain poorly tested, because data on postmetamorphic fitness components are still rare. We created variation in timing of and size at metamorphosis by manipulating larval competition, nonlethal presence of predators, pond drying, and onset of larval development, and measured the consequences for subsequent terrestrial survival and growth in 1564 individually marked water frogs (Rana lessonae and R. esculenta), raised in enclosures in their natural environment. Individuals metamorphosing at a large size had an increased chance of survival during the following terrestrial stage (mean <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> gradient: 0. 09), grew faster and were larger at maturity than individuals metamorphosing at smaller sizes. Late metamorphosing individuals had a lower survival rate (mean <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> gradient: - 0. 03) and grew more slowly than early metamorphosing ones. We found these patterns to be consistent over the three years of the study and the two species, and the results did not depend {{on the nature of the}} larval growth manipulation. Furthermore, individuals did not compensate for a small size at metamorphosis by enhancing their postmetamorphic growth. Thus, we found simple relationships between larval growth and postmetamorphic fitness components, and support for this frequently made assumption. Our results suggest postmetamorphic selection for fast larval growth and provide a quantitative estimate for the water frog example...|$|E

Our approach is based on performing <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> among exponentially many appropriately defined positive definite kernels that characterize non-linear interactions between the original variables. To select efficiently from these many kernels, we use the natural hierarchical structure of the problem to extend the multiple kernel learning framework to kernels that can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a graph-adapted sparsity-inducing norm, in polynomial time {{in the number of}} selected kernels. Moreover, we study the consistency of variable selection in high-dimensional settings, showing that under certain assumptions, our regularization framework allows a number of irrelevant variables which is exponential in the number of observations.

40|$|We analyse {{the bidding}} for unit-price contracts, {{a very common}} {{procurement}} auction. With a unit price contract, not the provision of the good but the employment of several kinds of inputs is priced. The seller charges a unit price for the employed quantity of each input. To select one seller, a <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> rule is used to rank submitted lists of unit prices. In this paper, we model heterogeneous technologies of craftsmen: firms differ in their requirement of input-quantities. An equilibrium of this model is found. The composition of submitted lists does not mirror the cost structure and the selection probability is not monotone in the type. Sometimes the ''lamer'' of two craftsmen is selected, enhancing all but the very lame types to bid very aggressively. Caused by this, unit-price bidding can be cheaper (require a lower expected payment) than standard auctions like the first price auction. ...|$|E
40|$|We present three {{variations}} of the following new sorting theme: Throughout the sort, the array is maintained in piles of sorted elements. At each step, the piles are split into two parts, so that {{the elements of the}} left piles are smaller than (or equal to) the elements of the right piles. Then, the two parts are each sorted, recursively. The theme, then, is a combination of Hoare's Quicksort idea, and the Pick algorithm, by Blum, et al., for <b>linear</b> <b>selection.</b> The variations arise from the possible choices of splitting method. Two variations attempt to minimize the average number of comparisons. The better of these has an average performance of 1 : 075 n lg n comparisons.

40|$|Phenotypic plasticity, {{the ability}} of a trait to change as a {{function}} of the environment, is central to many ideas in evolutionary biology. A special case of phenotypic plasticity observed in many organisms is mediated by their natural predators. Here, we used a predator-prey system of dragonfly larvae and tadpoles to determine if predator-mediated phenotypic plasticity provides a novel way of surviving in the presence of predators (an innovation) or if it represents a simple extension of the way noninduced tadpoles survive predation. Tadpoles of Limnodynastes peronii were raised in the presence and absence of predation, which then entered a survival experiment. Induced morphological traits, primarily tail height and tail muscle height, were found to be under selection, indicating that predator-mediated phenotypic plasticity may be adaptive. Although predator-induced animals survived better, the multivariate <b>linear</b> <b>selection</b> gradients were similar between the two tadpole groups, suggesting that predator-mediated phenotypic plasticity is an extension of existing survival strategies. In addition, nonlinear selection gradients indicated a cost of predator-induced plasticity that may limit {{the ability of}} phenotypic plasticity to enhance survival in the presence of predators...|$|E
