A <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time.

As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> by selling the newspaper to J. Harmon Caskey and Henry Roden. That same year, the campaign to elect Alaska's first delegate to Congress was under way, and one of the candidates, Jack Corson, purchased one-third of the newspaper.

King's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council. An area of the wood to the south {{was not included in the}} <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> and three residential roads were later constructed on it.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Marvel Studios {{signed a}} {{long-term}} <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films—Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers—at Raleigh's Manhattan Beach, California facility. Production Weekly reported that filming on Marvel's Thor {{was scheduled to}} begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to Santa Fe, New Mexico from March until late-April. Principal photography began on January 11, 2010. A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as Agent Coulson. In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with Del Mar, California to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for Thor involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film. On March 15, 2010, production of Thor moved to Galisteo, New Mexico where Cerro Pelon Ranch, an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.|$|E
5|$|In early 2011, the Rage {{along with}} the Fresno Monsters, Wenatchee Wild, and Alaska Avalanche, all {{declared}} dormancy for various reasons, not committing to playing the next season; the Rage were pursuing entry into the AJHL. As the season was ending, the other teams in the division came out of dormancy; the Wenatchee team had their BCHL move denied and the Fresno Monsters were able to secure a <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> for their arena. The bid by the DC Rage Society to move the team into the AJHL, by purchasing {{the rights to the}} St. Albert Steel, failed as the Steel were moved to Whitecourt. While the team was achieving the expected levels of corporate sponsorship and had an average attendance of 1,010 people (13th best in the league of 28 teams), the Rage's costs (especially the travel costs) were higher than expected. In the first week of April 2012, a final appeal by the DC Rage Society to the City of Dawson Creek to cover certain fees was denied and the society announced the team was ending operations.|$|E

50|$|Follow on {{the heels}} of the TIF Sunshine Ordinance is the City Asset Lease Disclosure Ordinance, {{introduced}} by Alderman Flores on May 13, 2009. The ordinance would publish and track documents pertaining to City asset <b>lease</b> <b>agreements</b> worth more than $10 million, such as the leasing of the Chicago Skyway, the Chicago Downtown Public Parking System and the Chicago Parking Meter System.

Currently, information about City <b>lease</b> <b>agreements</b> is available online. However, the information is scattered across several websites in lengthy budget documents.

40|$|Background: Fraud {{attempts}} create large {{losses for}} financing subjects in modern economies. At the same time, <b>leasing</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have become more}} and more popular as a means of financing objects such as machinery and vehicles, but are more vulnerable to fraud attempts. Objectives: The goal of the paper is to estimate the usability of the data mining approach in discovering fraud in <b>leasing</b> <b>agreements.</b> Methods/Approach: Real-world data from one Croatian leasing firm was used for creating tow models for fraud detection in leasing. The decision tree method was used for creating a classification model, and the CHAID algorithm was deployed. Results: The decision tree model has indicated that the object of the <b>leasing</b> <b>agreement</b> had the strongest impact on the probability of fraud. Conclusions: In order to enhance the probability of the developed model, it would be necessary to develop software that would enable automated, quick and transparent retrieval of data from the system, processing according to the rules and displaying the results in multiple categories...|$|R
5|$|Opposition members criticized Ravalomanana in {{the later}} period of his presidency, accusing him of {{increasing}} authoritarianism and the mixing {{of public and private}} interests. In addition, the benefits of the country's growth were not evenly spread, leading to increased wealth inequality, inflation and a decline in purchasing power for the lower and middle classes. In 2008 a controversial land <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> with Korean agricultural firm Daewoo, the purchase of a costly presidential jet and the closure of media channels owned by opposition leader and mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, strengthened popular disapproval of his policies. Rajoelina rallied popular support for the opposition, leading to a popular uprising that began in January 2009 and ended two months later with Ravalomanana's resignation under pressure and Rajoelina taking control with military support in a power transfer viewed by the international community as a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|Late in the season, reports {{began to}} surface that the Canucks would be {{purchasing}} their own AHL team and relocating it. Vancouver {{wanted to have}} more control over personnel decisions for their farm team and bought the Peoria Rivermen. The Canucks had originally hoped to move the franchise to nearby Abbotsford, British Columbia, which was home of the Calgary Flames AHL affiliate the Abbotsford Heat. Calgary indicated {{they would be willing}} to move their franchise, but a deal between the Canucks and the city of Abbotsford was unable to be reached. With the Abbotsford deal not working out, the Canucks set out to find a new home for their affiliate. They considered moving the team to Vancouver and sharing Rogers Arena, but the city was within the 50-mile territorial radius provided by the AHL. They next considered moving the team to Seattle, Washington, but were not allowed by the NHL. Seattle was a candidate to land the Phoenix Coyotes if a <b>lease</b> <b>agreement</b> could not be reached with the city of Glendale. Eventually, the Canucks decided to relocate their franchise to Utica, New York, creating the Comets.|$|E
