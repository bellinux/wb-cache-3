40|$|Capillarity in wet {{granular}} materials induces {{cohesion and}} increases the material strength due to the attractive forces acting on capillary bridges. In the funicular state, water bridges may be not only formed between two grains but also binding three or more particles, which breaks the axial symmetry of the liquid bridge. This work presents a fundamental study on capillary forces and rupture behaviours of funicular water bridges between three spherical bodies at equilibrium (or static) configurations. Funicular water clusters are numerically solved by an energy minimization approach. Experimental comparisons are made by measuring capillary forces and these confirm {{the validity of the}} numerical solutions. Evolutions of capillary forces and rupture distances are investigated systematically by moving two spheres away from the centre. The fixed water volume condition and the constant mean curvature condition are studied respectively. Comparisons are made between the un-coalesced pendular <b>liquid</b> <b>rings</b> and the coalesced funicular bridge. For a same fixed total water volume, the capillary force is weakened by water bridge coalescence to a funicular bridge when the spheres are packed together, but the situation may vary for different contact angles and inter-particle distances. For the constant mean curvature condition, water bridge coalescence does not alter capillary force significantly when particles are packed closely, but the discrepancy is larger by increasing the gap. Funicular water bridge rupture criteria are also proposed based on the studied configurations. It is observed that in general the transmission from pendular to funicular state extends the rupture distance when it has a relatively high water volume or low air-water pressure difference...|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} long-wave theory (also {{known as}} lubrication approximation) applied to fluid spreading or retracting on a solid substrate is derived under {{a set of}} assumptions, typically including small slopes and negligible inertial effects. In this work, we compare the results obtained by using the long-wave model and by simulating directly the full two-phase Navier-Stokes equations employing a volume-of-fluid method. In order to isolate {{the influence of the}} small slope assumption inherent in the long-wave theory, we present a quantitative comparison between the two methods in the regime where inertial effects and the influence of gas phase are negligible. The flow geometries that we consider include wetting and dewetting drops within a broad range of equilibrium contact angles in planar and axisymmetric geometries, as well as <b>liquid</b> <b>rings.</b> For perfectly wetting spreading drops we find good quantitative agreement between the models, with both of them following rather closely Tanner's law. For partially wetting drops, while in general we find good agreement between the two models for small equilibrium contact angles, we also uncover differences which are particularly evident in the initial stages of evolution, for retracting drops, and when additional azimuthal curvature is considered. The contracting rings are also found to evolve differently for the two models, with the main difference being that the evolution occurs on the faster time scale when the long-wave model is considered, although the ring shapes are very similar between the two models.
