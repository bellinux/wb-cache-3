The 1st Special Service Brigade was in the north on a line from Hameau Oger to Le Plain. In between the commandos and the airlanding brigade was the 3rd Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{occurred}} during Holy Week, 1799, amid rain and dense fog. Initially, the French {{were able to}} take, and hold, Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh. As the engagement began, Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses. By evening, the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights. On the next morning, as Jourdan considered a counter-attack, the weather broke, and he could <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Austrian battle array. The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless, {{and that he could}} not hope to maintain his position in the heights. As he withdrew, a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force.|$|E

25|$|Zechariah and Micah <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{fulfillment}} of their prophecies {{contained in the}} banderoles floating behind them. The Erythraean Sibyl is shown observing, while the Cumaean Sibyl, wearing a green dress with thick fur sleeves, gazes down at Mary, her hand held in empathy over her own womb. Micah's lunettes are an early instance of an illusionistic motif, wherein {{the sense of the}} boundary between the painting, frame and viewer's space becomes blurred.

25|$|The Lawful Good afterlife plane {{has been}} {{portrayed in the}} comic as a {{mountain}} with seven plateaus loosely based on Mount Celestia, and {{the side of the}} mountain the deceased enter from in depends on their religion. The first plateau is dedicated to satisfying physical desires, such as for sex and food, while higher levels offer spiritual satisfaction. The seventh level, at the mountain's peak, holds “true perfect enlightenment.” Below the mountain is a demi plane of blue skies and clouds, where dead souls, archons, and gods from all of the Good-aligned planes can <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mortal world.|$|E
25|$|For competition, a blue judogi is worn {{by one of}} the two {{competitors}} {{for ease}} of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of blue {{because of the fact that}} judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi for the impure blue is an offense.|$|E

25|$|He {{was mostly}} based in Genoa, {{although}} he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed {{for some time}} in Palermo in Sicily. For the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, {{he went back to}} Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of Brussels he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695. He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630 he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large altarpieces, and began his printmaking (see below).|$|E
25|$|On 24 September, Menshikov {{began to}} move his army out of Sevastopol towards Bakchi Serai and Simferopol, leaving Admirals Kornilov and Nakhimov to organise the 18,000-strong {{garrison}} (mainly sailors and marines) and prepare the port's defences. By venturing into {{the interior of the}} Crimea, Menshikov would not only keep open his communications with Russia, but would also be in touch with reinforcements from Odessa or Kertch; moreover, he would be free to operate in the field and threaten the Allied flank. Whilst Menshikov moved east, the Anglo-French-Turkish army, with the British in the vanguard, continued its march towards the southern coast of the peninsula. The heat was oppressive, the water sparse, and cholera rife, taking a heavy toll on the men including Saint-Arnaud who was already ill with cancer. The march had been a real trial and was not without incident. At one point, on 25 September near MacKenzie's Farm, Raglan and his staff in front of the British column stumbled across the rear of the retreating Russians; {{with the rest of his}} army strung out behind in hopeless disorder, Menshikov missed a chance to inflict a major reverse on the British. By the 26th, however, Raglan had reached the village of Kadikoi, and was able to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> narrow inlet of Balaclava. That same day Saint-Arnaud, now critically ill, surrendered his command to General Canrobert.|$|E

500|$|Between 10 and 16 January, the Okabe Detachment [...] {{moved down}} the coast in barges to Salamaua, where it {{assembled}} and completed its preparations for the attack on Wau. On 16 January, the Japanese encountered a platoon of the 2/7th Independent Company under Captain Geoffrey Bowen. A brief action followed in which Bowen was killed, and the Australians retreated back to Skindewai. However, instead of pursuing them, Okabe chose to advance on Wau down an old and seldom used track running through difficult country parallel to the Black Cat Track, and the two sides lost contact. Okabe thereby disguised the strength and objective of his force, and took the Australians by surprise. It was necessary to cross Komiatum Hill, advance to Mubo, and then take the track westward. This route was chosen {{so as to avoid}} observation from Allied aircraft in the daytime as they cut their way into the jungle. The mountain range east of Wau was about [...] high and not particularly difficult to cross, but in parts there were no tracks. These had to be prepared without being spotted by the Allied aircraft. As the troops had to carry their food, ammunition and equipment on their backs, the advance was difficult and took longer than anticipated. Eventually they reached a peak from which they were able to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wau-Bulolo Valley. By this time, food was running short. The commander of the Okabe Detachment, pointing at the Wau village, gave the order to attack: [...] "We are short of food—let us quickly capture Wau and get food from the enemy!" [...] However, the movement through such dense jungle caused his units to lose touch with each other. The resulting attack was delivered piecemeal, without sufficient preparation.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of its completion, the Post Office Building {{contained}} the largest uninterrupted enclosed space in the city. Its clock tower reached [...] into the air. It was also the city's first building to have a steel frame structure, and the first to be built with electrical wiring incorporated into its design. The structure featured elevators with cages of highly intricate wrought iron, a glass covered atrium and mezzanine level, and floors, moldings, railings, and wainscoting made of marble. The atrium was [...] high, and 10 floors of balconies looked out onto the space (which provided interior light in an era when indoor lighting was not common). It boasted more than 39,000 interior electric lights, and its own electrical generator. Girders and catwalks spanned the atrium at the third floor level to allow post office supervisors to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> workers. The fifth floor housed executive offices in the corners. Each office had a turret, ornately carved wooden moldings, and red oak paneling. But there were problems with the structure. The Washington Star newspaper reported that the skylights and windows leaked air and water, the marble floors were poorly laid, and much of the construction was shoddy. The ninth floor was to have served as a file room, but a post-construction inspection showed it could not accommodate the weight. Technological advances in electricity and electrical wiring, mechanical engineering, movement of air, heating, and more made the building out of date as soon as it opened.|$|E
