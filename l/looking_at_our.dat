500|$|After placing {{last in the}} Eurovision Song Contest 2007, RTÉ {{announced}} that they would review {{their position in the}} contest with Tara O’Brien of RTÉ saying that they would [...] "definitely be having a sit-down and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> geographical position and going through the whole process." [...] RTÉ reached a consensus and agreed to change the selection process and revert to the [...] "National Song Contest" [...] format that was used in Ireland before 2001, resulting in seven Irish winners.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the film}} would stand alone; {{producer}} Kevin Feige said [...] "about half" [...] the movie {{would be set}} during World War II before moving into the modern day. Producer Avi Arad said, [...] "The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man 'out of time', coming back today, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> world {{through the eyes of}} someone who thought the perfect world was small-town United States. Sixty years go by, and who are we today? Are we better?" [...] He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had [...] "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director". In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date. Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead. In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script. He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because [...] "my dad told me I could one day be Captain America". Joe Johnston met with Marvel to discuss directing the film.|$|E

2500|$|About the Afghan war, Majid is {{reported}} to have said, [...] "Pakistan has become a [...] "punching bag" [...] in the American media, specifically the CNN." [...] In a secret conversation with American ambassador Anne W. Patterson General Majid added, [...] "It {{got to the point where}} we are <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> own contingencies." [...] Ambassador Patterson later replied that his statement was astonishing. [...] In 2007, Majid maintained to the country's media representatives, about the security of country's strategic nuclear arsenals that the nuclear and strategic assets are well protected with robust safeguards and very elaborate security system. Any irresponsible [...] "act by any one against it will be responded very strongly at all levels of command", Majid quoted.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, on {{the album}} Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commented on Big in a skit called [...] "Shark Niggas (Biters)." [...] Alleging that he copied the cover from Nas' {{landmark}} release Illmatic, as well as styles from other rap artists. This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> competition. And when Ghost is saying whatever he was saying, we kinda knew who he was talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef. It's just sometimes, when you get in the booth and you start saying what you wanna say, it just happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Valve's former {{business}} development chief Jason Holtman {{stated that the}} company sees themselves as an [...] "oddity" [...] {{in an industry that}} looks towards punctual delivery of products; instead, Valve [...] " [...] as hard as we can to make the best thing possible in the right time frame and get people content they want to consume. And if that takes longer, that's fine". For that, Valve takes the concept of [...] "Valve Time" [...] as a compliment, and that [...] "having customers consistently <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> property or something you've done and saying, can you give me more" [...] is evidence that they are making the right decisions with their game releases, according to Holtman. The company does try to avoid unintentional delays of their projects, and believes that the earlier occurrences of [...] "Valve Time" [...] delays, primarily from Half-Life development, has helped them improve their release schedules.|$|E

60|$|Those poor {{girls were}} in an agony. Everybody in the church was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> pew and smiling. We all felt that we were terribly disgraced; but we could do nothing.

60|$|At Worcester we put {{ourselves}} {{into the hands}} of a cabman, who drove us to the Crown Hotel,--one of the old-fashioned hotels, with an entrance through an arched passage, by which vehicles were admitted into the inn-yard, which has also an exit, I believe, into another street. On one side of the arch was the coffee-room, where, after <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> sleeping-chambers {{on the other side of}} the arch, we had some cold pigeon-pie for supper, and for myself a pint of ale.|$|E

60|$|Passing this platform, {{the captain}} and Ruby {{threaded}} {{their way through a}} mass of workyard debris until they came to the building from which the sounds of the anvil proceeded. For a few minutes they stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> old friend Jamie Dove, who, with bared arms, was causing the sparks to fly, and the glowing metal to yield, as vigorously as of old. Presently he ceased hammering, and turning to the fire thrust the metal into it. Then he wiped his brow, and glanced towards the door.|$|E

60|$|I woke at six {{the next}} morning; and found George awake too. We both turned round, {{and tried to}} go to sleep again, but we could not.

As there was no earthly necessity for our getting up under another two hours at the very least, and our getting up at that time was an utter absurdity, it was only in keeping with the natural cussedness of things in general that we should both feel that lying down for five minutes more would be death to us.|$|E
