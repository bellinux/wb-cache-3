50|$|The {{breeding}} ponds of {{most species}} of <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> completely dry {{up during the}} dry season. The year-round ponds likely harbor frogs, fish, and other aquatic predators that eat young salamanders, so these salamanders prefer ephemeral ponds. Most species of <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> migrate up into nearby forests and do not spend any time near the breeding pond once they have metamorphosed and the pond is dry. A. m. croceum juveniles, though, often spend their first summer close to the breeding pond in a rodent burrow or rock fissure, only later migrating uphill into the forest. This may be because A. m. croceum breeding ponds retain water all summer.|$|R

The published article can be found at: [URL] Many species of ambystomatid salamanders are dependent upon highly variable temporary wetlands for larval development. High larval densities may prompt {{the expression of a}} distinct head morphology that may facilitate cannibalism. However, few studies have characterized structural cannibalism within natural populations of larval salamanders. In this study we used two species of larval <b>salamanders,</b> <b>long-toed</b> (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and ringed salamanders (A. annulatum). Head morphometrics and stable isotopic values of carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) were used to identify {{the presence or absence of}} structural cannibalism. Weather conditions were also analyzed as a potential factor associated with the expression of cannibalistic morphology. RESULTS: Populations of salamander larvae did not consistently exhibit cannibalistic morphologies throughout collection periods. Larval <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> exhibited trophic polymorphisms when relatively lower precipitation amounts were observed. Larval ringed salamanders were observed to be cannibalistic but did not exhibit polymorphisms in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Structural cannibalism may be transient in both species; however in <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> this morphology is necessary for cannibalism. Ringed salamanders can be cannibalistic without morphological adaptations; however the cannibal morph may prolong the viable time period for cannibalism. Additionally, weather conditions may alter pond hydroperiod, subsequently influencing head morphology and cannibalism...|$|R

5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate to hibernate in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along its tail. These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> will wave its tail and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to reddish brown background that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of its tail and slink away while the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called autotomy. The regeneration and regrowth of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Environmental {{contaminants}} {{and emerging}} infectious diseases are implicated as {{factors contributing to}} global amphibian declines. However, few studies have tested the interaction of these factors. We exposed six-week-old, larval <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma macrodactylum) to Ambystoma tigrinum virus (ATV; 0 or 103. 5 plaque-forming units/ml) and sublethal concentrations of atrazine (0, 1. 84, 18. 4, and 184 g/L) in a 4 2 factorial design for 30 d. We tested the effects of atrazine and virus on mass and snout-vent length (SVL) at metamorphosis and larval period {{as well as on}} rates of mortality and viral infectivity. We confirmed ATV transmission to A. macrodactylum via polymerase chain reaction, but infection rates were lower than expected, consistent with the theory predicting lower pathogen transmission to nonnative hosts. Larvae exposed to both atrazine and ATV had lower levels of mortality and ATV infectivity compared to larvae exposed to virus alone, suggesting atrazine may compromise virus efficacy. The highest atrazine level (184 g/L) accelerated metamorphosis and reduced mass and SVL at metamorphosis significantly relative to controls. Exposure to ATV also significantly reduced SVL at metamorphosis. The present study suggests moderate concentrations of atrazine may ameliorate effects of ATV on <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> whereas higher concentrations initiate meta-morphosis at a smaller size, with potential negative consequences to fitness.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Ultraviolet-B {{radiation}} (UV-B) {{has been}} suggested as a factor contributing to global amphibian population declines. While ambient UV-B levels damage the eggs and embryos of some amphibian species, few studies have addressed how UV-B affects other life history stages or sublethal responses. My dissertation focuses on (1) investigations of sublethal effects of UV-B exposure on growth and development in larval amphibians, (2) a preliminary examination of the hormonal stress response in larval amphibians exposed to UV-B and (3) investigations of defenses that amphibians may use to prevent UV-B damage. Delayed sublethal responses to UV-B were documented for red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Larvae exposed to ambient UV-B during embryonic development were smaller and less developed one month after hatching than larvae not exposed as embryos. Exposure of larval <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma macrodactylum) to UV-B in the laboratory resulted in sublethal effects on growth for larvae from mountain sites and in decreased survival for larvae from lower elevation. Mountain populations {{appear to be more}} resistant to the detrimental effects of UV-B exposure. However, although UV-B can have various sublethal effects on growth and development, I did not observe a hormonal stress response in larvae of four species. One potential mechanism of UV-B protection is skin darkening. Larval <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> Northwestern salamanders (A. gracile) and roughskin newts (Taricha granulosa) implications for larval survival by manipulating skin color on black and white backgrounds during UV-B exposure. UV-B exposure resulted in reduced growth, regardless of background coloration, but there were no survivorship differences between the groups. In summary, my results suggest that even at current levels, UV-B may have impacts on amphibian life histories. While direct mortality in response to UV-B exposure may be observed for some species, there are many sublethal responses as well. These sublethal responses could be important for the long-term survival of amphibian populations...|$|R

5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander,</b> there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise her tail and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral origins {{for this}} species stem from eastern North America, where species {{richness}} of ambystomatids are highest. The following biogeographic interpretation on {{the origins of}} A.macrodactylum into western North America is based on a descriptive account of fossils, genetics, and biogeography. The <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander's</b> closest living sister species is A.laterale, a native to northeastern North America.

It has been suggested that A.macrodactylum speciated from A.laterale after the Paleocene (~66–55.8 Ma) with the loss of the Western Interior Seaway opening an access route for a common ancestor into the Western Cordillera. Once situated in the montane regions of western North America, species had to contend with a dynamic spatial and compositional ecology responding to the changes in altitude, as mountains grew and the climate changed. For example, the Pacific Northwest became cooler in the Paleocene, paving the way for temperate forest to replace the warmer tropical forest of the Cretaceous. A scenario for the splitting of A.macrodacylum and other western temperate species from their eastern counterparts involves Rocky Mountain uplift in the late Oligocene into the Miocene. The orogeny created a climatic barrier by removing moisture from the westerly air stream and dried the midcontinental area, from southern Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R

5|$|The {{life history}} of the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> varies greatly with {{elevation}} and climate. Seasonal dates of migration {{to and from the}} breeding ponds can be correlated with bouts of sustained rainfall, ice thaw, or snow melt sufficient to replenish the (often) seasonal ponds. Eggs may be spawned at low elevations as early as mid-February in southern Oregon, from early January to July in northwestern Washington, from January to March in southeastern Washington, and from mid-April to early May in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta. The timing of breeding can be highly variable; of notable mention, several egg masses in early stages of development were found on July 8, 1999 along the British Columbia provincial border outside Jasper, Alberta. Adults migrate seasonally to return to their natal breeding ponds, with males arriving earlier and staying longer than females, and some individuals have been seen migrating along snow banks on warm spring days. Gender differences (or sexual dimorphism) in this species are only apparent during the breeding season, when mature males display an enlarged or bulbous vent area.|$|E

The distribution of the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> overlaps extensively with the forestry industry, a dominant resource supporting the economy of British Columbia and the western United States.

In this study, we examined the separate and combined effects of food availability and density on the agonistic behavior and life history of larval <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders,</b> Ambystoma macrodactylum. We designed a 2 × 2 factorial experiment in which larvae were raised with either a high or low density of conspecifics and fed either a high or low level of food.

Results indi-cated that differences in both density and food level in-fluenced all three life history traits measured. Moreover, differences in food level at which larvae were reared re-sulted in higher within-group size variation and height-ened intraspecific biting while both density and food level contributed to increased cannibalism. We suggest that increased hunger levels and an uneven size struc-ture promoted biting among larvae in the low food treat-ments. Moreover, these factors combined with a higher encounter rate with conspecifics in the high density treatments may have prompted larger individuals to seek an alternative food source {{in the form of}} smaller con-specifics...|$|R

500|$|The eggs of {{this species}} look {{similar to those of}} the related northwestern {{salamander}} (A. gracile) and tiger salamander (A. tigrinum). Like many amphibians, the eggs of the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> are surrounded by a gelatinous capsule. This capsule is transparent, making the embryo visible during development. Unlike A.gracile eggs, there are no visible signs of green algae, which makes egg jellies green in color. When in its egg, the <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> embryo is darker on top and whiter below compared to a tiger salamander embryo that is light brown to grey above and cream-colored on the bottom. The eggs are about [...] or greater in diameter with a wide outer jelly layer. Prior to hatching—both in the egg and as newborn larvae—they have balancers, which are thin skin protrusions sticking out the sides and supporting the head. The balancers eventually fall off and their external gills grow larger. Once the balancers are lost the larvae are distinguished by the sharply pointed flaring of the gills. As the larvae mature and metamorphose, their limbs with digits become visible and the gills are resorbed.|$|E

40|$|Cannibalism is a {{seemingly}} aberrant interaction, appearing {{counter to the}} fitness of individuals. Yet cannibalism is not overly uncommon, and naturally occurs among aquatic organisms, including larval amphibians. In temporary wetlands larval amphibians are in a race to complete metamorphosis before their aquatic habitat disappears. When intraspecific competition intensifies, eating conspecifics may represent a beneficial if not necessary strategy. The research presented within this thesis aims to characterize factors that influence cannibalism within populations of larval amphibians. Wood frog tadpoles (Lithobates sylvaticus) were used to test potential benefits of cannibalism as a diet, determine if dietary quality and nutritional stress influence cannibalism, and investigate the roles of competition and chemical cues in influencing cannibalism. Larval <b>long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma macrodactylum), and ringed salamanders (A. annulatum) were used to investigate a functional link between trophic polymorphism and cannibalism in natural populations. Results suggest that perceived increases in competition may stimulate some individuals to become less risk averse, and more aggressive, which may in turn facilitate cannibalistic behaviour. Cannibalism itself provided only conditional benefits to larval wood frogs, rather than the optimal growth that would be expected from an ideal diet. However, {{this may have been}} the result of individual variation in response to the diet and/or conspecific cues as opposed to a nutritional deficit. In conditions where tadpoles could perceive increased competition they altered their behaviour and morphology in ways that may improve their foraging success and potentially promote cannibalism. Finally, a functional link appears to exist between head morphology and cannibalism in natural wetlands. However, the appearance of this morphology appears related to conditions that may facilitate increased population densities through rapid pond drying...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 The {{potential}} impact of chemical contaminants and conservation practices on amphibians in agricultural landscapes is a key research topic globally. Amphibians represent a common group in many freshwater systems and are currently experiencing worldwide population declines. Global amphibian declines {{may be attributed to}} a number of causes, including habitat loss, introduced species, global climate change, disease, and chemical contaminants; most species declines are not a function of only one factor, but a result of interacting factors and synergistic impacts. 	I analyzed the impact of field conservation efforts employed in the Calapooia watershed, located in the central Willamette Valley in Oregon, on amphibian species diversity using Simpson's Diversity Index. In the Calapooia watershed the value of this index increased when conservation efforts, such as retaining crop residue and riparian buffers, were present. This suggests that species diversity increased with increased conservation effort at the field level. In addition, I found species-specific habitat associations in the Calapooia watershed. <b>Long-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma macrodactylum) were associated with stream channel cover. Rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa) and Red-legged frogs (Rana aurora) showed similar relationships to pH, bank width, depth, and riparian habitat where as Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) showed strong relationships to increased structural heterogeneity, increased distance to nearest agricultural field, and increased human disturbance. These results indicate that conservation efforts can impact amphibian biodiversity, and that there are species-specific habitat associations in the Calapooia watershed. My third chapter looked at pesticides and fertilizers, which have been shown to negatively affect many species of amphibians. I used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the lethal and sub-lethal effects of pesticides and fertilizers on amphibians in an effort to review the published work to date. I found that, in general, pesticides and fertilizers negatively affect amphibians by reducing both survival and growth.
