Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E

You can't throw your voice like that. You can't throw harmony like that. That is a very distinct voice. Her technique is a thread between the really far-out stuff and opera and pop music. It's distinct. It's all her own. Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first of}} two {{recording}} sessions for [...] "Fixing a Hole" [...] was at Regent Sound Studios in London on 9 February 1967, in three takes.

Also present at the session was a man who had arrived at McCartney's house in St John's Wood, shortly before McCartney was due to depart for the studio, and introduced himself as Jesus Christ. McCartney later recalled: [...] "I thought, Well, it probably isn't. But if he is, I'm not going to be the one to turn him away ... There were a lot of casualties about then. We used to get a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> maybe insecure or going through emotional breakdowns or whatever.

Martin told RTÉ Radio One's Sean O’Rourke show the cardinal's comments expressed [...] "our deeply held conviction about the meaning of marriage". [...] "One of the difficulties of the debate was that we had two parallel discussions going on. One was about the meaning of marriage and the other was about respecting gay people and showing tolerance," [...] he said. [...] "I think what Cardinal Parolin was expressing was our deeply held conviction about the meaning of marriage," [...] Martin said. [...] "He said three things. He said, look, I'm saddened by the result which I {{think a lot of people}} in this country are also. He said this isn't just a defeat for Christian principles, it's a defeat for humanity.

And I guess it kind of comes from my teens and my youth and just from having a kid. We have a son. He’s almost two now. So now, you know I was being a dad and these things are coming up. They’re resurfacing and these memories from the past and it’s me just wondering what the world’s gonna be like when he’s older. I guess I was thinking about my younger days when I was writing this song and how I was. I had a lot of really good friends but I had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> always, you know, they were searching a lot and everything was intense all the time, you know what I mean? And instead of enjoying life, they were constantly beating themselves down and I think I got pulled into that a little bit when I was in my teens and I guess it came out in song form in this song Joyride, so it’s just something that no one can control. You might as well just live in the moment and enjoy it because you never know." ...|$|E
