6000|$|This plant, the scarlet-runner of English gardeners and the Phaseolus coccineus of Lamarck, {{originally}} {{came from}} Mexico, as I am informed by Mr. Bentham. The flowers are so constructed that hive and humble-bees, which visit them incessantly, almost always alight {{on the left}} wing-petal, as they can best suck the nectar from this side. Their weight and movements depress the petal, and this causes the stigma to protrude from the spirally-wound keel, and a brush of hairs round the stigma pushes out the pollen before it. The pollen adheres to the head or proboscis of the bee which is at work, and is thus placed either on the stigma of the same flower, or is carried to another flower. (5/4. The flowers have been described by Delpino, and in an admirable manner by Mr. Farrer in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 2 4th series October 1868 page 256. My son Francis has explained 'Nature' January 8, 1874 page 189, the use of one peculiarity in their structure, namely, a little vertical projection on the single free stamen near its base, which seems placed as if to guard the entrance into the two nectar-holes in the staminal sheath. He shows that this projection prevents the bees reaching the nectar, unless {{they go to the}} left side of the flower, and it is absolutely necessary for cross-fertilisation that they should alight on the left wing-petal.) Several years ago I covered some plants under a large net, and these produced on one occasion about one-third, and on another occasion about one-eighth, of the number of pods which the same number of uncovered plants growing close alongside produced. (5/5. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 and more especially ibid 1858 page 828. Also 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.) This lessened fertility was not caused by any injury from the net, as I moved the wing-petals of several protected flowers, in the same manner as bees do, and these produced remarkably fine pods. When the net was taken off, the flowers were immediately visited by bees, and it was interesting to observe how quickly the plants became covered with young pods. As the flowers are much frequented by Thrips, the self-fertilisation of most of the flowers under the net may have been due to the action of these minute insects. Dr. Ogle likewise covered up a large portion of a plant, and [...] "out of a vast number of blossoms thus protected not a single one produced a pod, while the unprotected blossoms were for the most part fruitful." [...] Mr. Belt gives a more curious case; this plant grows well and flowers in Nicaragua; but as none of the native bees visit the flowers, not a single pod is ever produced. (5/6. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' 1870 page 168. Mr. Belt 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 70. The latter author gives a case 'Nature' 1875 page 26, of a <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> of Phaseolus multiflorus near London which [...] "was rendered barren" [...] by the humble-bees cutting, as they frequently do, holes at the bases of the flowers instead of entering them in the proper manner.) ...|$|E

40|$|Paddy {{fields are}} a major global {{anthropogenic}} source of methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), which are very potent greenhouse gases. China has the second largest area under rice cultivation, so developing valid and reliable methods for reducing {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} while sustaining crop productivity in paddy fields is of paramount importance. We examined the effects of applying straw, a residual product of rice cultivation containing high amounts of carbon and nutrients, to rice crops during both an early crop season (5 April – 25 July 2012) and a <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> season (1 August – 6 November 2012) on CH₄ and N₂O emissions in a subtropical paddy field in southeastern China. CH₄ fluxes had two seasonal peaks, on 5 May and 28 June, in the early crop but only one peak, on 13 August, in the <b>late</b> <b>crop,</b> which could be attributed to the lower temperatures after the final tillering stage in the <b>late</b> <b>crop.</b> Straw application significantly increased mean CH₄ cumulative production (g m־²) relative to the control in the <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> (37. 3 vs. 8. 34 mg m⁻² P 0. 05). The application of straw significantly increased N₂O cumulative production relative to the control in the <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> (75. 9 vs. 43. 4 μg m⁻² h⁻¹) but decreased N₂O cumulative production by over 43 % in the early crop (15. 60 vs. 27. 27 μg m⁻² h⁻¹) (P < 0. 05). Straw application increased rice yield by 9. 63 % and 12. 58 % in early and <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> respectively. Straw incorporation decreased global warming potential in the early season, but increased it in the late season. Thus, despite straw application enhances emissions of greenhouse gases in some situations, its application in the adequate season (here early crop) may be an effective soil amendment that can increase soil fertility without enhancing or even mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases and thus climate change...|$|E

40|$|A time-series {{analysis}} of potato prices {{will be introduced}} in this study. Potatoes are the leading vegetable in the United States {{from the viewpoint of}} annual production. Compared with the other table food plants, potatoes ranks second only to wheat. Almost 81 % of the potatoes produced are used for food consumption, 5 % of the crop are used for seed and the remaining 14 % of the crop, which are the surplus consisting mostly of poor grade potatoes, go for non-food uses, such as livestock feed and industrial products, starch and alcohol. At the same time potatoes {{are one of the most}} widely grown crops in the United States. They are grown in every state and harvested during every month of the year in some sections of the country. During recent years, there has been a tendency toward more specialization in potato production. The total acreage trended downward but the yields per acre have increased rapidly. Production of potatoes is becoming concentrated in the high-yielding areas and on large commercial farms. This high specializing and commercializing tendency makes potato price analysis more important. Potato price analysis in this study is centered on Chicago and St. Louis, the two big wholesale markets of midwest potatoes, and is devoted largely to the <b>late</b> <b>crop.</b> Since the data we have cover a period of only seven years, the study will be emphasized with respect to short-time price analysis, i. e., annual and short-term cyclic price fluctuations and seasonal price variations. The main objectives of this study are three, listed in the following: To find out the effects of changes in <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> production, intermediate crop prices, and their pertinent factors on the <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> prices, i. e., to make a potato price structure analysis.

Four locally made lysimters were installed in the middle of barley field to measure barley evapotranspiration. The single crop coefficient approach was used to estimate barley crop coefficient. The average seasonal evapotranspiration of barley was 375 mm which is similar to many other cereal crops in the region.

There were three different treatments: control (natural lodging), scaffolding (non-lodging) and <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> (result of early ratooning in December). Compared with the scaffolding treatment, a slow-down in biomass accumulation was observed in the control treatment only, {{for a short time}} after lodging, which led to 16 % less cane yield in the control treatment than in the scaffolding treatment at the September harvest. This was partially associated with lower dry weight of the stalks and partially with stalk death due to lodging. Sugar yields in the non-loding treatment were 18 % to 22 % higher than the control, depending on the time of harvest. This was mainly attributable to higher commercial cane sugar (CCS) concentrations in June and to higher cane yields (fresh or dry) in September. The growth rate of the late (younger) crop, which was influenced by lodging later in the season, was {{similar to that of the}} non-lodged cane crops. Cane biomass production continued in all the treatments until the final harvest in September. The crops did not experience a 'plateau' in yield accumulation, as observed in some studies under tropical conditions.

The survival of top shoot cuttings was more than 97. 8 % irrespective of the planting time and plant spacing. Significant variations were found among the treatment combinations for plant height at 45 and 60 days after planting (DAP), foliage coverage at 45 and 60 DAP, number of branches per plant, number of tubers per plant, individual tuber weight, tuber yields per plant and per hectare yield.

Future scenarios predict that Khorezm region will receive fewer water supplies due to climate change, transboundary conflicts and hence farmers have to achieve their yield targets with less water. We conducted a study and used AquaCrop model to develop the optimum and deficit irrigation schedule under shallow groundwater conditions (1. 0 - 1. 2 m) in the study region. Cotton being a strategic crop in the region was used for simulations. Capillary rise substantially contributes to crop-water requirements and is the key characteristic of the regional soils. However, AquaCrop does not simulate capillary rise contribution, thereby HYDRUS- 1 D model {{was used in this}} study for the quantification of capillary rise contribution. Alongside optimal irrigation schedule for cotton, deficit strategies were also derived in two ways: proportional reduction from each irrigation event (scenario-A) throughout the growth period as well as reduced water supply at specific crop growth stages (scenario-B). For scenario-A, 20, 40, 50 and 60 % of optimal water was deducted from each irrigation quota whereas for scenario-B irrigation events were knocked out at different crop growth stages (stage 1 (emergence), stage 2 (vegetative), stage 3 (flowering) and stage 4 (yield formation and ripening)). For scenario-A, 0, 14, 30 and 48 % of yield reduction was observed respectively. During stress at the <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> development stage, a reduced water supply of 12 % resulted in a yield increase of 8 %. Conversely, during stress at the earlier crop development stage, yield loss was 17 - 18 %. During water stress at the late ripening stage, no yield loss was observed. Results of this study provide guidelines for policy makers to adopt irrigation schedule depending upon availability of irrigation water...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- A {{two-phase}} {{field experiment}} {{on the effect}} of N application was studied on growth, yield and quality of seed cane of sugarcane variety, B 41 / 227 at Finchaa Sugarcane Plantation during 2000 / 2001 and 2002 / 2003 cropping years. Thirty two treatments comprised of four N levels – 0, 46, 92 and 138 kg/ha, and applied at 2 1 / 2, 5 and 7 1 / 2 months after planting in whole and split applications were used in RCBD with three replications. The source of fertilizer is urea (46 %N), which is the commonly used fertilizer in the plantation. The results of the experiment showed that application of high N rate resulted in better plant height, stalk population, stalk length as well as higher sett yield and improved sprouting of buds. In phase- 1 experiment, significantly higher sett yield was obtained for the highest rate of 138 kgN/ha applied in single, double and triple doses over the control. Apart from other treatments, application of 138 kgN/ha in two doses at two and half and five months significantly increased stalk population and sett yield by 39. 1 and 51. 7 %, respectively, over the control. In the second phase, seed setts obtained from seed cane plants treated with the same rate gave sprouting performance of average quality. Significantly higher sprouting performance was recorded for seed setts from seed cane plants treated with N rates applied at mid and <b>late</b> <b>crop</b> ages. Therefore, to get higher sett yield of average quality it is advisable that urea be applied to seed cane plants of sugarcane variety B 41 / 227 at the rate of 300 kgN/ha in two splits of 200 and 100 kgN/ha at two and half and five months of crop ages, respectively. Besides, as this study is the first by its kind under Finchaa condition, it paves an opportunity for further investigation including major sugarcane varieties under cultivation in the study site and other sugarcane plantations in the country.

50|$|Botvinik (2008) {{found that}} all {{existing}} models of hierarchically structured behavior share at least one general assumption - that the hierarchical, part-whole organization of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural representations underlying it. Specifically, {{the assumption is that}} there exist representations not only of low-level motor behaviors, but also separable representations of higher-level behavioral units. The <b>latest</b> <b>crop</b> of models provides new insights, but also poses new or refined questions for empirical research, including how abstract action representations emerge through learning, how they interact with different modes of action control, and how they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC).|$|R

Another change has been the gradual decline of single-screen cinemas and the increase of multiplex theatres, hosted by the same burgeoning malls.
