500|$|... "Next to You" [...] is a R and pop song. The song has lyrics about a relationship, but Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy {{said that}} the song also {{contained}} inspirational lyrics. It features [...] "digitized" [...] violins. According to the sheet music at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 116beats per minute. It is composed in the key of E major with Bieber and Brown's vocal ranges spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C6. The song features the chord progression of E–B–Cm–A. Nadia Noir of WNOW-FM said the song was a hybrid of a [...] "dance-jam" [...] and [...] "love-song." [...] Furthermore, AOL Music's Charley Rogulewski called the song a [...] "dreamy pop love song." [...] The song sees Brown and Bieber trading verses and the chorus in lyrics like [...] "I'll be there when you're insecure/ <b>Let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that you're always lovely/ Girl, because {{you are the only}} thing that I got right now." ...|$|E

500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E

500|$|McCormack {{received}} his breakthrough role in 1998 {{when he was}} cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. [...] "At {{the end of the}} audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> you never have to be more gay than that.'" [...] He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6million American viewers. Will & Grace quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will's best friend Grace Adler) worked [...] "nicely" [...] together. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". For this performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where you are in a relationship, it might not be going so well and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say what is on their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking? Why doesn't he <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, you lift me up." ...|$|E
500|$|Two main {{charges were}} brought to the House of Commons against Marlborough: first, an {{assertion}} that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that he had taken 2.5% from the pay of the foreign troops in English pay, amounting to £280,000. Despite Marlborough's refutations (claiming ancient precedent for the first allegation, and, for the second, producing a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deductions in lieu of secret-service money for the war), the findings were enough for Harley to persuade the Queen to release her Captain-General. On 29 December 1711 (O.S.), before the charges had been examined, Anne, who owed to him the success and glory of her reign, sent her letter of dismissal: [...] "I am sorry for your own sake the reasons are become so public which makes it necessary for me to <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you have render'd it impracticable for you to continue yet longer in my service". The Tory dominated Parliament concluded by a substantial majority that, [...] "the taking of several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough from the contractor for foraging the bread and wagons... was unwarrantable and illegal", and that the 2.5% deducted from the pay of foreign troops [...] "is public money and ought to be accounted for". When his successor, the Duke of Ormonde, left London for The Hague to take command of British forces he went, noted Bishop Burnet, with [...] "the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of Marlborough".|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on {{the applause}} {{given to the}} Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 {{magazine}} Propaganda called the result [...] "about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It {{was one of those}} ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an unforgettable moment." [...] Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment". He added [...] "to be able to address General Pinochet from the stage on live television in Chile and say, 'Give the dead back to the living. Please, General Pinochet, tell these women where the bones of their sons and daughters are.' That was an extraordinary moment... certainly in my life and U2's." [...] When asked if the negative reaction from some of the audience had disappointed the band Bono said it had not, stating [...] "it's proof to me that a rock 'n' roll audience are not lemmings.... If they don't agree with you, they will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> – but that doesn't mean they're not fans.... I was flattered that we weren't just playing to people who agreed with us." [...] U2's performance was later credited with inspiring a protest in the Chilean Parliament against Pinochet, who {{was in the process of}} becoming a Senator for life after relinquishing his position as head of the armed forces. The opposition party brought in the Madres, who again held pictures of their disappeared children and asked for information on the location of their bodies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper draws {{together}} four {{perspectives that}} contribute to {{a new understanding of}} probability and solving problems involving probability. The first is the Subjective Bayesian perspective that probability is affected by one's knowledge, and that it is updated as one's knowledge changes. The main criticism of the Bayesian perspective is the problem of assigning prior probabilities; this problem disappears with our Information Theory perspective, in which we take the bold new step of equating probability with information. The main point of the paper is that the formal perspective (formalize, calculate, unformalize) is beneficial to solving probability problems. And finally, the programmer's perspective provides us with a suitable formalism. To illustrate the benefits of these perspectives, we completely solve the hitherto open problem of the two envelopes. “Writing is nature's way of <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how sloppy your thinking is. ” —Richard Guindon (cartoon), San Francisco Chronicle, 1989 January “Mathematics is nature's way of <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how sloppy your writing is. ” —Leslie Lamport, Specifying Systems, page 2, 2002 July 19 “Formal mathematics is nature's way of <b>letting</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> how sloppy your mathematics is. ” —Leslie Lamport, Specifying Systems, page 2, 2002 July 1...|$|R
