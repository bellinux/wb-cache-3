5|$|As cancers do not {{immediately}} emerge after {{exposure to radiation}} instead radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed <b>lethality,</b> {{could be due to}} radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared <b>lethality.</b> Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly those {{who took part in the}} study.|$|E
5|$|Californium-251 has a {{very small}} {{calculated}} critical mass of about , high <b>lethality,</b> and {{a relatively short period}} of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.|$|E
5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and <b>lethality,</b> ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that <b>lethality</b> was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the <b>lethality</b> of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the <b>lethality</b> of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic <b>lethality</b> in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|The PIP and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The <b>lethality</b> of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons to clog up and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita exitialis contain a unique purine {{nucleoside}} that is {{coupled with an}} amino acid derivative named N2-(1-methoxycarbonylethyl)guanosine. The discovery and identification of this chemical was the first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its α-amino nitrogen (the nitrogen bonded to the α-carbon) to a nucleobase aglycone by a C-N (carbon to nitrogen) bond. The new compound {{was determined to be}} toxic in the brine shrimp <b>lethality</b> test, but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines. Other compounds isolated from the fungus include β-carboline and russulaceramide (a ceramide formerly found in some Russula mushrooms).|$|E
5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed <b>lethality</b> of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas studied an AH-64B, {{featuring}} {{an updated}} cockpit, new fire control system and other upgrades. In 1988, funding was approved for a multi-stage upgrade program to improve sensor and weapon systems. Technological advance {{led to the}} program's cancellation {{in favor of more}} ambitious changes. In August 1990, development of the AH-64D Apache Longbow was approved by the Defense Acquisition Board. The first AH-64D prototype flew on 15 April 1992, prototype testing ended in April 1995. During testing, six AH-64D helicopters were pitted against a numerically superior group of AH-64A helicopters; the results demonstrated the AH-64D to have a seven times increase in survivability and four times increase in <b>lethality</b> compared to the AH-64A. On 13 October 1995, full-scale production was approved; a $1.9-billion five-year contract was signed in August 1996 to rebuild 232 AH-64As to AH-64D standard. On 17 March 1997, the first production AH-64D first flew, it was delivered on 31 March.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and <b>lethality</b> of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E
5|$|The PanzerI was {{upgraded}} {{in order}} to increase its <b>lethality.</b> On 8August 1937, Major General García Pallasar received a note from Generalísimo Francisco Franco that expressed the need for a PanzerI (or negrillo, as their Spanish crews called them) with a 20-millimeter gun. Ultimately, the piece chosen was the Breda Model 1935, due to the simplicity of the design over competitors such as the German Flak 30. Furthermore, the 20mm Breda was capable of perforating 40millimeters of armour at 250meters (1.57in at 275yd), which was more than sufficient to penetrate the frontal armour of the T-26. Although originally 40 Italian CV.35 light tanks were ordered with the Breda in place of their original armament, this order was subsequently canceled after it was thought that the adaptation of the same gun to the PanzerI would yield better results. Prototypes were ready by September1937 and an order was placed after successful results. The mounting of the Breda in the Panzer I required the original turret to be opened at the top and then extended by a vertical supplement. Four of these tanks were finished at the Armament Factory of Seville, but further production was canceled as it was decided sufficient numbers of Republican T-26 tanks had been captured to fulfill the Nationalist leadership's request for more lethal tanks. The Breda modification was not particularly liked by German crews, as the unprotected gap in the turret, designed to allow the tank's commander to aim, was found to be a dangerous weak point.|$|E
25|$|Stage one of {{the seven}} step {{approach}} focuses on assessing <b>lethality.</b> The clinician is to plan and conduct a thorough biopsychosocial and lethality/imminent danger assessment; this should be done promptly at the time of arrival. Once <b>lethality</b> is determined one should establish rapport with the victim(s) whom the clinician will be working with.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} a {{research}} study on synthetic <b>lethality</b> in cancer. Synthetic <b>lethality</b> appears when a mutation in a single gene {{has no effect on}} the function of a cell but a mutation in an additional gene leads to cell death. This study aimed to find novel methods of treating cancer through blocking the <b>lethality</b> of drugs. GeneCards was used when comparing data of a given target gene with all possible genes. In this process, the annotation sharing score was calculated using GeneDecks Partner Hunter (now called Genes Like Me) to give paralogy. Inactivation targets were be extracted after the microarray experiments of resistant and non-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines.|$|E
25|$|When two {{mutations}} are viable alone but lethal in combination, it {{is called}} Synthetic <b>lethality</b> or unlinked non-complementation.|$|E
25|$|CASPASE12, a cysteinyl {{aspartate}} proteinase. The loss of {{this gene}} is speculated to {{have reduced the}} <b>lethality</b> of bacterial infection in humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{potential of}} synthetic <b>lethality</b> as an efficacious anti-cancer strategy is continually improving. Recently, {{the applicability of}} synthetic <b>lethality</b> to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A. DePinho and colleagues, in what is termed 'collateral lethality'. Muller et al. found that passenger genes, with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes, are collaterally deleted in some cancers. Thus, the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then pursing a synthetic <b>lethality</b> approach. Collateral <b>lethality</b> therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology. In 2012, Muller et al. identified that homozygous deletion of redundant-essential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma (GBM) is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic <b>lethality</b> approach to GBM inhibition. ENO1 {{is one of three}} homologous genes (ENO2, ENO3) that encodes the mammalian alpha-enolase enzyme. ENO2, which encodes enolase 2, is mostly expressed in neural tissues, leading to the postulation that in ENO1-deleted GBM, ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1. Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic <b>lethality</b> outcome by selective killing of GBM cells). In 2016, Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolar-range enolase inhibitor which preferentially inhibits glioma cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1-deleted cells. SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than pan-enolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1. Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer, whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis. Dey et al. show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species, consistent with KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer, and essentially primes ME2-null cells for synthetic <b>lethality</b> by depletion of redundant NAD(P)+-dependent isoform ME3. The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROS-mediated apoptosis. Meanwhile, Oike et al. demonstrated the generalizability of the concept by targeting redundant essential-genes in process other than metabolism, namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF complex.|$|E
25|$|At {{least three}} {{survivors}} were treated for cyanide poisoning. Exposure to carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide simultaneously produces a higher <b>lethality</b> than {{exposure to the}} two gases separately.|$|E
25|$|Metastasis is {{the major}} cause of tumor <b>lethality.</b> However, not every tumor cell can metastasize. This {{potential}} depends on factors that determine growth, angiogenesis, invasion and other basic processes.|$|E
25|$|In mouse, NEDD4-2 {{deletion}} {{leads to}} increased cell surface expression and activity of ENaC in the lung, resulting in premature clearance of lung fluid, airway drying, lung inflammation and perinatal <b>lethality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flu pandemics {{typically}} come in waves. The 1889–1890 and 1918–1919 flu pandemics each came {{in three}} or four waves of increasing <b>lethality.</b> But within a wave, mortality was greater {{at the beginning of the}} wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} triage assessment, {{which is an}} {{immediate}} assessment to determine <b>lethality</b> and determine appropriate referral {{to one of the}} following: emergency inpatient hospitalization, outpatient treatment facility or private therapist, or if no referral is needed.|$|E
25|$|If a {{resurgence}} of SARS this winter coincides with the annual outbreak of influenza, identifying and isolating suspected SARS cases {{will be much more}} difficult. SARS also could mutate, altering the symptoms, transmissibility, or <b>lethality</b> of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Loss of Cul4b in mice causes {{embryonic}} <b>lethality</b> and {{defects in}} placental development. The extra-embryonic tissue of these developing mice also showed increased rates of apoptosis and {{a decrease in}} cell proliferation. When Cul4b deletion was limited to the epiblast (only in Sox2-expressing tissue), it was possible to generate living mice.|$|E
25|$|Since XRCC4 {{is the key}} {{protein that}} enables {{interaction}} of LigIV to damaged DNA and therefore ligation of the ends, mutations in the XRCC4 gene were found to cause embryonic <b>lethality</b> in mice and developmental inhibition and immunodeficiency in humans. Furthermore, certain mutations in the XRCC4 gene are {{associated with an increased}} risk of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Later, as Chief of the Ordnance Development Division, he was {{assigned}} the task of supervising the development of proximity fuzes for nonrotating projectiles such as bombs, rockets, and mortars. It was calculated that a fuze which would explode a projectile near a plane or at some height above a target on the surface would increase <b>lethality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The no-SCAR {{technique}} uses a two-plasmid system; this {{is because}} co-transformation of both cas9 containing plasmid and the sgRNA plasmid results in cell death. More specifically, the cell <b>lethality</b> {{is a consequence of}} Cas9 cleaving the E. coli DNA that matches the sgRNA. In order to circumvent this issue, multiple plasmids are used in order to maintain expressional control of both cas9 and sgRNA.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} field firings {{were carried out}} to check the {{accuracy}} and <b>lethality</b> of the weapon systems. A large number of innovations and modifications carried out by units and formations to enhance combat power were tested in the field. The troops built on the training momentum gradually, with increased combat tempo {{to set the stage}} for a major joint army-air force exercise in the later part of the exercise.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax is {{a disease}} caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming, Gram positive, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium (Fig. 1). The <b>lethality</b> of the disease {{is caused by the}} bacterium's two principal virulence factors: (i) the polyglutamic acid capsule, which is anti-phagocytic, and (ii) the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin. Anthrax toxin is a mixture of three protein components: (i) protective antigen (PA), (ii) edema factor (EF), and (iii) lethal factor (LF).|$|E
25|$|Charles {{correctly}} {{assumed that}} 'Abd-al-Raḥmân would {{feel compelled to}} give battle, and move on and try to loot Tours. Neither side wanted to attack. Abd-al-Raḥmân {{felt he had to}} sack Tours, which meant he had to go through the Frankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles's decision to wait and stay on the hills proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyad Cavalry to charge uphill and through trees, diminishing their <b>lethality.</b>|$|E
25|$|The PTET {{promoter}} {{plays an}} integral {{role in the}} expression of both plasmids. It drives transcriptional expression of both the sgRNA of interest and cas9 in the host cell upon induction with anhydrotetracycline (aTc). In {{the absence of the}} inducer, the PTET promoter is repressed by the constitutively expressed tetracycline repressor protein (TetR). Therefore, the presence of TetR in the host cell prior to the introduction of both sgRNA and cas9 is a measure to avoid cell <b>lethality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cancer can {{be treated}} by surgery, chemotherapy, {{radiation}} therapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy (including immunotherapy such as monoclonal antibody therapy) and synthetic <b>lethality.</b> The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and {{the stage of the}} disease, as well as the general state of the patient (performance status). A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development. Under current estimates, two in five people will have cancer {{at some point in their}} lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterial}} variant Clostridium perfringens type A produces alpha-toxin. The toxin has phospholipase C activity, {{and causes}} hemolysis, <b>lethality,</b> and dermonecrosis. At high concentrations, alpha-toxin induces massive degradation of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, producing diacylglycerol and ceramide, respectively. These molecules then participate in signal transduction pathways. It {{has been reported}} that the toxin activates the arachidonic acid cascade in isolated rat aorta. The toxin-induced contraction was related to generation of thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid. Thus it is likely the bacterial PLC mimics the actions of endogenous PLC in eukaryotic cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|The bill itself {{contained}} no {{details on the}} type or amount of electricity that should be used and the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of determining these factors. In September 1888, a committee was formed and recommended 3000 volts, although the type of electricity, direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC), was not determined, and since tests {{up to that point}} had been done on animals smaller than a human (dogs), some members were unsure that the <b>lethality</b> of AC had been conclusively proven.|$|E
25|$|Caterpillar hair {{can be a}} {{cause of}} human health problems. Caterpillar hairs {{sometimes}} have venoms in them and species from approximately 12 families of moths or butterflies worldwide can inflict serious human injuries ranging from urticarial dermatitis and atopic asthma to osteochondritis, consumption coagulopathy, renal failure, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Skin rashes are the most common, {{but there have been}} fatalities. Lonomia is a frequent cause of envenomation in Brazil, with 354 cases reported between 1989 and 2005. <b>Lethality</b> ranging up to 20% with death caused most often by intracranial hemorrhage.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Everest {{is safer}} for climbers than {{a number of}} peaks by some measurements, but {{it depends on the}} period. Some {{examples}} are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the nordwand). Mont Blanc has more deaths each year than Everest, with over one hundred dying in a typical year and over eight thousand killed since records were kept. Some factors that affect total mountain <b>lethality</b> include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and of course the difficulty of the climb.|$|E
