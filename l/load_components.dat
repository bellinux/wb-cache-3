50|$|Internally, PCR {{is largely}} built up of custom {{applications}} {{on top of}} a VxWorks kernel. A benefit of the software is that it is completely modular and can <b>load</b> <b>components</b> to Passport control processors (CPs) and function processors (FPs) on an as-needed basis. FPs (also known as line cards) each run their own instance of the Operating System, and as such can be rebooted without the need to take the entire switch out of service, for example due to a software failure. As well, as would be expected, entire cards can be replaced while the system is hot, thus minimizing downtime due to hardware failure.|$|E

In engineering design for the structures, spatiotemporally varying wind loads on the low rise roofs are modeled as equivalent static wind loads.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{approach}} for {{the prediction of}} growth of delaminations in lami-nated composites made of plies of fiber-reinforced polymers is proposed. It allows to handle arbitrary combinations of force, displacement, temperature, and moisture loads. Quasi-static load cases can be treated as well as load cases where some <b>load</b> <b>components</b> are constant and some <b>load</b> <b>components</b> are cyclic. The proposed approach {{is based on the}} Griffith criterion, which is evaluated by means of some finite element procedure. It provides a complete picture of a delamination problem in a given structure and offers systematic understanding of the influence of size and position of a delamination on the growth, on the growth stability, and on the struc-tural response. Two examples, a curved laminate and a T-joint, are investigated in detail to underline the capabilities of the proposed approach...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new aggregate model for {{voltage and frequency}} dependent <b>load</b> <b>components</b> in power system studies. The model is built using a modular approach that allows the easy integration of dissimilar load data specification formats, such as exponential forms and polynomial representations. As opposed to conventional load models in which the exponents of the exponential or polynomial representations are constant, the proposed model dynamically ad-justs these exponents. The composite <b>load</b> <b>components</b> are represented by network equivalents connected to the transmission system maintaining the topological structure of the original power network. The proposed aggregate load model includes {{more information on the}} nature of the load devices than conventional models and is thus valid for a wider range of voltage and frequency variations. This paper presents the basic equations of the new proposed aggregate load model, as well as comparison with conventional models...|$|E

40|$|Load {{modeling}} {{plays an}} important role in power system operation and control. With increasingly complex grid and emergence of various new <b>load</b> <b>components,</b> load modeling becomes an intractable task. In this paper, our research work will focus on load modeling at distribution level. In order to capture specific load characteristics of various <b>load</b> <b>components,</b> a complete load model at distribution level with equivalent capacitor, large motor and small motor is applied. Disturbance data is processed in advance through MATLAB programs according to the requirements of measurement-based approach. In case study, the measurements and simulated model outputs are demonstrated. For comparison purpose, three load models are used to access model accuracy, which are respectively complete load model at distribution level, composite load model at transmission level and dynamic load model in PowerFactory at distribution level. By contrast, the complete load model proved to have better performance in transient conditions. By splitting the induction motor into two parts, some issues are introduced at the same time. Future work will focus on the generalization capability of this compete load model. Department of Electrical EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E

In order to obtain the necessary characteristics and fatigue properties, materials were tested under LCF strain-based mode with strain ratio Rɛ = 0, 1 and strain rate of 10 - 2 1 /s.

40|$|The {{composite}} load model (CLM) {{proposed by}} the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) is gaining increasing traction in industry, particularly in North America. At the same time, it has been recognized that further improvements in structure, initialization and aggregation methods are needed to enhance model accuracy. However, {{the lack of an}} open-source implementation of the WECC CLM has become a roadblock for many researchers for further improvement. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first open reference implementation of the WECC CLM. Individual <b>load</b> <b>components</b> and the CLM are first developed and tested in Matlab, then translated to the high performance computing (HPC) based, parallel simulation framework - GridPACK. The main contributions of the paper include: 1) presenting important yet undocumented details of modeling and initializing the CLM, particularly for a parallel simulation frame-work like GridPACK; 2) implementation details of the <b>load</b> <b>components</b> such as the single-phase air conditioner motor; 3) implementing the CLM in a modular and extensible manner.
