40|$|THE GREEK LE FT IN AUSTRALIA is an {{important}} topic about which much more ought to be said and written than appears in this article. It naturally concerns Greeks more than others though {{it would be difficult}} for the Australian <b>Left</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> its disinterest in such a movement. To plead more, the Greek Left operates within and strives for the hegemony of Australia’s second-largest ethnic minority — a community of 300, 000 people, most of whom are industrial workers...|$|R

50|$|The crux of {{problems}} that militate the growth of this town lies in the age-long land disputes over Otuocha land which have led to lots of violence and animosities between the two hosts, Aguleri and Umuleri communities. The question is {{which of the two}} communities first settled at the land and which of them has superior claim over the territory now called Otuocha? The case was first heard in 1933 when Umuleri leaders sued Aguleri over the land but lost because they had earlier sold the land to Royal Niger Company Limited and therefore had been divested of the rights or title to the land according to the judgement then. The court held that Umuleri has nothing <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the court giving them declaration of title. Aguleri sensing the loss of case, sued Umueri in 1935 but lost too on the ground that they too could not establish exclusive ownership of the land.|$|R
50|$|The CTRL-J {{command is}} used <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>justify</b> text. Text is flowed in each {{line of a}} {{paragraph}} up to a limit set with the -r option in the command line. If no limit is given in the command line, then a default value of 72 characters per line is used. This limit is used to wrap lines during composition, as well as <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> text. The CTRL-J command justifies the text in the paragraph that the cursor is placed on. The command CTRL-W CTRL-U is used <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> the full file. In case that justification is not done correctly, or by mistake, it can be undone by pressing the CTRL-U command immediately after justification has been done.|$|R

And maybe we would {{still be in the}} ghetto where they had relegated, if the facts had not come to give us reason. Undressing of this past and talk as if there had {{attended}} was for Cervi and for me, the biggest effort. We hope to be able: to the extent, of course, of quell'angle from which even more objective and impartial historian can not ignore. For us, the years from the Piazza Fontana bombing to Aldo Moro's murder are not «formidable» as are paint by some commentators and memoirs of <b>left</b> <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> their past <b>to</b> support the terrorism. For us those «formidable» years were those of abuse of a minority drunk of fashions and models of import (Marcuse, Mao, Che Guevara) on a majority succubus also because without a voice that represented it. We were this voice. And we can not ignore it even if we have done everything to forget it. In our opinion, the report of those «formidable» years is totally negative. They do not are left behind that grief, galleys, and the so-called «culture of suspicion» that followed to pollute our public life, constantly shaken by scandals more or less pretentious that in those «formidable» years have their origin and root.|$|R

40|$|Keeping {{birds in}} zoos raises the ethical {{question}} if is <b>justified</b> <b>to</b> do so. In this thesis I {{focus on the}} central question: Under wich conditions is it <b>justified</b> <b>to</b> keep birds in zoos? I discuss three possible answers to this question. It is justified if 1) Welfare is guaranteed and birds are used as 'ambassador' {{to raise money for}} other species. 2) In the case of endangered species, to use them for captive breeding. Welfare has to be guaranteed. 3) It is never <b>justified.</b> <b>To</b> evulate these answers I investigate bird welfare in zoos, the role of zoos in captive breeding of endangered species and in the support of in situ conservation projects. I also discusss whether it is <b>justified</b> <b>to</b> 'sacrifice' individuals for the good of (other) species. To investigate if it is never <b>justified</b> <b>to</b> keep birds in zoos I explore the concept of freedom. In conclusion, I argue that it is not true to state that it is never <b>justified</b> <b>to</b> keep birds in zoos. Even though breeding endangered species is ethically <b>justified,</b> it leads <b>to</b> many problems and is not often carried out by zoos. Keeping birds as ‘ambassadors’ is not ethically justified. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the welfare of zoo birds is really worse compared to the wild and thus if individuals are really being ‘sacrificed’ in zoos. Improvements are recommended: zoos should abolish animal species that adapt badly to captivity and they should keep less species, they should focus more on small animals and on education about the connectivity between animals and the natural world, thereby providing more activities (workshops, movies, lectures) for the public...|$|R
