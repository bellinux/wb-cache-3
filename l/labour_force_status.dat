40|$|It is well {{established}} that Indigenous Australians are heavily over-represented among Australia’s most disadvantaged citizens. An important component of this disadvantage is the limited and often unsuccessful engagement of Indigenous people with the labour market. To better understand this reality, the present paper explores the forces which influence the labour market status of Indigenous people. For this purpose, multinomial logit regression analysis is used to model <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> {{as a function of}} factors relating to geography, demographic characteristics, education, health, culture, crime and housing issues. The analysis is conducted utilising the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS). Particular attention is given to geographic issues, revealing significant variations between the determinants of <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> in non-remote and remote areas. The results also demonstrate the relevance {{of a wide range of}} factors in determining <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> among Indigenous people, highlighting the complex array of issues which should be considered in attempts to increase employment. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} level and {{source of income for}} Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians using data from the 2011 wave of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey. Three sources of income are considered: wages and salaries; {{government}} benefits; and income from businesses, investments and other private transfers. Consistent with many previous studies, Indigenous Australians have, on average, lower total income than non-Indigenous Australians, with this difference being largest for those who are full-time employed. The difference is also larger for males than females. In terms of non-wage income, Indigenous men and women receive a much smaller proportion of income from other sources than their non-Indigenous counterparts (primarily business and investment income). This is particularly the case for those who are not in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> (NILF). Correspondingly, government benefits constitute a higher proportion of income for the Indigenous population than for the non-Indigenous population. This is true for both males and females, and for all <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>statuses,</b> although the difference is largest for part-time employed and those who are NILF. Given that Indigenous people {{are also more likely to}} be unemployed than non-Indigenous people, they are more likely to be dependent solely on government payments as a source of income at any one time. The implications of these findings are discussed, as well as directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|This paper finds a {{statistically}} significant negative association between health <b>status</b> and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation. Abstract: This paper examines the association between health status and participation in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> using pooled unit-record data created from the ABS’s five consecutive cross-sectional National Health Surveys. Descriptive analysis of <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation, health <b>status</b> and other selected variables was conducted. A simple age–period–cohort decomposition model {{was used to examine}} the relative influence of these three factors on <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation. A logistic regression model was used to examine the association between participation in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> and health <b>status,</b> controlling for other relevant demographic/ socioeconomic variables including age, period and cohorts. Two self-reported health indicators, namely self-assessed general health status and the presence of selected long-term health conditions, were alternatively used to represent the health status variable in the model. The empirical results suggested {{a statistically}} significant negative association between health <b>status</b> and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation, and this relationship was found to be robust to the alternative measures of the health variable used in the analysis. Based on changes in predicted probabilities for both males and females, those with fair or poor self-assessed health status were less likely to participate in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> compared with those with good or better health. Likewise, there was also a strong negative relationship between major chronic diseases, such as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and asthma, and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation for both males and females, with the relative importance of these diseases varying for the sexes. The association between health indicators and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation appeared to be stronger for females than for males...|$|R
40|$|With {{a rapidly}} aging demographic, the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> {{attachment}} of older Canadians {{has become a}} key area of policy research for mitigating ensuing economic issues. This paper examines the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> attachment of older Canadians aged 50 years and older {{through the use of}} four <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> outcomes: <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation, employment <b>status,</b> full-time full-year status, and retirement status. Two sub-samples are created based on age to compare the impact and change in behaviour of individuals approaching the normal retirement age of 65 (i. e. 50 - 64) to those who have passed this age (i. e. 65 +). Furthermore, genders are analyzed separately in order to assess the differences in behaviour between men and women. Determinants for the four outcomes are also assessed. These include, but are not limited to, age group, marital status, educational attainment, region of residence, and presence of children in the household. Of the analyzed determinants, the results suggest that age is the most impactful factor for men and women in both the 50 - 64 and 65 + sub-samples. Compared to the youngest age categories, older individuals are less likely to have strong <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> attachment. Marital <b>status</b> and educational attainment also demonstrate to be important determinants for the labour market outcomes of older workers.

This long-standing commitment to data gathering reflects the importance of employment, unemployment, and labour force participation rates as key national indicators of social and economic wellbeing. To the extent that Indigenous people have formed part of the sample for the LFS and have participated in the process, they have always been included in the ensuing statistical profile. However, it was not until 1994, in the March survey round, that a question was added to enable the separate identification of Indigenous people within the sample. This practice has subsequently been repeated annually in each February survey. Thus, for one month {{in each of the past}} six years, the ABS has gathered statistics that provide for the calculation of Indigenous <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status,</b> although they have only recently released these data as official, albeit experimental, estimates (ABS, 2000) ...|$|E

Across all categories of <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation <b>status</b> (employed full time, part time or not in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> at all), those with arthritis were significantly more likely to be in poverty. Those employed full time with no health condition had 0. 82 times the odds of being in income poverty (95 % CI 0. 80 – 0. 84) compared with those employed full time with arthritis. Those not in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> with no chronic health conditions had 0. 36 times the odds of being in income poverty compared with those not in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> due to arthritis (95 % CI 0. 36 – 0. 37).

40|$|Nordic {{countries}} {{do not have}} the smallest health inequalities despite egalitarian social policies. A possible explanation for this is that drivers of class differences in health such as financial strain and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> remain socially patterned in Nordic countries.

The outcome was self-rated health in 5 categories. Stratified by gender we used fixed effects linear regression models and marginal standardisation to instigate how countries varied in the degree to which class inequalities were attenuated by financial strain and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status.</b> Before adjustment, Nordic countries had large inequalities in self-rated health relative to other European countries. For example the regression coefficient for the difference in health between working class and professional men living in Norway was 0. 34 (95 % CI 0. 26 to 0. 42), while the comparable figure for Spain was 0. 15 (95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 22). Adjusting for financial strain and <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> led to attenuation of health inequalities in all countries. However, unlike some countries such as Spain, where after adjustment the regression coefficient for working class men was only 0. 02 (95 % CI - 0. 05 to 0. 10), health inequalities persisted after adjustment for Nordic countries. For Norway the adjusted coefficient was 0. 17 (95 % CI 0. 10 to 0. 25). Results for women and men were similar. However, in comparison to men, class inequalities tended to be stronger for women and more persistent after adjustment.

The information in the survey allows identifying the number of children in the home (individuals aged 14 or younger) and the number of dependent elderly in the home (individuals aged 60 or older who are neither the head of the household nor the spouse). To limit the burden on respondents, the survey asks about educational attainment only in the June waves and up until 2008, asked about income in the March and June waves only.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the shape of}} the income–mortality association, before and after adjusting for confounding by other socioeconomic variables. Methods Poisson regression analyses were conducted on 11. 7 million years of follow-up of 25 – 59 year old New Zealand census respondents spanning four separate cohort studies (1981 – 1984, 1986 – 1989, 1991 – 1994, and 1996 – 1999). Results Mortality among low-income people was approximately two times that among high-income people. Adjustment for potential socioeconomic confounders (marital status, education, car access, and neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation) halved the strength of the income–mortality association, but did not appreciably change {{the shape of the}} association. Further adjustment for <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> largely removed the income–mortality association. The association of non-transformed income with mortality was non-linear, with a flattening out of the slope at higher incomes. Both the logarithm and rank of income appeared to have a better linear fit with the mortality rate, although the association of mortality with the logarithm of income flattened out notably at low incomes. Conclusions Much, but not all, of the crude association of income with mortality could be due to confounding. Adjusting income–mortality associations for <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> (also a proxy for health status) is problematic: on the one hand, it over-adjusts the association as poor health will be on the pathway from income to mortality; on the other hand, it appropriately adjusts for both confounding by <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> <b>status</b> and reverse causation whereby income changes as a result of poor health.
