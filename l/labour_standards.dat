40|$|Summary As {{multinational}} clothing {{corporations are}} increasingly pressured to improve severe working {{conditions at the}} supplier level, the suppliers in turn are facing an increasing load of requirements in addition to short lead times and competitive prices. Adhering to demands of a <b>labour</b> <b>standard</b> without additional support is thus a daunting task for suppliers. This paper explores local-level management motives for implementation of SA 8000 in Indian garment manufacturing. The impacts on business practices, in terms of obstacles and opportunities, are examined in a comparative case analysis, which demonstrates that suppliers need higher prices or long-term contracts to economically motivate implementation. However, a higher legal and social compliance may lead to business opportunities, such as decreased labour turnover and increased orders.

25|$|Some {{scholars}} suggest any labour {{by children}} aged 18 {{years or less}} is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries {{as well as the}} developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.|$|E
25|$|The ILO {{is a major}} {{provider}} of labour statistics. Labour statistics are an important tool for its member states to monitor their progress toward improving <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> As part of their statistical work, ILO maintains several databases. This database covers 11 major data series for over 200 countries. In addition, ILO publishes a number of compilations of labour statistics, such as the Key Indicators of Labour Markets (KILM). KILM covers 20 main indicators on labour participation rates, employment, unemployment, educational attainment, labour cost, and economic performance. Many of these indicators have been prepared by other organizations. For example, the Division of International Labour Comparisons of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics prepares the hourly compensation in manufacturing indicator.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, ILO {{helped lead}} the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182), which {{has so far been}} signed upon and {{domestically}} ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of international <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.|$|E
25|$|The ILO has {{considered}} {{the fight against}} forced labour {{to be one of}} its main priorities. During the interwar years, the issue was mainly considered a colonial phenomenon, and the ILO's concern was to establish minimum standards protecting the inhabitants of colonies from the worst abuses committed by economic interests. After 1945, the goal became to set a uniform and universal standard, determined by the higher awareness gained during World War II of politically and economically motivated systems of forced labour, but debates were hampered by the Cold War and by exemptions claimed by colonial powers. Since the 1960s, declarations of <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> as a component of human rights have been weakened by government of postcolonial countries claiming a need to exercise extraordinary powers over labour in their role as emergency regimes promoting rapid economic development.|$|E
25|$|There {{are plenty}} of causes {{that lead to the}} {{occurrence}} of this yet to be solved this global issue. Among them, globalisation is the main cause undeniably. Globalisation originally symbolises a worldwide trend that helps to balance the economy between developed and developing countries, however the unfair outsourcing attempts of manufacturing labour from rich to the poor countries have led to extreme poverty which is defined as living on less than US$1 a day. (Atal, 2015) Balko (2010) suggests that when the world markets are opened to free trade under globalisation, a phenomenon of “race to the bottom” happens. Sweatshop is an obvious example of such phenomenon. Without transnational guidelines and regulations, large corporations in developed countries are moving their manufacturing plants to the countries that are more vulnerable, such as with less environmental restrictions and lower <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> To meet the demands and compete for the patronage, factories in developing countries start to lower their labour regulations by providing minimum wages and ignoring workplace safety requirements. As a result, workers in developing countries face the hardship while the large corporations gain profit.|$|E

This committee reported back in February 1937, recommending the establishment of a Dominion publicity committee, and a trustee company for the purpose of publishing a party newsletter. Party Publications Ltd was thus created, and Waite was the first editor of The National News.

40|$|Labour market {{institutions}} are a crucial determinant of wage inequality, the wage share in aggregate income, and the unemployment rate. Since these variables affect, in turn, {{the distribution of}} income across households, the question arises of whether stronger labour market institutions {{have an impact on}} income inequality. Institutions can in principle have conflicting effects. For example, a higher unemployment benefit tends to increase the wage share, which in turn reduces inequality, but it also increases the unemployment rate thus making the distribution of income more unequal. This paper examines what is the overall impact of labour market institutions on household income inequality. The evidence indicates that stronger {{institutions are}} associated with lower income inequality, but in some cases also with higher rates of unemployment. We explore the magnitude of this trade-off, and quantify the changes in inequality and unemployment that we would observe if a common <b>labour</b> <b>standard</b> were imposed on members of the European Union.
