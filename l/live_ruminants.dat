40|$|Copper {{concentrations}} {{measured in}} liver are {{the gold standard}} for evaluating the copper status of ruminants. For <b>live</b> <b>ruminants,</b> measuring copper status is problematic because serum copper concentrations fluctuate and are not consistently correlated to liver copper values. In an attempt to establish an accurate evaluation of copper status from serum in caribou, we examined the correlation between liver copper concentrations and superoxide dismutase (SOD), which uses the oxidation and reduction reactions of a bound copper ion in order to catalyze superoxide radicals. Our study focuses on SOD activity in the serum of 16 individual adult female caribou and compares that to known copper levels within the liver. Determining copper levels in ruminants has proven difficult and currently a true proxy to determine liver copper levels in a live animal is unknown...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination against Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an {{essential}} tool for {{the control of the}} disease and for safe trade of <b>live</b> <b>ruminants</b> in accordance to OIE standards and EU legislation. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the safety of a BTV 1 modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine and its efficacy in protecting sheep against bluetongue infection. Moreover, in this study we performed a challenge trial with virulent strain BTV 2 in vaccinated sheep in order to verify evidence of crossprotection. The administration of BTV 1 MLV vaccine resulted to be safe, not causing in vaccinated animals significant clinical effects and haematological modifications, not showing any adverse effects in pregnant ewes if administered in the second half of gestation. However, titres and duration of viraemia recommend an awaiting period before shipment of vaccinated animals (60 days) to prevent the spread of the virus. Furthermore, this vaccine showed an appropriate balance between attenuation of virulence and ability to replicate in sheep. The antigenic stimulus provided by its replication elicits complete protection against challenge using a virulent homologous virus and does not cause any detectable viraemia in serologically positive vaccinated animals. In conclusion, the administration of BTV 1 MLV vaccine was safe, not causing particular drawbacks and effective, stimulating an adequate protection of animals in case of infection with wild strain of homologous serotype...|$|E

The vaccine produced via Vero cells, complies with all relevant norms set down by the Indian pharmacopeia. India has approximately 135.17 million goats; this vaccine could {{play a major role}} in controlling the disease and economic losses.By launching the PPR (Peste des Petits <b>Ruminants)</b> <b>Live</b> vaccines, the Company entered the animal vaccine business at an opportune moment as the Indian Government started its National Control Programme of PPR. Similar initiatives are been undertaken by the OIE and the FAO on a global basis. PPR is a fatal disease affecting sheep and goats. The vaccine produced via Vero cells and complies with relevant norms set down by the Indian pharmacopeia.|$|R
50|$|Unless factory farming, which entails in {{its most}} {{intensive}} form entirely trough-feeding, managed or unmanaged pasture is the main food source for ruminants. Pasture feeding dominates livestock farming where the land makes crop sowing and/or harvesting difficult, such as in arid or mountainous regions, where types of camel, goat, antelope, yak and other <b>ruminants</b> <b>live</b> which are well suited to the more hostile terrain and very rarely factory farmed. In more humid regions, pasture grazing is managed across a large global area for free range and organic farming. Certain types of pasture suit the diet, evolution and metabolism of particular animals, and their fertilising and tending of the land may over generations result in the pasture combined with the ruminants in question being integral to a particular ecosystem.|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{potential}} economic {{impacts of}} incorporating Romania into EU's Common Agricultural Policy. A CGE model of Romania is employed to model likely changes in trade, production and welfare patterns {{with a focus}} on fifteen local agro-food activities. Three main findings emerge. First, the adoption of the CAP expands agro-food output and trade, promotes higher farm incomes, and increases economic welfare. Second, CAP application results in production specialisation effects, particularly for sugar and sugar beet, bovine meat products, <b>ruminant</b> <b>live</b> animals, dairies, and cereal grains. Third, the identified impacts are driven by changes in trade-related measures, particularly enhanced access to EU markets, and less by alterations in production-related domestic support. The paper concludes that EU accession and CAP adoption may bring potentially realisable growth in Romania's agro-food sector, though in practice this will depend on producers' ability to respond to the supply incentives being offered...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ruminants</b> <b>live</b> {{in various}} parts of land. Similar cloven hooves assist {{ruminants}} in adapting to different ground environment during locomotion. This paper analyzes the general terrain adaptability of the feet of ruminants using kinematics of the equivalent mechanism model based on screw theory. Cloven hooves could adjust attitude by changing relative positions between two digits in swing phase. This function helps to choose better landing orientation. “Grasping” or “holding” a rock or other object on the ground passively provides extra adhesion force in stance phase. Ruminants could adjust the position of the metacarpophalangeal joint or metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP or MCP) with no relative motion between the tip of feet and the ground, which ensures the adhesion and dexterity in stance phase. These functions are derived from an example from chamois’ feet and several assumptions, which are believed to demonstrate the foundation of adaptation of ruminants and ensure a stable and continuous movement...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: From August 2009 to October 2010, International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research {{together}} investigated 14 {{outbreaks of}} anthrax which included 140 animal and 273 human cases in 14 anthrax-affected villages. Our investigation objectives were {{to explore the}} context in which these outbreaks occurred, including livestock rearing practices, human handling of sick and dead animals, and the anthrax vaccination program. Methods: Field anthropologists used qualitative data-collection tools, including 15 hours of unstructured observations, 11 key informant interviews, 32 open-ended interviews, and 6 group discussions in 5 anthrax-affected villages. Results: Each cattle owner in the affected communities raised a median of six ruminants on their household premises. The ruminants were often grazed in pastures and fed supplementary rice straw, green grass, water hyacinth, rice husk, wheat bran, and oil cake; lactating cows were given dicalcium phosphate. Cattle represented a major financial investment. Since Islamic law forbids eating animals that die from natural causes, when anthrax-infected cattle were moribund, farmers often slaughtered them on the household premises while they were still alive so that the meat could be eaten. Farmers ate the meat and sold it to neighbors. Skinners removed and sold the hides from discarded carcasses. Farmers discarded the carcasses and slaughtering waste into ditches, bodies of water, or open fields. Cattle in the affected communities did not receive routine anthrax vaccine due to low production, poor distribution, and limited staffing for vaccination. Conclusion: Slaughtering anthrax-infected animals and disposing of butchering waste and carcasses in environments where <b>ruminants</b> <b>live</b> and graze, combined with limited vaccination, provided a context that permitted repeated anthrax outbreaks in animals and humans. Because of strong financial incentives, slaughtering moribund animals and discarding carcasses and waste products will likely continue. Long-term vaccination coverage for at-risk animal populations may reduce anthrax infection...|$|R

Antibodies to pestivirus were found in 60 (18, 7 %) sheep, in 21 (6, 5 %) goats, in 8 (10, 8 %) alpacas and in 6 (14 %) llamas. The guanacos and vicunas did not have antibodies to pestivirus. Antibodies to herpesvirus were found in 8 (2, 5 %) sheep and in 62 (19, 3 %) goats. The alpacas, llamas, guanacos and vicunas did not antibodies to herpesvirus. From the seropositive animals to pestivirus, the sheep flocks were located in the Metropolitan Region and XII Region of Chile with 7, 1 % to 82, 1 % positive serum samples, with titres between I I to 1024, and 5 (22, 7 %) positive flocks; The goat flocks were located in the W Region and the Metropolitan Region with 6, 7 % to 100 % positive serum samples, with titers between 4 to 512, and 3 (13, 6 %) positive flocks. The alpacas and llamas flocks were located in the Metropolitan Region (where they <b>live</b> with other <b>ruminants).</b> Alpacas 10, 8 % serum samples from 2 flocks and 14 % serum sample of llamas from I flock, were positive, with titers between 32 to 2048. From the seropositive animals to herpesvirus, only one sheep flock was positive and it was located in VI Region of Chile with 28, 6 % positive serum samples, with titers between 2 to 5, 6; The goat flocks positive to herpesvirus were located in the IV Region and the Metropolitan Region with 4, 2 % to 66, 7 % positive serum samples, with titers between 2 to 45, and 14 (63, 6 %) positive flocks. The serum samples from guanacos and vicunas were obtained from their natural Regions, guanacos from the IV and XII Regions and vicunas. from the I Region. The findings of our study confirm that pestivirus infections of sheep, goats, alpacas and llamas and herpesvirus infections of sheep and goats occur in Chile. Financiamiento: FONDECYT 198119...|$|R
