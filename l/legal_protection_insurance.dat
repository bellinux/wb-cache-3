5000|$|Legal {{expenses}} insurance (LEI), {{also known}} as <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>insurance</b> (LPI) or simply legal insurance, {{is a type of}} insurance which covers policyholders against the potential costs of legal action brought by or against the policyholder. The concept originated around 1911 {{as a result of a}} fatal crash at the famous Le Mans race during which some spectators lost their lives and others were severely injured. When the victims or their families claimed damages from the insurers of the organizers, their claims were repudiated. They then all contributed to a pool which was used to fund collective action against the insurers. They were successful. This gave rise to the first LEI policy being developed in France. Not long after that, a motoring club in Germany called the [...] "Deutsche Automobil Schutz" [...] (DAS) increased membership contributions to create a similar pool to pay for the defence of its members charged with traffic related offences. Members of the general public then enquired about joining the scheme. That is when the idea of an insurance available to the general public became firmly established. At present, the DAS of Germany is still the largest legal expenses insurer in the world. It is estimated that they write approximately 50% of LEI business worldwide. Then follows ARAG, also a German insurer. It is estimated that they write approximately 30% of global business.|$|E

40|$|The term “Access to Justice” (AtJ) {{refers to}} the {{fundamental}} notion that all people – even disadvantaged groups of society – should enjoy effective legal/judicial protection, ultimately through the courts. Accordingly, the principal targets of the AtJ-movement’s criticism have been so called “Access Barriers”, i. e. different legal and/or practical obstacles that make it difficult, or even impossible, {{for the general public}} to turn to the courts in order to vindicate their rights. The most significant barrier is legal fees in general, and counsel fees in particular. In a vast number of cases, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has concluded that law – substantive as well as procedural – is a rather complicated matter, which is often unintelligible to the layperson. Consequently, many self-represented litigants are neither accorded effective access to court (AtC), nor a fair trial – simply because they lack the skills necessary to present their case properly and competently. Therefore, the right to counsel has gradually evolved into a fundamental human right – not just in criminal cases, but also under the civil head of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Before Swedish courts, the parties to a dispute are always free to hire an attorney to conduct their case. In this narrow sense, the “right to counsel” is unconditional under Swedish law – both before the general courts and the administrative courts. In practice, however, the right to be assisted by counsel is conditional, since hiring a lawyer is always associated with a cost. In this way, a right that is theoretically bestowed on all is de facto denied many by the realities of economics. Or as the saying goes: “Justice is open to all; like the Ritz Hotel. ” It is an undeniable fact that most litigants {{will not be able to}} obtain counsel, if counsel fees are not covered by a legal aid and/or <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>insurance</b> scheme, or at least reimbursed through cost shifting rules. Against this background, this thesis examines how counsel fees are handled before Swedish courts in relation to the imbricated notions of AtJ and AtC. More specifically, the thesis discusses (1) “party funding” (i. e. cost shifting), (2) “public funding” (i. e. legal aid) and (3) “third-party funding” (i. e. legal insurance), with a comparative perspective on the Swedish civil, criminal and administrative procedure. Since a right to counsel can be derived from Article 6 of the ECHR, Swedish law is also compared with the case law of the ECtHR. Lastly, the thesis criticises “simplification of procedure” as an unrealistic alternative to lawyer-conducted litigation, at least in court proceedings which are adversarial in structure. The thesis argues that all people are not guaranteed equal AtJ in Sweden and that Swedish law – in some respects – is not even in compliance with the standards set by the ECtHR. With regard to the general courts, it is argued that the rules concerning assignment of public defence counsel are constructed in a way that infringes the suspect’s fair trial rights under Article 6. Before administrative courts, moreover, it is argued that the absence of legal aid (as well as legal insurances), combined with a default application of the American (“no-way” fee shifting) rule give rise to Access Barriers, since most individual parties (usually “one shot litigants”) are forced to proceed pro se in disputes against highly skilled adversaries, viz. state and municipal agencies (“repeat player litigants”). In view of this asymmetry, it is asserted that self-represented litigants are not always guaranteed effective access to a court/a fair trial...|$|E

The role of school in concluding the bullying problem is by giving religious education, educational service appropriately to the skill, interest, and capability, Pancasila education and counseling to the students and alternative of solution by conducting elucidation to the students. In this final part of legal writing the author uttered some suggestions, i. e. it is better for the school to focus also on the studying and comprehension to the children on the bad impact of bullying has clear regulation on bullying/anti-bullying policy and teacher needs to be given competence to communicate for preventing/concluding bullying case...|$|R

40|$|The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940 bestows <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> on two North American eagle {{species in}} the United States of America. The Act was {{originally}} aimed at the <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of only one species: the Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the national symbol of the USA. Later the Act was amended to extend protection also to the Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos. The Bald Eagle was an Endangered Species, but the Golden Eagle was not formally listed as Endangered nationwide in the USA. One {{of the reasons for}} extending <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> to the Golden Eagle under the Act was to strengthen the <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of the Bald Eagle, because immature Bald Eagles were being misidentified as Golden Eagles and shot. Additional factors relating to Golden Eagle mortality also made <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of the Golden Eagle desirable. The danger that a rare and legally protected species can be misidentified and mistaken for a more common and unprotected species can therefore serve as a reason for bestowing <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> on the more common species as well. Other factors may also indicate that <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of the more common species is desirable, making the case more compelling. If this line of reasoning is applied in respect of South African birds of prey, a strong case can be made in favour of extending <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> under the national biodiversity legislation to more species than the small number of species currently enjoying such protection. Species that are listed as Vulnerable under South African national biodiversity legislation may be misidentified as species that are not subject to such protection.

40|$|The diploma thesis named Introducing quality {{standards}} {{for social and}} <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children {{from the point of}} view of social workers of the institution of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children enables an insight into the issue of how social workers of the institution of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children view the introduction of {{quality standards}} for social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children. The amendment of Act No. 359 / 1999 Coll., on social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children, has brought significant changes in the activity of institutions of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> (OSPOD / BSLPC), especially in the field of applying instruments of social work. The conditions for a quality performance of the contents of this responsible work are created by means of standardisation. Standardisation means determining obligatory procedures in the performance of particular management activities as well as minimum parameters for a quality performance thereof (Macela, 2012). The thesis is divided into several parts. The first chapter defines the basic terms of the subject in question. The thesis is devised theoretically and draws on relevant professional literature. It deals with the specifications of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children (SLPC), what kinds of principles of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children there are, the SLPC social workers, the conditions for the performance of the profession of SLPC social workers. Further, the chapter explains terms of quality, social work, the family and the child. It defines perception and which factors may influence perception. Appropriate attention is given to the legislation of quality standards for the institutions of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children, the content and objective of quality standards of the institutions of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children, the process of standardisation and the availability of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> and the conditions for the performance thereof. The second chapter determines the objective of the thesis and research questions. The third chapter characterises the set examined and the methodology of work chosen for this purpose, the techniques of collecting data, analysis of data and the realisation of the actual research, including the ethics of the research. The fourth chapter deals with the outcomes of the thesis. The main objective of the thesis was to identify how social workers perceive the introduction of quality standards for social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children. To achieve the objective of the thesis, I chose the strategy of the qualitative research, method of questioning and the technique of a semi-structured interview. The interviews were realised in the course of July 2016 in the research sample of ten staff members of the institution of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children who work at the position of a SLPC social worker in communities with extended powers, situated in the Region of South Bohemia. The communication partners were chosen by the method of purposive sampling. Based on the objective of the thesis two research questions were set up: Which factors influence the perception of social workers of the institution of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children within the introduction of quality standards for social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children? Which aspects of the introduction of quality standards for social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children are perceived by social workers of the institution of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children as positive or negative? As has emerged from the research, the changes resulting from the introduction of the standards that social workers of the institution of social and <b>legal</b> <b>protection</b> of children regarded as positive included the improvement in workplace equipment and setting a limit for the number of families that a social worker may work with at one time.
