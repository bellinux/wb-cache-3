The proton resonances were assigned from double resonance studies on <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and on its salts, homologs, isomers, and chemically modified derivatives. Studies of proton and carbon longitudinal relaxation time suggest that <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> exists as a monomer, whereas the sodium and barium salts exist as dimers in nonpolar solvents. A study {{of the magnitude of}} the vicinal proton coupling constants and the chemical shifts and linewidths of the hydroxyl resonances suggest that the backbone conformation and intramolecular hydrogen bonds are similar for <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and its <b>sodium</b> and barium salts in nonpolar solvents. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the role of bound solvent molecules suggest a tightly bound water molecule in the barium complex dimer (crystallized from water-ethanol) and a weakly bound ethanol molecule in the <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> monomer (crystallized from ethanol) in cyclohexane. The selective changes in proton chemical shift on complexation [where the polar faces of two lasalocid anions coordinate the metal cation(s) in nonpolar solvents have been analyzed in terms of the proximity of the resonances to the cation, their linkage to the coordinating oxygen atoms, and the magnetic anisotropy effects of the polar groups of one ligand on the resonances of its partner in the dimer. The nuclear magnetic resonance studies in solution are compared with earlier observations on <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and its salts in the crystalline state. Thus, the short Ag-C 5 distance in the crystal structure of silver complex dimer is also observed in the solution structure.

Three polyketide natural products, namely erythromycin <b>A,</b> <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A,</b> and iso-lasalocid A, were subjected to both CAD and EID, and their fragment ions were assigned with sub-part-per-million accuracy. The number of fragment ions detected through EID was much greater than for CAD, leading to a greater amount of structural information obtained for each polyketide, albeit with a decreased signal-to-noise ratio. The effect of different bound cations on the fragment pattern of the isomers <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and iso-lasalocid A was studied, with CAD and EID performed on the [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + Li]+, and [M + NH 4]+ precursor ions.

40|$|Large-scale {{in vitro}} {{screening}} {{of different types}} of ionophores previously pinpointed nine compounds that were very active and selective in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum; their in vitro and in vivo antimalarial effects were further studied. Addition of the ionophores to synchronized P. falciparum suspensions revealed that all P. falciparum stages were sensitive to the drugs. However, the schizont stages were three- to ninefold more sensitive, and 12 h was required for complete parasite clearance. Pretreatment of healthy erythrocytes with toxic doses of ionophores for 24 to 48 h showed that the activity was not due to an irreversible effect on the host erythrocyte. No preferential ionophore adsorption in infected or uninfected erythrocytes occurred. On the other hand, ionophore molecules strongly bound to serum proteins since increasing the serum concentration from 2 to 50 % led to almost a 25 -fold parallel increase in the ionophore 50 % inhibitory concentration. Mice infected with the malaria parasites Plasmodium vinckei petteri or Plasmodium chabaudi were successfully treated with eight ionophores in a 4 -day suppressive test. The 50 % effective dose after intraperitoneal administration ranged from 0. 4 to 4. 1 mg/kg of body weight, and the therapeutic indices were about 5 for all ionophores except monensin A methyl ether, 5 -bromo <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A,</b> and gramicidin D, whose therapeutic indices were 12, 18, and 344, respectively. These three compounds were found to be curative, with no recrudescence. Gramicidin D, which presented impressive antimalarial activity, requires parenteral administration, while 5 -bromo <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> has the major advantage of being active after oral administration.

The model was based on a cascade of nucleophilic ring closures of postulated polyepoxide substrates generated by stereospecific oxidation of all-trans polyene polyketide intermediates.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) is preferentially cytotoxic {{to cancer}} cells over normal cells.

Monensin (a polyether ionophore antibiotic that is widely used in veterinary medicine) and salinomycin (a compound that is structurally related to monensin and shows cancer stem cell-inhibiting activity) are currently recognized as anticancer drug candidates. In this study, we show that monensin effectively sensitizes various glioma cells, but not normal astrocytes, to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis; this occurs at least partly via monensin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, CHOP-mediated DR 5 upregulation and proteasome-mediated downregulation of c-FLIP.

Given the recent {{emergence}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{as a cause of}} bovine mastitis, new intramammary (IMA) treatments are urgently required. <b>Lasalocid,</b> <b>a</b> member of the polyether ionophore class of antimicrobial agents, has not been previously administered to cows by the IMA route and has favorable characteristics for development as a mastitis treatment. This study aimed to develop an IMA drug delivery system (IMDS) of lasalocid for the treatment of bovine mastitis. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined applying the procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Solid dispersions (SDs) of lasalocid were prepared and characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. IMDSs containing lasalocid of micronized, nano-sized, or as SD form were tested for their IMA safety in cows. Therapeutic efficacy of lasalocid IMDSs was tested in a bovine model involving experimental IMA challenge with the mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. Results: Lasalocid demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the major Gram-positive mastitis pathogens including S. aureus (MIC range 0. 5 – 8  µg/mL). The solubility test confirmed limited, ion-strength-dependent water solubility of <b>lasalocid.</b> <b>A</b> kinetic solubility study showed that SDs effectively enhanced water solubility of lasalocid (21 – 35 -fold). Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) -lasalocid SD caused minimum mammary irritation in treated cows and exhibited faster distribution in milk than either nano or microsized lasalocid. IMDSs with PVP-lasalocid SD provided effective treatment with a higher mastitis clinical and microbiological cure rate (66. 7 %) compared to cloxacillin (62. 5 %). Conclusion: Lasalocid SD IMDS provided high cure rates and effectiveness in treating bovine mastitis with acceptable safety in treated cows.
