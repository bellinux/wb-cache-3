This approach {{is based on}} a stump's detailed geometric model and provides a substitute to plaster cast obtained through the traditional manual methodology with a physical model, realized with Rapid Prototyping technologies; this physical model will be used for the socket lamination. The paper discusses a methodology to reconstruct a 3 D geometric model of the stump able to describe with high accuracy and detail the complete structure subdivided into bones, soft tissues,muscular masses and dermis. Some different technologies are used for stump acquisition: non contact laser technique for external geometry, CT and MRI imaging technologies for the internal structure, the first one dedicated to bones geometrical model, the last for soft tissues and muscles. We discuss problems related to 3 D geometric reconstruction: the patient and stump positioning for the different acquisitions, markers' definition on the stump to identify landmarks,alignment's strategies for the different digital models, in order to define a protocol procedure with a requested accuracy for socket's realization. Some case-studies illustrate the methodology and the results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Recent biomechanical {{studies have}} shown that an {{anatomic}} double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction is superior in restoring normal knee laxity compared with the conventional single-bundle isometric reconstruction. We describe a modification of an endoscopic PCL reconstruction technique using a double-bundle Y-shaped hamstring tendon graft. A double- or triple-bundle semitendinosus-gracilis tendon graft is used and directly fixed with soft threaded biodegradable interference screws. In the medial femoral condyle, 2 femoral tunnels are created inside-out through a low anterolateral arthroscopic portal. First, in 80 ° of flexion, the double-stranded gracilis graft is fixed with an interference screw inside the <b>lower</b> femoral <b>socket,</b> representing the insertion site of the posteromedial bundle. In full extension the combined semitendinosus-gracilis graft is pretensioned and fixed inside the posterior aspect of the single tibial tunnel. The double- or triple-stranded semitendinosus tendon is inserted in the higher femoral tunnel, presenting the insertion site of the anterolateral bundle. Finally, pretension is applied to the semitendinosus bundle in 70 ° of flexion and a third screw is inserted. Using this technique, the stronger semitendinosus part of the double-bundle graft, which mimics the anterolateral bundle of the PCL, is fixed in flexion, whereas the smaller gracilis tendon part (posteromedial bundle) is fixed in full extension.

Three specimens were wrapped with Plaster of Paris (POP) and the other three with commercially available silicone interface liner. Data was obtained by utilising MRI technology and then the segmented images compared to corresponding calliper measurement, photographic imaging, and water suspension techniques. The MRI measurement results were strongly correlated with actual diameter, surface area, and volume measurements. The results show that the selected scanning parameters and the semiautomatic segmentation method are adequate enough, considering the limit of clinical meaningful shape and volume fluctuation, for residual limb volume and the cross-sectional surface area measurements...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} a new surgical technique using fascia lata to deepen the shallow inferior conjunctival fornix in contracted socket and anophthalmic socket syndrome. Methods. A prospective controlled {{study in which}} 24 sockets of 24 patients who were unable to wear and retain their ocular prosthesis due to shallow inferior fornix were enrolled and categorized into anophthalmic socket syndromes (9 patients) and contracted sockets (15 patients). Another 24 patients who underwent evisceration or enucleation with healthy sockets and can wear and retain their prosthesis comfortably were chosen as a control group. Deepening of the fornix was performed using fascia lata strips under general anesthesia. Central depth of the inferior fornix was measured preoperatively and postoperatively. Results. A statistically significant improvement of the postoperative central inferior fornix depth was reported which was marked in anophthalmic subgroup. 100 % of anophthalmic sockets and 93. 3 % of contracted sockets achieved satisfactory results during the follow-up period with no postoperative lower eyelid malposition or obvious skin scar.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of pressure sores and related skin problems due to extrinsic {{factors such as}} pressure, shear, friction and moisture at the residual limb-socket and limb-orthosis interface is often debilitating and time-consuming for both patient and practitioner. Aside from this medical challenge, the economic costs borne with the associated time off work or work disability, add to the already strained psychosocial challenges placed on both the patient and family. The biomechanics of the coupling between the musculoskeletal residual limb and the <b>lower</b> limb prosthetic <b>socket</b> {{is an important factor}} for socket fit (1). Socket fabrication and fit is a highly refined process relying on the Prosthetists skill and experience. It refers to achieving proper biomechanical alignment and load transfer while providing user support, comfort, safe suspension and aesthetics (1, 2). Despite major technology improvements to lower limb prosthetic components, socket fit still remains a key issue, especially since the residual limb soft tissues are not suited for loading (3, 4). As a result of pressure, shear forces, friction and pistoning, amputees often experience skin breakdown near bony prominences such as over the anterior tibial surface or near the fibular head. Residual limb skin problems typically include discomfort, pain, sweat pooling, edema, contact dermatitis, blisters, cysts, verrucous hyperplasia, pressure ulceration an...|$|R
40|$|Object of {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} is a socketed axe (‘celt’) which is a stray find from {{the region of the}} village Knizhovnik, south of Haskovo. As reported by D. Aladzhov there is an Early Iron Age settlement in this area. The artefact belongs to type Varbitsa T 1 A after the typology of <b>Lower</b> Danubian <b>socketed</b> axes offered by V. Dergachev. This type is common for the central parts of Northern Bulgaria, west of the Yantra River. That kind of ‘celt’ is predominantly found in hoards of the HaA-HaB period. The stray find from the region of Haskovo is among the smallest tools of this type and probably dates to the X-IX century BC or {{the first phase of the}} Early Iron Age in Bulgaria. It is important to take into consideration that it is the only representative of type Varbitsa T 1 A south of the Balkan mountains. However, the moulds for production of this type of socketed axes are from South Bulgaria. The chemical composition of the ‘celt’ (As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, and Zn) has been determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The artefact is made of tin bronze with 93, 15 % copper and 3, 3 % tin. Such concentration of tin is common for archaeological bronze finds, it lowers the melting point of the alloy and improves its malleability, hardness and tensile strength. The quantity of antimony is 1, 6 % which is an evidence that the element was deliberately added to increase the hardness of the metal. The concentrations of trace elements such as zinc, nickel, lead, iron, arsenic, phosphorus, manganese and selenium are so low that it could not be suggested that they have been intentionally included in the alloy. In general, ‘celts’ are usually made of tin bronze in bivalve stone moulds. A socketed axe from Northeast Bulgaria was examined by the methods of metallography. The revealed production technique is casting which was followed by a cycle or cycles of cold hammering and annealing with annealing as final operation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lower</b> limb {{prosthetic}} <b>socket</b> {{provides the}} interface {{for the transfer}} of loads between {{the ground and the}} stump. During daily physical activities, the stump has to endure mechanical stresses in normal (pressure) and tangential (shear) directions to the stump/socket interface, both of which may cause discomfort, pain, and a host of stump health problems. Despite the importance of the issues, there is currently no clinically-friendly sensor technology available to monitor both pressure and shear at the stump/socket interface. In this thesis, two sensor systems were developed - both capable of simultaneously measuring dynamic pressure and shear at the lower limb stump/socket interface. In particular, two thin, capacitive sensors based on flexible elastomers (3 D-printed and silicone) were designed and fabricated. To acquire sensor signals, appropriate data acquisition circuitries and PC software were produced. A viscoelastic model for real-time processing of the sensor signals was developed, to improve their dynamic response. The sensor systems were characterised in research lab settings, and their performance was verified against comprehensive design requirements. The characterised sensor systems were validated at the stump/socket interface in a series of amputee walking tests, and a range of clinical factors were investigated. Pressure and shear were measured at up to three discrete locations of a trans-femoral stump. Their temporal profiles when walking on level and inclined surfaces were obtained. The results suggest that ankle flexion resistance may have an effect on both the magnitudes and the temporal profiles of pressure and shear at the stump/socket interface. The thesis delivers a tool for measuring pressure and shear at the stump/socket interface in a clinically-friendly manner. What is more, it contributes to the prosthetic field by bringing an insight into the pressure and shear at the trans-femoral stump/socket interface, thus enhancing the understanding of its biomechanics. In the future such a sensor technology could potentially aid daily monitoring of socket fit, assist prosthetists with socket fitting, support research on the stump/socket interface biomechanics, etc. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) still poses {{an enigma}} for clinicians and {{researchers}} alike, with a pathogenesis {{that is still}} shrouded in mystery. MRONJ is known to occur in patients taking oral or intravenous bisphosphonates following an invasive dental procedure of the bone yet, can also present rarely without any obvious inciting trauma. At present, there is no accepted preventative intervention of the the condition however, a variety of novel methods have been proposed ranging {{from the use of}} recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) to the use of platelet rich fibrin (PRF) once MRONJ occurs. Currently, clinicians rely on prevention of the condition which revolves around identification of at-risk patients and minimization of exodontia or traumatic dental procedures involving bone after the commencement of bisphosphonate therapy. If MRONJ occurs, treatment is then dictated by the degree of bone exposure and spread to adjacent structures, through the use of antibiotics, antimicrobial mouthrinses or finally, surgery. 1 This study evaluated the efficacy of a novel polyethylene glycol-heparin hydrogel 2 (starPEG-heparin) incorporating arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) coupled with rhBMP- 2 for the prevention of MRONJ development at the time of dentoalveolar surgery. Twenty-four (24) skeletally mature rats were divided into three equal groups (n= 8) receiving two doses of intravenous zoledronic acid (0. 1 mg/Kg) at weeks two and five of the housing period prior to surgery. In all animals, the right first molar of the mandible was extracted and the gingiva sutured close using 6 / 0 prolene. Group 1 animals had the sockets left empty following extraction, while those in group 2 had starPEG-heparin/RGD hydrogel (15 μL) without rhBMP- 2 placed into the extraction socket. Animals in group 3 had starPEG-heparin /RGD hydrogel (15 μL) with rhBMP- 2 (5 μg) placed in the extraction socket. Eight weeks after surgery specimens containing the right <b>lower</b> mandibular <b>socket</b> and contralateral equivalent were harvested and analyzed. Levels of c-terminal telopeptide (CTX) from serum taken periodically from the animals were evaluated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). This demonstrated a linear downward trend in the bone turnover from week 1 to the final week of housing confirming the efficacy of the administered zoledronic acid. μCT analysis of samples showed a greater degree of bone formation in group 3 and the least bone formation in Group 1, as expected (P < 0. 05). Histological analysis of samples using H&E staining from group 1 displayed empty lacunae, or areas of karyorrhexis and pyknosis in the bone surrounding the extraction socket, consistent with MRONJ. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase staining displayed an increase in osteoclastic action in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (P < 0. 05). Although, increased angiogenesis was seen in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 throughout all the angiogenesis markers (anti-CD 31, anti-CD 34, anti-Von Willebrands Factor), these results were not significant. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of samples confirmed increased osteocyte density surrounding the extraction socket in groups 2 and 3 compared to group 1 (P < 0. 05). These results indicate that the use of a starPEG-heparin/RGD hydrogel combined with rhBMP- 2 can stimulate increased osteoclastic action, localized angiogenesis and increased bone healing compared to both hydrogel-alone, or no intervention in a MRONJ rat animal model. Further work is required to evaluate if this novel intervention is translatable to an animal model with bone biology more similar to the human species...|$|R
