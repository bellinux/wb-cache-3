25|$|Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) {{may be used}} {{to treat}} open-angle glaucoma, but this is a {{temporary}} solution, not a cure. A 50-μm argon <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{microphones}} {{are often}} portrayed in movies as spy gadgets, {{because they can}} be used to pick up sound at a distance from the microphone equipment. A laser beam is aimed at the surface of a window or other plane surface that is affected by sound. The vibrations of this surface change the angle at which the beam is reflected, and the motion of the <b>laser</b> <b>spot</b> from the returning beam is detected and converted to an audio signal.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of PCI over ultrasound biometry {{is that the}} axial length measurement is performed through the visual axis since the patient is asked to fixate into the <b>laser</b> <b>spot.</b> In highly myopic or staphylomatous eyes, this can be particularly advantageous since it can sometimes be difficult to measure the true axial length through the visual axis with an ultrasound probe. PCI is also superior to ultrasound in the measurement of pseudophakic and silicone oil-filled eyes. For optical biometry, {{it is not as}} critical how the media change because the correction factor that must be applied is much smaller than in ultrasound biometry. It {{should be noted that the}} axial length obtained from PCI may be slightly longer than that obtained from ultrasound. This is due to PCI measuring the distance from the corneal surface to the RPE while ultrasound measures to the anterior retinal surface. Therefore, many IOL measurement machines require refined IOL constants unique to their mechanism.|$|E

This research was conducted using a solid state pulsed Nd:YAG laser machine with a 3 -axis motion controller to generate MEMS structure on PMMA. The MEMS structure generated on PMMA includes laser lines and <b>laser</b> <b>spots.</b> The effects of various laser parameters on the PMMA specimen were studied and measured under optical microscope before transferring the data to STATISTICA software for analysis. From the results, the feasible laser parameter combinations can be determined to generate the smallest possible micro feature on PMMA. Pulse energy and cutting speed from the process parameters show significant response to the line width for generation of laser lines geometry. As for the generation of <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> geometry, pulse width from the process parameters significantly affects the diameter length of the spots. The usage of assist gas has generally decreases the <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> diameter for generation of both micro-holes and line width for generation of micro-lines but it also causes inconsistency to the cutting quality of the laser machine. The feasible parameters for structuring laser lines (micro-channels) geometry without assist gas {{are found to be}} in the range of 40 – 90 mm/min for traverse speed and 0. 01 - 0. 02 J for pulse energy. On the other hand, the feasible parameters for laser lines geometry with assist gas are found to in the range of 80 - 120 mm/min for traverse speed and 0. 01 – 0. 02 J for pulse energy. As for structuring <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> (micro-holes), the feasible parameters for generating <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> geometry without assist gas are found to be in the range of 18 – 26 % for pulse height and 0. 15 – 0. 21 ms for pulse width.

To ex-pand the film application, formation of oxygen {{deficiencies in the}} film {{was one of the}} useful meth-ods. Electrical resistance of the film can be decreased due to oxygen deficiencies formation. The lo-cal heating process in vacuum is a useful method to create the oxygen deficiencies in local area of the film. Electrical resistance might be locally decreased by local heating with a CW fiber laser. In our experiment, the films were irradiated with the laser in vacuum. Control of temperature on the film was very important for reducing the electrical resistance. Therefore, temperature monitoring of the <b>laser</b> focusing <b>spot</b> area on the film was performed. Temperature of the <b>laser</b> focusing <b>spot</b> area was increased as the laser intensity was increased. Then, the electrical resistance of the <b>laser</b> focus-ing <b>spot</b> area was decreased as the laser intensity was increased. Thus, electrical resistance of the la-ser focusing spot area was decreased as temperature of the <b>laser</b> focusing <b>spot</b> area was increased.

40|$|BACKGROUND: As the murine {{model of}} laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is {{becoming}} the most established and commonly utilized model worldwide for studying the pathogenesis of CNV and its response to treatment, specific operating standards are yet to be clarified. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare the lesion size of CNV in mice with different ages, sex, durations of CNV process, and treated positions of <b>laser</b> <b>spots,</b> to make recommendations that may improve and optimize the quality of the model. METHODS AND RESULTS: C 57 /BL 6 mice of different ages were treated with diode laser photocoagulation per eye and perfused with PBS containing fluorescein-labeled dextran at different time of observation. Choroid flat mounts, were then examined by fluorescence microscopy for the measurement of CNV area. Messenger-RNA expression levels of several angiogenic cytokines in eye cups of male and female C 57 BL/ 6 mice at 5 - 8 and 16 - 20 week-old were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assay. The results showed significantly more CNV area in eyes of female mice compared to male mice with the expression level of several angiogenic cytokines elevated. 16 - 20 -week-old female mice developed the biggest area of CNV. The mean area of CNV increased significantly at the 14 th day after photocoagulation. <b>Laser</b> <b>spots</b> delivered 1 PD away from the optic disc induced the biggest area of CNV compared to those 2 PD or 3 PD away. Interaction of NV was observed in <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> delivered less than 1 PD away from each other. CONCLUSION: The current results suggest that 16 - 20 -week-old female C 57 BL/ 6 mice developed the most distinct CNV lesion size with <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> delivered 1 PD away from the optic disc. The best time to observe and analyze is the 14 th day after photocoagulation...|$|R

40|$|Using a KrF pulsed excimer laser, various interrelated {{deposition}} parameters {{governing the}} quality of laser-ablated Y 1 Ba 2 Cu 3 O 1 -delta(123) thin films have been systematically studied.

Small <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> exposing a relatively large diameter annular track of the rotating target have been found to give better plume stability than larger spots exposing the same diameter track.

40|$|A laser-ultrasonic method {{based on}} the {{shadowing}} effect is used for sizing and locating surface-breaking tight cracks in metals.

The <b>laser</b> <b>spots</b> are scanned along the same line across the path of cracks on the cracking surface or opposite surface. The amplitude of the longitudinal or shear waves specularly reflected from the backwall is extracted from each signal to construct an amplitude profile. In the presence of a crack, the profile shows regions of reduced amplitude due to shadowing of the direct or reflected beam from the backwall. The sharp amplitude drop and the gentle signal recovery observed are well predicted by a model of crack tip diffraction. The crack depth can be simply determined by considering the immediate vicinity of the amplitude drop.

Methods: Focal laser treatment of diabetic macular edema in 54 consecutive patients was digitally planned on fundus images and performed using the navigated laser photocoagulation system Navilas&reg; (OD-OS GmbH, Teltow, Germany). Treatment-related pain was quantified on a visual analog scale directly after treatment and compared with a matched control group who received conventional laser treatment (n = 46).
