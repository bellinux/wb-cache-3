30|$|Proof. Since f fl ips an edge, {{there must}} be at least one loop in the Markov graph that has length 1 and has {{negative}} orientation. Since Trace(M (f)) = e - v, {{there must be}} at least e - v + 1 <b>loops</b> of <b>length</b> 1 that have positive orientation. By going around each of these loops in the Markov graph twice we can see that there {{must be at least}} e - v + 2 <b>loops</b> of <b>length</b> 2 that have positive orientation. Since Trace(M (f) 2) = e - v, there must be at least one <b>loop</b> of <b>length</b> 2 with negative orientation. Since it has negative orientation, it cannot be the repetition of a shorter loop. So the Markov graph of f has a non-repetitive <b>loop</b> of <b>length</b> 2 with negative orientation.|$|R

Knittability can be achieved when less stress is applied on the knitting machine parts by the knitting yarns. This paper presents a novel measuring system for the knitting force needed to perform knitting yarns on flat knitting machine based on data acquisition system (DAS). The proposed system is used to measure the knitting force at different machine settings and different properties of the knitting yarns to determine the optimal production conditions. For this reason, three types of knitted fabric structures (single jersey, Rib 1 × 1, and full cardigan) with three different <b>loop</b> <b>lengths</b> and five different twists of ply yarn were produced. The obtained results showed the optimal yarn ply twist factor (αe) which gave minimum knitting force (less stress on needles or knitting yarns) at different <b>loop</b> <b>lengths</b> for each structure...|$|R
40|$|The X-ray light {{curves of}} pre-main {{sequence}} stars can show {{variability in the}} form of flares altering a baseline characteristic activity level; the largest X-ray flares are characterized by a rapid rise to more than 10 times the characteristic count rate, followed by a slower quasi-exponential decay. Analysis of these high-contrast X-ray flares enables the study of the innermost magnetic fields of pre-main sequence stars. We have scanned the ANCHORS database of Chandra observations of star-forming regions to extend the study of flare events on pre-main sequence stars both in sky coverage and in volume. We developed a sample of 30 high-contrast flares out of the 14, 000 stars of various ages and masses available in ANCHORS at the start of our study. Applying methods of time-resolved spectral analysis, we obtain the temperatures, confining magnetic field strengths, and <b>loop</b> <b>lengths</b> of these bright, energetic flares. The results of the flare analysis are compared to the 2 MASS and Spitzer data available for the stars in our sample. We find that the longest flare <b>loop</b> <b>lengths</b> (of order several stellar radii) are only seen on stars whose IR data indicates the presence of disks. This suggests that the longest flares may stretch {{all the way to the}} disk. Such long flares tend to be more tenuous than the other large flares studied.

The start-up of ADSL was very slow due to overpriced plans (~€350 per month for 1024/256 kbit). At the beginning of 2004, local loop unbundling began, and alternative operators started to offer ADSL (and also SDSL). This, and later privatisation of Cesky Telecom, helped to drive down prices. On July 1, 2006, Český Telecom was renamed to Telefónica O2 Czech Republic. As of 2009, ADSL2+ was offered in three variants, mostly without data limits (Fair User Policy - limiting link speed based on amount of transferred data).
