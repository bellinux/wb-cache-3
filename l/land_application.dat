25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{is the process}} of removing contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage. It includes physical, chemical, and biological processes to remove these contaminants and produce environmentally safer treated wastewater (or treated effluent). A by-product of sewage {{treatment is}} usually a semi-solid waste or slurry, called sewage sludge, that has to undergo further treatment before being suitable for disposal or <b>land</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{concerns}} over external costs exist as well. In the United States, dental amalgam {{is the largest}} source of mercury received by sewage treatment plants. The mercury contaminates the treatment plant sludge, which is typically disposed of by <b>land</b> <b>application,</b> landfilling or incineration. Several states, including New Jersey, New York, and Michigan, have required the installation of dental amalgam separators prior to 2017. EPA promulgated an effluent guidelines regulation in 2017 which prohibits most dental practices from disposing amalgam waste down the drain. Most dental offices nationwide are now required to use amalgam separators.|$|E

25|$|Early {{techniques}} involved <b>land</b> <b>application</b> {{of sewage}} on agricultural land. The {{use of the}} land treatment systems continued into the nineteenth/twentieth century in central Europe, USA, and other locations all over the world, but not without causing serious public health concerns and negative environmental impacts. During 1840s and 1850s, this practice resulted in disastrous spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid. However, when the water supply links with these diseases became clear, engineering solutions were implemented that include the development of alternative water sources using reservoirs and aqueduct systems, relocation of water intakes, and water and wastewater treatment systems.|$|E
2500|$|Wastewater reuse is {{an ancient}} practice, which has been applied {{since the dawn of}} human history, and is {{connected}} to the development of sanitation provision.

This sewage sludge is usually mixed with primary sludge from the primary clarifiers and undergoes further sludge treatment for example by anaerobic digestion, followed by thickening, dewatering, composting and <b>land</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{solubility}} of most PPCPs, aquatic organisms are especially vulnerable to their effects. [...] Researchers have found that a class of antidepressants {{may be found in}} frogs and can significantly slow their development. [...] The increased presence of estrogen and other synthetic hormones in waste water due to birth control and hormonal therapies has been linked to increased feminization of exposed fish and other aquatic organisms. The chemicals within these PPCP products could either affect the feminization or masculinization of different fishes, therefore affecting their reproductive rates. In addition to being found only in waterways, the ingredients of some PPCPs can also be found in the soil. Since some of these substances take a long time or cannot be degraded biologically, they make their way up the food chain. Information pertaining to the transport and fate of these hormones and their metabolites in dairy waste disposal is still being investigated, yet research suggest that the <b>land</b> <b>application</b> of solid wastes is likely linked with more hormone contamination problems. Not only does the pollution from PPCPs affect marine ecosystems, but also those habitats that depend on this polluted water.|$|E

Vaquero Lake and Canyon Lake lie within Mackenzie Park and at Vaquero Lake, Blackwater Draw and Yellowhouse Draw converge.
