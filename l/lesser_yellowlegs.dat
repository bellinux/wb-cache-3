40|$|This dataset {{presents}} a Common Gull (Mew Gull, Larus canus, Taxonomic Serial Number TSN 176832) survey data set for urban areas and stripmall parking lots (app. 300 mx 600 m), super markets, fast food restaurants, gravel pits, small ponds and the riverside (Chena) in Fairbanks, interior Alaska located app. 120 {{miles south of}} the arctic circle. We did 50 geo-referenced point surveys and detections in a rapid assessment fashion. Some opportunistic data were also taken when cruising. Gull data included presence/absenc. Data were geo-referenced with a GPS in decimal degrees (latitude and longitude, geographic datum of WGS 84) collected in early breeding season, 12 th of May in 2015 on a Tuesday (regular shopping and business times in the U. S.) between 7 AM and 7 PM by driving opportunistically on public strip mall parking lots, domestic areas and other locations of relevance for gull presences and absences in the survey area (app. 200 m radius). Other species were also recorded but received less attention. These non-intrusive citizen science car-based surveys result into a virtually unbiased data providing a representative snap shot in space and time for the study area. Stripmall parking lots near rivers and (gravel) lakes represent a typical situation of where Common Gulls are found in an urban habitat during breeding season. We reported basic gull behaviour also. Some other bird species were recorded as well but not in great detail, e. g. American Wigeon, Pigeon, White-crowned Sparrow, Swallow sp, Shorebirds sp, Mallard, <b>Lesser</b> <b>Yellowleg,</b> American Robin, Common Raven, Grassland birds, Northern Shoveler, Grebe sp., and Dark-eyed Junco. Noteworthy are the very high raven and gull numbers at the city garbage dump. The gull abundance seems to be driven by food items on the parking lot, e. g. provided by an adjacent fast food restaurant and by wetland areas nearby (e. g. Chena river and gravel pits) where the gulls find good conditions for nearby nesting. Gulls seem to be quite colonial. This survey is unique and contributes to multi-year baseline information relevant for gulls, ravens, urban subsidized predators (e. g. raptors) in the interior of Alaska. They are a simple but powerful snapshots in time and space and when put into an overall ecological context, e. g. as done with Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis.

40|$|We {{measured}} resting and peak metabolic rates (RMR and PMR, respectively) during {{development of}} chicks of seven species of shorebirds: least sandpiper (Calidris minutilla; adult mass 20 22 g), dunlin (Calidris alpina; 56 - 62 g), <b>lesser</b> <b>yellowlegs</b> (Tringa flavipes; 88 - 92 g), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus; 85 - 112 g), {{lesser golden plover}} (Pluvialis dominicana; 150 - 156 g), Hudsonian godwit (Limosa haemastica; 205 - 274 g), and whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus; 380 g). We tested two opposing hypotheses: the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, which posits that growth rate in chicks is inversely related to functional maturity of tissues, and the fast growth rate-high metabolism hypothesis, which suggests that rapid growth is possible only with a concomitant increase in either RMR or PMR. We have {{found no evidence that}} chicks of shorebirds with fast growth rates have lower RMRs or lower PMRs, as would be predicted by the growth rate-maturity hypothesis, but our data suggested that faster-growing chest muscles resulted in increased thermogenic capacity, consistent with the fast growth-high metabolism hypothesis. The development of homeothermy in smaller species is a consequence primarily of greater metabolic intensities of heat-generating tissues. The maximum temperature gradient between a chick's body and environment that can be maintained {{in the absence of a}} net radiative load increased rapidly with body mass during development and was highest in least sandpipers and lowest among godwits.

40|$|Populations of many shorebird species {{appear to}} be declining in North America, and food {{resources}} at stopover habitats may limit migratory bird populations. We investigated body condition of, and foraging habitat and diet selection by 4 species of shorebirds in the central Illinois River valley during fall migrations 2007 and 2008 (Killdeer [Charadrius vociferus], Least Sandpiper [Calidris minutilla], Pectoral Sandpiper [Calidris melanotos], and <b>Lesser</b> <b>Yellowlegs</b> [Tringa flavipes]). All species except Killdeer were in good to excellent condition, based on size-corrected body mass and fat scores. Shorebird diets were dominated by invertebrate taxa from Orders Diptera and Coleoptera. Additionally, Isopoda, Hemiptera, Hirudinea, Nematoda, and Cyprinodontiformes contribution to diets varied by shorebird species and year. We evaluated diet and foraging habitat selection by comparing aggregate percent dry mass of food items in shorebird diets and core samples from foraging substrates. Invertebrate abundances at shorebird collection sites and random sites were generally similar, indicating that birds did not select foraging patches within wetlands based on invertebrate abundance. Conversely, we found considerable evidence for selection of some diet items within particular foraging sites, and consistent avoidance of Oligochaeta. We suspect the diet selectivity we observed was a function of overall invertebrate biomass (51. 2 ± 4. 4 [SE] kg/ha; dry mass) at our study sites, which was greater than estimates reported in most other food selection studies. Diet selectivity in shorebirds may follow tenants of optimal foraging theory; that is, at low food abundances shorebirds forage opportunistically, with the likelihood of selectivity increasing as food availability increases. Nonetheless, relationships between the abundance, availability, and consumption of Oligochaetes for and by waterbirds should {{be the focus of}} future research, because estimates of foraging carrying capacity would need to be revised downward if Oligochaetes are truly avoided or unavailable for consumption...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Between spring 1976 {{and fall}} 1980 we studied the occurrence, abundance, and habitat use of birds over a 2000 -km 2 segment ofthe northcentral Alaska Peninsula. During this period {{observers}} were present 473 days and obtained records for all seasons. A total of 125 species was recorded; 63 % (79 of 125) were water-associated. The breeding avifauna {{was found to}} be a mixture of Panboreal (49 %), North her ican (34 %), and Aleutican (17 %) species. The Aleutican group was dominant in terms of biomass and numbers of individuals during the nonbreeding period. Forty-two species were confirmed breeding in the area and another 19 were suspected of breeding. The majority of birds occurred as migrants; 14 species were considered permanent residents and an additional 20 were winter residents. Our observations extended the known Alaska breeding distribution of American wigeon (Anus urnericana), black turnstone (Arenuriu melanocephalu), northern phalarope (Phuluropus loburus), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), western sandpiper (Culidris mauri), dunlin (C. alpinu), horned puffin (Fraterculu corniculara), tufted puffin (Lundu cirrhura), and orange-crowned warbler (Vermivoru celura). Our observations also extended the known postbreeding range or significantly changed the known status of bar-tailed godwit (Limosu lupponicu), whimbrel (Numenius phueopus), <b>lesser</b> <b>yellowlegs</b> (TringaJavipes), long-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus solopuceus), dunlin (Culidris alpinu), marbled murrelet (Bruchyrumphus marmorurus), American robin (Turdus migrutorius), yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroicu coronuru), and dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemulis). The area is a principal late summer and fall molting and staging area for several species of arctic and subarctic nesting waders and seaducks and emperor geese (Anser cunagica).
