Megaw LJ, in 1970, preferred the use of the classic categorising into condition or warranty due to legal certainty.

A special assessment levy enjoys a <b>legal</b> <b>benefit</b> known as a [...] "presumption of validity." [...] This means that it is much harder and usually, much more expensive to appeal than the ad valorem property tax most citizens are familiar with. This happens because {{it is difficult for}} the ordinary citizen to recognize that an error in the special assessment procedure or methodology has occurred and the resources a taxpayer must use to fight a special assessment levy are more expansive and costly than resources to fight an improper ad valorem tax on their real estate.|$|E

On the one hand, the forest provides economical growth, but it also brings the natural demage (environmental ecosystem) on the other hand. The legal norms become a border and a sign of legal subject flexibility at once for forest exploitation. According to Gustav Radburch, the purposes of law are fairness, certainty and usefulness; it will become the hope to create environmental management which has environmentally sound based on Law No. 32 of 2009 on the Protection and Environmental Management. This article uses a normative legal research based on legal system components including the structure, substance and legal culture. There are some rights and obligations in environmental management; the right to live in healty and good environment, and obligation to keep the environment as well as possible. Justice in environmental management can be actualized if rights and obligations are run inequilibrium.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of fabricated or exaggerated organic deficits {{is a frequent}} concern in both civil and criminal forensic cases. Additionally, organic deficits may exist, but be incorrectly attributed to a claimed cause. Exaggeration or fabrication can apply to primary cognitive or emotional effects of brain damage or to secondary emotional effects. These categories of deficits, {{and their relationship to}} physical brain damage, must be clearly understood in order to comprehensively evaluate the {{possibility of}} malingering. This includes evaluation of different forms of consistency between (1) behaviors during evaluation, (2) claimed deficits and known organic syndromes, (3) behavior or claims during evaluation and actual life-functioning, and (4) test perform-ance and known principles of cognitive functioning. Psychometric procedures and clinical strategies are described which can substantially aid in assessing consist-ency and distinguishing between honest and exaggerated self-reports. Limitations of available assessment techniques are described and a general decision model for evaluation of dissimulation of organic deficits is presented. The two characteristics which most crit-ically distinguish forensic assessments from standard clinical practice are the tailoring of investigatory procedures to legal criteria and the primacy of the con-sideration of malingering or exaggera-tion. In both civil and criminal areas, the presentation of being disordered can be of <b>legal</b> <b>benefit,</b> as in exculpation for a criminal offense through the defense of insanity, or through the acquisition of monetary benefits in claims of personal injury or malpractice.

40|$|It is {{not often}} that a {{judgment}} contains a reference to Aristotle’s work or a coda at its conclusion. The recent Singapore Court of Appeal judgment of Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter (delivered by Andrew Phang JA) contained both, the latter of which an extensive judicial exposition on the difficulties (and tentative solutions) relating to the contractual doctrine of consideration. This re-evaluation of consideration at the slightest opportunity is unsurprising, given the conceptual problems that have afflicted the doctrine. There have been various judicial solutions, generally capable of classification into two distinct types: first, through an internal re-definition of concepts within consideration (for example, the equation of factual and <b>legal</b> <b>benefit</b> or detriment in Williams v Roffey Bros 2 ̆ 6 Nicholls (Constructors) Ltd); second, {{through the application of}} an external doctrine in conjunction with or in replacement of consideration (for example, the arguable substitution of promissory estoppel for consideration in Collier v P 2 ̆ 6 MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd). For convenience, the former type will be termed the ‘internal solution’, and the latter termed the ‘external solution’. The application of either type of solution has different implications about the continued utility of consideration. Whilst leaving its final conclusion deliberately undecided, the Court in Gay Choon Ing seemingly preferred an external solution, providing yet another string to the bow for the abolition of consideration in contract law, at least in the Singapore context. However, questions remain as to the consequences of such abolition, particularly when, as this comment will suggest, there is insufficient recognition of the distinction between (and consequences of) internal and external solutions to the considerable problems of consideration...|$|E

40|$|In this reformation era, local administrations need {{to concern}} about the {{recognition}} and protection of human rights. This article proposed research questions; what kind of bylaws is considered violating human rights from juridical normative view and its synchronization with existing human rights instruments? The above question {{is based on the}} idea that in every development plan is not free from public awareness/sense of justice, as well as <b>legal</b> <b>benefit</b> and certainty, which may offend human rights instruments. The research used normative juridical research, which is the method of legal research by researching library materials or secondary materials. This is a normative juridical research on issues concerning the synchronization bylaws with human rights. The research findings based on the study on Pesisir Selatan Regency Regulation No. 8 of 2007 on Nagari Administration, it is not compatible with Human Rights Act No. 39 of 1999. This can be seen from the lack of explicit accommodation on cultural identity of Minangkabau ethnic communities such as indigenous customary court, the function of Kerapatan Adat Nagari, and customary symbols as well as customary title that are overlooked in the regulations. Furthermore, when viewed from the perspective of Civil and Political Rights Act No. 11 of 2005, it is reflected that identity of titles such as titles of tribe, clan, and family is not a concern of the nagari administration. Thus it is a violation of the civil rights of indigenous peoples. Likewise, viewed from the ILO Convention 169 of 1990 on Indigeus Peoples (protection against indigenous peoples), the central government to local administrations must accommodate the interests of indigenous peoples in the state and administration. The separation of the interests indigenous and the nagari government is considered a human rights violation. Keywords: bylaws, human rights, indigenous peoples, nagar...|$|E
