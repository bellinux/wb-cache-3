5|$|Inspired by German and American examples, he {{successfully}} {{asked the}} council to construct a system of villas at Bexley, advocated the separate treatment of acute and chronic cases, and introduced parole-style rewards for 'industrious' patients. <b>Like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his earlier administrative innovations, villas became popular and inspired similar designs elsewhere. Stansfield also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, and as a consultant on nervous diseases to the Eastern Command. Although he was appointed a CBE in 1919 for his war work, historians have drawn attention to his scepticism about shell shock, his attitudes towards eugenics and heredity, and his potentially misogynistic views about medical officers marrying. He nonetheless married twice, settling with his first wife at a house in Wimbledon where he enjoyed tending to the gardens; after her death, he married a second time in 1929 {{and moved to a}} villa in Sanremo, Italy, where he lived out his retirement.|$|E
5|$|The NSWRL were {{reluctant}} to admit a ninth team into the premiership and proposed they merge with nearby team Western Suburbs. However, the clubs involved declined so the NSWRL agreed to allowing the Cumberland team to a trial match against Eastern Suburbs. While Eastern Suburbs won the match 18–4, the NSWRL was convinced of {{that they could be}} competitive. As the NSWRL premiership had already begun, the NSWRL had to reformat the draw to include Cumberland, which meant increasing the number of teams from eight to nine. Cumberland did not have a home ground, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the other teams, and would play their games at the Agricultural Ground, Birchgrove Oval and Wentworth Park.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. Carbon, as lamp black, reacts at room {{temperature}} to yield fluoromethane. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400°C (750°F) to produce non-stoichiometric carbon monofluoride; higher temperatures generate gaseous fluorocarbons, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above {{room temperature}}, whereas paraffins and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted haloalkanes such as carbon tetrachloride, normally incombustible, may explode. Although nitrogen trifluoride is stable, nitrogen requires an electric discharge at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but {{can be made to}} react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas radon; of the other noble gases, only xenon and krypton react, and only under special conditions.|$|E

5|$|On 23 April 1799, George III created Prince Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh. Though he {{was made}} a lieutenant-general, both of British and Hanoverian forces, he {{remained}} in England, and, with {{a seat in the}} House of Lords, entered politics. Ernest had extreme Tory views, and soon became a leader of the right of the party. King George had feared that Ernest, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his elder brothers, would display Whig tendencies. Reassured on that point, in 1801, the King had Ernest conduct the negotiations which {{led to the formation of}} the Addington Government. In February 1802, King George granted his son the colonelcy of the 27th Light Dragoons, a post which offered the option of transfer to the colonelcy of the 15th Light Dragoons when a vacancy developed. A vacancy promptly occurred and the Duke became the colonel of the 15th Light Dragoons in March 1802. Although the post could have been a sinecure, Ernest involved himself in the affairs of the regiment and led it on manoeuvres.|$|E

25|$|The {{cork oak}} forests often contain wild olives, and <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the cool groves, are often {{accompanied}} by strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo) with mock privet (Phillyrea angustifolia) which grow in the clearings of these forests and dominate their regressive phases. In western Andalusia, other common components of the ecosystem are the areas of common broom, genus Teline.|$|E
25|$|Akira, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Otomo's {{other works}} (such as Domu), {{revolves}} around the basic idea of individuals with superhuman powers, especially psychokinetic abilities. However, these are not central to the story, which instead concerns itself with character, societal pressures and political machination. Motifs common in the manga include youth alienation, government corruption and inefficiency, and a military grounded in old-fashioned Japanese honor, displeased with the compromises of modern society.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{its initial}} importance, Texcoco did not develop {{as a major}} city <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its neighbors {{during the colonial period}} and for much of the post-independence period. It was mostly {{important}} for fishing and agriculture. From 1827 to 1830, Texcoco was the second capital of the State of Mexico, until it was moved to San Agustín de las Cuevas, today Tlalpan. Texcoco became the head of one of the districts of Mexico State in 1837. The appendage of “de Mora” was added in 1861. In 1919, it became a modern municipality.|$|E
25|$|Biological weapons may be {{employed}} in various ways to gain a strategic or tactical advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. <b>Like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the chemical weapons, biological weapons may also be useful as area denial weapons. These agents may be lethal or non-lethal, and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by nation states or by non-national groups. In the latter case, or if a nation-state uses it clandestinely, {{it may also be}} considered bioterrorism.|$|E
25|$|<b>Like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> {{the veteran}} socialists (Garabet Ibrăileanu, Henric Sanielevici, the România Muncitoare group), the young {{journalist}} made repeated attempts to revive and reunite the socialist clubs, left in disarray by the 1899 {{dissolution of the}} PSDMR. Cocea, with Arghezi, Demetrius and Galaction, stood out for marrying this political ideal with the artistic credo of Symbolism. This unusual vision was preserved in the magazine the three published together during 1904, Linia Dreaptă ("The Straight Line"). In 1905, Arghezi left for Switzerland and entrusted Cocea with his collection of rare books. Cocea {{is said to have}} lost it, an event which marked the first of several disagreements between them.|$|E

25|$|At first Gambetta {{was opposed}} to the war with Prussia. He did not, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his colleagues, refuse to vote for funds for the army, but took a {{patriotic}} line and accepted that the war had been forced on France. When {{the news of the}} disaster at Sedan reached Paris, Gambetta called for strong measures. He proclaimed the deposition of the emperor at the corps législatif, and the establishment of a republic at the Hôtel de Ville. He {{was one of the first}} members of the new Government of National Defense, becoming Minister of the Interior. He advised his colleagues to leave Paris and run the government from some provincial city.|$|E
25|$|His guitar playing {{style is}} {{characterized}} by complicated heavy metal riffs executed at great speed and with extreme precision, often using alternate picking technique and little vibrato. His compositions are usually filled with melodies and hooks, {{in order to make}} well-constructed songs, instead of long neo-classical themes <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his peers do. His shred guitar work has attracted many fans over the world and his musicianship has often been compared to the ability of guitarists of his age like Paul Gilbert, Marty Friedman, Kirk Hammett, David T. Chastain and others. In 1986 he declared that the main influences for his compositions and guitar solos came from the work of Deep Purple’s guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and from Japanese music for koto.|$|E
25|$|During the 1942–43 timeframe, the {{formerly}} all-black night fighter camouflage used by Luftwaffe night fighters had yielded to a light-color camouflage scheme that {{took advantage of}} the skyglow over German cities at night — this generally comprised the use of the Luftwaffe's usual Hellblau light blue undersurface color for diurnal-flown aircraft, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. The light gray base color usually had irregular patterns of darker gray splotches or irregular wavy lines spread over the light gray areas to increase the camouflage effect. Later in WW II, Luftwaffe night fighters, <b>like</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the Kampfgeschwader-flown He 177A heavy bombers being used at night, switched back to a black coloration for the undersurfaces and vertical sides of the airframe, while retaining the light gray with dark gray-color disruptive patterns established in the mid-war period.|$|E
