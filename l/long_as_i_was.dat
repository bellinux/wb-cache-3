500|$|In 1943 Judge Green {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps, the {{predecessor}} to the United States Air Force. At the time, the armed forces were still segregated. Green was initially [...] "optimistic that the military {{was going to be}} a good life," [...] until his unit was shipped from Fort Lee, Virginia to Keesler Field (now Keesler Air Force Base), in Mississippi. When the unit arrived at Keesler they were driven past the barracks to what Green would later describe as [...] "a tent city." [...] It was then that Green [...] "realized for real that I was really in a segregated army, and there was always, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the service, two standards, one quite unacceptable and the other as acceptable as could be considering the fact that the country was at war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee Judson, Peete's husband, {{was also}} {{arrested and charged}} with murder. The couple both {{maintained}} their innocence. On January 11, 1945, the murder charge against Judson was dropped due to insufficient evidence and he was released. The following day, he jumped to his death from the ninth floor of the Spring Arcade, an office building in Los Angeles. Upon learning of her husband's death, Peete wept and told reporters, [...] "I'm to blame for that. [...] He couldn't face disgrace. As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> associated with him, he was a marked man." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was no tour in 1971–72 and in 1972 Ian Chappell's {{young team}} came {{to fight the}} England {{veterans}} of 1970–71. England won the One Day Prudential Trophy 2–1, Snow taking 3–35 at Lord's. [...] Australia lost the First Test at Old Trafford by 89 runs thanks to Snow, who took 4/41 & 4/87. They fought back at Lord's where Bob Massie's outrageous swing bowling took 16–137. However, Snow took 5/57 to peg back the Australians to a 36 run lead in the first innings, but couldn't stop Australia's first win in The Ashes for 13 Tests. At Trent Bridge in the drawn Third Test Snow dismissed Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell, Doug Walters, Ross Edwards and Bob Massie with 5/92 in the first innings and Keith Stackpole, Greg Chappell and Walters with 3/94 in the second as England held out for a draw. Snow took only two wickets at Headingley as [...] "Deadly" [...] Derek Underwood spun England to an Ashes retaining victory with 10/82, {{but he was the}} second highest scorer in the England first innings, adding 104 with Ray Illingworth (57) before he was stumped for 48 and given a standing ovation by the Yorkshire crowd. With The Ashes safe England lost the Fifth Test at The Oval by 5 wickets, Snow taking only one wicket after a Lillee bouncer bruised his wrist in the first innings, leading to more accusations that he did not try in the Australian fourth innings run chase. Even so, he was easily the biggest England wicket-taker with 24 wickets (23.12). It was a sad ending for the England team, many feeling that this was the last series in which the veteran 1970–71 team would play together as some players neared retirement, while others were unpopular with the selectors. Snow was under no illusions [...] "as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taking wickets I was safe. If I missed out then I would be on the way out".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{went to the}} cemetery," [...] he continued. [...] "I {{wanted to}} realize that those who had died were dead, it was all one thing as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in there; {{everybody}} was dead; and then I came on to your house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, I'll {{stop for}} a few minutes," [...] replied the wood-chopper; [...] "but I can not stay <b>long,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{expected}} at court." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ponting {{was confronted}} by a large media pack shortly after his arrival at Sydney Airport and said he wasn't aware of Lillee's comments. [...] "I'm not {{concerned}} about those things.

But <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> looking after the guys in my dressing room, then I'll be happy," [...] Ponting stated, adding that he wished to remain captain.|$|R
6000|$|Gunga Dass {{had been}} educated at a Mission School, and, {{as he himself}} admitted, had he only changed his {{religion}} [...] "like a wise man," [...] might have avoided the living grave which was now his portion.

60|$|It mattered {{nothing to}} me where I went, so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{on my way to}} Mrs. Van Brandt. It was too late to travel that day; I slept at a hotel. The night passed quietly and uneventfully. The next morning I set forth by the public {{conveyance}} for Amsterdam.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{took care}} {{there should be}} no mistake before I uttered it at all, Bayham!" [...] cries F. B.'s patron.

60|$|From the {{position}} which the Cassandra occupied this {{entrance to the}} harbor was so well defended that any vessel entering thereat must be twice raked by our broadside fire, once in rounding the northern, and once the southern angle of the channel. Hence it was that I determined to hold our present position as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> close by, Walter. However, I don't {{mind your}} taking Larry. He would, as you say, be useful, {{and you will}} want {{somebody}} to look after your horse and act as your servant. We may be separated, sometimes, for the troop may be sent on detached service, when I could not take you with me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{really did}} not seem {{necessary}} to give the matter much thought. Here {{was a place of}} public entertainment, and, as I was one of the public, why should I not be entertained?

6000|$|Jackson seemed pleased. [...] "I've read {{everything}} I can lay {{my hands on}} about it.

6000|$|... "Because I {{made up my}} mind to bear it as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have done}} so. It was {{impossible}} for me to remain there any longer, and I determined to take my life into my own hands, and, if necessary, find a situation.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir, all well. Bob {{has turned}} out a great help to my father. I was sure he would do well {{when he got the}} chance.

60|$|Then I bethought me of {{my earlier}} resolve to seek shelter in some convent, and his mention of the pass caused me to think now {{that it would be}} wiser to cross the {{mountains}} into Tuscany.

6000|$|... "You are a wise woman," [...] Malcolm said. [...] "There {{is nothing}} like freedom. Give me a crust, and a sod for my pillow, rather than gold plates inside a prison.
