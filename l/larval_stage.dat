5|$|Beetles are {{the most}} widely eaten insects, with about 344 species used as food, usually at the <b>larval</b> <b>stage.</b> The {{mealworm}} (the larva of the darkling beetle) and the rhinoceros beetle are among the species commonly eaten.|$|E
5|$|Cercaria mirabilis, a trematode, has an {{especially}} large <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> (known as a cercarium) which looks {{much like a}} small crustacean or mosquito larva. It also mimics the locomotory behavior of such animals, allowing it to be eaten by predaceous fish.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the <b>larval</b> <b>stage,</b> the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E

40|$|The {{first four}} <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> of the pandalid shrimp Chlorotocus crassicornis (A. Costa, 1871) are {{described}} and illustrated from laboratory-reared material obtained from ovigerous females {{collected in the}} southwestern Spain and south Taiwan. The second to fourth <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> of this species are reported {{for the first time}} to science. Detailed examination of the first <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> reveals that previous description misidentified some key larval characters which have prevented its identification in plankton samples. It is found that the zoeal morphology of Chlorotocus is not very different from other pandalid larvae, and in fact closely resembles Plesionika and Heterocarpus...|$|R
40|$|The egg, <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> (I, II, and III) and {{the adult}} {{male and female}} were {{examined}} under a dissecting microscope. For {{each one of the}} above stages the body length, colour and other morphological characteristics were investigated. The anterior and the posterior spiracles of the three <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> were dissected out and examined under a phase contrast microscope...|$|R
5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a {{water-borne}} mould that parasitizes the <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> of mosquitoes. When {{applied to}} water, the motile spores avoid unsuitable host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) {{can also}} be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its <b>larval</b> <b>stage,</b> the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its appendages, while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its appendages, or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar <b>larval</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E

5|$|The eggs of the puffadder shyshark are fed {{upon by the}} whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, {{at least}} in captivity. Known parasites of this species include the {{trypanosome}} Trypanosoma haploblephari, which infests the blood, the nematode Proleptus obtusus, which infests the intestine, and the copepods Charopinus dalmanni and Perissopus oblongatus, which infest the skin. Another parasite is the praniza <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> of the isopod Gnathia pantherina, which infests the nares, mouth, and gills. The deep-penetrating mouthparts of these larvae significantly damage local tissue, causing bleeding and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|The larval period {{can vary}} widely. A fungus feeding staphylinid Phanerota fasciata {{undergoes}} three moults in 3.2 days {{at room temperature}} while Anisotoma sp. (Leiodidae) completes its <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> in the fruiting body of slime mold in 2 days and possibly represents the fastest growing beetles. Dermestid beetles, Trogoderma inclusum can remain in an extended larval state under unfavourable conditions, even reducing their size between moults. A larva {{is reported to have}} survived for 3.5 years in an enclosed container.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as {{they do not need}} to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E

5|$|Browerian mimicry, {{named after}} Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower, is a {{postulated}} form of automimicry; where the model {{belongs to the}} same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (imago) form. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the <b>larval</b> <b>stage,</b> some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages â€“ egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} potato into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of potato crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate potato plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of potato leaves during the entire <b>larval</b> <b>stage,</b> but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{complete}} larval development (including four zoeal stages and a megalopa stage) of Dyspanopeus sayi is described and illustrated in detail based on larvae reared in the laboratory. Ovigerous females {{were collected in}} Alfacs Bay, Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) where the species was recently introduced. These <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> were compared with others collected in the plankton from the same area, the <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> described previously for this species and the <b>larval</b> <b>stages</b> of the two other Panopeidae that inhabit the Iberian Peninsula: Panopeus africanus and Rhithropanopeus harrisii. Differences were found in both zoeal and megalopal larval characters between D. sayi {{and the other two}} species, which could raise doubt about their placement in the same family...|$|R

5|$|The {{superclass}} Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic <b>larval</b> <b>stage.</b> They are not found in the sea {{with the exception of one}} or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans {{exhibit a}} number of larval forms, of which the {{earliest}} and most characteristic is the nauplius. This has three pairs of appendages, all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the zoea (pl. zoeÃ¦ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed {{it to be a}} separate species. It follows the nauplius stage and precedes the post-larva. Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic appendages, as opposed to nauplii, which use cephalic appendages, and megalopa, which use abdominal appendages for swimming. It often has spikes on its carapace, which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming. In many decapods, due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first <b>larval</b> <b>stage.</b> In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.|$|E
5|$|Epaulette {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as other sharks. Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E

5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host {{is not an easy}} task though, despite the fact that several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E
5|$|The eggs may be {{deposited}} singly or {{in small}} groups, or may {{take the form of}} spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are laid in grape-like clusters in burrows near streams. The amphibious salamander Ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots. The greenhouse frog (Eleutherodactylus planirostris) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening <b>larval</b> <b>stage.</b> The tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs. First a raft is built, then eggs are laid in the centre, and finally a foam cap is overlaid. The foam has anti-microbial properties. It contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female.|$|E
5|$|The <b>larval</b> <b>stage</b> of dragonflies lasts up to {{five years}} in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
