6000|$|But I was {{fortunate}} enough in choosing the Jamaliyah Wakalah, for I found a friend there. On board the steamer a fellow-voyager, seeing me sitting alone and therefore as he conceived in discomfort, placed himself by my side and opened a hot fire of kind inquiries. He was a man about forty-five, of middle size, with a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> closely shaven, a bull-neck, limbs sturdy as a Saxon's, a thin red beard, and handsome features beaming with benevolence. A curious dry humour he had, delighting in [...] "quizzing," [...] but in so quiet, solemn, and quaint a way that before you knew him you could scarcely divine his drift.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{placed his}} broad-brimmed hat {{on the ground}} beside him, exposing a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> somewhat bald in front, but not from age, {{and the rest of}} it covered with close-cut brown hair. His black clothes fitted him very closely, their extreme tightness suggesting that they had shrunken in the course of wearing, or that he had grown much plumper since he had come into possession of them; and their general worn and dull appearance gave considerable distance to the period of their first possession. But there was nothing worn or dull about the countenance of the man, upon which was an expression of mellow geniality which would have been suitably consequent upon a good dinner with plenty of wine. But his only beverage had been coffee, and in his clear bright eye there was no trace of any exhilaration, except that caused by the action of a hearty meal upon a good digestion and an optimistic disposition.|$|E
5000|$|Fleeman is {{described}} as having a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> with dull hair that stood on end giving the impression he had been [...] "scared out of his wits", broad shouldered and possessing formidable strength.

5000|$|It {{was built}} as a one-story wood frame central hall plan raised {{plantation}} house with a rear wing for kitchen and dining room. It had one room {{on each side of}} the hall. It has a five-bay facade with a gallery with square posts having molded capitals. It has an entablature which is [...] "unusually large". Greek Revival elements include transoms and side lights at the front and rear central doors. The house also has some Italianate influences: <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> panels of the front doors and [...] "jig sawn balustrade work".|$|E
50|$|The {{only known}} {{specimen}} of Gerobatrachus is a nearly complete skeleton about 11 cm long. It is preserved in red siltstone with only its underside exposed. Like other amphibamid temnospondyls, Gerobatrachus has a rounded and flattened head, well-developed limbs, {{and a small}} tail. Its vertebral column is somewhat shorter than those of related amphibamids. The <b>large,</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> and shortened vertebral column are features Gerobatrachus shares in common with frogs and the early salamander Karaurus. Gerobatrachus also has a large embayment {{at the back of}} the skull called an otic notch, which is seen other amphibamids and in frogs and supports the tympanum, an eardrum-like structure used in hearing.|$|E
5000|$|The Umibōzu {{is said to}} live in {{the ocean}} and capsize the ship of anyone who dares speak to it. This spirit's name, which {{combines}} the character for [...] "sea" [...] with the character of [...] "Buddhist monk," [...] is possibly related {{to the fact that the}} Umibōzu is said to have a <b>large,</b> <b>round</b> <b>head,</b> resembling the shaven heads of Buddhist monks.Alternatively they are demonic Yōkai (spectres) that appear to shipwreck victims and fishermen. They are believed to be drowned priests, and exhibit the shaven head and typically appears to be praying. It is usually reported as having a grey, cloud-like torso and serpentine limbs.|$|E
50|$|Kokeshi dolls, while less symbolic, {{are also}} a popular {{traditional}} craft. They are carved wooden dolls, with <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>heads</b> and hand painted bodies. Kokeshi dolls are popular throughout many regions of Japan, but Fukushima is credited as their birthplace.|$|R

50|$|A Marshall Fredericks {{statue of}} 1957 seeks {{to make the}} lion less {{threatening}} to children. The sculpture was commissioned for the Eastland Center in Harper Woods, Michigan. The lion is carved from limestone and has a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> with stylized, uniformly coiled ringlets. Reclining on its back, it grins at the little mouse perched on its paw. This was cast from gilt bronze and gold plated, which led to its being stolen numerous times. One was returned 50 years after its theft and exhibited at the Detroit Historical Museum in 2007. A copy of the whole statue is on exhibition in the sculpture garden of the Marshall M. Fredericks Sculpture Museum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} What's Her Face Dolls {{are approximately}} 9.5" [...] tall. Their most recognizable feature is a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> with No Facial features. The doll's completely blank face {{is intended to}} be drawn on and designed by the owner, using included washable colored markers and if desired, special rubber stamps of eyes and mouths. A flower-shaped mask was also included, with corresponding holes to help align the stamps on the Doll's face. The Doll's oversized head lacks rooted hair, and has velcro on top, designed to help their changeable brightly colored wigs stay in place. The Doll's body is similarly stylized, approaching a nearly cartoonish pre-teen build with large, flat feet, which allow the Doll to stand on her own. Many of the Dolls sport molded-on floral-print panties, but the earliest Dolls did not, this feature being added midway through the line's run.|$|E
5000|$|Killdeer have a {{characteristic}} <b>large,</b> <b>round</b> <b>head,</b> long tail, long flesh-colored legs, and long wings. The bill is short, dark, and thick. Plumage is brownish-tan on dorsal areas and {{white on the}} ventral belly and chest; the neck is also surrounded by a white collar. Two large, dark bands surround the upper breast with an additional band located on the head, spanning both the forehead and the area above the bill and continuing {{around the back of}} the head. The tail is brown with a black subterminal band, a white terminal band, and white outer tail feathers. Additional defining plumage characters include a brightly colored red-orange rump that is visible during flight and displays, white wing stripes visible during flight. Appearance does not vary between males and females, although breeding females may have additional brown plumage on the head. Juveniles resemble adults with the exception of buff fringe feathers and the presence of only one neck band ...|$|E
50|$|These insects {{characteristically}} have <b>large</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>heads</b> covered {{mostly by}} well-developed, compound eyes, legs that facilitate catching prey (other insects) in flight, {{two pairs of}} long, transparent wings that move independently, and elongated abdomens. They have three ocelli and short antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of}} the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} studies have found {{correlation}} between variation in brain size in cranial capacity and geographic ancestry in humans. This variation in cranial capacity is believed to be primarily caused by climatic adaptation that favor <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>heads</b> in colder climates because they conserve heat and slender heads in warm climates closer to the equator (See Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule).|$|R
50|$|Northwestern wolves {{are one of}} {{the largest}} {{subspecies}} of wolves with grown males weighing between 105 lb and 135 lb in British Columbia, Canada. Sir John Richardson described the northwestern wolf as having a more robust build than the European wolf, with a <b>larger,</b> <b>rounder</b> <b>head</b> and a thicker, more obtuse muzzle. Its ears are also shorter, and its fur bushier.|$|R
50|$|The {{hawfinch}} has {{an overall}} length of 18 cm, with a wingspan {{that ranges from}} 29 to 33 cm. It weighs 46 - 70 g with the male being on average slightly heavier than the female. It is a robust bird with a thick neck, <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> and a wide, strong conical beak with a metallic appearance. It has short pinkish legs with a light hue {{and it has a}} short tail. It has brown eyes.The plumage of the female is slightly paler than that of the male. The overall colour is light brown, its head having an orange hue to it. Its eyes have a black circle around them, extending to its beak and surrounding it at its edge. Its throat is also black.The sides of its neck, as well as the back of its neck, are gray. The upper side of its wings are a deep black colour. The wings also have three stripes from approximately the middle till their sides: a white, a brown and a blue stripe.Adults moults between July and September.|$|E
50|$|Vanni’s {{most famous}} {{work is a}} polyptych in the church of Santo Stefano alla Lizza. It gives the viewer {{a greater sense of}} Vanni’s manner. The central panel {{contains}} a portrait of the Virgin and Child and apart from the color being striking, there is a “silhouette-like character of the design”. The Madonna is set like a dark pattern against the gold background of her throne. There is almost no attempt at chiaroscuro except around the face and hands which gives the piece a rather flat effect, and is an example of Simone Martini’s influence. The drapery of the Virgin however, is an example of Lorenzetti’s influence. Simple folds and lines along with the Madonna’s stiff upright pose is nothing like the Madonna’s of Martini but the “statelier figures of Lorenzetti”. The facial expression is completely of Vanni’s own. The Madonna has a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head,</b> narrow eyes and a delicate mouth. Her firm chin completes a set of strong features which are hard to ignore. The Christ Child is said to be modeled after the prototype for Martini’s fresco of the Majestas in the Palazzo della Signoria.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{range from}} 16 to 25 cm {{in length and}} weigh 121 - 244 g. Among the {{differently}} sized races, length can average from 19.5 to 23.8 cm. The wingspan can range from 46 to 61 cm. In Ohio, male owls average 166 g and females 194 g while in central Texas, they average 157 g and 185 g, respectively. They have either rusty or dark gray intricately patterned plumage with streaking on the underparts. Mid-sized by screech-owl standards, these birds are stocky, short-tailed (tail averages from 6.6 to 8.6 cm in length) and broad-winged (wing chord averages from 14.5 to 17 cm) as {{is typical of the}} genus. They have a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> with prominent ear tufts, yellow eyes and a yellowish beak, which measures on average 1.45 cm in length. The feet are relatively large and powerful compared to more southern screech owls and are typically feathered down to the toes, although the southernmost populations only have remnant bristles rather than full feathering on the legs and feet. The eastern screech owl (and its western counterpart) are actually one of the heaviest screech owls, the largest tropical screech owls do not exceed them in average or maximal weight but (thanks to the eastern screech owls' relatively short tail) they are surpassed in length by Balsas (M. seductus), long-tufted (M. sanctaecatarinae), white-throated (M. albogularis) and rufescent (M. seductus), in roughly that order.|$|E

40|$|Micromorphological and ultrastructural {{analyses}} of the leaf trichomes of Salvia fruticosa Mill. were performed by light and electron microscopy. The leaves bear numerous non-glandular unbranched trichomes, and peltate, capitate and digitiform glandular trichomes. Very elongated flagelliform non-glandular trichomes densely covered the leaf surfaces, with especially abundance on the leaf margins. Peltate trichomes consist of a basal epidermal cell, a very short stalk cell and a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> of eight secretory cells arranged in a circle. Capitate trichomes {{can be divided into}} two main types, short-stalked and long-stalked, and further into five subtypes according to the number of stalk cells, morphology and number of glandular head cells. Digitiform trichomes consist of one basal cell, one or two stalk cells and one apical secretory cell, which are of similar diameter and approximately equal length.

40|$|Two {{brothers}} {{with severe}} mental retardation of unknown origin {{were found to}} share several physical anomalies, including <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head,</b> small concave nose, downslanted palpebral fissures, and gingival hyperplasia. In addition to relative macrocephaly, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed severe cerebral atrophy, especially fronto-temporally. The brothers also had a thin corpus callosum and atrophic caudate nuclei. The reduced white matter showed patchy periventricular signal intensity changes. The lateral and third ventricles were large, but the fourth ventricle was of normal size. The boys had large cisterna magna, communicating widely with the fourth ventricle, but no vermian hypoplasia. Both boys had Lennox-Gastaut spectrum type epilepsy. No chromosomal anomalies were found, despite the suggestive clinical picture. Some of the clinical findings resembled fetal alcohol effects/fetal alcohol syndrome (FAE/FAS), which was also suggested by history. Current diagnostic criteria for FAE/FAS, however, excluded full-blown FAS in these cases and failed to explain the entire clinical picture in the boys. We argue that these boys had an unidentified inherited syndrome, possibly modified by fetal alcohol exposure...|$|E
40|$|A {{dark spot}} on the dorsal fin is common. Round Goby – The {{distinctive}} feature of the round goby is its fused pelvic (bottom) fins. This fish can grow up to 10 inches in length, although 3 - to 6 -inch fish are more common. The smaller tubenose goby has two, rather distinct, tube-like projections from its head. Map courtesy of U. S. Geological Survey. The round goby is a small, but aggressive bottom-dwelling fish that grows rapidly, and reproduces several times in one spawning season. It is a huge threat to North American aquatic ecosystems because it is adaptable {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions, and will eat just about anything alive that will fit in its mouth. Species Description Round gobies have a soft body and a <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>head</b> with thick lips and distinctive frog-like raised eyes. They can reach up to 10 inches in length as adults, but are usually less than seven inches in the Great Lakes. Females and immature males are a solid slate gray mottled with black and brown spots. Spawning males turn almost solid black. Two distinguishing characteristics of round gobies are a single, scallop-shaped pelvic fin and a distinctive black spot located on the dorsal fin. Round gobies closely resemble the native mottled sculpin, but the two species can be easily separated by looking at the pelvic fins. The sculpin has two separated pelvic fins compared to the single, fused pelvic fin found on the round goby. The sculpin also lacks the large black spot found on the dorsal fin of the round goby. Native & Introduced Ranges Round gobies are native to Eurasia in the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, and tributaries. They were first discovered in the St. Clair River in 1990, presumably released during ballast water exchanges of transoceanic ships. They have since spread to all of the Great Lakes, and are now working their way inland through rivers and canal systems. In Pennsylvania, the round goby is abundant in Lake Erie and its lower tributaries. The first inland occurrence for Pennsylvani...|$|E
50|$|Most {{species have}} a compact build with a <b>large,</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>head,</b> a short, {{straight}} bill, and rounded wingtips. They occupy {{a wide range}} of wooded habitats, from subalpine to tropical rainforest, and mangrove swamps to semi-arid scrubland. All are primarily insectivorous, although a few supplement their diet with seeds. Hunting is mostly by perch and pounce, a favoured tactic being to cling sideways onto a treetrunk and scan the ground below without moving.|$|R

50|$|Liparis fabricii {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 18 to 20 cm. The shape of its body resembles that of a tadpole, with a <b>large</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>head</b> and abdomen {{tapering}} towards a narrow tail. Two nasal pores are present {{on each side of}} the head. The eyes are relatively large, with orbital diameters of 5.3 to 10.3% of the total body length. The mouth is shaped into a suction disc and has simple unlobed teeth. The peritoneum of L. fabricii is distinctively dark, visible in both the interior of the mouth and behind the gill covers.|$|R
50|$|It is dioecious. At {{breeding}} time, {{the male}} courts the female by following her around closely. When ready to spawn, the female ascends rapidly to the surface, where she lays {{a mass of}} eggs stuck together by gelatinous mucus. This egg raft adheres to the seaweed, where it is fertilised by the male. On hatching, each larva is surrounded by an integumentary envelope and has a <b>large,</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>head,</b> fully formed fins, and eyes with double notches. As the larva develops into a juvenile, this envelope fuses with the skin.|$|R
50|$|The {{whistlers}} are stout {{birds with}} strong bills, {{and the group}} was once known as the thickheads due to the <b>large</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>heads</b> of many species. Their plumage is rufous, brown, or grey {{in the majority of}} species. Nevertheless, a few species, particularly the golden whistler and its close relatives, have bright plumage. One of the more unusual traits of this family is found in the feathers of some of the pitohuis, which have toxins. These toxins are probably a deterrent to parasites and may also serve to dissuade predators from taking the birds.|$|R
5000|$|This small species rarely exceeds 32 in (81.3 cm) in length. It has a <b>large,</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>head,</b> {{and fairly}} heavy body for its size, with eyes with {{vertical}} pupils. Like other rattlesnakes, its tail has a rattle, which {{is composed of}} keratin. Each time the snake sheds its skin, a new segment {{is added to the}} rattle. However, the rattle is fragile and may break off, and the frequency of shedding can vary. So, the snake's age cannot be determined by the number of segments or length of the rattle.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the west}} {{face of the}} church, on Bartholomew Lane, was exposed. This was three bays wide, the central bay being equal in width to the two outer bays combined. The two outer bays had <b>large</b> <b>round</b> <b>headed</b> windows, while the central bay had a Venetian window above the main entrance. The tower was in the south west corner and was built of brick, with a parapet on top. In the middle of each side was an open arch {{supported}} by ramps. This was either a whimsical design or preparation for a steeple that was never erected.|$|R
50|$|The red-legged {{kittiwake}} {{is a very}} localised subarctic Pacific species. Apart {{from the}} distinguishing feature implicit in its name, it {{is very similar to}} its better known relative, the black-legged kittiwake; other differences include the shorter bill, larger eyes, a <b>larger,</b> <b>rounder</b> <b>head</b> and darker grey wings, and in the juveniles, which barely differ from the adults, lacking the black tail band and 'W' across the wings of juvenile black-legged kittiwakes. Juveniles take three years to reach maturity. Adults are 35 - 39 cm long, with an 84 - 92 cm wingspan and a body mass of 325 - 510 g.|$|R
