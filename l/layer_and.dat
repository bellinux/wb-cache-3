5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman <b>layer,</b> <b>and</b> it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>and</b> the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E

C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous <b>layer</b> <b>and</b> a predominately yellow middle layer, or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. It also has a reddish peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex <b>layer</b> <b>and</b> protected by an impermeable and rigid coat.

Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the impact of As+ ion implantation on strain relaxation and dopant activation of biaxially strained SSOI <b>layers</b> <b>and</b> uniaxially strained/unstrained NWs is presented. Three aspects are investigated: (i) the quality of the single crystalline <b>layers</b> <b>and</b> the NWs, (ii) strain relaxation of the implanted NWs and (iii) dopant activation of the <b>layers</b> <b>and</b> NWs. Optimization of the doping conditions resulted into very low contact resistivities of NiSi contacts on strained and unstrained 70 nm SOI <b>layers</b> <b>and</b> Si NWs. For NW contacts values as low as 1. 2 x 10 (- 8) Omega cm(2) for an As+ dose of 2 x 10 (15) cm(- 2) were achieved, which is 20 times lower than for planar contacts made under the same implantation and annealing conditions.

Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell <b>layer,</b> <b>and</b> as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.|$|E
