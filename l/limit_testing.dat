40|$|Neuropsychologists {{have been}} {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} assess the neuropsychological functioning of elderly individuals to aid in both diagnosis and treatment planning. Various factors frequently complicate these assessment attempts, such as {{the high incidence of}} peripheral sensory and motor deficits, increased susceptibility to fatigue, and a general unfamiliarity with test taking situations. The present article describes practical features of the Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery which make it well suited for use with elderly populations. The battery is relatively brief to administer and can be given over multiple sessions. Two forms of the battery are available allowing serial testing and the instruments needed are quite portable. Within standardized administration there is considerable flexibility allowing the clinician to circumvent difficulties posed by peripheral sensory and motor impairment, or deficits other than those which specific items are intended to tap.

New advancements in lighting technology, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), promise clean, portable and durable lighting at higher-quality and lower-cost.

To <b>limit</b> <b>testing</b> costs, a three-level test procedure was developed: (i) a simple visual and function test, (ii) lab measurements of the relevant parameters for all main components and (iii) a luminous maintenance test of the light source.

40|$|There {{is a new}} {{generation}} of mildly flammable refrigerants that pose unique challenges to flammability <b>limit</b> <b>testing</b> with ASTM E 681. This test standard relies on visual observation of flame propagation inside of a spherical glass vessel. The combustion of these refrigerants etches the glass test vessel, making it difficult to properly observe the flame. The current standard specifies the electrodes to be placed vertically in the flame path, hindering the propagation of the flame. The rubber stopper that seals the vessel is prone to leak and also vent before the flame fully propagates, skewing the results of the test. These problems have been addressed through the creation of a polycarbonate testing apparatus that utilizes a weighted rubber stopper and electrodes that penetrate through the side of the vessel. This prototype was tested extensively with R- 32, and yield a lower flammability limit of 14. 8 % when testing with a starting pressure of 91. 2 kPa. The polycarbonate prototype proved to be an adequate alternative to the glass flask, and provided solutions to the etching, quenching, and venting issues...|$|E

However, the value for compaction and direct shear test also did not give good result as the value for optimum moisture content, cohesion and friction angle also quite similar to each other thus, it can be clearly said that the percentage of sodium bentonite did not give effect to the soil samples and not suitable to be use in this type of soil...|$|R
