40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to validate an in vitro model of the Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART). This model allowed in depth analyses of the migration of apatite forming Sr and F, from a glass-ionomer, Fuji IXGP (GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), into partly demineralized dentine. The second objective was to study the effects of the levels of mineral <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> such ionic <b>exchange.</b> METHODS: Artificial lesions were created in thirty third molars, which were divided into three groups based on time of exposure to the demineralizing solution (7, 14 and 21 days). These were restored with Fuji IXGP and left for 21 days. The method of analysis was electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) with wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). This combination can yield both qualitative identification of elements as well as quantitative compositional information, with a minimum detection limit of 0. 01 %. RESULTS: The results indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in the levels of Ca and P from the control and test sides for all three groups of demineralized dentine. The differences in the depth of penetration and the amount of Sr and F between control and test were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The validity of the in vitro model was confirmed. There was migration of both strontium and fluorine to the artificially demineralized dentine in a pattern consistent with remineralization and similar to what was observed in a previous in vivo study.

40|$|In recent years, China has {{experienced}} {{two forms of}} extreme macroeconomic imbalance: an expenditure imbalance {{in the sense of}} very high investment and very low consumption, giving rise to rapid capital accumulation; and an imbalance between expenditure and production, producing external imbalance, i. e. a huge surplus on the current account of the balance of payments. Both imbalances imply a low rate of time discount by both government and society: consumption in the present is forgone in favour of consumption in the future. The paper examines how these imbalances came about and goes on to consider whether they can be sustained and how they might be redressed. There {{is no evidence that the}} rapid capital accumulation has reduced the rate of profit on capital and thus the incentive to invest. However, persistent external imbalance poses a threat to investment if it generates excess liquidity and asset bubbles. The current account surplus rose remarkably in the years 2004 – 07. This was associated with exogenous increases in competiveness and in saving, both attributable to the economic reform policies. On current policies, the surplus is likely to rise again once the world economy recovers from its recession. This poses three sorts of problems, each of which is examined in turn: difficulties for macroeconomic stabilisation policies; risk of capital <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> the foreign <b>exchange</b> holdings; and the threat of retaliation by China’s trading partners. A combination of internal and external policies will be required to redress the imbalance...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the causal nexus between capital inflows (foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment) and exchange rate in Nigeria. It also examined {{the impact of these}} capital inflows <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate in Nigeria for the period spanning 1986 to 2011. The study employed both granger causality and error correction modelling techniques. The causality estimates showed no causal link between capital inflows (foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment) and exchange rate within this period. The long run regression estimate revealed that foreign direct investment had negative effect <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate while portfolio investment had positive impact <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. However, the magnitude of the impacts was very minute unlike the international oil price which had a strong negative effect <b>on</b> the <b>exchange</b> rate. The result of the short run result was similar to the causality result, indicating that neither foreign direct investment nor foreign portfolio investment had significant impact <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. The study concluded that the relationship between capital inflows and exchange rate in Nigeria is a long run phenomenon...|$|R

30|$|The {{determinants}} of exchange rates have attracted considerable attention among researchers {{over the past}} several decades. Most studies, however, ignore the possibility that the impact of oil shocks <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rates could vary across the exchange rate returns distribution. We employ a quantile regression approach to address this issue. Our results indicate that the effect of oil shocks <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rates is heterogeneous across quantiles. A large US depreciation or appreciation tends to heighten the effects of oil shocks <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate returns. Positive oil demand shocks lead to appreciation pressures in oil-exporting countries and this result is robust across lower and upper return distributions. These results offer rich and useful information for investors and decision-makers.|$|R

50|$|The {{academic}} literature largely ignores cross-listings <b>on</b> non-U.S. <b>exchanges.</b> However, {{there are many}} cross-listings <b>on</b> <b>exchanges</b> in Europe and Asia. Even U.S. firms are cross-listed in other countries. In the 1950s there was a wave of cross-listings of U.S. firms in Belgium, in the 1960s in France, in the 1970s in the U.K., and in the 1980s in Japan (see Sarkissian and Schill, 2014). Roosenboom and van Dijk (2009) analyze 526 cross-listings from 44 different countries on 8 major stock exchanges and document significant stock price reactions of 1.3% on average for cross-listings <b>on</b> US <b>exchanges,</b> 1.1% <b>on</b> London Stock <b>Exchange,</b> 0.6% <b>on</b> <b>exchanges</b> in continental Europe, and 0.5% <b>on</b> Tokyo Stock <b>Exchange.</b> These findings suggest that cross-listings <b>on</b> Anglo-Saxon <b>exchanges</b> create more value than <b>on</b> other <b>exchanges.</b> They also highlight the incomplete understanding of why firms cross-list outside the UK and the United States, {{as many of the}} arguments discussed above (enhanced liquidity, improved disclosure, and bonding) do not apply. In this respect, Sarkissian and Schill (2014) show that cross-listing activity in a given host country coincides with the outperformance of host and proximate home country’s economies and financial markets, thus, highlighting the market timing component in cross-listing decisions.|$|R
