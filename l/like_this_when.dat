25|$|Before {{they are}} killed, cage salmon are anaesthetised with a herbal extract. They are then spiked in the brain. The heart beats {{for a time}} as the animal is bled from its sliced gills. Relaxing the salmon <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> it is killed {{produces}} firm, long-keeping flesh. Lack of disease in wild populations and low stocking densities used in the cages means that New Zealand salmon farmers do not use antibiotics and chemicals that are often needed elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{finally got}} a call from Eisenhower at 10pm, Pacific time, Sunday night. Eisenhower {{expressed}} a reluctance to see him leave the ticket, and felt that he should have a chance to make his case to the American people. Nixon enquired if the general would {{be able to make a}} decision on whether to keep him as the running mate immediately after the broadcast, and when Eisenhower equivocated, he angrily burst out: [...] "General, there comes a time in matters <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> you've either got to shit or get off the pot." [...] Eisenhower replied that it might take three or four days to gauge public reaction.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, the Icelandic donor {{died and}} his penis was surgically removed {{so that it}} could be added to the museum's collection. The penectomy was not entirely {{successful}} and left the penis [...] "a greyish-brown, shrivelled mass". According to Sigurður, [...] "I should have stretched it and sewn it at the back to keep it in more or less a normal position". Instead, it [...] "went directly into the formaldehyde". Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon." [...] Visitors' most common reaction to the preserved human penis is [...] "that it's very old, you know, a bit shrunken, and the male members [...] say 'oh, I hope mine will not look <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> I get old. Sigurður has considered donating his own penis to the museum when he dies but said that it depends on his wife: [...] "If she dies first, my specimen would go in here. If I die first, well I can't say. She might say no." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics who praised its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. Chris Richards of The Washington Post {{referred to the}} track a [...] "club-hungry come-ons" [...] with a [...] "dexterous melody". He further stated that the [...] "skeletal" [...] track [...] "keeps Beyoncé tethered to the ground". Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of 'Get Me Bodied,' which sets Beyoncé's harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media called the track a [...] "percussive, Diwali-esque jam". Us Weekly described [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] a [...] "snappy dance number." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker noted that the song sounds [...] "anxious." [...] Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that the song {{is very similar to}} Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] (2005) and expressed further praise about [...] "Get Me Bodied", writing: [...] " [...] Beyonce’s glorified version of a 'Hollaback Girl'-type song. [...] But listen to way she wails and shouts throughout the song! Gwen Stefani certainly isn’t capable of vocal gymnastics <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>When</b> she sings [...] you can visualize beads of perspiration coming off of her as she shakes to this song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several unnamed Chelsea {{players were}} {{quoted as saying}} Grant's methods were [...] "25 years behind the times" [...] and [...] "Chelsea deserve a bigger coach than him.

2500|$|Anne-Marie is {{initially}} highly supportive of Joseph's relationship with Jac Naylor, {{unaware that the}} younger woman {{was having an affair}} with Lord Byrne. Jane Asher said of the storyline at the time: [...] "Her husband may have strayed before, but never <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> <b>When</b> she finds out the truth, it's going to be pretty earth shattering for her. When she realises what her husband's been up to there'll be quite a showdown!" [...] Indeed, Anne-Marie discovers Charles' infidelity several weeks later, in episode [...] "Close Relations", and immediately terminates their marriage and removes Charles from the family home. [...] Although they swiftly begin divorce proceedings, Anne-Marie attends to Charles' bedside after he suffers a stroke in episode [...] "The Q Word", and agrees to take him back, before he dies from a fatal heart attack in episode [...] "Temporary Insanity".|$|E

2500|$|Although Kobach's {{campaign}} treasurer, Tom Arpke, possessed campaign experience, {{losing a}} state senate race in 2008, winning a Salina City Council seat the next year, {{and a state}} House seat in 2010, he {{was found to have}} under-reported contributions by $35,000 and nearly $43,000 in expenditures in Kobach's 2010 campaign, resulting in a maximum $5,000 fine. Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, [...] "The only real distinction I can see is that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate." [...] The chair of the Kansas ethics commission said [...] "The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission." [...] When he obtained convictions of Kansans for interstate voting irregularities in 2016, Kobach said, [...] "The fines are “exactly what I wanted to see in cases <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> I made the case before Kansas Legislature that this authority was needed ... A $5,000 fine is very significant, and hopefully something no one would want to have to pay”, he said.|$|E
2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{then take}} their pink box {{in search of}} older women {{to talk about their}} clothing. They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of what to wear. Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures to see how she is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm going to look <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>when</b> I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow my face to become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E
