There are numerous approaches to the concept of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> in the Russian Federation. There is no legal definition of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process.</b> The lack of a single term that describes the activities of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process,</b> leads to uncertainty in theory and practice of Constitutional law. The article deals with the analysis of the definition of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> in the Russian Federation. The article provides various scientific views on the question about the nature of <b>legislative</b> <b>process,</b> highlighted the theoretical and practical problems of this kind of constitutional process. Ultimately the author gives his own concept of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> in the Russian Federation. DOI:  [URL] </p...|$|R

50|$|In 2004 Beinisch {{criticized the}} use of {{expedited}} legislative mechanisms, often used by the Knesset to legislate various economic laws and reforms. She ruled that although judicial review of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> in Israeli does not recognize a ground of lack of “legislative due process”, the Court would intervene {{if there is a}} defect in the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> that “goes {{to the heart of the}} process.” Such a defect is one that involves a severe and substantial violation of the basic principles of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> in Israel’s parliamentary and constitutional system.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to identify the main developments of the Danish <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> within the past 10 years in order to evaluate the legitimacy {{and the quality of the}} process. Data concerning central parts of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> is examined and the analysis shows among other things an expansion in the number of informal political agreements ahead of the formal <b>legislative</b> <b>process.</b> This has a comprehensive impact on the transparency and publicity of the process. The analysis furthermore demonstrates that there today is less risk of short notice regarding the formal hearings, and that the government quite seldom speeds up the formal parliamentary <b>legislative</b> <b>process.</b> These results are examined by using a deliberative approach to democratic legitimacy by Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson. This is an idealistic perspective that sets up normative rules for a legitimate process concerning both procedural and substantive principals. Changes in both principals lead to the conclusion that the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> has become less deliberative and therefore less legitimate. In order to balance this view with the political reality we include the need for efficient govern-ment. These two perspectives – the legitimacy of the process and the comprehension of the need for efficiency – together form a notion of quality regarding the <b>legislative</b> <b>process.</b> This leads to a discussion of the changes within the quality of the process. We conclude, that there is a space of possibilities concerning strengthening of the deliberative aspect in order to balance deliberation and efficiency and optimize the quality of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to deal with and {{systematically}} describe the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> which is regulated by law and also the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> {{at the level of}} the government which has not been formalized completely. The phenomenon of <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> significantly influences the legal and social environment in the Czech Republic. The first and the second chapter is focused on theoretical definition of the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> and deals with the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> {{at the level of the}} Parliament. Special attention is paid to the lacks of legal regulation and practice, such as to changes implemented by the amendment of the Rules of Procedure of the Chamber of Deputies from 2015. It is also dealt with the Collection of Laws and its intended electronization. The third chapter is related to the position of the government within the <b>legislative</b> <b>process.</b> The government is the most important initiator of lawmaking, as it has the expert workers of ministries which create the legal drafts at its' disposal. Due to the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union, the government must deal with the topic of compatibility of the Czech and EU law. The level of compatibility depends especially on the quality work of individual ministries. Planning of legislation works is also connected to this [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{democratic}} deficit of the European Union The European Parliament in the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> of the European Union - {{in comparison with}} the position of the Bundestag This thesis examines the {{democratic deficit}} of the European Union based on the comparison of the position of the European Parliament in the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> of the European Union and the Bundestag in German <b>legislative</b> <b>process.</b> I chose the comparison with the Bundestag because out of all the Member States, the German political system and its <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> resembles the one of the European Union the most. The purpose of this thesis is to determine whether and to what extent, taking into consideration the strengthening of the European Parliament in recent years, we can still discuss the democratic deficit of the European Union, when the European Union citizens and their elected representatives were excluded from effective participation in the adoption of legislative acts. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part deals with the context of the democratic deficit of the European Union within the role of the European Parliament according to a number of leading authors on the issue of European integration. The second part is devoted to the <b>legislative</b> <b>process</b> in Germany, focusing on the position and role of the Bundestag in [...] ...|$|R
