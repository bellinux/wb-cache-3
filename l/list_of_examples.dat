25|$|Bog Bodies {{are human}} remains {{which have been}} found in peat bogs in various {{locations}} around the world. They have been preserved naturally in varying degrees due to the specific conditions of peat bogs. Despite their natural preservation, these remains are sensitive to deterioration after being removed from their original locations. Freeze-drying is an accepted method of preserving bog bodies in museum collections. Some notable bog body discoveries include the Tollund Man of Denmark, the Elling Woman of Denmark, the Cashel Man of Ireland, the Huldremose Woman of Denmark, the Girl of the Uchter Moor of Germany, the Lindow Man of England, and the Yde Girl of the Netherlands. For a more comprehensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples,</b> see List of bog bodies.|$|E
25|$|If the two {{terminal}} repeats in a solenoid do {{not physically}} interact, {{it leads to}} an open or linear structure. Members of this group are frequently rod- or crescent-shaped. The number of individual repeats can range from 2 to over 50. A clear advantage of this topology is that both the N- and C-terminal ends are free to add new repeats and folds, or even remove existing ones during evolution without any gross impact on the structural stability of the entire domain. This type of domain is extremely common among extracellular segments of receptors or cell adhesion molecules. A non-exhaustive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> include: EGF repeats, cadherin repeats, leucine-rich repeats, HEAT repeats, ankyrin repeats, armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, etc. Whenever a linear solenoid domain structure participates in protein-protein interactions, frequently at least 3 or more repetitive subunits form the ligand-binding sites. Thus - while individual repeats might have a (limited) ability to fold on their own – they usually cannot perform {{the functions of the}} entire domain alone.|$|E
500|$|Justice Samuel Alito wrote a {{separate}} concurring opinion, {{in which he}} was joined by Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Sonia Sotomayor. He agreed that content-based regulations present the same dangers as viewpoint-based regulations because content-based regulations [...] "may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth". He also agreed that the town's ordinance was [...] "replete with content-based distinctions" [...] that were subject to strict scrutiny. However, Justice Alito wrote separately to emphasize that the Court's opinion would not [...] "prevent cities from regulating signs in a way that fully protects public safety and serves legitimate esthetic objectives". To support his argument, Justice Alito provided a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> of content-neutral sign regulations, including: regulations that target the size of signs, regulations that target the locations at which signs may be placed, regulations distinguishing between lighted and unlighted signs, regulations that distinguish between the placement of signs on public and private property, rules that restrict the total number of signs [...] "per mile of roadway", and rules that distinguish between freestanding signs and signs that are attached to buildings.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the book}} Heroism and Gender in War Films (2014), the lyrics of [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "outline the perfect woman". The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what you give me to work with", the performers then offer an extensive <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as it fast unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they would much rather remain single: [...] "the kind of girl who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to go find herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons. You’ve got other plans".|$|E
2500|$|The long <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> in {{this article}} is only a partial {{indication}} of how often an interesting mathematical construction is an adjoint functor. [...] As a result, general theorems about left/right adjoint functors, such as the equivalence of their various definitions or the fact that they respectively preserve colimits/limits (which are also found in every area of mathematics), can encode the details of many useful and otherwise non-trivial results.|$|E
2500|$|To illustrate: {{one might}} be tempted to give as {{examples}} of qualia [...] "the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the redness of an evening sky". But this <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> already prejudges a central issue in the current debate on qualia. An analogy might make this clearer. Suppose someone wants to know the nature of the liquid crystal pixels on a television screen, those tiny elements that provide all the distributions of color that go to make up the picture. It would not suffice as an answer to say that they are the [...] "redness of an evening sky" [...] as it appears on the screen. We would protest that their real character was being ignored. One can see that relying on the list above assumes that we must tie sensations not only to the notion of given objects in the world (the [...] "head", [...] "wine", [...] "an evening sky"), but also to the properties with which we characterize the experiences themselves ("redness", for example).|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that [...] "selling arrangements" [...] would be presumed to {{not fall into}} TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected {{them in the same}} manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as [...] "in law and in fact" [...] it was an equally applicable [...] "selling arrangement" [...] (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so {{did not need to be}} justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect [...] "in fact" [...] particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were [...] "the only effective form of promotion enabling [...] to penetrate" [...] the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' [...] "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" [...] to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory [...] "race to the bottom", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.|$|E
2500|$|Relatively {{few cases}} are ever brought {{directly}} by consumers, given {{the complexity of}} litigation, cost, and its worth if claims are small. In order to ensure consumer protection laws are actually enforced, the Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction to bring consumer regulation cases on behalf of consumers after receiving complaints. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 section 70 and Schedule 3, the CMA has jurisdiction to collect and consider complaints, and then seek injunctions in the courts to stop businesses using unfair terms (under any legislation). The CRA 2015 is formally broader than UCTA 1977 in that it covers any unfair terms, not just exemption clauses, but narrower in that it only operates for consumer contracts. Under section 2, a consumer is an [...] "individual acting for purposes that are wholly or mainly outside that individual's trade, business, craft or profession." [...] However, while the United Kingdom could always opt for greater protection, when it translated the Directive into national law it opted to follow the bare minimum requirements, and not to cover every contract term. Under section 64, a court may only assess the fairness of terms that do not specify [...] "the main {{subject matter of the}} contract", or terms which relate to [...] "appropriateness of the price payable" [...] of the thing sold. Outside such [...] "core" [...] terms, a term may be unfair, under section 62 if it is not one that is individually negotiated, and if contrary to good faith it causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties. A <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>examples</b> of unfair terms are set out in Schedule 2. In DGFT v First National Bank plc the House of Lords held that given the purpose of consumer protection, the predecessor to section 64 should be construed tightly and Lord Bingham stated good faith implies fair, open and honest dealing. This all meant that the bank's practice of charging its (higher) default interest rate to customers who had (lower) interest rate set by a court under a debt restructuring plan could be assessed for fairness, but the term did not create such an imbalance given the bank wished only to have its normal interest. This appeared to grant a relatively open role for the Office of Fair Trading to intervene against unfair terms. However, in OFT v Abbey National plc the Supreme Court held that if a term related in any way to price, it could not by virtue of section 64 be assessed for fairness. All the High Street banks, including Abbey National, had a practice of charging high fees if account holders, unplanned, exceeded through withdrawals their normal overdraft limit. Overturning a unanimous Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court viewed that if the thing being charged for was part of a [...] "package" [...] of services, and the bank's remuneration for its services partly came from these fees, then there could be no assessment of the fairness of terms. This controversial stance was tempered by their Lordships' emphasis that any charges must be wholly transparent, though its compatibility with EU law is not yet established by the European Court of Justice, and it appears questionable that it would be decided the same way if inequality of bargaining power had been taken into account, as the Directive requires.|$|E
