50|$|<b>Leech</b> Lake outlets to the <b>Leech</b> Lake River, which {{flows into}} the Mississippi River. The sole outlet to the <b>Leech</b> Lake River is {{controlled}} by a dam in order to regulate water levels of the lake. <b>Leech</b> Lake has seven major inlets that include Portage Lake Creek, Sucker Creek, Steamboat River, Benedict River, Shingobee River, Bishop Creek, and the Boy River.

5|$|Mr. Poe {{leaves them}} with their Aunt Josephine, a kindly woman who is {{nonetheless}} obsessed with grammar and has irrational fears. Olaf appears disguised as Captain Sham to interfere with their plans again. One day, Josephine is not at the house, leaving what is apparently a suicide note; Klaus takes advantage of mistakes in the letter's grammar (which Josephine would never have tolerated) to decode her location; Curdled Cave. A hurricane sweeps through the town, ultimately destroying the house but allowing the children to flee before the structure falls apart. They sail to the cave and rescue her, but attract <b>leeches</b> due to Josephine having eaten a banana. Olaf appears and takes the kids with him, throwing Josephine off the boat and to the Lachrymose <b>Leeches</b> after she annoys him by correcting his speech.|$|E
5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, <b>leeches</b> (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an animal is to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its {{riparian}} zone {{are home to}} a variety of species. Caddisflies, clams and mussels, crayfish (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, <b>leeches,</b> chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar maples, black cherries, Norway maples, and red maples, while barberry, privet, holly, Japanese knotweed, honeysuckle, spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's riparian shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|E
5000|$|Al-Baghdadi's Mukhtarat fi al-Tibb {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} works on hirudotherapy. He introduced a more modern use for medicinal <b>leech,</b> stating that <b>leech</b> could be used for cleaning the tissues after surgical operations. He did, however, understand that there is a risk over using <b>leech,</b> and advised patients that <b>leech</b> need to be cleaned before being used and that the dirt or dust [...] "clinging to a <b>leech</b> should be wiped off" [...] before application. He further writes that after the <b>leech</b> has sucked out the blood, salt should be [...] "sprinkled on the affected part of the human body." ...|$|R

50|$|The 24-dimensional <b>Leech</b> lattice has a fixed-point-free {{automorphism}} {{of order}} 3. Identifying {{this with a}} complex cube root of 1 makes the <b>Leech</b> lattice into a 12 dimensional lattice over the Eisenstein integers, called the complex <b>Leech</b> lattice. The automorphism group of the complex <b>Leech</b> lattice is the universal cover 6 · Suz of the Suzuki group. This makes the group 6 · Suz · 2 into a maximal subgroup of Conway's group Co0 = 2 · Co1 of automorphisms of the <b>Leech</b> lattice, and shows that it has two complex irreducible representations of dimension 12. The group 6 · Suz acting on the complex <b>Leech</b> lattice {{is analogous to the}} group 2 · Co1 acting on the <b>Leech</b> lattice.|$|R
5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous stonefly, caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, <b>leeches,</b> crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E
5|$|Unwilling {{to allow}} the Aztecs to {{continue}} their practices, Madoc instigates war between the Aztecs and the much smaller Hoamen nation. While the Aztecs bring a large army, Madoc is able to use Welsh technology and superior tactics to overcome them. The Hoamen are able to take many prisoners while the Aztec king contracts a mortal illness. Following the battle Madoc shocks the Aztecs by releasing the prisoners instead of sacrificing them, and provides <b>leeches</b> to help the Aztec king recover from his disease. This leads to a treaty between the Aztecs and the Hoamen which abolishes human sacrifice. The Aztec priests fear to stop the practice, so the Aztec king decides that his people will abandon their religion and take up a monotheistic religion based on a God of love.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} bird families, {{pelicans}} {{are susceptible to}} a variety of parasites. Specialist feather lice of the genus Piagetella are found in the pouches of all species of pelican, but are otherwise only known from New World and Antarctic cormorants. Avian malaria is carried by the mosquito Culex pipens, and high densities of these biting insects may force pelican colonies to be abandoned. <b>Leeches</b> may attach to the vent or sometimes the inside of the pouch. A study of the parasites of the American white pelican found 75 different species, including tapeworms, flukes, flies, fleas, ticks and nematodes. Many of these do little harm, but flies may be implicated in the death of nestlings, particularly if they are weak or unwell, and the soft tick Ornithodoros capensis sometimes causes adults to desert the nest. Many pelican parasites are found in other bird groups, but several lice are very host-specific.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>Leech</b> has {{at times}} not {{dampened}} non-mutants like the Fantastic Four, <b>Leech</b> {{has also been}} shown to dampen abilities that are non-mutant in origin. <b>Leech</b> dampened Hazmat of the Avengers Academy, and during Marvel's Mutant Massacre crossover event, <b>Leech</b> negated the powers of the superhero team Power Pack, whose abilities were bestowed on them by an extraterrestrial.|$|R

50|$|Edward O. <b>Leech</b> {{was born}} on December 9, 1850, in Washington, D.C. where his father, Daniel D. Tompkins <b>Leech</b> (1810-1869) was an {{official}} with the United States Post Office and then the United States Department of the Treasury. Edward O. <b>Leech</b> was a direct lineal descendant of Lawrence Leach (1589-1662), a follower of Francis Higginson who settled in Salem, Massachusetts in 1629; Edward O. <b>Leech's</b> great-grandfather, Captain Hezekiah Leach fought in the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. Edward O. <b>Leech</b> was educated at Columbia University, receiving an A.B. in 1869.|$|R
5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, <b>leeches</b> and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Crossing into Afghanistan, {{the group}} found fresh water in an {{irrigation}} channel by a deserted hamlet. Albeit teeming with <b>leeches,</b> the water saved the group from dying of thirst. Marching {{for another two}} days, they reached the vicinity of Herat, where they made contact with Afghan authorities. Unsure what reception awaited them, von Hentig sent Barkatullah, an Islamic scholar of some fame, to advise the governor that the expedition had arrived and was bearing the Kaiser's message and gifts for the Emir. The governor sent a grand welcome, with noblemen bearing cloths and gifts, a caravan of servants, and a column of hundred armed escorts. The expedition was invited into the city as guests of the Afghan government. With von Hentig in the lead in his Cuirassiers uniform, they entered Herat on 24 August, in a procession welcomed by Turkish troops. They were housed at the Emir's provincial palace. They were officially met by the governor {{a few days later}} when, according to British agents, von Hentig showed him the Turkish Sultan's proclamation of jihad and announced the Kaiser's promise to recognise Afghan sovereignty and provide German assistance. The Kaiser also promised to grant territory to Afghanistan as far north as Samarkand in Russian Turkestan and as far into India as Bombay.|$|E
25|$|Green {{sea turtles}} {{have a variety}} of parasites {{including}} barnacles, <b>leeches,</b> protozoans, cestodes, and nematodes. Barnacles and <b>leeches</b> attach to the carapace and flippers of the turtles, which damage their tissues, shells, and lead to blood loss. Protozoans, cestodes and nematodes lead to many turtle deaths because of the infections in the liver and intestinal tract. The greatest disease threat to the turtle population is fibropapilloma, which produces lethal tumor growth on scales, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Fibropapilloma is caused by a herpesvirus that is transmitted via <b>leeches.</b>|$|E
