The benchmark rate used to price many US financial securities is the three-month US dollar <b>Libor</b> <b>rate.</b> Up until the mid-1980s, the Treasury bill rate was the leading reference rate. However, it eventually lost its benchmark status to Libor due to pricing volatility caused by periodic, large swings in the supply of bills. In general, offshore reference rates such as the US dollar <b>Libor</b> <b>rate</b> are preferred to onshore benchmarks since the former {{are less likely to}} be distorted by government regulations such as capital controls and deposit insurance.|$|E

It is found that short-term <b>libor</b> <b>rates</b> follow a random walk with time-varying volatility and with interest rate changes drawn from a distribution with fat tails, (sic). The nature of interest rate changes is sensitive to monetary regime: interest rate changes in the pre-ERM regime are drawn from a distribution with much faster tails than for the ERM regime. These statistical characterisations of <b>libor</b> <b>rates</b> are inconsistent with existing models for pricing interest rate and bond options, which assume either that interest rates follow a random walk with constant volatility, or that interest rates are mean-reverting. ...|$|R

The dynamics of overnight indexed swap and <b>LIBOR</b> <b>rates</b> are specified following the methodology of the affine LIBOR models and are driven by the wide and flexible class of affine processes.

5000|$|An {{interest}} rate cap is a derivative in which the buyer receives payments {{at the end of}} each period in which the {{interest rate}} exceeds the agreed strike price. An example of a cap would be an agreement to receive a payment for each month the <b>LIBOR</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds 2.5%. They are most frequently taken out for periods of between 2 and 5 years, although this can vary considerably. Since the strike price reflects the maximum interest rate payable by the purchaser of the cap, it is frequently a whole number integer, for example 5% or 7%. By comparison the underlying index for a cap is frequently a <b>LIBOR</b> <b>rate,</b> or a national interest rate. The extent of the cap is known as its notional profile and can change over the lifetime of a cap, for example, to reflect amounts borrowed under an amortizing loan.
