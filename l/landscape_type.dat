40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the {{contribution}} of ENVISAT ASAR data for the monitoring of the littoral plains of Kourou and Saint Laurent du Maroni (French Guyana). It presents results of qualitative and quantitative analyses of SAR ERS and ASAR ENVISAT data based on the following comparative criteria for <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> discrimination:- Comparison between SAR ERS and ASAR ENVISAT in same configuration acquisition (mode IS 2) - Seasonal influences (dry vs rainy season effects),- Incidence angle influences (exploitation of ASAR ENVISAT incidence angle range),- Polarization influences (exploitation of ASAR ENVISAT Image and Alternating Polarization modes data). The calibration of the different considered radar images allows their inter comparison {{in order to obtain}} information about <b>landscape</b> <b>type’s</b> properties (dielectric, moistures, real evolutions) and on homogeneous parcel of land. The study showed that different parameters, like the season, the incidence angle, and the polarization, strongly influence the radar signal observed over such <b>landscape</b> <b>types.</b> In addition, results show that ASAR-IS 2 mode, similar to ERS SAR configuration ensures the continuity of SAR ERS- 1 & 2 for land surface monitoring. However, it arises that discrimination between various <b>types</b> of <b>landscape</b> are confusing when analysing the backscattering coefficient values alone. The backscattering coefficients only cannot allow discriminating all the different landscape classes. Other parameters like texture, structure, geographical position, form and size are needed for <b>landscape</b> <b>type’s</b> discrimination from rada...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{employed}} to find spatial regularity in a complicated mountain landscape of Beijing, China {{on the basis of}} functional and structural affinities. The first approach applied Affinity Analysis based on species composition to landscape. The mosaic diversity of the landscape was 3. 5298 > 3, which means the study landscape is complex and controlled by multiple environmental gradients. These <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> were divided into 3 parts according to the mean affinity values of 0. 2143 and 0. 7857 (0 : 5 1 SD). Modal sites are the central <b>types</b> of the <b>landscape,</b> which include a zonal broad-leaved forest of the region and a conifer plantation replacing the former. Outliers are found in the highest altitude and the lowest, both have few species in common with the above two modal <b>types.</b> The remaining <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> are intermediate sites, which are transitional between modals and outliers, broadly distributed throughout mountain environments. Neighbor types have more species in common than those more widely separated, which probably distributed adjacently in space or in similar quality habitat. The other method employed is the new TWINSPAN analysis by substituting spatial neighboring data of <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> for species composition data. It clearly divided the <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> into three groups, i. e., subalpine, middle and low mountain groups, which were correlated with altitude, as well as influenced by human disturbance.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a detailed description}} and analysis of habitat and management differences between 89 pairs of organic and non-organic fields on 161 farms containing arable crops distributed throughout England. Data were derived at different scales ranging from field to landscape scale using a range of methods including: land manager questionnaires, habitat surveys {{and the use of}} large-scale landscape datasets. Organic farms were situated in inherently more diverse <b>landscape</b> <b>types,</b> had smaller field sizes, higher, wider and less gappy hedgerows subject to less frequent management, used rotational practices including grass, {{were more likely to be}} mixed farms and did not use artificial fertilisers and pesticides. Organic farms were associated with heterogeneous <b>landscape</b> <b>types.</b> However, even in such <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> the organic farming system produced greater field and farm complexity than farms employing a non-organic system. The findings of the study point to the importance of organic farming systems for maintaining landscape and local complexity with consequent benefits for biodiversity in arable farming landscapes. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|We have {{classified}} {{the archipelago}} of Puerto Rico into {{a set of}} homogeneous and coherent natural landscape units. Such a classification may serve as the basic division of the territory for use in research or in planning and land management efforts. The landscape units defined in this work consist of homogeneous regions-in terms of their structural, functional and visual characteristics-which have been shaped by natural abiotic factors. Four variables were considered in the analysis: elevation, slope, life zones, and geology. The information from these variables was processed with non-linear Principal Component Analysis, which extracted two components. These components were used in a K-means cluster analysis to define nine <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> (i. e., different groupings based on environmental characteristics). Two additional measures were obtained from this procedure and used in a subsequent analysis: cell membership values and the dissimilarity between <b>landscape</b> <b>types.</b> The strength of the grouping procedure was tested by using Multiple Discriminant Analysis, which found that 86 percent of the objects were correctly classified and that the whole classification process was significant. In addition, all variables {{were found to be}} significant during the classification process. The <b>landscape</b> <b>types,</b> the cell membership values, and the dissimilarity measure between <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> were all used to delineate fourteen landscape units of the archipelago of Puerto Rico.

40|$|The new {{typology}} of the landscapes of Belgium fits in {{the goal of}} the European Landscape Convention to characterise contemporary landscapes in a trans-regional and trans-border perspective. Belgium is a federal state and the Regions have the authority in landscape policy resulting in different approaches and regional landscape typologies. The method is proposed using a combination of holistic and parametric approaches at two scale levels to integrate different regional classifications. Four basic datasets covering Belgium as a whole were used: a digital terrain model, CORINE Land Cover, a soil map, and a Landsat 5 TM satellite image. Eighteen variables were defined from these datasets, describing the landscape characteristics of square kilometre cells at the first scale level. These variables are used to assign one of the 48 <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> to each cell. At the second scale level, the spatial patterns formed by the grid <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> are delineated into landscape units and described using <b>landscape</b> metrics. <b>Types</b> and patterns properties of the units are subsequently used in a hierarchical cluster analysis to define <b>landscape</b> character <b>types.</b> The new classification covers Belgium as a whole and integrates the regional classifications. The method also creates a landscape GIS-database with an open structure enhancing the characterisation of the landscapes. Both the kilometre cells at the first scale level as the landscape character areas at the second scale level are linked in the database. The variables used to differentiate <b>landscape</b> <b>types</b> and character areas can be extended by additional information and descriptive variables of very different sources relating for example to cultural, historical, and scenic properties and even iconographic documents. Thus the landscape character map is the entry to various queries for example to assess the evolution and time depth of forests and build up area per cell...|$|R
