Much of this excitement has centered on the claim that a certain class of quantum dimer model can support a quantum U(1) -liquid phase with deconfined fractional excitations in three dimensions. These fractional monomer excitations are quantum analogs of the magnetic monopoles found in spin ice. In this paper, we use extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations to establish the ground-state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on the three-dimensional diamond lattice {{as a function of the}} ratio mu of the potential to kinetic-energy terms in the Hamiltonian. We find that, for mu(c) = 0. 75 +/- 0. 02, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase transition from an ordered "R state" into an extended quantum U(1) -liquid phase, which terminates in a quantum critical Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point for mu = 1. This confirms the published field-theoretical scenario. We present detailed evidence for the existence of the U(1) -liquid phase and indirect evidence for the existence of its photon and monopole excitations. Simulations are benchmarked against a variety of exact and perturbative results, and a comparison is made of different variational wave functions.

An effective action proposed in arXiv: 1211. 4843 relates the partition function to the expectation value of a `potential' function of the S^ 1 holonomy in pure Chern-Simons theory; in several examples we compute the holonomy potential as a function of λ. We use level rank duality of pure Chern-Simons theory to demonstrate the equality of thermal partition functions of previously conjectured dual pairs of theories {{as a function of the}} temperature. We reduce the partition function to a matrix integral over holonomies. The summation over <b>flux</b> <b>sectors</b> quantizes the eigenvalues of this matrix in units of 2 π k and the eigenvalue density of the holonomy matrix is bounded from above by 1 / 2 πλ. The corresponding matrix integrals generically undergo two phase transitions as a function of temperature. For several Chern-Simons matter theories we are able to exactly solve the relevant matrix models in the low temperature phase, and determine the phase transition temperature as a function of λ. At low temperatures our partition function smoothly matches onto the N and λ independent free energy of a gas of non renormalized multi trace operators.

We also analysed data from 30 -minute traffic counts performed during those years. Results indicate that the city centre of Arnhem is a strong emission source of CO 2 compared to many other cities. The measured annual CO 2 flux equals about 8. 0 kgCm - 2 yr - 1. Heterogeneity within the footprint of the EC tower appeared to have no or only a small influence on the estimated annual and seasonal carbon <b>fluxes.</b> <b>Sector</b> analysis shows that CO 2 fluxes are consistently higher in sectors with the highest built-up surface fraction. However, no statistically significant relationship could be determined. Traffic and space-heating related burning of natural gas are the main emission sources. Weekly and diurnal variations in CO 2 flux are clearly correlated with traffic intensity, whereas seasonal variation can largely be explained by space heating demand. Partitioning of the total flux into a heating-related and traffic-related flux revealed that space heating accounts for up to 60 % to the total flux during winter. Traffic intensity remains more or less constant throughout the year. In summer, when space heating is absent, CO 2 emission is almost entirely related to traffic intensity. However, our estimations suggest that human respiration could have a non-negligible share in this. The contribution of the small fraction of urban green in the city centre is probably minimal. The annual emissions for the city centre estimated from our EC measurements are 20 - 25 % lower than those reported for the whole city by the official emission inventory. Climate projections for the Netherlands suggest that in 2050 Heating Degree Days would be reduced by 27 % resulting into a 32 % reduction of the heating-related emission flux, without a change in fossil fuel use. </p...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} Abstract. Simultaneous DMSP F 7 and Viking satellite {{measurements of}} the dawnside high-latitude auroral energy electron and ion precipitation show that {{the region of the}} low and middle altitude auroral precipitation consists of three characteristic plasma regimes. The recommendation of the IAGA Working Group IIF/III 4 at the IAGA Assembly in Boulder, July 1995 to decouple the nomenclature of ionospheric populations from magnetospheric population is used for their notation. The most equatorial regime is the Diffuse Auroral Zone (DAZ) of diffuse spatially unstructured precipitating electrons. It is generated by the plasma injection to the inner magnetosphere in the nightside and the subsequent drift plasma to the dawnside around the Earth. Precipitating particles have a hard spectrum with typical energies of electrons and ions of more than 3 keV. In the DAZ, the ion pitch-angle distribution is anisotropic, with the peak near 90 °. The next part is the Auroral Oval (AO), a structured electron regime which closely resembles the poleward portion of the night-side auroral oval. The typical electron energy is several keV, and the ion energy is up to 10 keV. Ion distributions are pre-dominantly isotropic. In some cases, this plasma regime may be absent in the pre-noon sector. Poleward of the Auroral Oval, there is the Soft Small Scale Luminosity (SSSL) regime. It is caused by structured electron and ion precipitation with typical electron energy of about 0. 3 keV and ion energy of about 1 keV. The connection of these low-altitude regimes with plasma domains of the distant magnetosphere is discussed. For mapping of the plasma regimes to the equatorial plane of the magnetosphere, the empirical model by Tsyganenko (1995) and the conceptual model by Alexeev et al. (1996) are used. The DAZ is mapped along the magnetic field lines to the Remnant Layer (RL), which is located in the outer radiation belt region; the zone of structured electrons and isotropic ion precipitation (AO) is mapped to the dawn periphery of the Central Plasma Sheet (CPS); the soft small scale structured precipitation (SSSL) is mapped to the outer magnetosphere close to the magnetopause, i. e. the Low Latitude Boundary Layer (LLBL). In the near-noon <b>sector,</b> earthward <b>fluxes</b> of soft electrons, which cause the Diffuse Red Aurora (DRA), are observed. The ion energies decrease with increasing latitude. The plasma spectra of the DRA regime are analogous to the spectra of the Plasma Mantle (PM). In the dawn sector, the large-scale field-aligned currents flow into the ionosphere at the SSSL latitudes (Region 1) and flow out at the AO or DAZ latitudes (Region 2). In the dawn and dusk sectors, the large-scale Region 1 and Region 2 FAC generation occurs in different plasma domains of the distant magnetosphere. The dawn and dusk FAC connection to the traditional Region 1 and Region 2 has only formal character, as FAC generating in various magnetospheric plasma domains integrate in the same region (Region 1 or Region 2). In the SSSL, there is anti-sunward convection; in the DAZ and the AO, there is the sunward convection. At PM latitudes, the convection is controlled by the azimuthal IMF component (B y). It is suggested to extend the notation of the plasma pattern boundaries, as proposed by Newell et al. (1996), for the nightside sector of the auroral oval to the dawn sector. Key words.

40|$|Abstract: Soon after a 222 Rn and 220 Rn {{survey in}} soil gases, {{performed}} (June 2005) {{in the frame}} of the “Diffuse Degassing in Italy” risk assessment project, a moderate earthquake (Mw= 4. 6) occurred in the Anzio offshore, on August, 22, 2005, only 5 miles from the Tor Caldara “Diffuse Degassing Structure” (DDS onward). Having available the pre-earthquake 222 Rn and 220 Rn grid-map on around 50 soil-gas points and being 222 Rn both a stress-pathfinder and a discriminative component of activated-faults, a mirror-like survey was repeated on the same 50 sites, soon after the close earthquake. Later, during a quiescent-aseismic period (December, 2005), a CO 2 flux survey was performed for the same 50 sites, adding detailed measurements (more than 100 sites) for the highest <b>flux</b> <b>sectors.</b> The aim of this survey was both to have an overall picture of the “background” CO 2 flux and to calculate the total budget of CO 2 flux throughout the DDS, to better interpret the 222 Rn and 220 Rn areal surveys before and after the seismic event. Herewith, we distinguish the contribution of organic, diffusive and advective CO 2 flux. Hints of convection and strong degassing linked to the fracture field, inside the DDS, have been envisaged on selected points, where continuous monitoring stations could be strategic, for seismic, volcanic and NGH surveillance. Despite we found higher 222 Rn values in soils after the earthquake, suggesting an enhanced local degassing probably linked to a stress signal throughout the DDS as a whole, the results highlight an unmodified shape and location of the 222 Rn anomalies before and after the earthquake. This evidence excludes both that the activated seismogenic segment has affected in some ways both the DDS degassing patterns and that fracture field changed. A similar result could be expected if the activated fault was oriented along the DDS itself and reached the surface. This evidence is well correlated with the reconstructed focal mechanism of the earthquake, pertaining to the transfer structure of the Ardea Graben, located along a peripheral sector of the degassing Alban Hills volcano and intersecting the DDS Tor Caldara itself. The shape and location of 222 Rn anomalies inside the DDS for both the surveys are strictly inversely correlated with the areal CO 2 flux data. The geometry of the degassing pathways is probably linked to the “barrier action” (sealing power) of the clays cropping out in the study area. These clays are generated by the strong leaching of the outcropping sedimentary Pleistocene rocks due to the huge flux of volcanic gas -rich fluids...|$|R
