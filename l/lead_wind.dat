40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{generation}} of persistent currents in Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold gases confined in a ring. This phenomenon has been recently investigated in an experiment [Nature 506, 200 (2014) ], where hysteresis loops have been observed in the activation of quantized persistent currents by rotating weak links. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of 3 D stationary currents with non-quantized angular momentum. They are generated by families of solitary waves that show a continuous variation in the angular momentum, and provide a bridge between different winding numbers. We show {{that the size of}} hysteresis loops is determined by the range of existence within the weak link region of solitary waves which configure the energy barrier preventing phase slips. The barrier vanishes when the critical rotation <b>leads</b> <b>winding</b> numbers and solitonic states to a matching configuration. At this point, Landau and Feynman criteria for phase slips meet: the fluid flow reaches the local speed of sound, and stationary vortex lines (which are the building blocks of solitons) can be excited inside the system.

40|$|We {{show how}} the superconducting phase {{difference}} in a Josephson junction {{may be used to}} split the Kramers degeneracy of its energy levels and to remove all the properties associated with time reversal symmetry. The superconducting phase difference is known to be ineffective in two-terminal short Josephson junctions, where irrespective of the junction structure the induced Kramers degeneracy splitting is suppressed and the ground state fermion parity must stay even, so that a protected zero-energy Andreev level crossing may never appear. Our main result is that these limitations can be completely avoided by using multi-terminal Josephson junctions. There the Kramers degeneracy breaking becomes comparable to the superconducting gap, and applying phase differences may cause the change of the ground state fermion parity from even to odd. We prove that the necessary condition for the appearance of a fermion parity switch is the presence of a "discrete vortex" in the junction: the situation when the phases of the superconducting <b>leads</b> <b>wind</b> by 2 π. Our approach offers new strategies for creation of Majorana bound states as well as spin manipulation.

40|$|Problem statement: A {{widely held}} belief {{that climate change}} has impacts on {{sustainable}} fish catch leads us {{to find out how}} these effects influence fish landings in Sabah, Malaysia, especially for the west and east coasts, based upon monsoonal periods. Correlation of fish landings with rainfall suggests that local fish landing is believed {{to be sensitive to the}} effects of climate change. Approach: Rainfall, temperature, wind, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and fish landings time series for 3 specific regions (Kota Kinabalu (KK), Tawau and Sandakan) have been studied using available local data for the last 9 years. Results: Results indicated significant fish landing variations due to the fluctuation of these meteorological parameters, for example, ~ 20 % reduction is found during Northeast (NE) monsoon at KK. Heavy rainfall correlates well with high fish landings when fish landings lead rainfall by 1 month. Fish landings and temperature were also highly correlated. Fish landings <b>leads</b> <b>wind</b> stress by 1 - 2 months with 99 % certainty and it is high when the wind direction is between 150 - 200 ° from north (approximately for South Easterlies and South Westerlies). Conclusion: The results confirmed that fish landing is low during NE monsoon period. In regard to the effect of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), low or negative SOI indicates high fish landings...|$|R
