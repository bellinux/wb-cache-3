40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the amount of external spray residues that accumulate on farm sprayers and tractors. Six different sprayers were examined, Airtec, conventional sprayer (three types of nozzles, TeeJet XR, <b>Lurmark</b> DriftBeta and Hardi Injet), Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoft and Släpduk. The study does not include accidental spillage from supply tanks or leakage from pipes etc. that may occur in everyday practise. A tracer dye, Nigrosin WLF, was added to the spray liquid. After spraying the sprayer and tractor were washed over a catchment pool containing a fixed volume of water. A small centrifugal pump was used to re—circulate the water. The concentrations of Nigrosin in the rinse water and in the spray liquid were determined by using a spectrophotometer. By comparing these concentrations, the amount of Nigrosin immobilised on the tractor and sprayer was determined. The sprayer was divided into two areas that were rinsed separately, the booms and the tank (every part of the sprayer except for the booms). The tractor was also divided into two areas, the front (radiator, bonnet and engine) and the back (the rest). All wheels were excluded. An average of between 0, 01 % - 0, 60 % of the sprayed tracer dye (active substance) was found on the tractor and sprayer after spraying had been carried out. The largest accumulation, 50 - 98 % of the accumulated deposition, was observed on the booms. The largest deposition was observed on the air-assisted sprayers, Kyndestoft (0, 60 % of the sprayed amount) and Hardi Twin (0, 46 %). Släpduk received the third largest deposition (0, 36 %). 0, 06 % of the sprayed tracer dye was observed on Danfoil and Airtec. The deposition on the conventional sprayer with TeeJet XR nozzles was 0, 04 % and on the same sprayer with <b>Lurmark</b> DriftBeta 0, 02 %. Hardi lnjet nozzles mounted on the conventional sprayer gave a deposition of 0, 01 %. Residues on contaminated sprayers can be released by rain and may cause local doses that significantly exceed approved amounts. To avoid contamination of surface and ground waters, it is wise to practise decontamination not on the farmyard where the topsoil often has been replaced by gravel, but on the field. Parking and filling can be done on a biobed, i. e. a construction that keeps the spill from going further down in the soil profile, to the ground water. In the biobed, herbicides and pesticides are contained and quickly decomposed...|$|E
40|$|The BCPC spray quality {{classification}} system utilises the <b>Lurmark</b> 31 - 03 -F 110 (F 110 / 1. 2 / 3. 0) flat fan nozzle to discriminate the threshold between the classes of Fine and Medium spray. This reference nozzle has also now {{been used to}} classify the spray drift potential for other spray nozzle-pressure combinations. This paper discusses whether such a reference nozzle {{can be described in}} general terms (F 110 / 1. 2 / 3. 0 or ISO 03) or needs more detail by specifying source of manufacturer, type and construction material. Comparisons of performance were made between twelve equivalent rated commercially available nozzles for spray distribution on a patternator, and spray quality and drop speed measurements with a PDPA laser. Drop size and speed data have then been used to calculate spray drift potential for standard conditions with the IDEFICS drift model. Despite identical commercial ratings, large differences can occur for spray distribution and spray quality. Calculated spray drift potential for some nozzle types could even be double that of the currently used BCPC Fine/Medium reference nozzle. It is concluded that for the classification of nozzles towards spray drift reduction classes, a unique, a detailed specification of reference nozzle is needed. Nozzles from different manufacturers of alternative designs and construction materials do affect performance too much to be freely chosen as a reference, despite their consistent specifications for spray pressure, flow rate and top angle (ISO 03 series) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare a selection of spray application techniques with different application volumes, with respect to the spray liquid distribution on flat surfaces, the deposition in fully developed crops and the biological effect. The spray application techniques in this study were conventional spray technique with three different nozzles: Teelet XR, Lechler ID and <b>Lurmark</b> DriftBeta, and also AirTec, Danfoil, Hardi Twin, Kyndestoit and Släpduk. The dynamic spray liquid distribution was measured on a flat surface, spraying a water and black dye solution on pre-glued wallpaper lengths. Spraying the same dye-water solution in established crops, the spray deposition on plant and on the ground was studied by measuring the absorbance of sampled leafs' and collectors' rinsing water. Spray deposition studies were made in winter wheat and potato. The biological effect was studied in field experiments with plots with linearly increased dose. The field trials in this study were weed control in spring barley, fungi control in winter wheat and potato late blight control. The weed weight was sampled and visual assessments were made of the infection of fungi. Grain yield and 1000 -kernel-weight were sampled in the wheat trial. The dynamic spray liquid distribution resulted in coefficients of variation, for all spray techniques, between 5 % and 16 %, which were considered to be at acceptable levels. Relatively large significant differences were found in the spray deposition measurements in potato canopies. For conventional spray technique, 90 % spray deposition was recovered in the top of the canopy. Higher deposition was recovered in the lower part of the canopy and on the ground for Danfoil, Hardi Twin and Släpduk than the other techniques. In the wheat crop, the differences in spray deposition between spray techniques were smaller. Släpduk had the greatest increase in liquid deposition on the head and the flag leaf. The techniques with external air assistance, Hardi Twin and Kyndestoft, had the lowest deposition on the ground. Analysing the effect of weed control in spring barley, fungi control in wheat and potato late blight control, no significant differences were found. This might be seemed remarkable when large differences in spray liquid deposition were found in the potato canopy. One conclusion could be that the penetration ability in dense potato canopies is not of equal importance as to protect the upper parts of the canopy. It is indicated that it could be important to consider other factors, not included in this study, such as the ability to reduce drift and increase capacity, when selecting spray application techniqu...|$|E
