40|$|This essay {{argues that}} the public defender should not undertake, or fail to undertake, any action to the <b>legal</b> <b>detriment</b> of a client {{on the basis of}} a {{conflict}} the attorney perceives between religious and professional responsibility, except for imminent death or serious bodily harm to another. Having accepted the responsibility of representing indigent criminal defendants, the public defender is duty-bound to not compromise that responsibility for competing religious obligations. This argument rests on four premises: (1) the public defender occupies a unique position in our legal system, and options available to private interest lawyers or other clients should not be available to the public defender; (2) any deviation from the governing professional constraints in representing a client that stems from conflicting religious belief and harms the client is both professional unethical and immoral; (3) religion is at best equivocal in addressing the propriety of specific actions taken or urged on behalf of clients; and (4) the appropriate role of religion in the work of a public defender is that of individual inspiration, or motivation to work to change the professional code or the criminal jutstice system itself...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the metaphor}} of silencing, Professor Margaret Montoya {{documents}} the irrelevance of race, gender, and socio-historical perspectives both in legal education and, more broadly, in legal discourse. Although others have invoked this metaphor, Professor Montoya 2 ̆ 7 s charting of the physical, rather than merely metaphorical, space of silence moves beyond this legal literature in several respects. Viewing silence not just as dead space, Professor Montoya enlivens and colors silence and other nonverbal aspects of communication as positive cultural traits. She demonstrates how silence {{can be used as}} a pedagogical tool (a centrifugal force) in the classroom and in client interviews to bring out the voices of women and of men of color. Moreover, Professor Montoya documents how silence and nonverbal communication, rich with cultural meaning, are misread to the <b>legal</b> <b>detriment</b> of the (non) speaker and others dependent on cross-cultural understanding. Professor Bender’s own experiences in the classroom, an Ethnic Studies classroom filled with students committed to the study and progressive practice of law, validate many of Professor Montoya 2 ̆ 7 s experiences and observations. In Part I, he discusses his own experiences with respect to silence and race in an Ethnic Studies classroom. In Part II, he addresses the challenges his undergraduate students face in their journey to become progressive lawyers. In Part III, he examines some of the doctrinal pitfalls encountered by new lawyers aspiring to use the law as a mechanism for achieving social justice. Finally, Professor Bender concludes by discussing the apparent irrelevance of Latino/a perspectives in legal education...|$|E
50|$|Decriminalization {{reflects}} changing {{social and}} moral views. A society may come {{to the view that}} an act is not harmful, should no longer be criminalized, or is otherwise not a matter to be addressed by the criminal justice system. Examples of subject matter which {{have been the subject of}} changing views on criminality over time in various societies and countries include:While decriminalized acts are no longer crimes under local or state law, they may still be the subject of penalties under federal law; for example a monetary fine in place of a criminal charge for the possession of a decriminalized drug. This should be contrasted with legalization, which removes all or most <b>legal</b> <b>detriments</b> from a previously illegal act. It has also been noted that while some acts have been decriminalised, such as homosexuality and adultery, others have increased in their criminalisation, such as familial sexual activities, or incest.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} {{indicative}} research examining {{the effectiveness of}} the British government's National Minimum Wage enforcement, a subject not previously investigated. The law, it has been argued, largely provides the tools needed for effective enforcement. Employer compliance levels as measurable from government statistics are, however, unclear and there are therefore no solid grounds for assuming that the current balance between employer 'self regulation' and enforcement is appropriate. The research reveals significant problems with the enforcement process; only a minority of workers in our sample received their <b>legal</b> rights without <b>detriment.</b> For many workers, the process entailed significant costs. The current system of 'light touch' self-regulation, may not be suitable where vulnerable workers without the support of any collective representation, are concerned. Recommendations for improvements in the enforcement process are made but we also note the relevance of the national political context for ensuring that the regulatory body has sufficient support to operate effectively...|$|R
40|$|It is {{not often}} that a {{judgment}} contains a reference to Aristotle’s work or a coda at its conclusion. The recent Singapore Court of Appeal judgment of Gay Choon Ing v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter (delivered by Andrew Phang JA) contained both, the latter of which an extensive judicial exposition on the difficulties (and tentative solutions) relating to the contractual doctrine of consideration. This re-evaluation of consideration at the slightest opportunity is unsurprising, given the conceptual problems that have afflicted the doctrine. There have been various judicial solutions, generally capable of classification into two distinct types: first, through an internal re-definition of concepts within consideration (for example, the equation of factual and <b>legal</b> benefit or <b>detriment</b> in Williams v Roffey Bros 2 ̆ 6 Nicholls (Constructors) Ltd); second, {{through the application of}} an external doctrine in conjunction with or in replacement of consideration (for example, the arguable substitution of promissory estoppel for consideration in Collier v P 2 ̆ 6 MJ Wright (Holdings) Ltd). For convenience, the former type will be termed the ‘internal solution’, and the latter termed the ‘external solution’. The application of either type of solution has different implications about the continued utility of consideration. Whilst leaving its final conclusion deliberately undecided, the Court in Gay Choon Ing seemingly preferred an external solution, providing yet another string to the bow for the abolition of consideration in contract law, at least in the Singapore context. However, questions remain as to the consequences of such abolition, particularly when, as this comment will suggest, there is insufficient recognition of the distinction between (and consequences of) internal and external solutions to the considerable problems of consideration...|$|R
40|$|Defence lawyers, {{in their}} practise, {{from time to}} time have to resolve various {{difficult}} dilemmas in connection with the client relationship, such as accepting repugnant cases or acting on questionable instructions from the client: dilemmas, which involve “hard questions” of guilt and innocence, truth and perjury. Many of these ethi-cal problems have never been subjected to interpretation in Swedish law and legal literature. Somehow, the law-yer will have to find a solution to her problem, without the aid of rules. The debate, as well as case law studies, indicate that one practitioner’s solution to a certain dilemma will be completely different from another’s. Which basic ideas concerning the role of the defence lawyer lie beneath the fact that two different lawyers, act-ing within the same legal system, can justify two conflicting ways of resolving an identical dilemma? The thesis studies this problem through an analysis of the arguments pro et contra the particular solution to the dilemma. Which solutions to the dilemma are clearly acceptable within the boundaries of the law, or could at least be in-terpreted as being in accordance with the law? This question is answered by an extensive analysis of the princi-ples of Swedish case law, statutes, professional standards and doctrine. The purpose of this thesis is to bring some order to the debate concerning lawyers’ ideals in Sweden and to try and understand the role of the lawyer by choosing typical practical problems and examining these problems from a normative point of view. The thesis argues that the explanation to the conflicting ways of resolving practical dilemmas lies in the con-flicting ideals, which guide practitioners. My study indicates that there are several such ideals in existence. In order to argue efficiently and clarify the dichotomy, I have used two main ideals, which are the opposite ex-tremes of the lawyers’ ideals; one client-dominant and one lawyer-dominant. It would seem that these different ideal types can co-exist in most typical Western <b>legal</b> systems without <b>detriment</b> to the clients or the State...|$|R
