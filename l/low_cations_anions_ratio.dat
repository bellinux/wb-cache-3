40|$|The mid-IR {{spectra of}} six large, {{irregular}} PAHs with formulae (C 84 H 24 – C 120 H 36) have been computed using Density Functional Theory (DFT). Trends {{in the dominant}} band positions and intensities are compared to those of large, compact PAHs {{as a function of}} geometry, size and charge. Irregular edge moieties that are common in terrestrial PAHs, such as bay regions and rings with quartet hydrogens, are shown to be uncommon in astronomical PAHs. As for all PAHs comprised solely of C and H reported to date, mid-IR emission from irregular PAHs fails to produce a strong CCstr band at 6. 2 µm, the position characteristic of the important, class A astronomical PAH spectra. Earlier studies showed inclusion of nitrogen within a PAH shifts this to 6. 2 µm for PAH cations. Here we show this band shifts to 6. 3 µm in nitrogenated PAH anions, close to the position of the CC stretch in class B astronomical PAH spectra. Thus nitrogenated PAHs may be important in all sources and the peak position of the CC stretch near 6. 2 µm appears to directly reflect the PAH <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> <b>ratio.</b> Large irregular PAHs exhibit features at 7. 8 µm but lack them near 8. 6 µm. Hence, the 7. 7 µm astronomical feature is produced by a mixture of small and large PAHs while the 8. 6 µm band can only be produced by large compact PAHs. As with the CCstr, the position and profile of these bands reflect the PAH <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> <b>ratio...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} kinetics of CaCO 3 /BaCO 3 and BaSO 4 /SrSO 4 {{solid solution}} systems is studied in this research. A CaCO 3 -precoated stainless steel plug flow reactor is developed {{to study the}} CaCO 3 /BaCO 3 system. Ba 2 + is found to partition into Calcite solid at low concentration, but at high concentration, it can ion exchange for the Ca 2 + ions or poison the Calcite surface and result in dissolution. Beaker study of BaSO 4 /SrSO 4 shows the presence of Ba 2 + can accelerate the precipitation of SrSO 4. Also a linear relationship is found between the saturation index of BaSO 4 and SrSO 4 during the precipitation process. The influence of background electrolyte is also discussed.

40|$|Given {{significant}} challenges with available {{measurements of}} aerosol acidity, proxy methods are frequently {{used to estimate}} the acidity of atmospheric particles. In this study, four {{of the most common}} aerosol acidity proxies are evaluated and compared: (1) the ion balance method, (2) the molar ratio method, (3) thermodynamic equilibrium models, and (4) the phase partitioning of ammonia. All methods are evaluated against predictions of thermodynamic models and against direct observations of aerosol–gas equilibrium partitioning acquired in Mexico City during the Megacity Initiative: Local and Global Research Objectives (MILAGRO) study. The ion balance and molar ratio methods assume that any deficit in inorganic <b>cations</b> relative to <b>anions</b> is due to the presence of H + and that a higher H + loading and lower <b>cation</b> / <b>anion</b> <b>ratio</b> both correspond to increasingly acidic particles (i. e., lower pH). Based on the MILAGRO measurements, no correlation is observed between H + levels inferred with the ion balance and aerosol pH predicted by the thermodynamic models and NH 3 –NH 4 + partitioning. Similarly, no relationship is observed between the <b>cation</b> / <b>anion</b> molar <b>ratio</b> and predicted aerosol pH. Using only measured aerosol chemical composition as inputs without any constraint for the gas phase, the E-AIM (Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model) and ISORROPIA-II thermodynamic equilibrium models tend to predict aerosol pH levels that are inconsistent with the observed NH 3 –NH 4 + partitioning. The modeled pH values from both E-AIM and ISORROPIA-II run with gas + aerosol inputs agreed well with the aerosol pH predicted by the phase partitioning of ammonia. It appears that (1) thermodynamic models constrained by gas + aerosol measurements and (2) the phase partitioning of ammonia provide the best available predictions of aerosol pH. Furthermore, neither the ion balance nor the molar ratio can be used as surrogates for aerosol pH, and previously published studies with conclusions based on such acidity proxies may need to be reevaluated. Given the significance of acidity for chemical processes in the atmosphere, the implications of this study are important and far reaching...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the molecular beam epitaxy growth of highly strained InGaAs on GaAs(100) {{as a function of}} the <b>anion</b> to <b>cation</b> flux <b>ratio.</b> Using reflection high energy electron diffraction the evolution of the film morphology is monitored and the surface lattice constant is measured. It is found that the <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> flux <b>ratio</b> dramatically affects the growth mode. Under arsenic‐rich conditions, growth is characterized by a two‐dimensional (2 D) to three‐dimensional (3 D) morphological transformation. However, for cation‐stabilized conditions, 3 D islanding is completely suppressed, and 2 D planar growth is observed. We associate these differences in the growth mode with corresponding changes in the surface tension of the overlayer. A high surface tension stabilizes 2 D growth. An analysis which relates surface tension to a critical thickness for the onset of coherent island formation supports this view...|$|R
40|$|Until {{recently}} {{the influence of}} solution stoichiometry on calcite crystal growth kinetics has attracted little attention, {{despite the fact that}} in most aqueous environments calcite precipitates from non-stoichiometric solution. In order to account for the dependence of the calcite crystal growth rate on the <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> <b>ratio</b> in solution, we extend the growth model for binary symmetrical electrolyte crystals of Zhang and Nancollas (1998) by combining it with the surface complexation model for the chemical structure of the calcite-aqueous solution interface of Wolthers et al. (2008). To maintain crystal stoichiometry, the rate of attachment of calcium ions to step edges is assumed to equal the rate of attachment of carbonate plus bicarbonate ions. The model parameters are optimized by fitting the model to the step velocities obtained previously by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Teng et al., 2000; Stack and Grantham, 2010). A variable surface roughness factor is introduced in order to reconcile the new process-based growth model with bulk precipitation rates measured in seeded calcite growth experiments. For practical applications, we further present empirical parabolic rate equations fitted to bulk growth rates of calcite in common background electrolytes and in artificial seawater-type solutions. Both the process-based and empirical growth rate equations agree with measured calcite growth rates over broad ranges of ionic strength, pH, solution stoichiometry and degree of supersaturation.

40|$|The {{mid-infrared}} {{spectra of}} large PAHs ranging from C 54 H 18 to C 130 H 28 are determined computationally using Density Functional Theory. Trends {{in the band}} positions and intensities {{as a function of}} PAH size, charge and geometry are discussed. Regarding the 3. 3, 6. 3 and 11. 2 micron bands similar conclusions hold as with small PAHs. This does not hold for the other features. The larger PAH <b>cations</b> and <b>anions</b> produce bands at 7. 8 micron and, as PAH sizes increases, a band near 8. 5 micron becomes prominent and shifts slightly to the red. In addition, the average anion peak falls slightly to the red of the average cation peak. The similarity in behavior of the 7. 8 and 8. 6 micron bands with the astronomical observations suggests that they arise from large, cationic and anionic PAHs, with the specific peak position and profile reflecting the PAH <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> concentration <b>ratio</b> and relative intensities of PAH size. Hence, the broad astronomical 7. 7 micron band is produced by a mixture of small and large PAH <b>cations</b> and <b>anions,</b> with small and large PAHs contributing more to the 7. 6 and 7. 8 micron component respectively. For the CH out-of-plane vibrations, the duo hydrogens couple with the solo vibrations and produce bands that fall at wavelengths slightly different than their counterparts in smaller PAHs. As a consequence, previously deduced PAH structures are altered in favor of more compact and symmetric forms. In addition, the overlap between the duo and trio bands may reproduce the blue-shaded 12. 8 micron profile. Comment: ApJ, 36 pages, 9 fig...|$|R
40|$|Nutritional and {{management}} strategies for dairy cattle {{are designed to}} prepare the cow for lactation and to minimize the incidence of metabolic diseases around calving. However, strategies initiated during the dry period should also consider the potential ef-fects on the calf prior to and after calving. Fetal requirements for energy and protein are significant, particularly during the last trimester of gestation. Energy requirements increase to 1. 3 to 1. 5 times maintenance in late pregnancy; therefore, the formu-lation of rations for dry cows must contain sufficient energy to support fetal growth plus maintenance. Pro-tein requirements during pregnancy increase, partic-ularly during the last 2 mo. Colostrum {{is a source of}} immune components and nutrients to the neonate and contains more protein, immunoglobulins (Ig), nonprotein nitrogen, fat, ash, vitamins, and minerals than does milk. Because some vitamins do not cross the placental barrier, colostrum is the primary source of these nutrients for the calf after birth. Colostrum from cows that are not supplemented with vitamin E during the dry period may provide inadequate vita-min E to calves after birth. The Ig concentration in colostrum is not markedly affected by prepartum pro-tein nutrition; diets containing high crude protein (CP) generally increase the nonprotein fraction of colostrum, but low CP diets do not affect the CP or Ig concentration of colostrum. However, data from beef calves suggest that absorption of IgG may be im-paired when low protein diets are fed during the dry period. Diets for dry cows may be balanced to reduce the <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> <b>ratio,</b> which may reduce the inci-dence of parturient paresis. Recent research also sug-gests that these diets might increase the incidence of calves born in respiratory acidosis, which may impair the acquisition of passive immunity...|$|R

The atom pair interaction energy parameters for various surface configurations were obtained from the first principle calculations. The other model parameters needed in the description of the kinetic processes are obtained from the available experimental data. The ordering kinetics is studied as a function of fluxes, flux ratio and growth temperature. The degree of ordering is estimated in terms of the short range order parameter. The short range order parameter increases with temperature till 650 °K and 7502 ̆ 7 K for <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> flux <b>ratios</b> 2 : 1 and 1 : 5, respectively. Beyond this critical temperature, the short range order parameter decreases. This critical temperature is identified as the kinetic order-disorder temperature. The order-disorder phenomenon observed in this theoretical study is explained in terms of the dependence of the surface migration rate of the cations on the growth temperature. The dependence on the order-disorder temperature on the flux ratio is attributed to decreased surface migration for larger flux ratios...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the individual activity coefficients of pure 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 electrolytes using our theory {{that is based}} on the competition of ion-ion (II) and ion-water (IW) interactions (Vincze et al., J. Chem. Phys. 133, 154507, 2010). The II term is computed from Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations {{on the basis of the}} implicit solvent model of electrolytes using hard sphere ions with Pauling radii. The IW term is computed on the basis of Born's treatment of solvation using experimental hydration free energies. The two terms are coupled through the concentration-dependent dielectric constant of the electrolyte. With this approach we are able to reproduce the nonmonotonic concentration dependence of the mean activity coefficient of pure electrolytes qualitatively without using adjustable parameters. In this paper, we show that the theory can provide valuable insight into the behavior of individual activity coefficients too. We compare our theoretical predictions against experimental data measured by electrochemical cells containing ion-specific electrodes. As in the case of the mean activity coefficients, we find good agreement for 2 : 1 electrolytes, while the accuracy of our model is worse for 1 : 1 systems. This deviation in accuracy is explained by the fact that the two competing terms (II and IW) are much larger in the 2 : 1 case so errors in the two separate terms have less effects. The difference of the excess chemical potentials of <b>cations</b> and <b>anions</b> (the <b>ratio</b> of activity coefficients) is determined by asymmetries in the properties of the two ions: charge, radius, and hydration free energies.

Experimental work on the surface roughening processes during MBE growth by monitoring the reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} (RHEED) intensity concluded that the surface roughening is a result of competition between surface roughening processes such as adsorption and evaporation and the surface smoothening process such as surface migration to stable sites. In this work, the stochastic model of MBE growth is employed to study the surface roughening kinetics in GaAs (100). The growth condition was chosen similar to that of experiments: temperature range of study: 773 – 873 °K; <b>cation</b> to <b>anion</b> flux <b>ratio</b> in the range: 1 : 10 to 1 : 20. Diatomic arsenic molecular specie is employed for the study was As 2. The time averaged RHEED intensity was obtained from the growth data and with the experimental results. The agreement between the results was excellent. A transition temperature at which the time averaged RHEED intensity is a maximum was observed for flux ratios 1 : 10 and 1 : 20. The RHEED intensity increases with temperature till the transition temperature due to surface smoothening resulting from the surface migration of Ga and As to energetically favorable sites. The RHEED intensity decreases beyond the transition temperature due to the evaporation of As from the surface. The transition temperature is observed to be a function of the flux ratio and {{can be explained by the}} difference in time for the formation of energetically stable surface atom clusters resulting from the difference in the effective surface migration rates for various flux ratios...|$|R
