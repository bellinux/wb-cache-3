5|$|The {{council was}} first called on 11 October 1147 by Eugene, who ordered the bishops and others {{summoned to the}} council to {{assemble}} at Trier on 21 March 1148. This is from a <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> to Henry Zdík, the Bishop of Olmuetz by the pope. However, a <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> by the pope on the next day, 12 October 1147, to Eberhard, the Archbishop of Salzburg, named Troyes as the location for the council. It is likely that Troyes, however, was a scribal error, as a further letter of Eugene's, to Suger, Abbot of St Denis, dated 6 October 1147, named Trier as the location also, thus confirming the location given in the letter of 11 October.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} Ephraim Fabricant {{was named}} for real-life murderer Valery Fabrikant, a mechanical engineering professor who shot dead four of his colleagues in {{what became known as}} the Concordia University massacre. In addition, the character's back-story and demise were both intended to echo the case of Jack the Ripper—both were believed to be medically trained, while the use of Fabricant's kidney to send a message is based on the From Hell <b>letter,</b> <b>sent</b> to the police by the Ripper along with one of his victims' kidneys.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Tour, rugby in Scotland was a game of the upper classes, and the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) was very conservative. Their {{officials}} believed the game should remain strictly amateur, and that rugby was for the players, not the spectators. The Scottish were uncomfortable with the public interest in the All Blacks, and did not make them feel very welcome. They interpreted a <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> to them stating that the All Blacks {{did not want to be}} entertained after their match quite literally, and the All Blacks were not invited to the after-match dinner organised by the Scottish Union. As well as this, the SRU refused to grant international caps for the game.|$|E
5|$|Correspondence between Chesney and {{his nephew}} Gilbert Foliot {{suggests}} {{their relationship was}} quite close. Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election.

Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum in an English source.

5|$|In November 1533, {{before the}} {{appearance}} of the fifth edition, Sepúlveda sent Erasmus a description of the ancient Vatican manuscript, informing him that it differed from the text which he had edited in favour of the Vulgate in 365 places. We do not know anything about these 365 readings except for one. Erasmus in Adnotationes to Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex from the Library Pontifici (i.e. Codex Vaticanus) name of the island is καυδα (Cauda), not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his Novum Testamentum (Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, cauda). In another <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> to Erasmus in 1534 Sepúlveda informed him, that Greek manuscripts were altered from the Vulgate.|$|E
5|$|Pope John XXIII issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} {{revealed}} to the authorities in an anonymous <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> to William Parker, 4thBaron Monteagle, on 26October 1605. During {{a search of the}} House of Lords at about midnight on 4November 1605, Fawkes was discovered guarding 36barrels of gunpowder—enough to reduce the House of Lords to rubble—and arrested. Most of the conspirators fled from London as they learned of the plot's discovery, trying to enlist support along the way. Several made a stand against the pursuing Sheriff of Worcester and his men at Holbeche House; in the ensuing battle, Catesby was one of those shot and killed. At their trial on 27January 1606, eight of the survivors, including Fawkes, were convicted and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|After the Austrian {{invasion}} of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia, bound by the treaty of alliance with France, reluctantly entered the war against Austria. The Russian army {{under the command of}} General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809. Golitsyin advanced as slowly as possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and, in fact, shared some operational intelligence. A courteous <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrey Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander. As a result, Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command. Furthermore, there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia. As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol.|$|E
5|$|In 1743, Smart {{pushed his}} {{translation}} of Pope's Ode on St. Cecilia's Day as Carmen Cl. Alexandri Pope in S. Caeciliam Latine Redditum {{and paid for}} the publication himself. With this translation, he wanted to win Pope's favour and translate Pope's Essay on Man, but Pope rejected the idea and, after a lettered response and a possible meeting between the two, Smart translated Pope's An Essay on Criticism (De Arte Critica) instead. The initial <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> from Pope recommending the future translation was prized by Smart. In response to this letter and his budding relationship with Pope, the Pembroke Fellows honoured him with a portrait showing him holding the letter from Pope and allowed him to write a poem in celebration of Jubilee of Pembroke's 400th year in 1744.|$|E

5|$|The Protestant James I, {{who became}} King of England in 1603, was less {{tolerant}} of Catholicism than his followers had hoped. Catesby therefore planned {{to kill him}} by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder during the State Opening of Parliament, the prelude to a popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. Early in 1604 he began to recruit other Catholics to his cause, including Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, and Guy Fawkes. Described latterly as a charismatic and influential man, {{as well as a}} religious zealot, over the following months he helped to bring a further eight conspirators into the plot, whose naissance was planned for 5November 1605. A <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> anonymously to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, alerted the authorities, and {{on the eve of the}} planned explosion, during a search of Parliament, Fawkes was found guarding the barrels of gunpowder. News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London, warning Catesby along their way.|$|E
5|$|Under pressure, he {{was adamant}} {{that he was}} unaware of the current {{whereabouts}} of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a <b>letter</b> <b>sent</b> to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofresí admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain José Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates.|$|E

King Henry continued to use Warelwast as an ambassador, sending him to Rome in 1101 to bring back Pope Paschal II's reply to a letter written by Henry immediately after his accession. Henry was seeking a reconciliation with the papacy, and confirmed to the pope the rights and obedience which his father had rendered, but he also requested the same rights within the Church as his father had enjoyed, chiefly the lay investiture of bishops and the granting of the symbols of episcopal authority by laymen. Paschal declined to grant Henry those rights.|$|E
