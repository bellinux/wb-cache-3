40|$|In the Netherlands, waste {{electric}} and electronic equipment (e-waste) {{is an important}} point for discussion on the circular economy agenda. This paper shows the Dutch example of how “waste” {{can be turned into}} a resource, and the climate change benefits from appropriate collection and recycling. It describes the avoided emissions of CO 2 -equivalents due to e-waste recycling and appropriate removal and destruction of (H) CFCs contained in cooling and freezing appliances. Six different e-waste categories were included, and the results of 2016 were compared to previous years (2009 – 2015). In 2016, 110, 000 tonnes of e-waste were collected. 80 % of this was recycled to useful materials. Additionally, it resulted in 17 % energy recovery. That year, the recycling of e-waste and the removal of (H) CFKs resulted in approximately 416, 000 tonnes of avoided emissions of CO 2 -equivalents. Although the phasing out of cooling and freezing appliances with (H) CFKs led to a general decrease in the quantity of avoided CO 2 emissions over time, removal of (H) CFKs still explained most of the avoided CO 2 emissions. Material recycling appeared particularly beneficial for cooling and freezing appliances and small and <b>large</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances.</b> The paper ends with reasons to further close the loop and ways forward to do so...|$|E
40|$|Electronic and {{electric}} devices are now applied in most human activities: their diffusion is increasing worldwide; furthermore, {{most of them}} are characterized by a high replacement rate due to technological obsolescence. Consequently, environmental problems due to their diffusion are increasing; several aspects are involved from the energy consumption derived from their manufacturing processes and their use phases to their end-of-life (EOL) management. Such legislative (e. g. the European Energy Efficiency directive for household appliances) or voluntary interventions (e. g. based on the ISO standards) have been introduced for such devices: the aim is to incorporate environmental considerations in product design and manufacturing in order to benefit the environment.

40|$|AbstractTaiwan EPA has promulgated Resource Recycling Act in 2002, {{which is}} {{formulated}} to conserve natural resources, reduce waste, promote recycling and reuse of materials, mitigate environmental loading, {{and build a}} society in which resources are used in a sustainable manner. [1] Since 1998, the recycling of waste <b>large</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> such as televisions, washing machines, refrigerators, and air conditioners, etc. has been implemented; waste electric fans and waste computer keyboards were also included in 2007. Although recycling in Taiwan initiated early, whether waste electrical and electronic equipment recycling is just the process of decomposition, recycling, incineration, and landfill, rather than extending the product lifespan, need further studies to confirm that. The Recycling Fund Management Board takes charge of the operation of recycling mechanism in Taiwan. The funds mostly paid by the businesses as the recycling, clearance and disposal fees. Such fees now are unified under the same products specifications. The existed system can’t provide products under the same specifications but with longer lifespan more preferential fees, which means that there is no incentive for the suppliers to improve the design of products. With Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) inserted in, the household appliances will not only have the basic information about the product, but also can keep track of the purchase and maintenance record, as well as the disposal date and location, during the use stage of that product. Such record provides information on the service life of the product, and the recycling fees paid by businesses could be returned relative to the lifetime to the consumers accordingly. The new mechanism incentives the suppliers to consider the product durability in design and manufacture stages that helps achieve the goal to make products decomposable, recyclable, and lifetime extended...|$|E

A total of 40. 7 % of this tonnage was made up of <b>large</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> with cooling appliances and small household appliances contributing to 15 % and 12. 1 % of this total respectively (Environment Agency, 2012). Small household appliances (SHA) are items such as kettles and toasters and personal care appliances such as hair dryers. The increasing incorporation of technology into electronic products and their affordability means that they are replaced regularly, especially by people strongly influenced by fashion and advertising. Consequently there are increasing concerns about the sustainability of EEE manufacture, use and disposal both in terms of resource and energy use. It is widely recognised that we need to transition to a so-called “Green Economy” in order to deliver sustainable development (Williams and Kemp, 2013). For this to be achieved, the business community and consumers will need to reduce their impacts on the environment by changing what is produced and how it is produced and used. It is therefore essential that young people in developed nations who have been brought up on a diet of cheap international transport, fast food, high-speed communication and resource intensive consumable products, fully grasp the consequences of this transition in terms of adopting different ways of living and working. The same applies to younger generations of the emerging economies who will cast a powerful global influence in terms of future economic development and resource consumption. University students are part of the demographic of young adults who frequently buy electrical and electronic equipment and buy personal care appliances due the perceived importance of image in contemporary society. As they often live in high-density accommodation, student households may also consume more energy than a typical household. The aims of this study were to assess the attitudes and behaviours of young adults (university students) in relation to the use and disposal of small household appliances and to quantify the frequency and period of use. The study employed an online questionnaire of students at the University of Southampton to assess the purchase, ownership, use and disposal of small household appliances. An additional small-scale energy diary study was employed at 28 student households to assess the energy usage patterns of several household appliances.

40|$|Closed loop supply chains comprise, in {{addition}} to the conventional forward flows from suppliers to end-users, a reverse flow of products, components, and materials from end-users to the manufacturers and secondary markets. Designing a closed-loop supply chain is a strategic level planning which considerably impacts on tactical and operational performance of the supply chain. It refers to the decisions taken on the location of facilities involved in the supply chain network along with the management of the physical flows associated with forward and product recovery channels. Our problem of interest is mainly motivated by the case of durable products including but not limited to <b>large</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances,</b> computers, photocopying equipment, and aircraft engines. Such category of products has a modular structure, composed of independent components. As opposed to simple structured products, e. g., printer cartridges, that can only be recycled, each of the components in the reverse bill of materials of durable products can be recovered by a particular type of recovery process. Besides, durable products share a long life cycle characteristic which indeed makes designing their CLSC networks more complicated. In this thesis, in keeping with the abovementioned motivation, we focus on designing closed-loop and reverse supply chains in the context of durable products that are of various quality conditions. The recovery decisions for product return include remanufacturing, part harvesting, bulk recycling, material recycling, and landfilling/incineration. Moreover, we take into account environmental concerns regarding the harmful impacts of used products in the closed-loop supply chain planning. As the closed-loop supply chains typically encounter uncertainty in quality and quantity of the profitable return stream, we further aim to consider the impact of uncertainty in designing the recovery network. For such purposes, in the first phase, we address a closed-loop supply chain planning problem in the context of durable products with generic modular structures. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model which is then solved by an accelerated Benders decomposition-based algorithm. The performance of the proposed decomposition approach is enhanced through incorporating algorithmic features including valid inequalities, non-dominated optimality cuts, and local branching strategies. Next, in the second phase, we propose a precise approach to model the uncertain quality status of returns, in which the availability of each component in the reverse bill of materials is modeled as discrete scenarios. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model to address this problem setting. Then, since the cardinality of the scenario set grows exponentially with the number of involved components, we detail on a scenario reduction scheme to alleviate the computational burden of the proposed model. The stochastic problem is solved by a L-shaped algorithm enhanced through valid inequalities and Pareto-optimal cuts. Finally, we investigate designing a dynamic reverse supply chain where the quantity of the return flows is uncertain. We introduce a multi-stage stochastic programming model and develop a heuristic inspired by scenario clustering decomposition scheme as the solution method. It revolves around decomposing the scenario tree into smaller sub-trees which consequently yields a number of sub-models in accordance with sub-trees. The resulting sub-models are then coordinated by Lagrangian penalty terms. On account of the fact that each sub-model per se is a hard to solve problem, a Benders decomposition-based algorithm is proposed to solve sub-models...|$|E

30|$|Freon gases from refrigerators, freezers, air {{condition}} equipment, and heat pumps shall be recovered for destruction, recycling or reclamation [39]. The destruction of Freon is regulated to avoid improper disposal techniques: Rotary kiln is approved {{for all types}} of ODS, municipal waste incineration is approved only for foams, and some plasma arc methods are approved for ODS with the exception of foams [39]. With respect to the WEEE directive [20], used refrigerators, freezers, and other electric and electronic devices have to be collected separately. The producers are obliged to take back used items and to pay for recycling and disposal. German authorities [40] urge companies running e-waste recycling facilities to recover 90 % of the Freon compounds from used devices including the isolation foam of freezers. To prevent improper recycling, the export of unusable devices in non-EU countries has been prohibited. In daily life, the success of these efforts is rather poor: The yearly minimum collection target within the EU is 4 kg per inhabitant (4 kg inh- 1 yr- 1) with respect to all waste from electric and electronic equipment. In 2008, about 6.95 kg inh- 1 yr- 1 have been collected in the European Union, whereas the overall amount of waste from electric and electronic devices was about 20.8 kg inh- 1 yr- 1. (The latter figure has been calculated using an empirical correlation published by Huisman [41].) According to European statistics, freezers and refrigerators are recorded in the category of <b>large</b> <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> (“white goods”). Therefore, we have only few data concerning the recycling of used appliances containing Freon compounds. Actually, most of the devices to be disposed contain either F- 11 /F- 12 or the successor products, i.e. partially halogenated hydrocarbons like F- 22 or fluorinated hydrocarbons. In new refrigerators, pentane is used as cooling agent. In the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen (17.8 Mio inhabitants), 550, 000 to 600, 000 refrigerators have to be disposed per year. Until 2014, more than 50 % of these devices will be contaminated with CFCs because of the long lifetime of household refrigerators [42]. Due to compulsory Freon elimination before metal recovery, the costs for the recycling of freezers are normally higher than the earnings from scrap. Therefore, refrigerators which do not work any longer (broken) cannot be sold by their owners. This might be the reason for the relatively high amount of refrigerators collected in comparison with other household appliances reported from the Dutch waste collection [43]. A considerable percentage of refrigerators and freezers are severely damaged by informal collectors who cut out copper tubes and compressors. Statistical data about these emissions are normally not found in government reports. Following an assumption by a German NGO, about 45 % of Freon compounds from household appliances are emitted [44]. The problems show primarily up with kerbside collection. In the city of Düsseldorf (~ 600, 000 inhabitants), about 70 % of the freezers and refrigerators declared for e-waste collection are damaged or stolen [45]. But also appliances brought to recycling yards are sometimes damaged. In the recycling facilities, Freon compounds used in the compressor and in the isolation must be separated in a first step. The recovery target for these contaminants is 90 % according to German authorities [40]. Following some random samples [46], the recovery targets are not met by most recycling facilities. The emissions from German point sources in 2009 add up to 0.82 Mg CFCs and 21.9 Mg HCFCs, respectively (data taken from [47]). Assuming a mean amount of 250 g Freon in a refrigerator, 2.5 million items to be disposed per year of which 50 % are filled with CFCs and 45 % loss during collection, the overall emission from this source is about 140 Mg per year. Thus, the diffuse sources mainly caused by improper waste management are far more important than the point sources.|$|E

40|$|The <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> in {{buildings}} have increased {{rapidly in the}} recent years. However, the surge withstanding capability of these <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> has not been increased. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} install surge protection device (SPD) to prevent serious damage of <b>household</b> electrical <b>appliances</b> caused by the in-rushing surges. In order to avoid the oscillation phenomenon, the effective protection distance of SPDs should be addressed before installing SPDs in the buildings. This paper discussed the influence of a group of common <b>household</b> electrical <b>appliances</b> connected in parallel on the effective protection distance of an SPD to a <b>household</b> <b>appliance.</b> The surges impinging on the <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> connected to a distribution system are analyzed using electromagnetic transient analysis software. It is found that the SPD's protection distance increases when multiple <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> are connected in parallel. The SPD's effective protection distance for one specific <b>household</b> <b>appliance,</b> which is determined from the case in which only this <b>household</b> <b>appliance</b> is used, is a conservative value; even if other <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> are connected with this appliance, the SPD still provides an effective protection to this specific appliance.

40|$|The key {{to success}} of {{producers}} of energy saving <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> is in respecting the consumers’ changed way of thinking and behaviour and their individual needs after the times of crisis and recession. Nowadays, consumers have total control over buying <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> and a far larger choice. Consumers of <b>household</b> <b>appliances,</b> whose consumption was the driving force before the times of crisis and recession, today, when making a decision about buying <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> take more factors into consideration, which makes their decision far more complex. From the aspect of <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> consumers changed values and motives, the key trends are: insisting on simplicity, <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> producers’ social responsibility, ethical business, demand for energy saving products, loyalty etc. With the appearance of energy saving <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> and appliances that do not pollute the environment the consumers have been questioning their consumer habits and turning towards »the green way of life«. The climate changes on the planet have reached a level when every consumer becomes {{aware of the importance}} of utilising less harmful energy sources and <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> that save energy resources. With a short overview of the times of crisis and recession as well as consumer habits in the times of crisis the aim of this paper is to establish motives and attitudes of <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> consumers and establish the level of awareness of respondents and their perception of energy saving <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> and appliances that encourage environmental care...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a method for}} the assessment and evaluation of energy efficiency of the manufacturing processes in the production {{as well as a}} corporate and cross-industry comparison. Already today, energy-related characteristic value systems are used, which are related to the energy consumption of <b>large</b> electronic <b>household</b> <b>appliances</b> or are focusing on their production facilities. The energy efficiency value is a newly developed indicator and will provide valuable information about the energy efficiency of the production of various products, production operators, and consumers. In the following, the energy efficiency value, which is based on the approach of minimal value calculation, is presented in detail. The basic idea is the comparison and evaluation of energy efficiency based on the ratio of the theoretically required energy consumption to the actual energy consumption. Depending on the analysis of influencing factors, a model highlighting their dependencies could be established. The developed system hinges on a successive calculation of the minimum value. Each of these minimum types can be put in relation to the measured energy consumption. However, depending on the chosen basis, the conclusion and focus of the calculated key figure may vary. By using the real minimum as a basis, the actually existing energy savings become visible. The method will be put to the test through an exemplary application for processes in the fields of cutting technologies. This course of action allows the validation of the developed energy efficiency value and reveals the potential of this method...|$|R
