40|$|The author {{presents}} a dietary program for weight reduction {{based not on}} the substitution of a <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> <b>meal</b> for a high calorie meal, but on the pre-meal ingestion of low calorie bulk beverages that are pleasant to taste and space filling, thereby compromising {{the capacity of the}} stomach to accommodate much of the higher calorie foods of the regular meals. This method makes any form of fasting unnecessary, as the intake of calories is already limited. Because of this method, few changes need to be made in food selection for regular meals...|$|E

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>calorie</b> liquid <b>meal</b> {{replacements}} {{can be used}} {{to achieve}} weight loss in obese patients. Many consider renal disease a contraindication to this {{due to a lack of}} specific research. The aim of this case study is to illustrate that this therapy can be used effectively in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). After numerous failed weight loss attempts, the multidisciplinary team (Nephrology, Endocrinology, General Practice and Dietetics) decided to trial a 65 year old patient (CKD Stage 3 secondary to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus requiring insulin) on a modified meal replacement plan. This plan consisted of 3 Optifast meal replacement drinks plus one portion controlled meal, (4 MJ and 85 g of protein per day). Monitoring included frequent blood glucose self testing, fortnightly blood tests and review by the Dietitian (monthly once stable). The patient was initially unable to exercise due to pain. At baseline, weight was 157  kg (BMI: 41  kg/m 2), waist circumference 155 cm and blood biochemistry indicated CKD stage 3 b (eGFR: 39  ml/min, Urea: 15. 9  mmol/L, Creat: 156  umol/L). After 14 weeks weight had decreased 22  kg (BMI: 35. 8  kg/m 2), waist circumference had decreased 18  cm and reported pain improved. Insulin requirements approximately halved, and blood biochemistry (eGFR: 42  ml/min, Urea: 15. 2  mmol/L, Creat: 147  umol/L) indicated no decline in renal function. With close monitoring a modified meal replacement plan was used successfully in a patient with CKD however prospective randomised trials are required to further investigate this treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between gastric emptying and the intragastric distribution of 300 ml radiolabelled beef consommé {{with and without}} 60 g margarine was investigated by performing randomised, paired gammacamera studies in seven healthy male volunteers (aged 20 - 22 years). The <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> bland <b>meal</b> emptied rapidly from both the proximal and distal stomach after a short lag period (4 - 6 min), during which 24 - 50 % of the liquid passed into the distal stomach. Addition of margarine to the liquid test meal increased the lag period (median 32 min, range 7 - 60 min; p less than 0. 01) and decreased the slope of emptying (T 1 / 2 lag period 88 min, 49 - 146 min v 15 min, 10 - 57 min; p less than 0. 01). During the lag period there was an initial filling of the distal stomach, similar to that with the bland liquid, followed by a redistribution of between 19 % and 61 % (median 46 %) of the distal stomach contents back into the proximal stomach. At the onset of emptying, the distal stomach filled (median 30 %, range 16 - 34 %) and during this time the proximal stomach emptied {{twice as fast as}} the whole stomach (p less than 0. 05). Thereafter, the distal stomach capacity remained relatively constant while both the proximal and whole stomach emptied at similar rates. This study shows that the delay in gastric emptying of a liquid that has a high fat content {{is due in part to}} a redistribution of distal stomach contents back into the proximal stomach...|$|R

40|$|Background: Surgery is {{the only}} {{effective}} treatment for people with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 Kg/m² or even greater than 35 Kg/m² when some diseases like diabetes or hypertension appear. In order to minimize surgical risk and improve postoperative results, preoperative preparation it's very important. "Acute" preoperative weight loss just before surgery {{plays a crucial role}} in that preparation and can be achieved through different ways like a <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet, a very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet or with the use of an intragastric balloon. The advantages or particularities of every one of them will be summarized in this article. Material and methods: Literature review of the benefits, risks and complications of preoperative weight loss through a <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet, a very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet or intragastric balloon placement. Results: Seven of thirteen initially selected reports from Medline search were considered relevant, including a total 371 patients (240 patients treated with <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet, 90 with very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet and 41 cases of intragastric balloon placement). We found that weight loss was greater in patients with very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diets and intragastric balloon groups but with a slightly increase in morbidity and cost. Conclusion: Although there are no comparative studies, data from the literature results show that diets very <b>low</b> in <b>calories</b> are more effective and require less time than low-calorie diets and cheaper with fewer side effects than the intragastric balloon...|$|R

AIM:This study aims at evaluating {{the effect of a}} high protein <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet on glycaemia, creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol, VLDL, HLDL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We have selected 30 surgical patients with a body mass index equal to 30 - 50 who underwent a high protein <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet for 40 days a s a complications-preventive strategy before operation. The calories supplied have been in the range of 800 - 1200 accordingly to the individual workload and urgent need to lose weight. RESULTS:After a diet of 40 days, all the patients showed a definite weight loss and significant glycaemia, creatinine, triglycerides, cholesterol, VLDL and HLDL improvement. In the hypertensive patients, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly. DISCUSSION:The very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diet is quite effective to lose [corrected] weight before surgical procedures. This dietary regimen, from a physiological perspective, improves electrolyte balance supporting lean mass preservation and reducing the patient's weakness and hunger,without any wound healing impairiment or weakness.

40|$|Abstract Exponential {{growth in}} the number of {{patients}} suffering from diseases caused by the consumption of sugar has become a threat to mankind's health. Artificial <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> sweeteners available in the market may have severe side effects. It takes time to figure out the long term side effects and by the time these are established, they are replaced by a new <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> sweetener. Saccharine has been used for centuries to sweeten foods and beverages without calories or carbohydrate. It was also used on a large scale during the sugar shortage of the two world wars but was abandoned as soon as it was linked with development of bladder cancer. Naturally occurring sweet and taste modifying proteins are being seen as potential replacements for the currently available artificial <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> sweeteners. Interaction aspects of sweet proteins and the human sweet taste receptor are being investigated. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mandated posting of calorie {{information}} on menus and menu boards at fast {{food and other}} large chain restaurants has garnered growing public and legislative support as a potential strategy for addressing the obesity epidemic. However, no studies to our knowledge have sought to quantify {{the potential impact of}} this strategy on the epidemic. To address this gap, we conducted a health impact assessment of menu labeling, as proposed in California’s Senate Bill 120 in 2007 and in the current Senate Bill 1420, on the obesity epidemic in Los Angeles County. Data on population weight gain from the California Department of Education Physical Fitness Testing Program and the Los Angeles County Health Survey were used to quantify the obesity epidemic in Los Angeles County. Additional data to estimate the number of meals served annually at large chain restaurants in the county, the percentage of restaurant patrons that would order reduced <b>calorie</b> <b>meals</b> as a result of menu labeling, and the amount of calorie reductions that would result from patron response to calorie postings were examined using published and unpublished data sources. Multiple scenarios of restaurant patron response to calorie postings were examined to estimate a plausible range of impacts of menu labeling on the obesity epidemic. Using conservative assumptions that calorie postings would result in 10 % of large chain restaurant patrons ordering reduced <b>calorie</b> <b>meals,</b> with an average reduction of 100 <b>calories</b> per <b>meal,</b> and no compensator...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{studied the}} cases of 17 {{individuals}} who died suddenly of ventricular arrhyth-mia after prolonged use (median 5 months) of very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> weight reduction regimens consisting entirely or largely of protein. The deaths appeared to be independent of type of medical supervision received during the diet, daily dosage of potassium supplementation, and biological quality of the protein product used. Factors common to all cases were marked obesity {{at the onset of}} dieting, prolonged use of extremely <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> diets (approximately 300 to 400 kcal daily), and significant and rapid weight loss. Our review of available electrocardiograms and pathological specimens revealed a pattern of cardiac changes previously described in starvation. We conclude that use of very <b>low</b> <b>calorie</b> weight reduction regimens should be curtailed until further studies determine what modifications, if any, can insure their safety. Am. J. Cliii.
