Bernanke notes that at least in some instances, [...] "the CRA has served as a catalyst, inducing banks to enter underserved markets that they might otherwise have ignored". In the same 2007 speech, Bernanke also noted that, [...] "managers of financial institutions found that these <b>loan</b> <b>portfolios,</b> if properly underwritten and managed, could be profitable" [...] and that the loans [...] "usually did not involve disproportionately higher levels of default".|$|E

40|$|Credit Risk {{management}} within banking {{is continually}} developing. Advances in credit-scoring models have allowed banks {{to improve their}} avoidance of non credit-worthy firms. Through meticulous credit evaluation, banks attempt to minimize credit-specific risk to their ideal cost of capital. However, this practice may not sufficiently reduce the total <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> risk; systematic risk. To minimize the total <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> risk, banks can consider diversify-ing its <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio.</b> Yet, research indicates that the correlations between portfolio compo-nents are often unconsidered by banks. The bank is therefore exposed to low firm specific credit risk, but may be exposed to high total portfolio credit risk if the portfolio components are highly correlated. Our thesis investigates the strategy behind <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversification at banks. This thesis is a qualitative study about how large banks in Sweden manage their loan portfo-lios. We discuss credit risk diversification {{with the help of}} Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory (1952). Furthermore, we investigate whether Swedish banks actively pursue loan port-folio diversification and what methods they use. We found that the majority of large banks in Sweden to a certain degree intuitively diversify their <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio.</b> On the other hand, we found that due to practical complexities the banks do not manage using <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversification. Due to the size of these large banks it is assumed that <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> diversification will happen naturally...|$|R

40|$|Theories on <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> swap hedging {{are based}} on a portfolio-choice approach. This paper {{presents}} an alternative: a firm-theoretic model for bank behavior with <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> swaps. Our paper derives the optimal loan rate and rate-taking loan amount of the bank’s portfolio, and relates them to the market loan rate, counterparty loan rate, swap default risk, capital-to-deposits ratio, and deposit insurance. We find that in the bilateral default risk approach, the comparative static results are generated by four factors: the bank’s risk magnitude about the equity market value, loan composition in the swap contract, the substitution effect in the <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio,</b> and the income effect from the swap transaction. The results imply that changes in the payoff asymmetry in the event of swap default and the bank’s regulatory parameters have a direct effect on the bank’s <b>loan</b> <b>portfolio</b> for lending and swap transactions.
