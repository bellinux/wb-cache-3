40|$|This book, co-written by Brody and Wozencroft (RCA), {{explores the}} history of the {{experimental}} digital type and print magazine ‘FUSE’ in its 20 th year. ‘FUSE’ challenged, explored and extended typographic and visual language concepts, questioning the Western alphabet and proposing that new demands need new visual languages. Each issue featured five experimental typefaces, with posters and essays. In the New York Times (2012), Steven Heller noted that the book ‘arguably offers a window onto the most significant shift in type style and function since the time of Gutenberg’. Long out of print and only now available in one place, the 416 -page collection is contained in a box similar to the original package, with two new editions of the magazine commissioned by Brody and Wozencroft, featuring ten new fonts and posters. Texts and images relating to the FUSE conferences and competitions are available for the first time. The book focuses a vital debate on the current and future social, cultural and commercial role of typography and visual language. It introduces new, radical ideas about typography to a wide public and a new generation of designers. Brody co-edited and designed the book, creating designs to express and explain the typefaces. There is a Foreword by Brody and a transcript of ‘Beyond typography’, presented by Brody at the ‘FUSE 98 ’ conference (1998). Brody’s fonts and posters designed for FUSE publications 1 – 18 are documented. Distributed worldwide in six languages, the book has had major international press, Web and radio reviews in, for example, Blueprint, Eye, Creative Review, Wallpaper and Design Week. Brody and Wozencroft curated and presented a related <b>lecture</b> <b>evening,</b> ‘E-Motional Type’, at the British Library, London (2012). In 2012, Brody gave lectures on ‘FUSE 1 - 20 ’ in San Francisco, Chicago, Rhode Island, London, Barcelona, Tokyo, Istanbul, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong...|$|E

In a formal sense, this is true.

In some cases, these <b>lectures</b> <b>even</b> were delivered by university professors– a practice that foreshadowed Cooperative Extension work more than a century later.|$|R
5000|$|McComas's {{start in}} comedy was in May 1976, {{when he made}} his famous hoax lecture at Monash pretending to be Glanville Williams, [...] "alternative {{professor}} of English law at University of Cambridge".

30|$|When {{information}} seekers evaluate online information, {{they pay}} attention to relevant characteristics about {{the source of the}} information. However, they do not evaluate these relevant characteristics in isolation. Instead, information seekers evaluate the interaction of relevant characteristics and adjust their conclusions accordingly. The results of this study show that information seekers combine information about the source’s professional affiliation (“Who does the information source work for?”) and the source’s involvement in the study (“Who conducted the studies that were the basis of the source’s arguments?”) to make judgements about the source’s credibility, trustworthiness and instructional quality {{in the context of an}} online video <b>lecture.</b> <b>Even</b> though these findings are important for various disciplines and professions, they are especially important for professionals involved in developing online educational materials who want to improve their information communication strategies.|$|R

There was a tradition in Belgium of the most gifted mathematicians entering engineering rather than pure mathematics or physics. Belevitch showed his mathematical leanings by preferring the use of blackboard and chalk to any audio-visual aids during <b>lectures.</b> He <b>even</b> <b>lectured</b> in this way when presenting the opening lecture to a large audience at an international conference at the IEE in London.|$|R
