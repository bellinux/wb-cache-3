5|$|The Central <b>line</b> <b>station</b> {{opened on}} 30 July 1900, and the Bakerloo <b>line</b> <b>station</b> on 10 March 1906. Both are Grade II listed. The station was rebuilt in 1912 to relieve {{congestion}}. Further congestion {{led to another}} reconstruction in 1923. Numerous improvements were made {{as part of the}} New Works Programme and as a flood protection measure. To accommodate additional passengers on the Victoria line, a new ticket hall was built. The Victoria <b>line</b> <b>station</b> opened on 7 March 1969, including cross-platform interchange with the Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|The King's Cross fire in 1987 {{started in}} the machine room for a wooden {{escalator}} between the main <b>line</b> <b>station</b> and the London Underground station's Piccadilly line platforms. The escalator burnt up {{and much of the}} tube station caught fire with smoke spreading to the main <b>line</b> <b>station,</b> killing 31 people.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built and}} {{initially}} operated as two separate stations {{by the two}} companies, the C and the CCE platforms were sufficiently close together that a deep level interchange was constructed between the passages of the two stations with a small ticket office for passengers changing between the lines. Another passage led to lifts that surfaced within the main <b>line</b> <b>station</b> itself. With the entrance within the main <b>line</b> <b>station</b> able to serve both sets of platforms satisfactorily, the separate station buildings were considered unnecessary, and they both closed on 30 September 1914. The CCE building remains (converted for use as an electrical substation), but the C's building was demolished in 1934 to enable the construction of Euston House for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main <b>line</b> <b>station,</b> and the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E
5|$|Between April and August 2016 the Bakerloo line {{platforms}} {{were closed}} to enable escalator replacements {{and the construction}} of connecting passageways to the new Crossrail platforms due to open in 2018. In December 2016 Westminster City Council approved proposals to construct a new mixed-use development called Paddington Quarter on a site adjacent to the mainline station. The plans include reconstruction of the Bakerloo <b>line</b> <b>station</b> to provide a larger ticket hall and better access between platforms and street level.|$|E
5|$|The Kendall MBTA Red <b>Line</b> <b>station</b> {{is located}} on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods {{surrounding}} MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods. In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. The MIT Museum will eventually be moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus.|$|E
