The decline of arctic ocean summer ice coverage was assumed to be one such sign, however, the reversal of that trend leaves the question open as the origins of the now reversed 30 year trend. In 1979, the cover of Time magazine was illustrated with an image of arctic ice covering and expanding BEYOND the arctic basin, opinion seems to have little value. Real data reveal the trend of ice coverage to be on the increase. If this increase will continue, only time will tell. Developed nations ceased the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons and the atmospheric abundance and consequent ozone depletion are generally on the decrease. ozone hole Breaking-off of polar ice shelves is a continuing process with increases in Western Antarctica balanced by decreases in Eastern Antarctica. Careful study has revealed that the volume of ice in Western Antarctica was incorrectly estimated and shows no significant change attributable to climate change over the observation period.|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the Australian eastern king prawn (Melicertus plebejus) is {{understood}} in greater detail by quantifying the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effect</b> is {{the change in the}} species 2 ̆ 7 growth rate during migration. Mark-recapture data (N = 1635, latitude 22. 21 degrees S- 34. 00 degrees S) presents northerly movement of the eastern king prawn, with New South Wales prawns showing substantial average movement of 140 km (standard deviation: 176 km) north. A generalized von Bertalanffy growth model framework is used to incorporate the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effect</b> together with the canonical seasonal effect. Applying this method to eastern king prawn mark-recapture data guarantees consistent estimates for the latitudinal and seasonal effects. For M. plebejus, it was found that growth rate peaks on 25 and 29 January for males and females, respectively; is at a minimum on 27 and 31 July, respectively; and that the shape parameter, k (per year), changes by - 0. 0236 and - 0. 0556 every 1 degree of latitude south increase for males and females, respectively...|$|E

This effective distance may then be used in any interpolation methods instead of the standard geodetic distance. Several hundreds of sites are used in Europe to assess the benefits of several effective distances. The meteorological parameters under concern are ten-years averages of monthly means of daily sum of horizontal global irradiation, daily sum of sunshine duration, daily extremes of air temperature, atmospheric pressure and water vapor pressure, and of monthly sums of precipitation. This work demonstrates that taking into account the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effects</b> in the distance increases the accuracy in interpolation. Such effects have been seldom mentioned in previous publications. The orographic effects may be partly corrected by adding the weighted difference in elevation to the geodetic distance. The proposed effective distance between the point P and each of the measuring sites Xi for all parameters, is found to give better results than the others...|$|R

40|$|One general {{approach}} for assessing whether phenotypic variation {{is due to}} selection is to test its correlation with presumably neutral molecular variation. Neutral variation is determined by population history, the most likely alternative explanation of spatial genetic structure, whereas phenotypic variation {{may be influenced by}} the spatial pattern of selection pressure. Several methods for comparing the spatial apportionment of molecular and morphological variation have been used. Here, we present an analysis of variance framework that compares the magnitudes of <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effects</b> for molecular and morphological variation along a body size cline in Australian Drosophila populations.

The relationship between MSR and W was best described by a semilog (exponential) model, which was highly significant:       MSR = - 5. 2 + 10. 8 log W.       The fit of a power model (MSR = c W z) was also significant. The steep slope of the curve for a power model (z = 0. 49) suggests that beaches function as isolated rather than contiguous habitats and that the nature of the habitat becomes more benign as beaches widen.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} climate change is the potential shifts in flowering phenology and pollen initiation associated with milder winters and warmer seasonal air temperature. Earlier floral anthesis has been suggested, in turn, to {{have a role in}} human disease by increasing time of exposure to pollen that causes allergic rhinitis and related asthma. However, earlier floral initiation does not necessarily alter the temporal duration of the pollen season, and, to date, no consistent continental trend in pollen season length has been demonstrated. Here we report that duration of the ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) pollen season has been increasing in recent decades as a function of latitude in North America. <b>Latitudinal</b> <b>effects</b> on increasing season length were associated primarily with a delay in first frost of the fall season and lengthening of the frost free period. Overall, these data indicate {{a significant increase in the}} length of the ragweed pollen season by as much as 13 – 27 d at latitudes above ~ 44 °N since 1995.

The small-sized reed frogs reach sexual maturity during {{the first or second}} year of life, but longevity does not exceed three to four years. <b>Latitudinal</b> <b>effects</b> on demographic life-history traits are not detectable in tropical anurans, and altitudinal effects are limited to a slight size reduction at higher elevations.

Three mountainous areas were chosen, two of them characterised by calcareous bedrock, the third by siliceous bedrock. A total of 25 testate amoebae taxa were recorded, with a mean species richness of 9. 3 per sampling plot. In a canonical correspondence analysis, 63. 1 % {{of the variation in}} the amoebae data was explained by moss tissue chemistry, namely by C, P, Ca, Mg, Al, Fe, and Na content and a binary site variable. We interpreted this result as an indirect effect of moss chemistry on testate amoebae through an influence on prey organisms. Although two species responded to altitude, there was no overall significant relationship between testate amoebae diversity or community structure and altitude, presumably because our sampling protocol aimed at minimizing the variability due to vegetation types and soil heterogeneity.

The exospheric temperature is related to the density by the solution of the diffusion equilibrium equations for the different constituents of the atmosphere as a function of altitude.

40|$|Background: Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{a neurological}} disorder {{with a highly}} characteristic disease distribution. Prevalence and incidence in general increase with increasing distance from the equator. Similarly the female to male sex ratio increases with increasing latitude. Multiple possible risk factors have been hypothesised for this epidemiological trend, including human leukocyte antigen allele frequencies, ultraviolet exposure and subsequent vitamin D levels, smoking and Epstein-Barr virus. In this study we undertook a study of medical records across Scotland on an NHS health board level of resolution to examine the epidemiology of MS in this region. Methods and Results: We calculated the number and rate of patient-linked hospital admissions throughout Scotland between 1997 and 2009 from the Scottish Morbidity Records. We used weighted-regression to examine correlations between these measures of MS, and latitude and smoking prevalence. We found a highly significant relationship between MS patient-linked admissions and latitude (r weighted by standard error (r sw) = 0. 75, p = 0. 002). There was no significant relationship between smoking prevalence and MS patient-linked admissions. Discussion: There is a definite <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effect</b> on MS risk across Scotland, arising primarily from an excess of female MS patients at more Northerly latitudes.

The insulatory properties of nests have been investigated in a variety of songbird species and can vary with temperature and latitude.

Here, we study the variations of the insulatory properties of European Robin (Erithacus rubecula) nests in conjunction with the morphology of the nests and composition of the materials used in construction. As well as quantifying the materials used to construct these nests for the first time, we test the hypothesis that there is a <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effect</b> on nest insulation. Robin nests have a cup structure that is quite distinct, and easily separated, from the nest’s base. Although the cup and nest’s base shared similar construction materials discriminant analysis showed that they can be distinguished on the basis of their differing proportions of leaves. Insulatory values correlated with the mass of leaves in the cup but not latitude. Unlike other songbirds of comparable size that nest in nestboxes, European Robins appear to be able to use plant-derived materials rather than animal-derived materials to effectively insulate their nests...|$|E
40|$|Changing {{climate is}} {{predicted}} to impact all depths of the global oceans, yet projections of range shifts in marine faunal distributions in response to changing climate seldom evaluate potential shifts in depth distribution. Marine ectotherms’ thermal tolerance is limited by their ability to maintain aerobic metabolism (oxygen- and capacity-limited tolerance), and is functionally associated with their hypoxia tolerance. Shallow-water (< 200 m depth) marine invertebrates and fishes demonstrate limited tolerance of increasing hydrostatic pressure (pressure exerted by the overlying mass of water), and hyperbaric (increased pressure) tolerance is proposed {{to depend on the}} ability to maintain aerobic metabolism, too. Here, we report significant correlation between the hypoxia thresholds and the hyperbaric thresholds of taxonomic groups of shallow-water fauna, suggesting that pressure tolerance is indeed oxygen-limited. Consequently, it appears that the combined effects of temperature, pressure, and oxygen concentration constrain the fundamental ecological niches (FENs) of marine invertebrates and fishes. Including depth in a conceptual model of oxygen- and capacity-limited FENs’ responses to ocean warming and deoxygenation confirms previous predictions made based solely on consideration of the <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effects</b> of ocean warming (e. g. Cheung et al., 2009), that polar taxa are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, with Arctic fauna experiencing the greatest FEN contraction. In contrast, the inclusion of depth in the conceptual model reveals {{for the first time that}} temperate fauna as well as tropical fauna may experience substantial FEN expansion with ocean warming and deoxygenation, rather than FEN maintenance or contraction suggested by solely considering latitudinal range shifts...|$|R

A predominance of small squid (< 50 mm ML) during autumn was observed in all three areas. Multi-modal size-frequency distributions were apparent in both sexes. The greatest complexity was observed in Portuguese waters, with males exhibiting possibly four or more modal size classes. Sexually mature squid were found throughout the year, with generally more mature squid in spring-summer and fewer in autumn-winter. In Portuguese waters, maturity in both sexes peaked in spring, whereas maturity in the other areas peaked in summer. Similar sizes-at-maturity were observed, with male squid maturing over a greater size range (40 - 125 mm ML) than females (30 - 50 mm ML). An apparent secondary peak in male maturity at 65 mm ML suggests two different size-maturation patterns in Portuguese waters. Estimates of potential fecundity in the Irish Sea ranged from ∼ 2200 - 13 500 eggs per female. Mean egg diameters of 0. 45 mm and 1. 55 mm were recorded for developing oocytes and mature ova, respectively. Three to four modal size classes of oocytes were apparent in each ovary. There was some indication of <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effects</b> on growth, maturation and reproduction of A. subulata across its geographic range. The greater complexity of size-structure in warmer waters suggests that water temperature may be the main factor involved, possibly through shorter incubation times, faster growth and maturation rates and extended spawning periods...|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{information}} from his colleague Arvid Högbom, Arrhenius {{was the first}} person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes were large enough to cause global warming. In his calculation Arrhenius included the feedback from changes in water vapor as well as <b>latitudinal</b> <b>effects,</b> but he omitted clouds, convection of heat upward in the atmosphere, and other essential factors. His work is currently seen less as an accurate quantification of global warming than as the first demonstration that increases in atmospheric CO2 will cause global warming, everything else being equal.Arrhenius absorption values for CO2 and his conclusions met criticism by Knut Ångström in 1900, who published the first modern infrared absorption spectrum of CO2 with two absorption bands, and published experimental results that seemed to show that absorption of infrared radiation by the gas in the atmosphere was already [...] "saturated" [...] so that adding more could make no difference. Arrhenius replied strongly in 1901 (Annalen der Physik), dismissing the critique altogether. He touched on the subject briefly in a technical book titled Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik (1903). He later wrote Världarnas utveckling (1906) (German: Das Werden der Welten 1907, English: Worlds in the Making 1908) directed at a general audience, where he suggested that the human emission of CO2 would be strong enough to prevent the world from entering a new ice age, and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the rapidly increasing population: ...|$|R
