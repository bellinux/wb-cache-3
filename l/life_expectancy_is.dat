40|$|This study {{examined}} the association between unemployment and <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in the United States during 1990 – 2010. Census-based unemployment rates were linked to US county-level mortality data. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancies</b> <b>were</b> calculated by age, sex, race, and unemployment level during 1990 – 2010. Differences in <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>were</b> decomposed by age and cause of death. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> consistently lower in areas with higher unemployment rates. In 2006 – 2010, those in areas with high unemployment rates (≥ 9 %) had a <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of 76. 9 years, compared with 80. 7 years for those in areas with low unemployment rates (< 3 %). The association between unemployment and <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> stronger for men than for women. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> ranged from 69. 9 years among black men in high unemployment areas to 90. 0 years among Asian/Pacific Islander women in low unemployment areas. Disparities persisted over time. In 1990 – 1992, <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> 4. 7 years shorter in high unemployment than in low unemployment areas. In 2006 – 2010, the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> difference between the lowest and highest unemployment areas decreased to 3. 8 years. Heart disease, cancer, homicide, unintentional injuries, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and liver cirrhosis contributed most to the lower <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in high unemployment areas. High unemployment areas recorded larger gains in <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> than low unemployment areas, contributing to the narrowing gap during 1990 – 2010...|$|R
2500|$|... 17th-century English <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> {{only about}} 35 years, largely because infant and child {{mortality}} remained high. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> under 25 {{years in the}} early Colony of Virginia, and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40 per cent died before reaching adulthood.

5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} live more than {{fourteen}} years. Disease features {{significantly associated with}} reduced survival are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination.

5|$|Like {{many other}} eastern European countries, Belarus has a {{negative}} population growth rate and a negative natural growth rate. In 2007, Belarus's population declined by 0.41% and its fertility rate was 1.22, well below the replacement rate. Its net migration rate is +0.38 per 1,000, indicating that Belarus experiences slightly more immigration than emigration. , 69.9% of Belarus's population is aged 14 to 64; 15.5% is under 14, and 14.6% is 65 or older. Its population is also aging; {{the median age of}} 30–34 is estimated to rise to between 60 and 64 in 2050. There are about 0.87 males per female in Belarus. The average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>is</b> 72.15 (66.53 years for men and 78.1 years for women). Over 99% of Belarusians aged 15 and older are literate.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis. Treatments attempt to improve function after an attack and prevent new attacks.

The long-term outcome is difficult to predict, with good outcomes more often seen in women, those who develop the disease early in life, those with a relapsing course, and those who initially experienced few attacks. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>is</b> on average 5 to 10 years lower than that of an unaffected population.|$|E
5|$|Health {{indicators}} in Ratanakiri are {{the worst}} in Cambodia. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>is</b> 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates of maternal and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined {{in the most recent}} survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's highest rates of severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.|$|E

5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>is</b> three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

40|$|Background: Glasgow’s low <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> {{and high}} levels of {{deprivation}} are well documented. Studies comparing Glasgow to similarly deprived cities in England suggest an excess of deaths in Glasgow that cannot be accounted for by deprivation. Within Scotland comparisons are more equivocal suggesting deprivation could explain Glasgow’s excess mortality. Few studies have used <b>life</b> <b>expectancy,</b> an intuitive measure that quantifies the between-city difference in years. This study aimed to use the most up-to-date data to compare Glasgow to other Scottish cities and to (i) evaluate whether deprivation could account for lower <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in Glasgow and (ii) explore whether the age distribution of mortality in Glasgow could explain its lower <b>life</b> <b>expectancy.</b> Methods: Sex specific <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> calculated for 2007 – 2011 for the population in Glasgow and the combined population of Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> <b>was</b> calculated for deciles of income deprivation, based on the national ranking of datazones, using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in Glasgow overall, and by deprivation decile, was compared to that in Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh combined, and the <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> difference decomposed by age using Arriaga’s discrete method. Results: <b>Life</b> <b>expectancy</b> for the whole Glasgow population was lower than the population of Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh combined.
