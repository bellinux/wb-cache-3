The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated body surface area (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a nomogram, using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the perception of}} public school teachers {{in the city of}} Aracoiaba- CE, Brazil, on health promoting actions and healthy environments. Methods: This was a case study conducted in public school, in April 2009, with the participation of 26 elementaryschool teachers. For collecting data we used the technique of group interview. Content analysis of Laurence Bardin was applied for data analysis. Results: The perception of teachers interviewed in relation to health promoting actions and healthy environments was restricted to focal experiences. Therefore, it was necessary to consider how teachers work the health issue in school environment, as well as the link between education for health and the scheduling of all school subjects. Conclusion: The knowledge of teachers on health seemedto be relevant but <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> insight into the concepts. Health practices developed in school related to emergency measures such as Dengue and activity directed to oral health.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Ultrasonically Assisted Drilling (UAD) has received great interest {{in the past few}} years by both academia and industry. The technology has demonstrated <b>a</b> multitude <b>of</b> advantages over conventional drilling technology although its industrial employment has been mainly thwarted by inconsistent results and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> development; <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding <b>of</b> the underlying dynamic process is required. This work commences with pertinent background information prior to delivering a critical and comprehensive literature survey on current UAD technology. From the literature survey, a key area requiring improvement is isolated, anda novel strategy is developed to address this. Standard high-speed steel drill bits are excited ultrasonically in their axial (longitudinal) direction and their vibration characteristics are recorded with respect to their tips longitudinal and torsional velocities. It is revealed that a pronounced vibration mode conversion or coupled motion occurs in the drill bit's structure. This has not previously been measured or documented and prompts a critical change in the design philosophy of UAD vibration systems. It also highlights the shortcomings of employing traditional drill bits and promotes the development of modem alternatives. Ultrasonically excited (standard) drill bits were employed to cut steel samples. During the UAD process, the excitation frequency was swept over <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> frequencies and the drilling reactions were recorded. The swept excitation signal employed is novel and unique to this work. As a result, clearly optimal regimes are revealed. A critical discussion is performed, and the workpieces that result from steady state UAD are evaluated with respect to their physical properties, and mechanisms that occur during UAD are proposed. Knowledge of these mechanism supports future UAD system development. A three-dimensional finite element modelling methodology is developed to further understand the UAD system's vibration characteristics. Simulation results show similar characteristics to the experimental data obtained although inconsistencies have been identified. Further work is necessitated to fully identify the numerical models developed with the experimental system. Routes by which this can be achieved are defined. The modelling techniques employed may be expanded to incorporate non-linear cutting forces, and are suitable for the development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new generation <b>of</b> UAD technology...|$|R

This review carefully examined nutritional status trends {{of children in}} North Korea using published reports from national nutrition assessment surveys. Nutritional adaptation of North Korean child refugees living in South Korea was also studied with their growth and food consumption, using published researches. The nutritional status of children in North Korea has recovered to a “low” level acute malnutrition status and a "medium" level chronic malnutrition status. Large disparities by geographic region still remain. North Korean child refugees in South Korea were significantly shorter and lighter than their age- and sex-matched South Korean counterparts (P< 0. 05); however, North Korean child refugees were catching up, and weight was improving faster than height.

Rather, faculty become predisposed to leave by virtue of dissatisfaction with certain aspects of their work environment (Daly 2 ̆ 6 Dee, 2006; Johnsrud 2 ̆ 6 Rosser, 2002; Rosser, 2004), which act as a 2 ̆ 2 push 2 ̆ 2 to either entertain offers or go looking for 2 ̆ 2 greener pastures 2 ̆ 2 (Daly 2 ̆ 6 Dee, 2006). Embedded within these push and pull factors, and subsequent departure decisions, are expectations and assumptions of what could have been, or should have been possible, in the institutions faculty members leave behind (Lawrence, Celis, 2 ̆ 6 Ott, 2014; Trower, 2012). Important research over the last decade has reinforced the role of work expectations and psychological contracts on advising relationships and faculty work lives (Benzoni, Rousseau, 2 ̆ 6 Li, 2006; Darrah, Hougland, 2 ̆ 6 Prince, 2014; Huston, Norman, 2 ̆ 6 Ambrose, 2007). Early career faculty bring many expectations related to professional relationships, career advancement, and teaching to the door steps of their new academic homes (Lawrence et al., 2014; Trower, 2012). Regardless of whether these expectations are met, they are often left unsaid. Unfortunately, what is left unsaid can be a major factor in faculty departure. This study makes a distinct contribution to the literature by examining the experiences of faculty who have actually left or are about to leave their university. It is rare in studies of faculty departure to have interviews with faculty who actually made the decision to leave, rather than those who simply desire to leave, because of the logistics and politics involved in gaining access to this group. Although intent to leave is <b>a</b> strong predictor <b>of</b> departure, more faculty intend to leave than actually do (Bluedorn, 1982; Daly 2 ̆ 6 Dee, 2006; Rosser 2 ̆ 6 Townshend, 2006; Zhou 2 ̆ 6 Volkwein, 2004); thus understanding the factors that were pivotal in the departure decisions of those who actually left is important to understanding the phenomenon of faculty departure...|$|R
