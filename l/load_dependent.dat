In light diastolic dysfunction, the peak early mitral flow velocity E is reduced in proportion to the e, but if relaxation is so reduced that it causes increase in atrial pressure, E will increase again, while e, being less <b>load</b> <b>dependent,</b> remains low. Thus, the ratio E/e is related to the atrial pressure, and can show increased filling pressure, although with several reservations.

Furthermore, we aim to find a sufficient evaluation criterion to judge which topology configuration of sensors outperforms than others. Three major contributions {{are made in the}} dissertation. The connection of the influential Modal Kinetic Energy method and the Effective Independence method is derived and a fast algorithm for computing the Effective Independence method is developed. Furthermore, existing influential sensor placement methods are critically reviewed and discussed. An extended MinMAC algorithm is also proposed. Secondly, five influential evaluation criteria for sensor placement are treated from a mathematical point of view to reveal their connections and interrelationship. Based on this, an almost unbiasedness criterion is proposed, which is found to be a more general criterion and can be regarded as step-by-step approximate to the Fisher information criterion used by the Effective Independence method. Finally, a <b>loading</b> <b>dependent</b> sensor placement method is specially developed to incorporate the influences of the structural characteristics and that of actual loading conditions with the aid of the proposed representative least squares method.

A six-story truss model structure is built and used to validate the idea of <b>loading</b> <b>dependent</b> sensor placement method proposed in the dissertation.

40|$|Miniature {{components}} {{with complex}} shape {{can be created}} by micromilling with excellent form and finish. However, for difficult-to-machine materials, such as Ti-alloys, failure of low-flexural stiffness microtools is a big limitation. High spindle speeds (20, 000 - 100, 000 rpm) {{can be used to}} reduce the undeformed chip thickness and the cutting forces to reduce the catastrophic failure of the tool. This reduced uncut chip thicknesses, in some cases lower than the cutting edge radius, can result in intermittent chip formation which can lead to dynamic variation in cutting forces. In addition, the run-out and the misalignment effects are amplified at higher rotational speeds which can induce dynamic force variation. These dynamic force variations coupled with low-flexural rigidity of micro end mill can render the process unstable. Consequently, accurate prediction of forces and stability is essential in high-speed micromilling. Most of the previous studies reported in the literature use constant cutting coefficients in the mechanistic cutting force model which does not yield accurate results. Recent work has shown significant improvement in the prediction of cutting forces with velocity-chip <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> coefficients but a single-function velocity-chip model fails to predict the forces accurately at very high speeds (> 80, 000 rpm). This inaccurate force prediction affects the predicted stability boundary at those speeds. Hence, this paper presents a segmented approach, wherein a function is fit for a given range of speeds to determine the chip <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> cutting coefficients. The segmented velocity-chip <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> cutting coefficient improves the cutting force prediction at high speeds, which yields much accurate stability boundary. This paper employs two degrees-of-freedom (2 DOF) model with forcing functions based on segmented velocity-chip <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> cutting coefficients.

40|$|Congestive {{heart failure}} {{may result from}} {{cardiovascular}} overload, from systolic or from diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic left ventricular dysfunction may result from structural resistance to filling such as induced by pericardial constraint, right ventricular compression, increased chamber stiffness (hypertrophy) and increased myocardial stiffness (fibrosis). A distinct and functional etiology of diastolic dysfunction is slow and incomplete myocardial relaxation. Relaxation may be slowed by pathological processes such as hypertrophy, ischemia and by asynchronous left ventricular function. The present contribution analyses the occurrence of slow and incomplete myocardial relaxation in response to changes in systolic pressure {{and in response to}} changes in venous return. The regulation of myocardial relaxation by load is critically dependent on the transition from myocardial contraction to relaxation, which occurs in dogs when 82 % of peak isovolumetric pressure has developed or at a relative load of 0. 82. This corresponds to early ejection in normal hearts, but is situated even before aortic valve opening in severely diseased hearts. When load is developed beyond this transition, relaxation becomes slow and even incomplete. This is <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> diastolic dysfunction. <b>Load</b> <b>dependent</b> diastolic dysfunction occurs in normal hearts facing heavy afterload and in severely diseased hearts even with normal hemodynamic parameters.

This paper presents a possible approach {{to overcome this}} obstacle when considering new technology and topologies in airborne systems. Using controlled current converters and electromechanical actuators for rudder control are examples of such new technology. The governing idea is to separate the high (electrical) and low (mechanical) frequency parts [1] of the model and thereafter only consider the low frequency part.

40|$|Volvo Construction Equipment {{is highly}} {{regarded}} for robust products, {{but with an}} increasing competition in their market, development of the product portfolio {{is more important than}} ever. One step being carried out is to reduce losses in powertrains and increase the fuel efficiency for solutions such as articulated haulers and wheel loaders. This would eventually lower the fuel costs and emissions for the end customer. With this development, Volvo CE could strengthen their position in the market while also contributing to reducing the construction industry's environmental impact. By investigating the front bogie axle of the recently introduced hauler, Volvo A 60 H, important information about possible reductions and the distribution of the current losses were found. The investigation focused on a front bogie axle, but some of the results are applicable for other applications such as wheel loaders as well, since a lot of the technology in the axles are similar. A conceptual study was performed where completely new ideas were generated, such as implementing a dry sump system in the axle, as well as ideas for improving the subcomponents currently found in the axle. Two cases were presented for the evaluation of concepts, one with a fully loaded dump body and low speeds, and one with an unloaded dump body and a wider speed interval. The concepts were later evaluated using calculation tools such as MATLAB and a Simulink-model was created for the losses in the axle. When combining concepts that reduces <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> losses, a potential reduction of 64 % of the axle's total losses was achieved for the case with a full dump body. The largest improvement found for the load independent losses was 8 % with an unloaded hauler and the highest speed investigated, 50 km/h. A dry sump system improves the axle's efficiency with 45 % in optimal working conditions, but was found to lower the efficiency at other conditions. Room for improvement of axle losses currently exists both for <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> and load independent losses. The evaluation performed pointed towards the <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> losses being the largest influence on the total losses, even with an unloaded dump body and high speeds.

40|$|Switched mode power {{supplies}} (SMPS) have found wide spread acceptance in all power processing applications. The design demand is moving towards higher power densities. For reduction {{in size and}} weight, {{it is imperative to}} process the power at a higher switching frequency. High switching frequency requires soft switching techniques to reduce the switching losses. Several families of soft switching converters have emerged in the past two decades. Analysis and modelling methods have been proposed in relation with these topologies. Active clamp converters are the recently introduced soft switching topologies. Steady state analysis and model of these converters have been reported in literature. This thesis presents a uniﬁed equivalent circuit oriented model for the family of active clamp converters. Analytical expressions for DC conversion ratio in terms of pole current and throw voltage are derived for all the DC-DC converters with active clamp. The special feature is that, the conversion ratio exhibits a <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> drop (IRd), where I is the pole current and Rd is the damping resistance. The damping resistance Rd is a mathematical artifact to represent the voltage loss on account of delay in the turn-on of the active switch. There is no energy loss associated with this <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> drop. This is conveniently expressed as an appropriate lossless resistance in the equivalent circuit model. The proposed equivalent circuit models are valid for both steady-state and dynamic performance. A spread sheet based design is presented for the basic DC-DC converters with active clamp. A prototype design following the spreadsheet is made. The performance of the same is validated and veriﬁed by simulation and measurements. Steady state and dynamic results are presented. The stability criterion for the active clamp converters under current programming is investigated. The same is veriﬁed through simulation and validated on a current programmed active clamp converter prototype. The active clamp converters suﬀer from a few disadvantages: Higher VA ratings of switches, <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> ZVS performance and increased component count. Several soft switching topologies have been reported in literature. Eﬃciency improvement and increase in switching frequency are obtained to diﬀerent degrees. This thesis proposes a new family of soft switching converters. This family of converters switch at constant frequency and maintains the advantages of traditional PWM converters. The proposed topology employs an auxiliary circuit to achieve soft switching. The auxiliary circuit consists of a dependent voltage source, an auxiliary switch, a series diode and a set of resonant elements (Inductor and capacitor). The switching transitions of both the active switch and the auxiliary switch are lossless. The novelty in the proposed circuit is the method of generating the dependent source required to enable zero current switching of the auxiliary switch. The dependent source is realized by a coupled winding in the energy storage inductor or tapped from the energy transfer transformer of non-isolated and isolated converters respectively. The proposed topology is applicable to most of the isolated and non-isolated DC-DC converters. The circuit equations governing the sub-intervals of the converter are expressed in terms of pole current and throw voltage. With such a deﬁnition, performance results and the design equations are identical for all types of DC-DC converters. Equivalent circuit models are obtained for the whole family of DC-DC converters. The proposed model is valid for steady state and dynamic performance. Analytical expressions of DC conversion ratio for all topologies, in terms of pole current and throw voltage are derived. The special feature is that, the conversion ratio exhibits a <b>load</b> <b>dependent</b> drop (IRd), where I is the pole current and Rd is the damping resistance.

The actual pH of equivalent As(V) and As(III) sorption was strongly <b>loading</b> <b>dependent,</b> decreasing from pH ~ 8. 0 at loadings 4. 6).
