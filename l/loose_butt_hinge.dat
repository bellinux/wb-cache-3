50|$|The New England Butt Company is a {{historic}} factory building at 304 Pearl Street in Providence, Rhode Island. It is a 3-1/2 story brick structure with a monitor roof, built in 1865 to designs by Spencer P. Read. The New England Butt Company originally manufactured cast iron <b>butt</b> <b>hinges,</b> but later changed to producing machinery for braiding and stranding wire. Many of the machines are still used today by wire companies throughout the world.|$|R
2500|$|The hinge sinker bit is {{an example}} of a custom drill bit design for a {{specific}} application. Many European kitchen cabinets are made from particle board or medium-density fiberboard (MDF) with a laminated melamine resin veneer. Those types of pressed wood boards are not very strong, and the screws of <b>butt</b> <b>hinges</b> tend to pull out. A specialist hinge has been developed which uses the walls of a [...] diameter hole, bored in the particle board, for support. This is a very common and relatively successful construction method.|$|R

50|$|In 1857 an {{earthwork}} fort, Fort Scott, {{was built}} by the 85th Regiment of Foot (Bucks Volunteers) on a knoll west of the present highway near the turnoff to Salt Rock. The first church at Umhlali was a temporary wattle-and-daub building of coarse grass daubed inside with red mud. It was built for about £90 {{with the intention of}} servicing the fort. Most settler buildings of this time were wattle and daub, thatched with tambootie grass. Daub was composed of clay or ant-heap, tempered with sand and cow dung. Windows were hung on <b>butt</b> <b>hinges.</b> Unfortunately this first church burnt down shortly after completion.|$|R

5000|$|The {{northeast}} shed room {{is heated}} by a fireplace with an exterior chimney. To the east, {{between the two}} chimneys, {{is a pair of}} lighted pent closets with early shelving. The southeast room has a door to the exterior sheltered by a shed porch with thick turned early 19th century columns. The side door, typical of North Carolina vernacular design, suggests that the exterior kitchen was to the east of the main house. Between the unheated northwest shed room, which opens only into the southwest room, and the passage is a lighted closet with a built-in beaufat consisting of glazed doors over drawers over a lower cupboard section. There is a similar beaufat, with arch-top lights, in the large southwest room. The closet opens only into the passage. The three principal rooms have flat paneled wainscot; the passage wainscot is a double range of panels with the stiles [...] "breaking joint" [...] like brickwork. All doors in the house are raised paneled on the [...] "good" [...] side and flat paneled on the back and are hung on their original <b>butt</b> <b>hinges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{couple of}} things {{happened}} shortly after the American Revolution that would quickly change exterior shutter hardware. Machines were invented to make screws. Machines were invented to produce rolled iron in thin sheets. By about 1800 cheap screws were readily available. Cast iron technology had long been available - now machine made screws allowed such hardware to be economically mounted. A bunch of <b>butt</b> type <b>hinges</b> can be seen during this [...] "Federal" [...] Period (1800-1830) - but they quickly fell from favor, probably because they were subject to breakage.|$|R
50|$|In 1963 Austin Baer, an MIT-trained engineer, {{earned a}} patent for his design of hinge leaves with intermeshed gears. In 1968, {{he earned a}} second patent for adding thrust {{bearings}} to the original design. All geared hinges today are based on this design, which distributes the door’s weight over the entire door length rather than concentrated on two or three spots as with <b>butt</b> or pivot <b>hinges.</b> The gears allowed fluid movement as {{the door opened and}} closed.|$|R
5000|$|A nervous Mrs. Kennedy {{gives her}} {{introduction}} to the audience as the kids get ready for their performance. Their disgust and lack of enthusiasm show {{how they feel about}} the show. During the first act, Mary Ann and Wheezer forget many of their lines and confuse some words for others, so Mrs. Kennedy has to yell them out to them. In the background a tall boy sneezes, causing his fake wig and beard to fall and land on Pete the Pup. Mrs. Kennedy helps Chubby start his line and then prompts her husband to shake a tin sheet, creating thundering noises. When Farina begins saying his line, a goat runs <b>loose</b> and <b>butts</b> him, knocking him down. Getting up, Farina yells, [...] "Forsooth, I think these mountains are full of too many goats!" [...] As Act I is ending, Chubby gets ready to play Nero. He begins writing his lines on his costume in case he forgets one. Mr. Kennedy notices that the costume is inside out and has him put it on correctly.|$|R
