60|$|At last {{there was}} a crisis. At {{the end of the}} second season after their visit to us, Clarence sent a hasty note, begging my father to join him in averting an {{execution}} in Griffith's house. I cannot record the particulars, for just at that time I had a long low fever, and did not touch my diary for many weeks; nor indeed did I know much about the circumstances, since my good nurses withheld as much as possible, and would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> what they believed to make me worse. Nor can I find any letters about it. I believe they were all made away with long ago, and thus I only know that my father hurried up to town, remained for a fortnight, and came back looking ten years older. The house in London had been given up, and he had offered a vacant one of our own, near home, to Griff to retrench in, but Selina would not hear of it, insisting on going abroad.|$|E

I tell you, Watson, I've {{only known}} her these few weeks, {{but from the}} first I just {{felt that she was}} made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day {{for the first time that}} I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my {{feelings}} towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{dreamed of}} the day when {{computer}} games would be a viable medium of artistic expression — an art form. I dreamed of computer games encompassing the broad range of human experience and emotion: computer games about tragedies, or self-sacrifice; games about duty and honor, patriotism; a satirical game about politics, or games about human folly; games about men's relationship to God or to Nature; games about the passionate love between a boy and girl, or the serene and mature love between husband and wife of decades; games about family relationships or death, mortality, games about a boy becoming a man, and a man realizing that he is no longer young; games about a man facing truth at high noon on a dusty main street, or a boy and his dog, and a prostitute with a heart of gold. All of these things and more were part of this dream, but by themselves they amounted to nothing, because all of these things have already been done by other art forms. There was no advantage, no purchase, nothing superior about this dream, it's just an old rehash. All we are doing with the computer, if all we do is just reinvent the wheel with poor grade materials, well, we don't have a dream worth pursuing. But there was a second part of this dream that catapulted it into the stratosphere. The second part is what made this dream important and worthy: that is interactivity.Let me explain to you why interactivity is so overwhelmingly important. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the human brain. You know, our minds are not passive receptacles, they are active agents. It’s not as if we have a button on the side of our heads and they come along and push the button and the top of our heads flips open and then they take a pitcher full of knowledge and pour it into our skull, and then they close the top of our head, shake well and say, «Congratulations, you’re educated now!». ... All the higher mammals learn by playing, by doing, by interacting. And indeed, the higher the mammal, the more of its life is spent in play to prepare itself for adulthood. So you can see, this active role of the mind is fundamental to the way we think, it’s wired into our brains. And over the millennia we humans have learned ways to improve upon this. The first improvement is language. ... So language is a way of allowing one person to learn from many different people. But you know, we’ve also learned to turn that concept around to use language as a way of allowing one person to teach many people. ... the principle remains the same. And in fact, this is the genesis of art. 'Cause art really is just a way of communicating ideas.... The interactive conversation is effective, but the expository lecture is efficient. That’s the trade-off we make. And over the centuries, we humans have learned that the gains in efficiency outweigh the losses in effectiveness. And therefore we choose expository methods. But the sacrifice remains real! We haven’t ever solved that problem. It’s been with us since the beginning of history. Every single artist has faced this, every communicator, every teacher, every novelist, every sculptor, every singer, every musician, every painter, every single artist through all of human history has been forced to sacrifice effectiveness for efficiency… until now. Because now we have a technology that changes everything. ... That is the revolutionary nature of the computer. It allows us to automate interactivity to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency. That was {{the most important part of}} my dream.|$|E

40|$|Thank you {{for coming}} and <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the theory and {{practice}} of education. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> start with some observations about {{what we are trying to}} do, or what I think that we should be trying to do, with Education theory. And in thinking about Education theory, we should never forget that what we are actually dealing with is people – living, breathing, feeling individuals with their own purposes and intentions. In view of the diversity and range of individuals that is implied by that simple statement, it is perhaps surprising that we can predict anything about people. But we can predict some things with considerable accuracy – such as traffic jams at particular times of day or seasons of the year, or the sale of food in supermarkets. But if we try to predict everything about a person, then we are not respecting their individuality, their ability to make their own choices, and to exercise free will. Education theory should make predictions that are helpful for planners, but that respect the freedom and individuality of the personal decisions that each of us make. I have argued elsewhere that this means that Education theory should be based on three principles: ● It should be ethical in allowing scope for individual free will; ● It should be multi-centred in allowing that there is more than one correct way to develop one’s educational career; and ● It should allow for partial autonomy between levels of understanding, between the individual, the schoo...|$|R

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} useful way {{to enter into a}} {{conversation}} about the therapeutic relationship {{and the role of the}} therapist is to address what I see as a central issue in discussions of social construction as it relates to the practice of psychotherapy: What does constructionism offer in the realm of practice? What do we do, as therapists, once we propose that meaning emerges in the on-going flow of persons in situated activity? And thus, what are the implications of this form of practice for the therapeutic relationship? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> begin by <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> social construction as a philosophical stance, rather than as a model or method for psychotherapy. Social construction offers us a “stance ” for engaging in the therapeutic relationship as well as a way of expanding our understanding of what we mean by the therapeutic relationship. When we <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> therapy as social construction 1 we are not emphasizing a particular technique or method but rather a way of thinking about therapeutic process.
