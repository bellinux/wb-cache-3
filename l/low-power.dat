5|$|A bus-powered hub is a {{high-power}} device providing <b>low-power</b> ports. It draws 1 {{unit load}} for the hub controller and 1 unit load {{for each of}} at most 4 ports. The hub may also have some non-removable functions in place of ports. A self-powered hub is a device that provides high-power ports. Optionally, the hub controller draw power for its operation as a <b>low-power</b> device, but all high-power ports draw from the hub's self-power.|$|E
5|$|There {{are limits}} on the power a device may draw, {{stated in terms of}} a unit load, which is 100mA or 150mA for SuperSpeed devices. There are <b>low-power</b> and {{high-power}} devices. <b>Low-power</b> devices may draw at most 1 unit load, and all devices must act as <b>low-power</b> devices when starting out as unconfigured. High-power devices draw at least 1 unit load and at most 5 unit loads (500mA) or 6 unit loads (900mA) for SuperSpeed devices. A high-powered device must be configured, and may only draw as much power as specified in its configuration. I.e., the maximum power may not be available.|$|E
5|$|WCSD-LP (104.9 FM) is a <b>low-power</b> FM {{radio station}} {{broadcasting}} a variety music format.|$|E
5|$|BeagleBoard, a <b>low-power</b> {{open-source}} hardware single-board computer (made by Texas Instruments) has {{switched to}} Debian Linux preloaded on its Beaglebone Black board's flash.|$|E
5|$|KALH-LP is a <b>low-power</b> FM {{station that}} carries a variety radio format, network {{news on the}} hour, and local news on some hours.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunication over fixed {{lines is}} called {{point-to-point}} communication {{because it is}} between one transmitter and one receiver. Telecommunication through radio broadcasts is called broadcast communication because it is between one powerful transmitter and numerous <b>low-power</b> but sensitive radio receivers.|$|E
5|$|The town's small {{business}} district includes a bar, two restaurants, a traveler's inn, a wellness center, small specialty shops, and a pottery gallery. A <b>low-power</b> radio station, KBAS-LP, 98.3FM, owned by Jefferson County Disaster and Emergency Services, broadcasts from Basin.|$|E
5|$|Per {{the base}} specification, any device {{attached}} to an SDP must initially be a <b>low-power</b> device, with high-power mode contingent on later USB configuration by the host. Charging ports, however, can immediately supply between 0.5 and 1.5A of current. The charging port may apply current limiting or shut down completely, but must not apply limiting below 0.5A, and must not shut down below 1.5A or before the voltage drops to 2V.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{is home to}} {{the summer}} music festival Athfest, , the Athens Popfest and the late spring Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the <b>low-power</b> (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most {{prominent}} modern music media. Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a <b>low-power</b> compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{buildings}} from Basin's heyday form much of {{the core}} of the CDP's small business district, which includes a fire station, a post office, two restaurants, a bar, a commercial gallery, small specialty shops. Basin has a small elementary school, its own water system, and a <b>low-power</b> radio station. Local volunteers and elected trustees provide limited services to the settlement, but it relies on the government of Jefferson County, Montana, for law enforcement and other services. From 1993 through 2011 Basin was home to the Montana Artists Refuge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to limiting the total average power {{used by the}} device, the USB specification limits the inrush current (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and filter capacitors) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. USB devices are also required to automatically enter ultra <b>low-power</b> suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.|$|E
5|$|<b>Low-power</b> and {{high-power}} devices remain operational {{with this}} standard, but devices using SuperSpeed {{can take advantage}} of increased available current of between 150mA and 900mA, respectively. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2– December 2010), which increases the power handling capability to 1.5A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5A.|$|E
5|$|The school {{implemented}} {{a system of}} entrance examinations starting in 1934. The examination program was later expanded to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science, and was developed {{with the assistance of}} Columbia University. During the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries and cafeterias. In 1956, a team of six students designed and began construction of a cyclotron, and a <b>low-power</b> test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.|$|E
5|$|Utica {{is served}} by three {{stations}} affiliated with major television networks: WKTV 2 (NBC; CBS on DT2; CW on DT3), WUTR 20 (ABC), and WFXV 33 (Fox). PBS member station WCNY-TV in Syracuse operates translator W22DO-D on analog channel 22 and digital channel 24. Several <b>low-power</b> television stations, such as WPNY-LP 11 (MyNetworkTV), also broadcast in the area. Cable television viewers are served by the Syracuse office of Charter Communications (doing business as Charter Spectrum), which offers a local news service, a local sports channel, and public-access channels. Dish Network and DirecTV provide satellite television customers with local broadcast channels.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} USB devices use the 5V {{power supply}} without {{participating in a}} proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface. These are usually called USB decorations. Examples include USB-powered keyboard lights, fans, mug coolers and heaters, battery chargers, miniature vacuum cleaners, and even miniature lava lamps. In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a <b>low-power</b> mode (100mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.|$|E
25|$|WRUF-LD is a <b>low-power</b> {{television}} station that carries weather, news, and sports programming.|$|E

25|$|The Albany-Schenectady-Troy media market, the 56th {{largest in}} the United States, {{includes}} all of the 11 counties of the Capital District, along with Hamilton County, New York, as well as Berkshire County, Massachusetts, and Bennington County, Vermont. In total, there are 16 AM/MW stations, 30 full-power FM stations, 14 <b>low-power</b> FM translators, 8 full power analog TV stations, 5 <b>low-power</b> TV translators, and 8 full power digital TV (DTV) stations licensed to communities within 30 miles (48km) of downtown Albany.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the only {{stations}} broadcasting in black-and-white {{were a few}} high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, {{and a handful of}} <b>low-power</b> repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s, B sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably <b>low-power</b> uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s, even those areas switched to color sets.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have criticized fMRI studies for problematic statistical analyses, {{often based on}} <b>low-power,</b> small-sample studies. Other fMRI researchers have defended their work as valid.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{resistive}} ROs can {{be operated}} at AC voltages exceeding 200 V {{and used as}} <b>low-power</b> AC or DC relays, e.g., to control electroluminescent indicators.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{conceived}} in 1816 as an industrial prime mover to rival the steam engine, its practical use was largely confined to <b>low-power</b> domestic applications {{for over a}} century.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance outputs {{typically}} require high quiescent (i.e., idle) {{current in}} the output stage and will dissipate more power, so <b>low-power</b> designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Low-power</b> FM {{stations}} include Drake University's KDRA-LP, on the 94.1 frequency, and KFMG-LP 99.1, {{a community}} radio station broadcasting from the Hotel Fort Des Moines and also webstreamed.|$|E
