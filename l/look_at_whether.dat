2500|$|The 1987 case R. v. Collins had {{established}} three factors {{to consider when}} determining whether to exclude evidence. First, the courts would <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>whether</b> the admission of the evidence would affect {{the fairness of the}} trial. Second, they would look at the seriousness of the Charter violation, and third, they would look at the effect of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice. [...] Typically, evidence obtained through violating an accused's right to have counsel (section 10(b)) or the right to security from unreasonable search and seizure (section 8) was excluded by this section.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of his opinion in this case, Marshall began the careful work of {{determining}} what the phrase [...] "commerce...among the several states" [...] means in the Constitution. He stressed that one must <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>whether</b> the commerce in question has wide-ranging effects, suggesting that commerce which does [...] "affect other states" [...] may be interstate commerce, even if it does not cross state lines. Of course, the steamboats in this case did cross a state line, but Marshall suggested that his opinion had a broader scope than that. Indeed, Marshall's opinion in Gibbons would be cited by the Supreme Court much later when it upheld aspects of the New Deal in cases like Wickard v. Filburn in 1942. But, the opinion in Gibbons can also be read more narrowly. After all, Marshall also wrote: ...|$|E

The study found that reminding users of their uniqueness increased their willingness to contribute.
