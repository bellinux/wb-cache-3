5|$|Tungsten is {{the only}} metal from the third {{transition}} series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence is the {{production}} and emission of light by a <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> It {{is a form of}} chemiluminescence. Bioluminescence occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi, microorganisms including some bioluminescent bacteria and terrestrial invertebrates such as fireflies. In some animals, the light is bacteriogenic, produced by symbiotic organisms such as Vibrio bacteria; in others, it is autogenic, produced by the animals themselves.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E

30|$|In {{cognitive}} science, {{the concept}} of affordance is often considered [25], which is an idea in which information is ubiquitous within an environment. The affordance refers {{to the possibility of}} a specific behavior based on the environment. According to this idea, instead of <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> arbitrarily expressing a behavior, the environment affords the possibility of expressing the specific behavior on <b>living</b> <b>organisms,</b> and as <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> receive the possibility, the behavior is expressed.|$|R

5|$|Ganymede is the Solar System's largest {{moon and}} the Solar System's only known moon with a magnetosphere, {{but this does not}} shield it from cosmic {{radiation}} to a noteworthy degree, because it is overshadowed by Jupiter's magnetic field. Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest natural radiation levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E
5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified world views to discover {{the nature of the}} divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single <b>living</b> <b>organism,</b> although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} of a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> {{depends on the}} continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
50|$|Biochemistry is {{the study}} of {{chemical}} processes in <b>living</b> <b>organisms,</b> including, but not limited to, living matter.

50|$|Biologists {{reason that}} all <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> on Earth must share a single last {{universal}} ancestor, {{because it would}} be virtually impossible that two or more separate lineages could have independently developed the many complex biochemical mechanisms common to all <b>living</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sun is {{the primary}} source of energy for <b>living</b> <b>organisms.</b> Some <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> like plants need {{sunlight}} directly while other organisms like humans can acquire energy from the sun indirectly. There is however evidence that some bacteria can thrive in harsh environments like Antarctica as evidence by the blue-green algae beneath thick layers of ice in the lakes. No matter what the type of living species, all <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> must capture, transduce, store, and use energy to live.|$|R
5|$|Scientist David Banner has {{the idea}} to create super {{soldiers}} by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use human subjects. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After {{the birth of his}} son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a geneticist working with his girlfriend, Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the nanomeds once they are introduced into a <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.|$|E

25|$|It {{has also}} been shown that, while {{stimulating}} muscarinic cholinergic receptors in cultured pheochromocytoma cells increases HCN production, in a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> (in vivo) muscarinic cholinergic stimulation actually decreases HCN production.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{induction}} of apoptosis {{occurs when}} one or several cells of a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> {{are infected with}} a virus, leading to cell death.

25|$|One of {{the reasons}} for {{interest}} in the early atmosphere and ocean is that they form the conditions under which life first arose. There are many models, but little consensus, on how life emerged from non-living chemicals; chemical systems created in the laboratory fall well short of the minimum complexity for a <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the origin of life and the production of artificial <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> and programmable nano-biorobots we used ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) Hartree-Fock (HF), density functional theory (DFT), QM semiempirical PM 3 [1, 2 } and molecular dynamics (MD) NAMD, GROMACS and CHARMM simulations [3 - 5] to investigate various bioorganic systems of artificial minimal <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> based on peptide nucleic acid (PNA), photo-sensitizer, lipid precursor and SH anion molecules [6]. Quantum modeling of nano-structures self-assembly in PNA based minimal <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> were performed using our developed software for building PNA double helix [7] and additionally our implemented code in quantum chemical program packages for the calculations of extended DFT [8 - 10] for accurate descriptions of hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions. Our originally developed codes for electron charge and spin density tunneling calculations and visualization in electronic and magnetic excited states we used for quantum mechanical search of new light harvesting sensitizers in artificial <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> and for quantum modeling of molecular electronics and spintronics logical elements in PNA based minimal <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> [11, 12]...|$|R

50|$|Biochemist Linus Pauling stated thatBiological {{specificity}} is the set {{of characteristics}} of <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> or constituents of <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> of being special or doing something special. Each animal or plant species is special. It differs in some way from all other species. ……biological specificity is the major problem about understanding life.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} of a truly <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> (e.g. a simple bacterium) with no ancestors would {{be a much more}} complex task, but may well be possible to some degree according to current biological knowledge. A synthetic genome has been transferred into an existing bacterium where it replaced the native DNA, resulting in the artificial {{production of}} a new M. mycoides organism.|$|E
25|$|Of a {{different}} kind is the approach made by James Lovelock. In the 1970s he and microbiologist Lynn Margulis presented the Gaia theory or hypothesis, that states that all organisms and their inorganic surroundings on Earth are integrated into a single self-regulating system. The system {{has the ability to}} react to perturbations or deviations, much like a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> adjusts its regulation mechanisms to accommodate environmental changes such as temperature (homeostasis). Nevertheless, this capacity has limits. For instance, when a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> is subjected to a temperature that is lower or higher than its living range, it can perish because its regulating mechanism cannot make the necessary adjustments. Similarly the Earth {{may not be able to}} react to large deviations in critical parameters. In his book The Revenge of Gaia, he affirms that the destruction of rainforests and biodiversity, compounded with the increase of greenhouse gases made by humans, is producing global warming.|$|E
25|$|From the {{essential}} perspective, {{the soul of}} every <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> is perfect in every way, is independent of any actions of the organism, and is considered God or to have godliness. But the epithet of God {{is given to the}} soul in whom its properties manifest in accordance with its inherent nature. There are countably infinite souls in the universe.|$|E
50|$|Biochemistry is {{the science}} of the {{chemical}} processes which takes place within <b>living</b> <b>organisms.</b> Living organisms need essential elements to survive, consisting of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus.

Society, according to Upadhyaya, rather than arising from a social contract between individuals, was fully born at its inception itself as a natural <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> with a definitive 'national soul' or 'ethos' and its needs of the social organism paralleled those of the individual.|$|E
25|$|Biologists with philosophic {{interests}} responded, emphasising {{the dual}} {{nature of the}} <b>living</b> <b>organism.</b> On the one hand there was the genetic programme (represented in nucleic acids) - the genotype. On the other there was its extended body or soma - the phenotype. In accommodating the more probabilistic and non-universal nature of biological generalisations, it was a help that standard philosophy of science {{was in the process}} of accommodating similar aspects of 20th century physics.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{instructions}} {{of every}} replicating cell in a <b>living</b> <b>organism</b> are contained within its DNA.
