It was written by Diddy, Skylar Grey, Jay-Z, J. Cole, and Alex [...] "da Kid" [...] Grant, and {{produced}} by Jay-Z and Grant. When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat {{that makes me feel}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man in a basement in Atlanta".

Within {{a few weeks to}} a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of [...] to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, diastase activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the Phadebas methods.

2500|$|When the Lakers {{faced the}} Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made {{headlines}} {{by engaging in}} handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify {{the end of the}} so-called [...] "Bryant–O'Neal feud" [...] that had festered since the center left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant. However, on June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant {{for not being able to}} win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times [...] "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes." [...] O'Neal justified his act by saying [...] "I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all." [...] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal, Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to [...] "use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language".

2500|$|Luther was {{a school}} {{recruiter}} for Captain Richard Henry Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He was sincere in his desire to show what we had learned, and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills. [...] However, many children died in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. [...] Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. It was not the negligence of Captain Pratt, but rather lax Indian agents who would set aside letters from Carlisle until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would never see them again. Luther got mixed reception home on the reservation. Some were proud of his achievements while others lamented that he had, in effect, become a white man. He was happy to be home and some of his relatives aid that he “looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> boy dressed in eastern clothes.” Luther felt proud to be compared to a white boy. But others would not shake his hand because some returning Carlisle students were ashamed of their culture, and a few even tried to pretend that they did not speak Lakota.

Some rejected their educational experiences and “returned to the blanket”, casting off white ways. Others found it more convenient and satisfying to remain in white society.

2500|$|Diddy {{described}} the Last Train to Paris as an [...] "electro-hip-hop-soul funk" [...] album {{which has been}} {{three years in the}} making. Diddy says the sound of this album was influenced [...] "by being in the dance music world and doing stuff with Felix da Housecat, Erick Morillo, Deep Dish, DJ Hell and being in Ibiza and DC10." [...] The arc will follow Diddy's character as he tours from London to Paris and finds the woman of his dreams - only to lose her, find her, lose her again and find her a final time. The records were conceptualised from Diddy's comments to his producers. He told Alex da Kid (who produced [...] "Coming Home") [...] "I want a beat that makes me feel <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man in a basement in Atlanta." [...] Diddy said that [...] "most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time. The records came together by hanging out with them, taking them to parties and showing them movies". In an interview with MTV News Diddy said [...] "One of the things [...] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records out right now — no disrespect to them, but they're all surface. It's about what people have or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion — you get a feeling, a vibe." [...] Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was [...] "assembled from 60 or so songs. The genesis of Last Train to Paris is full of odd stories involving our hero, ensconced in a darkened studio, barking batty ideas to his production team." ...|$|E
