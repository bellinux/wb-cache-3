5|$|The fibres {{that form}} the spinal {{accessory}} nerve are formed by <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, {{is located in the}} lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} is {{primarily}} composed of neurons, glial cells, neural stem cells, and blood vessels. Types of neuron include interneurons, pyramidal cells including Betz cells, motor neurons (upper and <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons),</b> and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Betz cells {{are the largest}} cells (by size of cell body) in the nervous system. The adult human brain is estimated to contain 86±8 billion neurons, with a roughly equal number (85±10 billion) of non-neuronal cells. Out of these neurons, 16 billion (19%) {{are located in the}} cerebral cortex, and 69 billion (80%) are in the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> that synapse with {{upper motor neurons}} at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E

50|$|A <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> lesion is a lesion {{which affects}} nerve fibers {{traveling}} from the ventral horn or anterior grey column of {{the spinal cord}} to the relevant muscle(s) - the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron.</b>|$|R
5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
25|$|Alpha (α) motor neurons (also called alpha motoneurons), are large, multipolar <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> of the {{brainstem}} {{and spinal}} cord. They innervate extrafusal muscle fibers of skeletal muscle and are {{directly responsible for}} initiating their contraction. Alpha motor neurons are distinct from gamma motor neurons, which innervate intrafusal muscle fibers of muscle spindles.|$|E
25|$|Like other neurons, <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> {{have both}} afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) connections. Alpha motor neurons receive input {{from a number}} of sources, {{including}} upper motor neurons, sensory neurons, and interneurons. The primary output of α-MNs is to extrafusal muscle fibers. This afferent and efferent connectivity is required to achieve coordinated muscle activity.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{signs are}} collectively termed the [...] "upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome". Affected muscles {{typically}} show multiple signs, with severity {{depending on the}} degree of damage and other factors that influence motor control. In neuroanatomical circles, it is often joked, for example, that hemisection of the cervical spinal cord leads to an [...] "upper <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome and a <b>lower</b> upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> syndrome". The saying refers to <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> symptoms in the upper extremity (arm) and upper <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> symptoms in the lower extremity (leg).|$|R

5000|$|Motor {{information}} travels {{from the}} brain down the spinal cord via descending spinal cord tracts. Descending tracts involve two neurons: the upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> (UMN) and <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> (LMN). [...] A nerve signal travels down the upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> until it synapses with the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> in the spinal cord. Then, the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> conducts the nerve signal to the spinal root where efferent nerve fibers carry the motor signal toward the target muscle. The descending tracts are composed of white matter. There are several descending tracts serving different functions. The corticospinal tracts (lateral and anterior) are responsible for coordinated limb movements.|$|R
25|$|The {{disorder}} causes {{muscle weakness}} and atrophy {{throughout the body}} due to the degeneration of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement, although bladder and bowel function and the muscles responsible for eye movement are usually spared until {{the final stages of}} the disorder.|$|E
500|$|The {{wall of the}} {{esophagus}} from the lumen outwards consists of mucosa, submucosa (connective tissue), layers of muscle fibers between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective tissue. The mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium of around three layers of squamous cells, which contrasts to the single layer of columnar cells of the stomach. The transition between {{these two types of}} epithelium is visible as a zig-zag line. [...] Most of the muscle is smooth muscle although striated muscle predominates in its upper third. It has two muscular rings or sphincters in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. The lower sphincter helps to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. The esophagus has a rich blood supply and venous drainage. Its smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary nerves (sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic trunk and parasympathetic nerves via the vagus nerve) and in addition voluntary nerves (<b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> which are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.|$|E
2500|$|The nerve axons {{traveling}} {{down the}} tract {{are referred to}} as efferent nerve fibers of the upper motor neurons. These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> The majority of axons do not directly synapse with <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so {{at the level of the}} spinal cord they terminate in.|$|E

2500|$|ALS {{itself can}} be {{classified}} a few different ways: by how fast the disease progresses (slow vs fast progressors), by whether it is inherited or sporadic, and by where it starts. [...] Most commonly (~70% of the time) the limbs are affected first. In this case, neurons in the brain (upper motor neurons) and in the spinal cord (<b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> are dying and this form is called [...] "limb onset". [...] In about 25% of cases, [...] muscles in the face, mouth, and throat are affected first because motor neurons {{in the part of}} the brain stem called the medulla oblongata (formerly called the [...] "bulb") start to die first along with <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons.</b> This form is called [...] "bulbar onset". [...] In about 5% of cases muscles in the trunk of the body are affected first. [...] In all cases the disease spreads and affects other regions. [...] The symptoms may also be limited to one spinal region.|$|E
2500|$|Fibres {{from the}} [...] motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the {{internal}} capsule, but terminate {{in a number}} of locations in the midbrain (cortico-mesencephalic tract), pons (Corticopontine tract), and medulla oblongata (cortico-bulbar tract). [...] The upper motor neurons of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei, namely oculomotor, trochlear, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, abducens, facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal, vagus and accessory nerves. [...] These nuclei are supplied by nerves {{from both sides of the}} brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face. These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral (opposite) side of the cortex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> (LMNs) are motor neurons {{located in}} either the {{anterior}} grey column, anterior nerve roots (spinal <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons)</b> or the cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem and cranial nerves with motor function (cranial nerve <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons).</b> All voluntary movement relies on spinal <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> which innervate skeletal muscle fibers and act as a link between upper motor neurons and muscles. Cranial nerve <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> control movements of the eyes, face and tongue, and contribute to chewing, swallowing and vocalization. Damage to the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> can lead to flaccid paralysis.|$|E

From the sacral plexus, the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> travels down the sciatic nerve. [...] The sciatic nerve {{branches}} {{into the deep}} fibular nerve and the tibial nerve. The tibial nerve innervates the semitendinosus {{as well as the}} other hamstring muscles, the semimembranosus and biceps femoris.|$|R

5000|$|Neuromuscular {{diseases}} {{are those that}} affect the muscles and/or their direct nervous system control, problems with central nervous control can cause either spasticity or some degree of paralysis (from both <b>lower</b> and upper <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> disorders), depending on the location {{and the nature of}} the problem. Some examples of central disorders include cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Spinal muscular atrophies are disorders of <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> while amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a mixed upper and <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neuron</b> condition.|$|R
50|$|There are {{upper motor neurons}} and <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons,</b> {{with the}} cell type {{described}} above being a lower motor neuron. Upper motor neurons are cortico-spinal interneurons that arise from the motor cortex and descend to the spinal cord where they activate the <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> through synapses.

5000|$|The {{anterior}} corticospinal tract descends ipsilaterally in {{the anterior}} column, where the axons emerge and either synapse on lower ventromedial (VM) motor neurons in the ventral horn ipsilaterally or descussate at the anterior white commissure where they synapse on VM <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> contralaterally [...] The tectospinal, vestibulospinal and reticulospinal descend ipsilaterally in the anterior column {{but do not}} synapse across the anterior white commissure. Rather, they only synapse on VM <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> ipsilaterally. The VM <b>lower</b> <b>motor</b> <b>neurons</b> control the large, postural muscles of the axial skeleton.

30|$|We {{show that}} FMCA is {{associated}} with disability independently of BPF.
