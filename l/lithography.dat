5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam <b>lithography</b> and nanosphere <b>lithography</b> to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E
5|$|Electron-beam <b>lithography</b> (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching {{semiconductors}} at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium {{aluminium}} garnet (Al5Lu3O12) {{has been}} proposed {{for use as a}} lens material in high refractive index immersion <b>lithography.</b> Additionally, a tiny amount of lutetium is added as a dopant to gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), which is used in magnetic bubble memory devices. Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED light bulbs.|$|E

5|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped with Mk. II's in May 1941 and Finucane {{was assigned}} serial P8038, formerly of No. 303 Squadron RAF, on 21 May. It {{was the first}} of four Spitfires to carry the Shamrock emblem as his personal insignia. Jimmy Firth, his airframe rigger and 'Speedy' Moore, a Canadian engine fitter, were attempting to put an outline of the design on. Poorly done, it attracted the attention of Maurice Pownhall a professional in <b>Lithography.</b> Using green dope he completed the emblem on the forward left part of the cockpit fairing panel. Finucane approved and the Shamrock stayed.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} retail release of The King of Limbs, Radiohead {{distributed}} a free single-issue newspaper, the Universal Sigh, at independent record shops {{across the world}} on 28 March 2011. Donwood and Yorke distributed copies in person at a record shop in east London. Influenced by free newspapers such as LA Weekly or London Lite, the Universal Sigh is a 12-page tabloid printed using web-offset <b>lithography</b> on newsprint paper and features artwork, poetry, and lyrics along with short stories by Donwood, Jay Griffiths and Robert Macfarlane.|$|E
5|$|A <b>lithography</b> in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and an olive branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems {{surrounded}} by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint {{is referred to as}} Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).|$|E

5|$|A {{thousand}} {{copies of}} the report were printed by <b>lithography</b> at the Pentagon, and deposited in Groves's office in the New War Department Building in Washington, DC, where they were kept securely locked away. Final approval was sought from the President, Harry S. Truman, in {{a meeting at the}} White House on August 9, 1945, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima. Stimson, Harrison, Groves, Conant, Vannevar Bush, and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy presented their views, and Truman authorized the immediate release of the report. The War Department released the thousand {{copies of the}} report that had been kept in Groves's office to the media for use by the radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9:00 pm on August 11, 1945, and for the newspapers of August 12.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1844, Thayer left the <b>lithography</b> {{business}} {{and was replaced by}} John Bufford, a lithographer who worked for Thayer in Boston from 1939 through 1844. Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own firm in New York under the title Bufford Lithographer. By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford Lithographer so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of {{the fall of}} 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of Happiness is the only Ives' game to list Bufford Lithographer. Green was again used on one of the litho stones but the end space was a green circle. The other litho stone printed black.|$|E
5|$|Though John Cole and the Carrs {{were among}} the first major music {{publishers}} in Baltimore, the city was home to a vibrant publishing tradition in the 19th century, aided by the presence of A. Hoen & Co., one of the biggest <b>lithography</b> firms of the era, who illustrated many music publications. Other prominent music publishers in Baltimore in this era included George Willig, Arthur Clifton, Frederick Benteen, James Boswell, Miller and Beecham, W. C. Peters, Samuel Carusi and G. Fred Kranz. Peters was well known nationally, but first established a Baltimore-based firm in 1849, with partners whose names remain unknown. His sons eventually joined the field, and the company, then known as W. C. Peters & Co., published the Baltimore Olio and Musical Gazette, which contained concert news, printed music, educational and biographical essays and articles. The pianist-composer Charles Grobe was among the contributors.|$|E

25|$|Various {{techniques}} of nanolithography such as optical <b>lithography,</b> X-ray <b>lithography</b> dip pen nanolithography, electron beam <b>lithography</b> or nanoimprint <b>lithography</b> were also developed. <b>Lithography</b> is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced {{in size to}} nanoscale pattern.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these commercially well-established techniques, {{a large number of}} promising microlithographic and nanolithographic technologies exist or are being developed, including nanoimprint <b>lithography,</b> interference <b>lithography,</b> X-ray <b>lithography,</b> extreme ultraviolet <b>lithography,</b> magnetolithography and scanning probe <b>lithography.</b> Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example electron beam <b>lithography,</b> are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). Electron beam <b>lithography</b> is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam <b>lithography</b> as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless <b>lithography,</b> in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam <b>lithography</b> has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E

25|$|Another {{group of}} nanotechnological {{techniques}} include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, {{those used in}} semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet <b>lithography,</b> electron beam <b>lithography,</b> focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint <b>lithography,</b> atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions {{in the development of}} scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.|$|E
