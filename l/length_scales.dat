40|$|The sensory {{perception}} of foods {{is directly related}} to gel morphology. The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between gel water holding and stiffness for gels with a different morphology. Whey protein gels were prepared by varying ionic strength to create fine and coarse-stranded gels. These gels were characterized for their coarseness, stiffness and their water holding capacity. Fine gels were referred to typical coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> smaller than 0. 1 μm and coarse gels were referred to coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> larger than 0. 1 μm. Water holding was measured both as a function of time and of applied pressure. Increased gel coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> in both fine and coarse gels resulted in a larger extent of network deformation at a certain applied force. For fine gels, the coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> of the gel was shown to determine water removal. In the case of coarse gels, coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> and stiffness had a counteracting effect, but coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> was still dominant. These results show that the tuning of coarseness <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> of protein networks independent of stiffness or, the other way round, provides a tool to set the water holding capacity in food gels. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E

40|$|A new mixing <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> is {{presented}} for turbulence closure schemes with {{special emphasis on}} neutral to convective conditions in clear and cloudy boundary layers. The <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> is intended for a prognostic turbulent kinetic energy closure. It is argued that present-day <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> formulations may easily fail in one of following limits: schemes based on a local stabil-ity measure (e. g., the Richardson number) display unrealistic behavior and instabilities in the convective limit. This strongly limits the representation of mixing in cloudy boundary layers. On the other hand, it is shown that non-local parcel methods may misrepresent mixing near the surface. The new <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> formulation combines local and nonlocal stability in a new way; it uses vertical integrals over the stability (the Richardson number) in a simple “parcel ” frame-work. The <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> matches with surface layer similarity for near-neutral conditions and displays a realistic convective limit. The use of the <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> formulation can be extended well to cloudy boundary layers. The scheme is numerically stable and computationally cheap.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} field theory to describe large <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> effects induced by solutes {{in a cold}} and otherwise placid liquid. The theory divides space into a cubic grid of cells. The side length of each cell is {{of the order of}} the bulk correlation length of the bulk liquid. Large <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> states of the cells are specified with an Ising variable. Finer <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> effects are described with a Gaussian field, with mean and variance affected by both the large <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> field and by the constraints imposed by solutes. In the absence of solutes and corresponding constraints, integration over the Gaussian field yields an effective lattice gas Hamiltonian for the large <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> field. In the presence of solutes, the integration adds additional terms to this Hamiltonian. We identify these terms analytically. They can provoke large <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> effects, such as the formation of interfaces and depletion layers. We apply our theory to compute the reversible work to form a bubble in liquid water, {{as a function of the}} bubble radius. Comparison with molecular simulation results for the same function indicates that the theory is reasonably accurate. Importantly, simulating the large <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> field involves binary arithmetic only. It thus provides a computationally convenient scheme to incorporate explicit solvent dynamics and structure in simulation studies of large molecular assemblies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract] Techniques for {{imposing}} a minimum <b>length</b> <b>scale,</b> or minimum feature size, in continuum topology optimization {{have been proposed}} in literature, with the motivation being stabilization of the maximum stiffness problem and satisfying manufacturing constraints. Imposing an upper bound on feature sizes, however, has not been investigated. This paper proposes a scheme for restricting the maximum <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> in topology optimization. In short, the design domain is searched and structural features larger than the prescribed maximum <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> are penalized. The scheme is implemented {{in the context of}} minimum compliance design together with an existing minimum <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> methodology. The resulting optimization problem is continuous and solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA). Beam design examples are considered and solutions are shown to be near 0 / 1 (void/solid) topologies that satisfy the minimum and maximum <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> criteria. The designer thus gains complete control over member sizes and therefore additional influence over cost and manufacturability. Further, restricting maximum <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> can potentially be used to introduce structural redundancy into the design, as loads previously carried by few large members are often redistributed over an interconnected system of smaller members.

40|$|Abstract. In metaheuristic optimization, {{understanding}} the relation-ship between problems and algorithms is important but non-trivial. There {{has been a}} growing interest {{in the literature on}} techniques for analysing problems, however previous work has mainly been developed for discrete problems. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for characterising continuous optimization problems based on the concept of <b>length</b> <b>scale.</b> We argue that <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> is an important property for the characterisa-tion of continuous problems that is not captured by existing techniques. Intuitively, <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> measures the ratio of changes in the objective function value to steps between points in the search space. The concept is simple, makes few assumptions and can be calculated or estimated based only on the information available in black-box optimization (ob-jective function values and search points).
