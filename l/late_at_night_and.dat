I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and {{we came up with}} the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|Using Iraqi passports, Oan {{and three}} {{other members of the}} DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in Earls Court. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. The men {{typically}} returned to the flat drunk, <b>late</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes accompanied by prostitutes. Within a week, the housekeeper asked them to leave. They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in the flat on one occasion.|$|E

After {{a series}} of other story pitches, Lidster was asked to work on one of Russel T Davies’s standby plots {{concerning}} a spooky 24-hour supermarket to center on Jack and Ianto. Described as “Die Hard in a Supermarket”, it was set shortly after Ianto was brought {{back from the dead}} (as was originally planned, before this storyline shifted to Owen). It would have involved getting a woman named Maggie, the supermarket’s last customer, out alive. The store would have been possessed by a demonic creature from the rift that manifested only <b>late</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> which feds of the human life-force. Ianto would have able to save the day due to being already dead.|$|E

25|$|Some {{days after}} the find was {{revealed}} a local farmer (Karl Andersson) told Albert Sandklef of a legend he had heard as a child.

He would start haunting <b>late</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> in order to stop this, poles were struck through his body, whereafter the haunting stopped. As far as the farmer could remember they mentioned Store Mosse, a bog about 10 miles from the find, close to Nackhälle village, though he acknowledged that his memory might fail him as he had grown up in the vicinity of that bog.|$|E
25|$|In September 1988, Dahmer's {{grandmother}} {{asked him}} {{to move out of}} her house because of his habit of bringing young men to her house <b>late</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> the foul smells emanating from both the basement and the garage.

I could not, therefore, resist the temptation of writing to you; I argued with myself it is very pleasant for me to write, and it will not be exactly painful, though it may be tiresome to monsieur to read.

25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme. For example, {{one or more of the}} women would become involved in some sort of problem, often involving other family members, men, or an ethical dilemma. At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes <b>late</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E
25|$|Fort Wayne being {{equidistant}} from Chicago, Detroit and Cincinnati, clear-channel WOWO {{competed with}} WLS, WJR, and WLW for the agricultural market. Farmers {{would have the}} radio turned on in the milking parlor; research seemed to indicated that it relaxed the cows and produced more milk. In an era when live music was the rule, {{rather than the exception}} on the radio, WOWO's Nancy Lee and the Hilltoppers proved popular with rural audiences, and eventually WLS, WJR and WLW surrendered the rural audience to concentrate on their urban audiences, leaving WOWO unchallenged for the rural market, and giving them the largest audience of any Fort Wayne area station for decades, until FM stations largely displaced AM stations. WOWO could be heard as far away as Florida, especially {{early in the morning and}} <b>late</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> many snowbirds listened to WOWO year-around. They shut down the transmitter on Sunday nights, giving Philadelphia station WCAU at 1210 AM a slight ratings boost as sleepless WOWO listeners sought something to listen to.|$|E

He regained his place in the 1957–58 season, and stopped his partying lifestyle as he settled down to married life.

500|$|The {{writing process}} for Fantasy Black Channel was largely unplanned.

The lyrics in the chorus are about the first time Late of the Pier drove to London and got lost. [...] "Space and the Woods" [...] tries to weigh up what is more important: a person or an inanimate object, or an absence of anything, while [...] "The Bears Are Coming" [...] concerns [...] "a silent threat". The idea for the lyric [...] "A heartbeat, a flicker, a line" [...] in [...] "Heartbeat" [...] came to Eastgate while recording the song and hearing its time signature always changing.|$|E
