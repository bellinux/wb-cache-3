5|$|Today, {{the legend}} of Henry is {{challenged}} by historians {{to the point of}} being labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe, and in the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> of either the crusade or Henry, that possibility may not be fully denied.|$|E
5|$|Unas {{assumed the}} throne {{at the death}} of his {{predecessor}} Djedkare Isesi. Djedkare is thought to have been Unas' father, in spite of the complete <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> bearing on the question. The succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> other <b>evidence</b> is not {{necessarily}} fatal to its plausibility, as the 3rd century saw a huge diminution {{in the frequency of}} inscriptions compared to the two preceding centuries. Furthermore, if the legion was founded around in the period 230-44 and destroyed in 251, its existence lasted only a decade or two, explaining the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> more <b>evidence.</b>|$|R

5|$|In March 1991, {{the case}} against Amedo and Dominguez in {{relation}} to the Monbar attack was dropped due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> However, in September 1991, both Amedo and Dominguez were sentenced to 108 years in prison for organising other GAL attacks.

5|$|Kemp, {{along with}} Williams {{and three other}} teammates, were accused of raping a 19-year-old woman {{at the time of}} a high school all-star {{basketball}} tournament on January 20, 2002, at the Columbus, Ohio Hyatt hotel. The players were suspended from the team during the investigation. However, the woman did not press charges, and the district attorney opted to not pursue the matter due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in {{determining}} the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and payments made by insurance agencies. Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's next-of-kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 passengers on board.|$|E

50|$|Sicyopterus griseus, the Clown goby, is {{a species}} of goby endemic to India and Sri Lanka, where it is found in estuaries, blackwaters, and fresh waters. The populations within Sri Lanka is not yet internationally accepted, due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidences</b> (Jayaram 1999). This species can reach a length of 9.7 cm SL.|$|R

Both were released on bail, but were suspended by the club pending a police inquiry. Whalley was not charged due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> On 18 May 2015, Whalley left Luton by mutual consent {{two months before the}} end of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Polyphenols {{of several}} classes are {{widespread}} in medicinal plants; these substances likely fight infection and reduce grazing by herbivorous insects. They include hormone-mimicking phytoestrogens, and astringent tannins. In Ayurveda, the astringent rind of the pomegranate {{is used as}} a medicine, while polyphenol extracts from plant materials such as grape seeds are sold for their potential health benefits despite the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three bad endings {{see one of}} {{the protagonists}} undergo the second {{transformation}} if Indiana could not convince Ubermann to use the machine instead, or if Sophia was not freed from her prison or Nur-Ab-Sal's influence. In the good ending, Atlantis succumbs to the eruption of the still active volcano as the duo flees from the city. The final scene depicts Indiana kissing Sophia on top of the escape submarine, to comfort himself for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for their discovery.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic eruptions are {{not known}} to have {{occurred}} from the Anahim hotspot in historical times. However, since 2007 there have been recorded volcano tectonic earthquakes and carbon dioxide emissions {{in the vicinity of}} Nazko Cone. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for historic seismicity prior to 2007 suggests that the area is tectonically stable, making the Nechako Basin one of the most seismically inactive areas of British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|A {{comprehensive}} analysis {{conducted in}} 1980 by Hopson questioned Thulborn's ideas. Hopson {{showed that the}} wear facet patterns on the teeth in fact indicate vertical and lateral rather than back and forth jaw movements. Furthermore, Hopson demonstrated variability {{in the degree of}} tooth wear, indicating continuous tooth replacement. He did acknowledge that X-ray images of the most complete specimen showed that this individual indeed lacked unerupted replacement teeth. According to Hopson, this indicated that only juveniles continuously replaced their teeth, and that this process ceased when reaching adulthood. Thulborn's aestivation hypothesis was rejected by Hopson due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
30|$|Incidence of IPH in the {{intensive}} care is unknown. Most of the time, these patients usually need hemodynamic and/or respiratory support and blood transfusion [6]. Given the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidences,</b> there is no consensus on therapeutics, and each decision, i.e., conservative treatment, embolization, surgical or CT scan-guided hematoma’s drainage, is made by weighting risks and benefits [7].|$|R

5|$|A ring Roxy {{inherited}} from Archie, which went missing at Christmas, is planted in Janine's flat. Marsden receives an anonymous tip-off and Janine is arrested after the ring {{is found in}} her teapot. She is interviewed, but is released due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> She realises that Peggy planted the ring {{in an attempt to}} frame her. When Shirley thinks Phil is seeing another woman, she accuses him of only being interested in her for her alibi. He says it is not true, but she drunkenly threatens to withdraw the alibi, and walks to the police station.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{liothyronine}} (synthetic T3) to levothyroxine {{has been}} suggested as a measure to provide better symptom control, but {{this has not been}} confirmed by studies. In 2007, the British Thyroid Association stated that combined T4 and T3 therapy carried a higher rate of side effects and no benefit over T4 alone. Similarly, American guidelines discourage combination therapy due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> although they acknowledge that some people feel better when receiving combination treatment. Treatment with liothyronine alone has not received enough study to make a recommendation as to its use; due to its shorter half-life it needs to be taken more often.|$|E
5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling {{of the case and}} deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E
