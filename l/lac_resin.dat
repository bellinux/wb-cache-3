5000|$|Ashta means 8 in Sanskrit and Bandhanam means tying or fixing. Ashtabandhanam is {{the process}} of {{affixing}} an idol to its pedestal (peetham) with a clay-like paste made of 8 specific herbs mixed with wood <b>lac,</b> limestone powder, <b>resin,</b> red ochre, beeswax and butter. The paste is formed into long rolls about 2 cm thick and applied directly {{around the base of the}} idol, so that the cemented joints become watertight. This process is believed to keep the idol rejuvenated for a period of 12 years. When the Bandhanam is performed with gold (Swarnabandhanam), the rejuvenating power of the deity is believed to last for a period of 100 years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{powerful}} Kingdom of Lan Xang had {{wealth and}} influence {{due to the}} location of its capital along the Silk Route and also serving as the center of Buddhism in Southeast Asia. The kingdom prospered with riverine traffic along the Mekong and overland caravan routes to the ports of Siam, which had emerged as a bustling entrepôt of sea-borne trade, and to southern China and other Tai mueang. The first Western visitors during the reign of Phra Chao Sourigna Vongsa ( [...] , พระเจ้าสุริยวงศาธรรมิกราช) (1634-1697 AD) noted how the kingdom prospered off exports of gold, benzoin <b>resin,</b> <b>lac</b> and lacquer ware, medicinal herbs, ivory, silk and silk clothing, and wood.

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>lac</b> <b>resin</b> samples {{obtained}} from artists’ suppliers, industrial manufacturers, and museum collections were analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) and reactive pyrolysis GCMS with quaternary ammonium reagents. These techniques allowed a detailed chemical characterisation of microgram-sized samples, {{based on the}} detection and identification of derivatives of the hydroxy aliphatic and cyclic (sesquiterpene) acids that compose the resin. Differences in composition {{could be related to}} the nature of the resin, e. g. wax-containing (unrefined), bleached, or aged samples. Furthermore, differences in the relative abundances of aliphatic hydroxyacids appear to be associated with the biological source of the resin. The diagnostic value of newly characterised lac components, including 8 -hydroxyacids, is discussed here for the first time. Identification of derivatised components was aided by AMDIS deconvolution software, and discrimination of samples was enhanced by statistical evaluation of data using principal component analysis. The robustness of the analyses, together with the minimal sample size required, make these very powerful approaches for the characterisation of <b>lac</b> <b>resin</b> in museum objects. The value of such analyses for enhancing the understanding of museum collections is illustrated by two case studies of objects in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art: a restorer’s varnish on a painting by Luca Signorelli, and a pictorial inlay in an early nineteenth-century High Chest by George Dyer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), edible fruit, nuts, peel of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), <b>lac,</b> gums, <b>resins,</b> vegetable saps and extracts nes (HS- 13), rubber and articles thereof (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or tufted fabric, lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not knit or crochet (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87). Those commodities are in line with Indonesian government export's strategy direction which mainly focuses on several sectors, including fishery, vegetable products, rubber, wood and wood products, textiles, and transportation. Therefore, Indonesian government should focus to improve those commodities in AEC.

Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissue have been previously described {{but there is no}} protocol of estimating the same quantitatively till date. In the present study a protocol has been attempted to estimate the total terpenoids concentration of different resin producing plants using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent. ### Introduction Terpenes and terpenoids are the primary {{constituents of}} the essential oils of many types of plants and flowers. These compounds belong to the isoprenoid group. Even though isoprene itself has not been found in nature, its polymers, terpenic hydrocarbons and their oxygen derivatives are very often present in large quantities in different plant species. The resin produced by most plants is a viscous liquid, composed mainly of volatile fluid terpene 3. The single isoprene unit, therefore, represents the most basic class of terpenes, the hemiterpenes. An isoprene unit bound to a second isoprene is the defining characteristic of terpene, which is also a monoterpene (C 10). Sesquiterpenes contain three isoprene units (C 15), while diterpenes (C 20) and triterpenes (C 30) contain two and three terpene units respectively. Tetraterpenes consist of four terpene units, polyterpenes more than four such units. In nature, terpenes occur predominantly in the form of hydrocarbons, alcohols and their glycosides, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids and esters. Apart from broad structural diversity, terpenes also exhibit a wide array of biological actions. Essential oils have antimicrobial, antiparasitic, insecticidal and antioxidant/prooxidant activities that often represent the combined bioactivity of multiple components 10. Many plant terpenoids are cytotoxic towards tumour cells and are applied as chemotherapeutic or chemo-preventive compounds 1, 2. Terpenes play an important role as signal compounds and growth regulators (phytohormones) of plants 10. Many insects metabolize the terpenes which they may have obtained from their plant food for synthesizing growth hormones and pheromones 10. Many plant and insect resins like <b>Lac</b> <b>resin</b> also have economically beneficial properties, useful for varnishes and adhesives 4. This protocol describes a rapid, small-scale, high-throughput assay for approximating the total terpenoids content in plant tissue using a monoterpene, Linalool as standard reagent with conc. sulfuric acid. In this reaction Geraniol (primary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O) may be produced from Linalool (Tertiary alcohol, C 10 H 18 O). Alpha-terpineol (C 10 H 18 O) or such monocyclic terpenoids may further be produced from geraniole 3. It is very obscured to explain the exact chemical nature of the reaction in where a brick red precipitation has been formed and which is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution and chloroform but fully in methanol. All estimation has been done spectroscopically at 538 nm. ### Reagents 1. Methanol (Sigma, Cat. No. M 3641) - Sulfuric Acid (Sigma, Cat. No. 320501) - Chloroform (Sigma, Cat. No. C 2432) - Linalool (Sigma, Cat. No. L 2602) ### Equipment 1. Colorimeter - Mixer mill disrupter with adaptor sets for 2 ml tubes (Qiagen tissue lyser) or Mortar & pestle. ### Procedure 1. Harvest plant material (approximately 500 mg.) in screw-capped tubes & freeze immediately in liquid Nitrogen. [Sample must be stored at - 80 ⁰ C for 1 - 2 months but fresh sample must be preferred] - To homogenize the tissue, place three tungsten Carbide beads & 3. 5 ml of ice-cold 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol in each sample tube & insert sample into pre-cooled teflon adaptors. Homogenized tissue for 5 minutes at 30 Hz. If a mixture mill is not available tissue can be homogenized in an ice-cold mortar & pestle. - Remove tungsten carbide beads with a magnet & incubate the sample at room temperature for 48 h in dark. - Centrifuge the samples (4000 g for 15 min. at room temperature) & collect the supernatant in a fresh 2 ml micro-tube. - Add 1. 5 ml Chloroform in each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube & then add 200 µl sample supernatant in each. REMARK For the standard curve 200 µl of previously prepared Linalool solution in methanol will be added to 1. 5 ml Chloroform & serial dilution must be done[dilution level- 100 mg/ 200 µl to 1 mg/ 200 µl (12. 965 µM- 1. 296 µM) Linalool Conc. In case of serial dilution total volume of 200 µl will be make up by addition of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol]. - Vortex the sample mixture thoroughly & take the time 3 min to rest. - Add 100 µl Conc. Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) to each 2 ml microcentrifuge tube. - CRITICAL STEP If heat generation occurs then the entire system must be cooled by using ice-pad but not more than 15 min. - Then the assay tube must be incubated at room temperature for 1. 5 h- 2 h in dark. - PAUSE POINT For standard solution (Linalool) incubate not more than 5 minutes and during incubation time the microcentrifuge tube must not be disturbed. - At the end of incubation time a reddish brown precipitation will be formed in each assay microcentrifuge tube. Then carefully & gently decant all supernatant reaction mixture liquid with-out disturbing the precipitation. - CRITICAL STEP The reddish brown precipitation is partially soluble in reaction mixture solution so must gently decant the supernatant fluid. - Add 1. 5 ml of 95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol & vortex thoroughly until all the precipitation dissolve in Methanol completely. - Transfer the sample from assay tube to Colorimetric cuvette [95 % (Vol/Vol) Methanol will be used as blank] to read the absorbance at 538 nm. Total Terpenoid Calculation 12. Calculate a standard curve from the blank-corrected at wave length at 538 nm of the Linalool standard (Fig. 1). Calculate total terpenoids concentration of unknown plant sample as Linalool equivalents using the regression equation of Linalool standard curve. ### Troubleshooting Terpenoids content varies considerably among leaf and bark tissue and also with environmental and biological stress 8, 11. In the design of this experiment we advise the use of multiple biological and technical replicates, in order to minimize the sample errors (Table 1). Different incubation time should be tried with each plant species and tissue to optimize the assay. Automated liquid handling system may also significantly increase throughput and improve results 6. Most probably sulfuric acid rearranged the linalool and the tertiary alcoholic group reduces to primary alcohol for which the solubility of reaction product has been reduced to chloroform. It is very important to note that sulfuric acid not only reacts to terpenoids but also it may react with methanolic extract of plant tissue samples having plant phenolics and alkaloids. ### Anticipated Results Some qualitative estimation methods of terpenoids in plant tissues have been previously described and widely used 9. The quantitative analytical colorimetric method of total terpenoids concentration in plants as suggested in this protocol can be used to estimate the total terpenoids of different resin producing plants. ### References 1.
