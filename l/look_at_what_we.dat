5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "civilization" [...] is {{used here}} as a synonym for the civically and technologically-advanced (hence, [...] "civilized") invading nations of various European countries. The imagery of the [...] "single-fanged beast" [...] is in {{reference}} to the severe battering delivered to these foreign armies by Turkish forces as part of their independence efforts. Specifically, the poet is creating an image whereby the patriotic {{men and women who are}} advancing the national resistance have knocked out all but one of the ferocious monster's (i.e. the invaders') teeth — hence the expression, [...] "single-fanged". In essence, the poet is building upon his earlier message to the Nation about showing patience and endurance against seemingly-impossible odds. He states that the vast superiority of the invaders in terms of technology, equipment and manpower over the war-stricken, undermanned, and underfed Turkish forces (that were hastily assembled by patriotic civilians and ex-military officials following World War I) can not only be matched, but actually overcome and even defeated by the unassailable spirit of the Turkish people. Thus, the poet is calling out to the Nation, saying, [...] "While 'the lands of the West may be armed with walls of steel', i.e., while these European armies may have seemingly impenetrable/unbeatable modern technology and weaponry, do not be fooled/discouraged by their apparent superiority. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have accomplished so far with virtually non-existent arms and supplies! We are horribly fatigued, and at a disadvantage in every conceivable way, yet we still are able to succeed in our battle for liberty! This seemingly undefeatable 'monster' has had almost every one of its teeth knocked out (hence, 'single-fanged') by our victorious campaign! Our motivation, faith, and internal drive is what has and will continue to carry us through, and that is something that our enemies simply cannot match. All we need for ultimate victory is the ability to recognize our true 'innate strengths': a 'fiery faith' and the 'mighty chest (i.e. heart) of a believer'".|$|E

The club's owners faced recriminations from supporters over the sale of Rob Hulse (top scorer {{over the last two}} season) on transfer deadline day leaving no time to recruit an adequate replacement, leading Executive Chairman Tom Glick to defend the club's actions, stating [...] "We presented the offer to the manager and staff and they made the judgement from a footballing standpoint that this is an offer that was right to accept. Rob has been a great contributor and we acknowledge that when a player like Rob goes there will be disappointment. But ultimately I would have them fans look at the squad Nigel has put together, take a look past the temporary injury situation and take a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have in the squad and the style of football we are playing.

[...] The squad was again suffering from injuries - Chris Porter (hip), Russell Anderson (groin), Stephen Pearson (knee) were all short term casualties, with Steve Davies (cruciate ligaments) and Miles Addison (foot) out for the season. In addition, Jake Buxton was fit enough only for the bench and Tomasz Cywka playing with a protective mask on after fracturing his cheekbone. Reigning Player of the Year Shaun Barker was also playing with a slight thigh strain. The club restated its intention to benefit from the loan system, saying [...] "There will be more and better players available on 7 September that were not available in the last window. That has to do Premier League's 25-man squad rule and Premier League sides holding on to guys just in case to make final decision" [...] The club revealed it had agreed a deal with West Bromwich Albion to sign Chris Wood on loan, but WBA's own injury problems forced them to pull the plug on any deal. Though Derby initially hoped to resurrect it at a later date, they instead bought in Swansea City's Shefki Kuqi on a three-month loan and Wood's West Brom teammate Luke Moore and Sunderland youngster Ryan Noble on 29 day deals.
