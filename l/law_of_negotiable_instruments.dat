50|$|As noted above, essay {{questions}} {{are the most}} variable component of the bar exam. States emphasize different areas of law in their essay questions depending upon their respective histories and public policy priorities. For example, unlike Texas and Alta California, Louisiana did not convert to common law when it was acquired by the United States, so its essay questions require knowledge of the state's unique civil law system. Several states whose law descends from Spanish and Mexican civil law, like Texas and California, require all bar exam applicants to demonstrate knowledge of community property law. Pennsylvania, {{with a history of}} federal tax evasion (e.g., the Whiskey Rebellion), tests federal income tax law, while New Jersey, with a history of discriminatory zoning (resulting in the controversial Mount Laurel doctrine), tests zoning and planning law. Washington, South Dakota, and New Mexico each test Indian law, because of their relatively large populations of Native Americans and large numbers of Indian reservations. Most states test knowledge of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> and secured transactions (Articles 3 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code), but Alaska, California, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania do not; they have recognized {{that the vast majority of}} criminal, personal injury, and family lawyers will never draft a promissory note or litigate the validity of a security interest.|$|E

It was first adopted in Canada in 1890 and, while it has been amended several times, has never been substantially overhauled during the intervening 120 years. One judge described the English Act as 2 ̆ 2 the best drafted Act of Parliament ever passed. 2 ̆ 2 Nevertheless, over the years, some contentious issues have arisen in connection with its interpretation while other provisions have become obsolete. Even so, considering the overall operation of the Act, one can conclude that, as a codification of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments,</b> it has served its purpose well. I do not propose repealing the Act or {{replacing it with a}} new statute.

It should be pointed out that the Act has not functioned as a codification of the law of payment systems or funds transfers. Thus, while it provides for cheques as instruments, it is not a comprehensive code covering cheque collection; nor does it cover other methods for the transfer of funds from one bank account to another.

40|$|A knot of {{controversy}} over the merits of federalizing nonregulatory state banking laws by preempting or otherwise displacing them has gathered {{in an area where}} state authority to govern commercial law commonly has been taken for granted. The problems pervade recent revisions to the state uniform law provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code (2 ̆ 2 U. C. C. 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Code 2 ̆ 2), which are intended to codify the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments,</b> and the laws governing bank collections and payment. The proposed adoption of these changes by the states has raised questions about the proper scope of uniform laws {{and the extent to which}} state laws should endorse deference to federal regulatory authority. The implications of these revisions extend beyond abstract concerns about the coherence of the Code when they are considered together with concerns about the demise of federalism in banking and the adequate representation of interests in federal and state rule-making processes. Originally titled 2 ̆ 2 Commercial Paper 2 ̆ 2 but now limited in scope to 2 ̆ 2 Negotiable Instruments, 2 ̆ 2 the new Article 3 incorporates a deferential approach to the expansion of federal control. Section 3 - 102 (c) states that 2 ̆ 2 [r]egulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and operating circulars of the Federal Reserve Banks supersede any inconsistent provision of this Article to the extent of the inconsistency. 2 ̆ 2 As the analysis below suggests, this provision increases the likelihood that Federal Reserve authorities will administratively supersede the Code and perhaps other state laws in cases where previously they only supplemented them. Since the scope provision not only recognizes the federalization of state law but advances it, questions arise about its legal effect and wisdom. Is this provision really necessary? What substantive effects can be anticipated? If one of the notable accomplishments of the U. C. C. is the preservation of a strong role for state lawmaking authority in the area of commercial law, why should a provision of model uniform state law demand its own supersession? If we explore closely the proposed federal administrative preemption of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> contained in Revised Article 3, perspective may be gained about the Uniform Commercial Code 2 ̆ 7 s prevalent resistance to displacement by federal regulatory law. Part II of this study reviews general principles of federal administrative preemption and displacement of state laws. Part III suggests a framework for understanding the historical importance of the Code and the values of federalism that stand to be undercut by federal administrative displacement. Parts IV and V then examine two existing scope provisions in U. C. C. Articles 3, 4 and 7 in an effort to identify the extent to which these articles have entertained their own supersession. The remainder of this study examines potentially adverse practical consequences and state law constitutional problems flowing from anticipatory displacement provisions...|$|E
40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Faculty of Law, Rand Afrikaans University, 29 August 1974 The {{principles}} of the modern <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> {{are the product of}} an evolution spanning many centuries. Originally the cambial obligation was based on the contract of exchange. an agreement in terms of which the one party undertook to pay {{a certain amount of money}} to the other party and the latter undertook to repay or cause to be repaid the same amount of money at a different time and place and in a different currency. This contract of exchange was executed by means of a bill of exchange, which can functionally be described as an instrument for the transfer of money. The bill of exchange, or its delivery, had no independent obligatory force. The theory of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments,</b> at that stage, centred on the contract of exchange and the medieval writers strove to analyse and classify it within the system of the Roman law of contract. From the 17 th century, the bill of exchange evolved into an instrument of credit. It became a perfectly flexible paper currency adapted to the needs of commerce and the cambial obligation was accordingly founded on the bill itself. Predominant was the idea of a litterarum obligatio. The reaction against the old theory, however. went much too far and the law of bills of exchange was no longer explained in terms of the known concepts of the law of obligations. The Kreationstheorie became popular, resting the cambial obligation not on contract but on the unilateral and abstract promise of the drawer to pay. In the bill, according to this theory, the drawer objectifies his intention to be bound to every factual holder of the instrument. This view dominated judicial thought in Europe during the nineteenth century and found its expression in English decisions then current and still inspires authors of the present day. It is, however, based on a misconception. The Kreationstheorie led to the unavoidable consequence that even a thief or finder of a lost document could, in theory, be a creditor. A corrective was thus necessary and in the effort to find this corrective the modern {{principles of}} the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments</b> were born. Originally, in terms of the different "theories of property" that developed as a reaction to the Kreationstheorie, the mere signature of the drawer or other party is insufficient to found the cambial obligation. To found this obligation it is necessary also for the holder to acquire ownership of the document. These "theories" were not far removed from the ideas underlying the continental rules that sanction the acquisition of property in movables a non domino. Their present importance is, however, not that they offer an explanation for the creation of the cambial obligation, but that they stress the nexus between holding a bill of exchange and exercising the personal right evidenced by it. The bill of exchange is a negotiable instrument, a Wertpapier. A negotiable instrument is a document in which a personal right is incorporated in such a manner that it can be exercised through possession of the document only. Exercise of the personal right presupposes possession. Hence the axiom of the modern law: das Recht aus dem Papier folgt dem Recht am Papier. But acceptance of this axiom still leaves unexplained the source of the cambial obligation. It is one thing to give the holder in due course, who acquired a non domino, a real right, but entirely another thing to hold the drawer, acceptor or indorser of a lost or stolen document contractually liable. The cardinal objection to the Kreationstheorie is that it elevates a mere signature on a bill of exchange to a declaration of an intention to be bound. The drawer of an instrument who locks it away, has no intention to be bound and makes no such declaration. Nothing can be simpler than this. Any proper theory has to proceed from the normal situation. It can accordingly be stated that the source of the cambial obligation is contract, but a contract whose form is dictated by the character of the bill of exchange as a negotiable instrument. It is thus concluded by delivery, which is directed both at the transfer of a real right to the document and the founding of a personal right on it. Despite the rejection of the Kreationstheorie, with its idea of the direct and abstract promise to pay, it is accepted that the cambial obligation is an abstract obligation. Abstract in the sense that it is autonomous and not dependent on the validity of the causal obligation. Vis-a-vis third parties this abstraction entails the unavailability of defences arising from the causal obligation (material abstraction). The same abstraction is found in the figures of the delegation imparfaite, the credit card, the irrevocable credit and to a lesser extent in the contract of suretyship. Between immediate parties, on the other hand, the cambial obligation is only formally abstract. This implies a shifting of proof. The creditor is discharged of the onus other than that relating to the abstract promise to pay. Between immediate parties the rule is the availability of defences. The cambial obligation is, however, not always founded on contract. The liability of the drawer of a lost or stolen instrument to a holder in due course is not based on contract but on the protection of the legitimate confidence, or estoppel. By drawing, accepting or indorsing, the debtor creates the appearance of being contractually bound. He is held responsible for this appearance when he knowingly or negligently signed the bill of exchange. Having created the appearance of contractual liability, he is deemed to be bound contractually. Estoppel, or the protection of the legimate confidence, not only explains the acquisition of the real and personal rights in and arising from the bill of exchange, but also the principle of the unavailability of defences. Negotiation is in principle the same as cession, but with the difference that the holder in due course obtains the personal right as it is incorporated in the document. The debtor has created the appearance of his being bound strictly according to the tenor of the bill and he is held liable accordingly. This is the sense of the medieval words quod non est in cambia non est in mundo...|$|E
40|$|Gambling has a {{long and}} {{circuitous}} history in American law. Perhaps the strangest turn in this journey is the current situation in Nevada, in which the District Attorney uses the force of criminal law to collect unpaid loans owed to casinos {{in return for a}} generous ten percent bounty. It is part of the lore of Las Vegas that the mob running some of the casinos in the city would send a bagman to collect unpaid debts, with a variety of unpleasant consequences for those who refused to pay. Morris Barney “Moe” Dalitz reputedly was the last of the great mobsters to control gambling in Las Vegas, and common wisdom held that it was most certainly not a good thing to be indebted to Moe. At the same time, the lore holds that he had the reputation for being a reasonable man: you were in real trouble only if you had the ability to pay and were attempting to skirt your obligations. In addition to this reputation for displaying a measure of reasonableness, he was a major benefactor of many charities and cultural sites in Las Vegas, with the result that he was given the honorific title, “Mr. Las Vegas. ” Thus, it is not too far a stretch to suggest that even Moe Dalitz would blush if he could see the current collection operation run by the District Attorney of Clark County. This Article, will first describe the basis upon which the District Attorney acts as a collection agent for casinos and then demonstrate that this basis is wholly without support under the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments.</b> To render the discussion concrete, this Article refers to the recent high-profile case in which Terrance Watanabe was prosecuted by the Clark County District Attorney for refusing to pay $ 14. 75 million in casino markers, a refusal that was motivated by his ongoing legal dispute with the casinos that held the markers. This Article concludes that the strong intuition that there is something fundamentally wrong with the State of Nevada using its police power to collect unpaid loans owed to casinos, and accepting a substantial fee for doing so, turns out to be wholly in accord with the applicable law as properly understood...|$|E

40|$|The {{concern of}} this thesis {{is to examine}} the risk of forgery of {{signatures}} In the context of negotiable Instruments. The allocation of the said risk is submitted to represent {{one of the most controversial}} matters among the existing legal systems. It is believed that the issue under consideration has represented a major obstacle to the adoption of an acceptable unification of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>negotiable</b> <b>instruments.</b> The main task of this thesis is to propose an efficient allocation of the risk of the forgery of signatures. The scope of this enquiry is confined to the forgery of two forms of signatures, namely, that of the proprietor of a blank document and that of the payee or indorsee of a negotiable instrument. The forgery of such signatures is submitted to represent the major incident of the problem of risk allocation in the context of negotiable Instruments. Its involvement affects the currency of such documents and ultimately, it affects the determination of the property right of negotiable instruments, as well as the enforcement of the incorporated contractual promises and undertakings. In formulating the proposed allocation of the risk of the forgery of signatures, this thesis takes into account economic considerations, as well as the considerations relevant to the institution of negotiable Instrument So The theory underlying such an attitude is firstly, to reconcile with recent developments in the law, secondly to accommodate the needs of modern society and thirdly, to promote the efficiency of a significant finance instrument. The promotion of the efficiency of negotiable instruments would necessarily promote the efficiency of the market. Finally, this thesis examines the attitude of the major existing legal systems in allocating the forgery of signatures in the context of negotiable instruments. In particular, it examines the attitude of the Anglo-American and the Continental Geneva legal systems. It examines the theories underlying such an attitude. It examines the validity of the advanced theories. It examines the compatibility of the attitude of the said legal systems with the considerations underlying the institution of negotiable Instruments as well as those underlying economic reality.
