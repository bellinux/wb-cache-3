The {{objective of the}} controller is to maximize the energy capture from the wind with reduced oscillation on the drive train.

40|$|The load {{mitigation}} {{and energy}} capture characteristics of twist-coupled HAWT blades that are {{mounted on a}} variable speed rotor are investigated in this paper. These blades are designed to twist toward feather as they bend with pretwist set to achieve a desirable twist distribution at rated power. For this investigation, the ADAMS-WT software has been modified to include blade models with bending-twist coupling. Using twist-coupled and uncoupled models, the ADAMS software is exercised for steady wind environments to generate C{sub p} curves {{at a number of}} operating speeds to compare the efficiencies of the two models. The ADAMS software is also used to generate the response of a twist-coupled variable speed rotor to a spectrum of stochastic wind time series. This spectrum contains time series with two mean wind speeds at two turbulence levels. Power control is achieved by imposing a reactive torque on the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> proportional to the RPM squared with the coefficient specified so that the rotor operates at peak efficiency in the linear aerodynamic range, and by limiting the maximum RPM {{to take advantage of the}} stall controlled nature of the rotor.

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are among}} the largest rotating machines {{in the world and}} are subjected to highly variable loading and environmental conditions. In actively-controlled horizontal axis wind turbines, generator power output, wind speed, and wind direction are monitored and fed into a control system to pivot (yaw) the rotor into the oncoming wind and to rotate (pitch) the blades to maintain the most efficient rotational speed for power-generation and limit excessive loading in high winds. However, these systems do not take into account that wind loading can vary significantly along the span of the blades, and it is the blade responses to this loading that dictate both power output and reliability of the turbine. More detailed knowledge of the blade structural dynamic response has the potential to improve wind turbine control so that high power output is maintained while damaging loading conditions are mitigated, and the data analysis methods applied in this thesis seek to accomplish those goals using blade-mounted inertial and strain sensors. ^ Both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on wind turbines are costly, and downtime can significantly reduce revenue. Expanding current condition monitoring systems to integrate blade load monitoring can improve maintenance scheduling and allow for controlling or positioning the turbine so as to reduce asymmetric loading and rotor imbalances which can damage structural and drive line components. As a step toward achieving these goals, a set of data analysis tools were developed for processing generator power, rotor operational acceleration and strain measurements, and nacelle and drivetrain loads in both horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines (HAWTs and VAWTs, respectively). Modal filtering of blade responses was demonstrated to be effective in classifying the loading cycles of potentially damaging vibration in an experimental VAWT subjected to a variety of wind shear conditions and showed that proper placement of a VAWT in a wind field can reduce excitation of asymmetric modes by as much as 40 % while increasing power output by 5 %. Blade vibration analysis was also used to classify individual blade pitch error on an operating 900 watt HAWT. Computer models were created to verify this technique in utility scale HAWTs, as well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of a combination of condition monitoring methods for evaluating rotor mass imbalance and aerodynamic asymmetry in the form of blade pitch error. It was shown that even a single-blade pitch error of 1 ° in a utility scale turbine can increase the nacelle yaw moment by 250 %, a 2 ° error increased the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> bending moment by 100 %, and a 5 ° error reduced the power output by over 7 %. A 0. 5 % blade mass imbalance increased the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> shear force by 60 %, the tower top side-to-side shear force by 50 %, and the tower-base side-to-side shear force by 250 %. Therefore, it is critical that these imbalances be detected and accounted for to reduce or prevent potentially damaging loading conditions and maintain peak performance. Imbalance detection algorithms using only non-blade measurements, which are {{the current state of the}} art, could not distinguish between simultaneously applied mass imbalances and pitch errors, and could not locate the blade responsible for the pitch or mass imbalance in these simulations. A combination of blade and non-blade measurements were formulated into an algorithm for the detection and classification of pitch and mass imbalances in a wind turbine rotor - the algorithm quantifies the magnitude of the imbalance and locates the problematic blade or blades. ...|$|E

40|$|Predictive {{maintenance}} of wind turbines could provide an estimated 50 % reduction in cost {{when compared to}} reactive maintenance, which is the current industry approach. The ability to identify damage using wind turbine operating data is necessary for implementing a predictive maintenance approach. Wind turbine blade damage is the most costly type of damage to repair and requires significant down time. Furthermore, blade damage often leads to secondary component damage, such as the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> bearings and gearbox. It is proposed that rotor mounted inertial sensors {{can be used to}} measure static and dynamic rotor blade responses to monitor blade health to facilitate improved maintenance scheduling for individual turbines. ^ In this thesis, free and forced dynamic response measurements on a 2. 1 meter horizontal axis wind turbine are used to characterize the rotor structural dynamics of a turbine operating in steady wind flow. Several blade damage mechanisms were initiated to demonstrate that rotor mounted inertial sensors are an effective means of detecting and characterizing blade damage based on the blade structural dynamic response in operation. It was shown that for a particular damage condition, trends are observed in the forced response linear spectra. Notable, the lead-lag measurement degree of freedom was sensitive to blade root damage; however, tip delamination was most readily identified using the span measurement degree of freedom. For the case of blade ice accretion, aerodynamic and power output indicators confirmed changes that were observed in the forced response spectra for the flap measurement degree of freedom. Additionally, operational modal analysis was used to verify the observed changes in the forced response linear spectra. ...|$|E

The master thesis starts with a look at wind power and the design of a modern wind turbine. Two models, one for constant wind speed wind turbines and one for variable speed wind turbines, are presented. An example shows how modal analysis can be utilized to evaluate a network's dynamic stability. Simulations are performed on a two-area network where different wind power models are tested and compared. A two-mass model is used to model a constant wind turbine. The model consists of an asynchronous generator, a turbine, and a <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>shaft</b> with a tensional stiffness. The model representing the variable speed wind turbine is based on a DFIG model included in the simulation software. The two-area network consists of two areas connected together through a long line between Bus 5 and Bus 6. Area 1 has two production sources, one placed in Bus 1 and one placed in Bus 2. The second area represents a large network modelled as a very large synchronous generator with a high inertia. The calculations have showed how modal analysis can be used to evaluate a system by using linearized differential equations and how the systems robustness against small disturbances can be altered by changing the systems parameters. Simulations have verified that a two-mass model must be used when modelling a constant speed wind turbine. The inertia of the turbine will greatly influence the model's behaviour and must therefore be included in the model. Eigenvalues analysis performed during different wind speeds have documented that wind power will not become less stable towards small disturbances when operated at low wind speed conditions. </p...|$|E
