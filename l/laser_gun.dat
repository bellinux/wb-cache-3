He asks Krusty for help, but Krusty informs Bart that he has already helped the Duff Brewery set up free <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> stands around Springfield. Bart then goes to his father, Homer, for help, and the duo quickly pursue Kang and Kodos to the brewery. However, the aliens escape, and before departing, they reveal that they have already {{released}} Buzz Cola throughout Springfield's water supply. As the cola seeps into the ground, it releases the undead from the Springfield Cemetery, who invade Springfield.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a <b>laser</b> <b>gun).</b> Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

50|$|In {{a similar}} development, Chinese {{scientists}} produced <b>laser</b> <b>guns</b> that can disable the sensors of missiles, satellites and other sensor equipped devices. The guns {{are expected to}} be used by the Chinese military in future warfare and have been compared to Star Wars <b>laser</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
5|$|The game world {{consists}} {{of a number of}} rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to adjacent rooms which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives; the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location.|$|E

500|$|Willa Paskin from New York Magazine {{opened her}} {{review of the}} video writing, [...] "Maybe it’s exhaustion, maybe it’s acquiescence, maybe it's just time, but Ke$ha and her whole glam-wasted shtick are {{starting}} to charm us." [...] Paskin felt that Kesha had a great [...] "functioning sense of humor" [...] writing that she [...] "enjoyed her new video". Peter Gaston from Spin, referring to Kesha, wrote {{that he was able}} to [...] "continually find something massively entertaining about this tartlet" [...] and wrote that the video was [...] "provocative". Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua wrote [...] "You know you're in for a great video when the very first thing you see is a disclaimer reading [...] "No mythological creatures were harmed in the making of this video." [...] Perpetua wrote that [...] "Blow" [...] had it all, from unicorns to James Van der Beek and <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> battles. Becky Bain of Idolator said the video included [...] "the best mid-video dialogue scene in all of music video history." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Goldsmith and Richard Band, {{the brother}} of film {{producer}} Charles Band, composed the music for Laserblast, marking the first film score for both composers. The score was written in five days, and makes heavy use of synthesizer, particularly synthesized brass instruments, as well as electronic music. The music was also used in the Charles Band-produced film Auditions, released the same year, the 1986 science fiction film Robot Holocaust and the 1983 horror film The House on Sorority Row. [...] The company Echo Film Services handled the sound effects. The alien language chatter between the aliens in Laserblast was later used as sound effects in the metal band Static-X's song [...] "A Dios Alma Perdida", which is featured in their 2001 album Machine. During several points in the film when something explodes after it is shot by the <b>laser</b> <b>gun,</b> the scene is edited so that multiple shots of the same explosion are shown in succession. [...] This type of editing became a trademark of Charles Band's films, and was done previously in his 1977 films Crash! and End of the World.|$|E
500|$|Laserblast has {{received}} largely negative reviews, and consistently {{ranks among the}} Bottom 100 list of films on the Internet Movie Database. A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "The only thing eerie about Laserblast is {{the thought that the}} people who made this loser are still running around loose." [...] In the review, Laserblast was described as [...] "an incomprehensible blending" [...] of popular recent films like Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a script [...] "so disordered we could not be certain that the reels were being run in proper sequence". It also criticized the props, particularly the <b>laser</b> <b>gun,</b> which they compared to a cereal box prize. A review by Variety magazine said the special effects were decent, but the script [...] "has more holes than the laser-ravaged landscape." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times said Kim Milford's performance was dull and that the script included plot-holes and inconsistencies. The Los Angeles Times critic Linda Gross said the script lacked [...] "credibility, psychological motivation and narrative cohesiveness", although she praised Terry Bowen's cinematography, saying it [...] "effectively captures the ambience of desert small-town life." [...] It was described as one of the worst films {{of the year in the}} book, The Golden Turkey Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Lazzaro: Another POW. A sickly, ill-tempered car thief from Cicero, Illinois, {{who takes}} Weary's dying words as a revenge {{commission}} to kill Billy. He keeps a mental list of his enemies, claiming {{he can have}} anyone [...] "killed for a thousand dollars plus traveling expenses." [...] Lazzaro eventually fulfills his promise to Weary and has Billy assassinated by a <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the non-chronological story telling, {{other parts}} of Billy's life are told {{throughout}} the book. After being evicted from the radio studio, Barbara treats Billy {{as a child and}} often monitors him. Robert becomes starkly anti-Communist and a Green Beret. Billy eventually dies in 1976 after giving a speech in a baseball stadium in which he predicts his own death and claims that [...] "if you think death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I've said." [...] Billy is soon after shot by an assassin with a <b>laser</b> <b>gun,</b> commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.|$|E
2500|$|The SJ 107 can equip {{a variety}} of weapons, ranging from {{conventional}} armaments such as a machine gun and a rocket launcher to more exotic weaponry such as a <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> and [...] "erosion gun". While most weapons use ammunition, some run off of the suit's power supply. The energy decreases over time, and can be charged by picking up batteries or using an energy unit. When the energy is critically low, the suit's driving power, radar and energy-based weapons become impaired. The game ends if the SJ 107 suit either takes too much damage or runs out of power.|$|E

2500|$|Restricting {{the sale}} {{or use of}} laser devices. This is done in some jurisdictions. For example, in April 2008 New South Wales, Australia banned laser pointer possession, except by special permit, {{in an effort to}} reduce the number of laser illuminations of aircraft. In October 1997 in the United Kingdom, {{administrative}} steps were taken to restrict the sale of laser pointers > 1 milliwatt output, for similar reasons (although the purchase, importation and use of such pointers in the UK remains lawful). In the U.S., the Congressional Research Service notes that a ban could [...] "pose significant challenges because these devices are widely available at low cost and are used in a variety of applications such as laser pointers, laser levels and <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> sights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brendan's {{curiosity about}} K-9 is matched only by Sarah's renewed concern over Lavinia's absence. They thus split up and follow their new-found obsessions. Sarah goes into town to {{question}} the locals, and Brendan stays behind to test the capabilities of Sarah's new [...] "pet". In town, Sarah discovers that Lavinia has become disliked by some because of her blunt letters to the local newspaper editors about a growing practice of witchcraft in the area. Brendan, meanwhile, is attacked while using K-9 to analyse soil samples in Lavinia's garden. His attackers, George Tracey and his son, Peter, are tied into the local coven. George Tracey flees before Brendan {{can get a good}} look at him, however K9 uses his <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> to stun Peter before setting off in pursuit of George. [...] Peter is pinioned and interrogated by Brendan, but makes his escape when Brendan goes outside to investigate a crashing sound which turns out to be the accidental destruction of a greenhouse by K9 in his pursuit of the elder Tracey.|$|E
2500|$|If an {{activity}} does fall within article 56, a restriction {{can be justified}} under article 52, or by overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent [...] "undesirable developments in securities trading" [...] including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a [...] "laserdrome" [...] business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake <b>laser</b> <b>gun</b> services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against [...] "playing at killing" [...] entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16, which the case law has developed.|$|E
