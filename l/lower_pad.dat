Standard antiplatelet treatment may not confer uniform benefit in different patient groups. This study aimed to compare platelet function in {{patients with}} <b>lower</b> limb <b>PAD,</b> carotid disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Methods: patients with <b>lower</b> limb <b>PAD</b> (n = 20), carotid disease (n = 40), AAA (n = 13) and age/sex matched healthy controls (n= 20) were studied. Whole blood methods to detect spontaneous platelet aggregation (SPA), and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen-induced aggregation were used. The detection of platelet P-selectin and the PAC- 1 antigen by flow cytometry were also used as markers of platelet activation and aggregation. Results: patients with <b>lower</b> limb <b>PAD</b> or AAA had higher baseline SPA compared to normal controls (p < 0. 01). There was significantly higher collagen-induced aggregation in IC patients compared to normal controls (p < 0. 01). However, {{there was no difference}} in ADP-induced aggregation between <b>lower</b> limb <b>PAD</b> and control patients. There was no difference in PAC- 1 binding between control patients and the patients with <b>lower</b> limb <b>PAD,</b> carotid disease or AAA. Patients with carotid disease had a higher expression of P-selectin compared to normal controls (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: An {{analytical}} {{formulation of}} the brake judder problem caused by disc thickness variation is described by using a simplified source–path–receiver model. Eigenvalue analysis is first conducted to determine the transfer mechanism from the brake source to the steering-wheel receiver. Calculations show that the peak vibration levels of the steering wheel are seen when the rotational frequency of the tyre coincides with the resonant frequency of the transfer path; in this case, only the first-order disc thickness variation is considered. The effects of two key parameters, associated with the source and the path respectively, are analytically and computationally studied. Analysis suggests that the <b>lower</b> <b>pad</b> stiffness and/or the higher bushing stiffness should effectively reduce the vibration levels. Finally, a new vibration control concept is proposed that modulates the actuation pressure; {{it is based on}} an approximate solution for the angular displacement of the disc in the model developed here. Preliminary work indicates that this concept could be very effective in reducing the receiver vibration level without sacrificing the brake performance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{demand for}} {{increased}} computing power {{and more complex}} integrated circuit devices with increased functions per chip results in high lead-count integrated circuit packages. With the shrinkage in integrated circuit sizes towards smaller packages, and the decrease in pad pitch, the trend is moving from the current ultra-fine-pitch volume production of 50 µm to even <b>lower</b> <b>pad</b> pitches. However, the various concerns for 50 -µm pitch bonding, such as low production yield, reliability issues, etc, have forced many customers to re-visit the feasibility of utilising the robust fine pitch bonding to handle the high lead-count packages. This paper reports the new development of bonding tools to handle the multi-tier wire bonding requirement with a maximum loop height of 475 µm. With {{the increase in the}} loop height of the wires, the bottleneck height of the capillary needs to be increased accordingly to prevent touching the adjacent wire during bonding. The increase in bottleneck height can influence the efficient transfer of the ultrasonic energy from the bonding tool to the bond interface and affect bond quality. In addition, the longer bottleneck height of the capillary also increases the risk of tip breakage during bonding. In this study, the external profile of the capillary is simulated with respect to the looping profile during bonding using a customised software package. In addition, finite element simulation is also utilised to analyse the difference in stress level with different bonding tool designs. The results of the simulations are then used to correlate with the actual bonding responses...|$|E

The aim of this review was to evaluate the association of prothrombin G 20210 A and lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD). MethodsThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of case–control studies. A systematic review of electronic databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, was conducted to assess the prevalence of prothrombin G 20210 A in patients with <b>lower</b> extremity <b>PAD.</b> The main outcome was the prevalence of prothrombin G 20210 A in patients with <b>lower</b> extremity <b>PAD.</b> The random effects model odds ratio (OR) was used as the primary outcome measure. ResultsThe initial electronic search identified 168 relevant abstracts of which five studies evaluating 1, 524 cases of PAD and 1, 553 controls were included. Prothrombin G 20210 A was found in 70 of 1, 524 patients with <b>lower</b> extremity <b>PAD</b> and 44 of 1, 553 of the controls (random effects OR 1. 68, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 8 – 3. 2).

The patients were divided into a <b>lower</b> extremity <b>PAD</b> group (ankle-brachial index≤ 0. 9 or > 1. 4; 88 patients, 7. 5 %) and a non-PAD group (ankle-brachial index> 0. 9 and ≤ 1. 4; 1090 patients, 92. 5 %). Age; duration of diabetes; systolic blood pressure; the hypertension rate; the use of hypertension drugs, ACEI /ARB, and statins; CHD risk; fatal CHD risk; stroke risk; and fatal stroke risk were significantly higher in the PAD group than in the non-PAD group (P< 0. 05 for all).

METHODS: High resolution ultrasound (15 MHz) {{was performed on}} the lower eyelids of 7 normal subjects. Movements of the lower eyelid and its compartments were visualized with ultrasound. In addition, the maximal excursion area of the lower eyelid fat compartments and retractor motions was measured before and after motion. RESULTS: The orbicularis muscle could be seen as an echolucent structure between the dermis and the echodence fat <b>pads.</b> <b>Lower</b> eyelid fat <b>pad</b> seems to be divided into 2 compartments as range of motion and direction of movement of each of them varies.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to study}} the {{influence}} of tobacco exposure and sympathectomy on basal sympathoadrenal function of patients with Buerger's disease. Design: plasma catecholamines were measured before and after smoking, in patients with Buerger's disease (n= 13), in patients with Buerger's disease submitted to surgical bilateral lumbar sympathectomy (n= 13), and in healthy volunteers (n= 16). Materials and Methods: venous blood samples were collected before and 2 h after smoking one cigarette (0. 9 mg nicotine). Plasma concentrations (pg/ml) of dihydroxiphenylalanine (pL-DOPA), noradrenalin (pNA), adrenalin (pAD) and 3, 4 -dihydroxiphenylacetic acid (pDOPAC) were determined. Results: Buerger's patients have low basal plasma catecholamines compared to volunteers: pNA (501 (196 – 927) vs 1858 (968 – 3663)) and pAD (71 (31 – 109) vs 193 (116 – 334)). Sympathectomy increased pL-DOPA, pAD and pDOPAC, but not pNA. After smoking, pNA only decreased in volunteers (1858 (968 – 3663) vs 1064 (535 – 2393)). In Buerger+sympathectomy group, smoking <b>lowered</b> <b>pAD</b> (700 (58 – 3379) vs 278 (54 – 429)). Conclusions: in Buerger's disease there is an impairment of sympathoadrenal function with an altered peripheral adrenergic response to cigarette smoking.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the oil seal between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the oil seal edges of the piston rod bearing oil cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and oil edge sealing, the oil chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and <b>lower</b> oil <b>pads</b> of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and oil seal changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and <b>lower</b> oil <b>pads</b> then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R

Total walking time was significantly <b>lower</b> in <b>PAD</b> when compared with C (9. 8 ± 4. 6 min vs 26. 57 ± 24. 3 min).

40|$|Purpose: To {{present the}} {{qualitative}} and quantitative ultrasonographic findings of lower eyelid compartments in patients with chronic thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) compared to normal subjects. Methods: In a prospective study, dynamic and static ultrasonographic investigation, applying high resolution (15 Â MHz) ultrasound was performed to assess the lower eyelid, in 15 TAO patients that were in chronic phase and 10 normal subjects. The thickness and echogenisity of dermis, orbicular oculi muscle, lower eyelid retractor muscle, <b>lower</b> eyelid fat <b>pads,</b> and their qualitative relationships during vertical excursion of the globe were evaluated in static and dynamic investigation. Correlation of ultrasonic and clinical findings was evaluated. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients was 41. 82 Â Â±Â  7. 4 years, and the controls were age-matched (mean age, 42. 8 Â Â±Â  5. 6 years). Mean proptosis of the involved eyes was 3. 3 Â mm, and mean lower lid retraction was 2. 4 Â mm in chronic TAO group. Pattern of fat motion was blocky in chronic TAO patients compared to normal jelly motion of the fat in normal cases. In analyzing the range of motion, the difference was significant in the motion of both superficial and deep fat pockets between the two groups (PÂ <Â  0. 001). Limitation of fat motion correlated both with proptosis and lower eyelid retraction (Pearson correlation coefficientÂ =Â â 0. 77 vs â 0. 43, PÂ <Â  0. 001). Fibrotic changes of <b>lower</b> lid fat <b>pads</b> appearÂ in the tissue around the septum on observation. Considering the ultrasound findings, a new staging method is proposed in this study that starts with the appearance of echodense points, getting worse in fine bands, progresses to thick bands and ends in cord formation in the lower lid fat pocket that determines total fibrosis. Conclusion: Development of a series of static and dynamic changes in ultrasoundÂ is related to the clinical findings in chronic phase of TAO.

Many longboarding injuries are sustained while going downhill, while very few skateboarding accidents happen while going downhill. Longboarding injuries tend to involve head and neck areas more than skateboarding injuries, which are more likely to involve a skater's <b>lower</b> extremities.

5000|$|Van der Woude {{syndrome}} (VDWS) is {{a genetic}} disorder {{characterized by the}} combination of lower lip pits, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, and cleft palate alone (CP). The frequency of orofacial clefts ranges from 1:1000 to 1:500 births worldwide, {{and there are more}} than 400 syndromes that involve cleft lip with or without cleft palate. [...] VWS is distinct from other clefting syndromes due to the combination of cleft lip and palate (CLP) and CP within the same family. Other features frequently associated with VWS include hypodontia in 10-81% of cases, narrow arched palate, congenital heart disease, heart murmur and cerebral abnormalities, syndactyly of the hands, polythelia, ankyloglossia, and adhesions between the upper and <b>lower</b> gum <b>pads.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lower {{extremity}} {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) is {{a marker}} of widespread atherosclerosis. Individuals with PAD, most of whom do not show typical PAD symptoms ('asymptomatic' patients), {{are at increased risk}} of cardiovascular ischaemic events. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend that individuals with asymptomatic <b>lower</b> extremity <b>PAD</b> should be identified by measurement of ankle-brachial index (ABI). However, despite its associated risk, PAD remains under-recognised by clinicians and the general population and office-based ABI detection is still poorly-known and under-used in clinical practice. The Prevalence of peripheral Arterial disease in patients with a non-high cardiovascular disease risk, with No overt vascular Diseases nOR diAbetes mellitus (PANDORA) study has a primary aim of assessing the prevalence of <b>lower</b> extremity <b>PAD</b> through ABI measurement, in patients at non-high cardiovascular risk, with no overt cardiovascular diseases (including symptomatic PAD), or diabetes mellitus. Secondary objectives include documenting the prevalence and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and the characteristics of both patients and physicians as possible determinants for PAD under-diagnosis. Methods/Design PANDORA is a non-interventional, cross-sectional, pan-European study. It includes approximately 1, 000 primary care participating sites, across six European countries (Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, The Netherlands, Switzerland). Investigator and patient questionnaires will be used to collect both right and left ABI values at rest, presence of cardiovascular disease risk factors, current pharmacological treatment, and determinants for PAD under-diagnosis. Discussion The PANDORA study will provide important data to estimate the prevalence of asymptomatic PAD in a population otherwise classified at low or intermediate risk on the basis of current risk scores in a primary care setting.

40|$|International audienceUsing self-report of race/ethnicity, African Americans {{consistently}} have {{a higher}} prevalence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) compared to other ethnic groups. We aimed to determine the associations between estimated genetic admixture and PAD among African and Hispanic Americans. We studied the association between genetic ancestry and PAD among 1417 African and Hispanic American participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis who were genotyped for ancestry informative markers (AIMs). PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0. 90. The overall prevalence of PAD among the 712 self-identified African American subjects was 15. 2 % and 4. 6 % among the 705 self-identified Hispanic Americans. A one standard deviation increment in European ancestry was associated with non-significant reductions in the odds for PAD among African (OR: 0. 96 [95 % CI: 0. 78 - 1. 18]) and Hispanic Americans (0. 84 [0. 58 - 1. 23]), while the same increment in Native American ancestry {{was significantly associated with}} a <b>lower</b> odds of <b>PAD</b> in Hispanic Americans (0. 56 [0. 36 - 0. 96]). Adjustment for demographic variables, field center, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and inflammatory markers strengthened the odds for European ancestry among African (0. 85 [0. 66 - 1. 10]) and Hispanic Americans (0. 68 [0. 41 - 1. 11]). The magnitude of the association for Native American ancestry among Hispanic Americans did not materially change (0. 56 [0. 29 - 1. 09]). In conclusion, a higher percent Native American ancestry in Hispanics is associated with a <b>lower</b> odds of <b>PAD</b> while in both Hispanics and African Americans, greater European ancestry {{does not appear to be}} associated with <b>lower</b> odds for <b>PAD...</b>|$|R

30|$|During servo operation, {{the piston}} and piston rod are {{subjected}} to gravity and partial loading from unbalanced radial components. This force can be adjusted within a certain range using the force generated by pressure changes in the oil chambers of the upper and <b>lower</b> oil <b>pads,</b> which result from changes in {{the gap between the}} piston rod and seal oil edge. This ensures that the piston rod, guide sleeve, and cylinder maintain gaps in an appropriate range to facilitate oil film lubrication and reduce friction between the piston rod and guide sleeve, and piston and cylinder. This results in increased system load-bearing capacity and anti-eccentric load capacity, as well as wear-free operation over wide speed and load ranges, which significantly increases the reliability and longevity of horizontal hydraulic cylinders.|$|R
