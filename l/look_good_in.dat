5|$|The {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke {{due to the}} Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why {{the president should be}} guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E

Photographer Michael Spencer Johns said the original concept involved shooting each band member in various locations around the world, but when the cost proved prohibitive, the shoot was relocated to Stocks House. Spencer remarked that the shoot [...] "degenerated into chaos", adding that [...] "by 8pm, everyone was in the bar, there were schoolkids all over the set, and the lighting crew couldn't start the generator.

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Tidus and Yuna {{was listed as}} one of the video-game [...] "great loves" [...] by GameSpot, which called it [...] "one of the best (and ultimately saddest) examples" [...] of mature romance in games and cited its progression through the story {{as one of the}} game's best elements. GamesRadar found the relationship realistic, noting that they still try to reunite despite their sacrifices. Kotaku's Mike Fahey wrote that the popularity of Tidus and Yuna's relationship and his fading away at the game's end forced Square to make a sequel so they could meet again. Gamasutra's Leigh Alexander, calling Tidus a [...] "forgettable hero", nevertheless praised his and Yuna's relationship. In 2001, Tidus and Yuna won Game Informer Best Couple of the Year award. Their kiss was ranked the second-best in video games by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist. Kotaku called the scene one of gaming's most romantic, and IGN listed Tidus and Luna as one of gaming's greatest couples. Yuna's English voice actress, Hedy Burress, said that Tidus' interaction with Yuna gave her a humanized, [...] "womanly aspect". The 1UP.com staff described Tidus as the [...] "good kind of jock" [...] because of his support for the game's other protagonists, but his anger and growth kept him from being a [...] "stereotypical boy scout". According to Eurogamer's Tom Brawell, Tidus and the other characters [...] "make much more dignified and believable decisions than those made by their predecessors in other Final Fantasy games". NowGamer and Digital Spy found the remastered game lacking in emotion, but Destructoid said that its models still <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> comparison to newer role-playing games released.|$|E

Poppy then moves into Dot Cotton's (June Brown) house after being offered a room by Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell). Poppy forgives Anthony, and begins a new friendship with Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). She starts a relationship with Fatboy, after her sister Tansy Meadow's (Daisy Wood-Davis) visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, {{in an effort to make}} herself <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> front of her younger [...] "successful" [...] sister. Although it is revealed that Tansy is not that successful, she tells Poppy that Fatboy loves her. The two start a relationship and later declare their love for each other.

However, Fatboy reveals that Chloe is his colleague and he has started working at McKlunkies again.

500|$|Crackdown was envisioned {{to exceed}} the {{gameplay}} of Grand Theft Auto, giving the player [...] "toys" [...] {{to create their own}} in-game moments that could be verbally shared with others. [...] The crackdown logo is {{in the shape of the}} agency tower, modified. The entire playfield was to be open at the start, requiring the need to create a progression for the player, while still allowing for experimentation. [...] Realtime Worlds had hired a number of former Grand Theft Auto developers who experimented with refining the game's sandbox element. [...] "It was a big part of the idea to just let people do things", Realtime Worlds producer Phil Wilson said about the gameplay; [...] "testers would do things we were completely blown away by". Dave Jones, CEO of Realtime Worlds, described the concept of the game as [...] "How do we reward somebody for just having fun?" [...] They had initially planned to have 200 Xbox Live Achievements for the game towards this purpose, exceeded the then-current cap of 50 set by Microsoft, and pressured Microsoft to lift the cap. [...] Microsoft subsequently increased the maximum number of Achievements in a game to 80. [...] Through playtesting, the team noticed that many players performed certain out-of-the-way actions, such as climbing to the top of the Agency Tower. [...] They created in-game content to reward the player for performing these actions; for example, they created a special rendering procedure for the clouds during the in-game day/night cycle. The renderer would behave differently each day, and could only be viewed from atop the Agency Tower. [...] An initial fear of Jones' was that in the early part of the game, when the Agent is underpowered, the player may not realize the potential of the game and would not complete it; [...] "People weren't quite sure, because at that level, you're kind of like most characters in most other games". [...] Jones also expressed concern that [...] "This game does not <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> screenshots". [...] They took two major steps to overcome this. [...] First, the demo for the game on Xbox Marketplace allowed for accelerated growth of the player's abilities. [...] Second, the full game included five in-game movies that would be presented early on to the player that would give them a taste for what a fully powered character could do.|$|E

Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops".

In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else.

2500|$|Sexual {{discrimination}} {{can arise}} in different contexts. For instance, an employee may be discriminated against by being asked discriminatory questions during a job interview, or by an employer not hiring or promoting, unequally paying, or wrongfully terminating, an employee {{based on their}} gender. [...] Sexual discrimination can also arise when the dominant group holds a bias against the minority group. One such example is Wikipedia. In the Wikipedian community, around 13 percent of registered users are women. This creates gender imbalances, and leaves room for systemic bias. Women are not only more harshly scrutinized, but the representation of women authors are also overlooked. Relative to men, across all source lists, women have a 2.6 greater odds of omission in Wikipedia. In an educational setting, there could be claims that a student was excluded from an educational institution, program, opportunity, loan, student group, or scholarship because of their gender. In the housing setting, there could be claims that a person was refused negotiations on seeking a house, contracting/leasing a house or getting a loan based on their gender. Another setting where there have been claims of gender discrimination is banking; for example if one is refused credit or is offered unequal loan terms based on one's gender. [...] As with other forms of unlawful discrimination, {{there are two types}} of sex discrimination – direct discrimination and indirect discrimination. Direct sex discrimination is fairly easy to spot – 'Barmaid wanted', but indirect sex discrimination, where an unnecessary requirement puts one sex at a disproportionate disadvantage compared to the opposite sex, is sometimes less easy to spot, although some are obvious – 'Bar person wanted – must <b>look</b> <b>good</b> <b>in</b> a mini skirt'. Another setting where there is usually gender discrimination is when one is refused to extend their credit, refused approval of credit/loan process, and if there is a burden of unequal loan terms based on one's gender.|$|E

During a CMLL press conference on March 21, 2013 long time rivals Atlantis and Último Guerrero talked about their rivalry and then proceeded to sign a match for a Lucha de Apuestas but with no specific date mentioned. A Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match, is the most prestigious match form in Lucha Libre and means that the participants put their wrestling mask on the line and the loser will be forced to remove it after the match and never wrestle wearing it again. The act of signing a Luchas de Apuestas match between two of the top ranked CMLL workers without announcing a specific date has let people to speculate that it would take place at the 80th Anniversary show. CMLL officials explained that due to various prior commitment both in Mexico and in Japan and the United States they were not sure when the Lucha de Apuestas match could take place, but they wanted to get the contract signed first and then figure out the schedule.
