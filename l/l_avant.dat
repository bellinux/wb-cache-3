40|$|The vision Madagascar Natural ly {{aimed to}} triple {{the size of}} protec-ted areas in Madagascar from 1. 7 mi l l ion {{hectares}} to 6 mi l l ion hectares before 2008, {{in order to ensure}} the safe guarding of Ma-dagascar’s natural heritage and the human wel l-being that de-pends on it. In 2008, Maromizaha forest was selected by the Ministry of Environment and Forests tobecome a New Protected Area where the delegated manager is the Groupe d’Etude et de Recherche sur les Primates de Madagascar (GERP). One of GERP’s strategies is to provide support to the l ivel ihoods of the local people around the Maromizaha protected area {{in order to reduce the}} dependency on natural resources. During Apri l 201 4, GERP or-ganized a rapid socio-economic survey of 70 households across six vi l lages, in order to make a prel iminary, comparison and as-sessment of this development support and its impact on the main income generating activities of the local people, their highest level of formal education in 2008 and 201 4, and their thinking about conservation offsetting. The results showed that in 201 4, 70 % of local people were engaged in agriculture and less than 40 % in cat-tle farming. Some vi l lagers have benefited from pi lot development projects organized by financial and environmental organizations. Other local people benefited from other l ivel ihood activities rela-ted to the conservation management of the forest. Most partici-pants were aware of the ecosystem services of the forests (94. 3 %) and the education level has increased from 2008 to 201 4, al-though even in 201 4, 56 % of the survey participants were educa-ted only to primary school level; the rate of i l l i teracy is at 1 5. 6 %. We summarize some strengths, weaknesses and recommenda-tions in order to improve the management of the Maromizaha Protected Area.

40|$|Trees {{and tree}} {{products}} {{have long been}} central to human life and culture, taking on intensified significance during the long eighteenth century. As basic raw material they were vital economic resources, objects of international diplomatic and commercial exchange, and key features in local economies. In an age of ongoing deforestation, both individuals and public entities grappled with the complex issues {{of how and why}} trees mattered. In this interdisciplinary volume, contributors build on recent research in environmental history, literary and material culture, and postcolonial studies to develop new readings of the ways trees were valued in the eighteenth century. They trace changes in early modern theories of resource management and ecology across European and North American landscapes, and show how different and sometimes contradictory practices were caught up in shifting conceptions of nature, social identity, physical health and moral wellbeing. In its innovative and thought-provoking exploration of manâs relationship with trees, Invaluable trees: cultures of nature, 1660 â 1830 argues for new ways of understanding the long eighteenth century and its values, and helps re-frame the environmental challenges of our own time.
