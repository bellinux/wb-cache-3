Since lawsone shows many similarities with ninhydrin, the current reagent for <b>latent</b> <b>fingerprint</b> development, studies have been conducted to see if lawsone can be used in this field. As of now the research is inconclusive, but optimistic. Lawsone non-specifically targets primary amino acids, and displays photoluminescence with forensic light sources. It has a characteristic purple/brown coloration as opposed to the purple/blue associated with ninhydrin.Lawsone shows promise as a reagent for fingerprint detection because of its photoluminescence maximized at 640nm, which is high enough that it avoids background interference common for ninhydrin.|$|E

Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy allowed for the real-time detection of changes to the IR spectra and demonstrated an increase in the OH stretch band (3250 [*]cm– 1) over 5 [*]h at all temperatures investigated, suggesting various oxidation processes were taking place.

40|$|Abstract. The {{acceptance}} of fingerprint evidence {{by the courts}} has always been predicated {{on the assumption that}} no two individuals have identical fingerprints. <b>Fingerprints</b> (visible or <b>latent)</b> are often found at a scene of crime. Latent prints however, are difficult to locate and require the utilization of techniques that will visualize the prints. This study involved the application of chemical techniques to the visualization of <b>latent</b> <b>fingerprints.</b> The more recent superglue fuming technique was compared to two other techniques using ninhydrin and eosin as chemical reagents. The chemical enhancement of the three techniques was found to be dependent upon the nature of the surface on which the prints were deposited. Results showed that superglue fuming and eosin technique were capable of enhancing <b>latent</b> <b>fingerprints</b> on non-porous surfaces which have been kept for up to three months. The ninhydrin technique was found to be effective only for <b>latent</b> <b>fingerprints</b> on porous surfaces...|$|R

5000|$|During this time, Fred Barker stashed Ma Barker in {{a variety}} of hotels and hideouts. The purpose was to keep her from {{learning}} much about the gang's crimes, as well as to separate her from the gang's girlfriends, with whom she did not get along. Indeed the FBI later claimed that Ma would try to break up any relationships, so that [...] "other women in the gang" [...] did their best to avoid Ma. By 1933 most of the gang were back in St. Paul, where they planned and carried out two kidnappings of wealthy local businessmen. After successfully obtaining $100,000 ransom after abducting William Hamm, they then arranged the kidnapping of Edward Bremer, from which they netted a $200,000 ransom. The FBI first connected the gang to the William Hamm kidnapping by using a then new method of <b>latent</b> <b>fingerprint</b> identification. With the FBI now on the case and without Tom Brown supplying information, the gang decided to leave St. Paul.
