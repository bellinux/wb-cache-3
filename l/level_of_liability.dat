50|$|Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is {{designed}} to cover risk of financial liability or {{the loss of a}} motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below). The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another. A motor vehicle owner typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium. The insurance premium a motor vehicle owner pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors.|$|E

40|$|A central {{result in}} the {{economic}} theory of liability is that, if an injurer's liability equals the victim's loss, then either the rule of strict liability or the rule of negligence can induce the injurer to behave properly. However, for this result to hold, the injurer must know the victim's loss before the injurer decides whether {{to engage in the}} harmful activity and, g fortiori, before any harm has occurred. This paper reevaluates the rules of strict liability and negligence when the injurer's information is imperfect. Two questions are addressed: Under each rule, should the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> imposed on the injurer still equal the victim's loss? Are the rules of strict liability and negligence still equally desirable? With respect to the first question, it is demonstrated that the optimal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> generally is not equal to the victim's loss. With respect to the second question, it is shown that if the injurer's liability equals the victim's loss, then the two rules are equivalent, but if liability is set optimally under each rule, then strict liability generally induces the injurer to behave in a more appropriate way. ...|$|E

40|$|The notion <b>of</b> {{implicit}} <b>liabilities</b> for pension {{systems can}} be interpreted in several ways. Two approaches are centered on benefits due to current pensioners or {{to be paid to}} current contributors: these two approaches are the method <b>of</b> accrued-to-date <b>liabilities</b> and the closed-group method. A third approach also includes prospective benefits and contributions for future cohorts of contributors: this approach is generally referred to as the method <b>of</b> open-system <b>liabilities.</b> This paper presents some indicative quantifications of these three approaches for French pensions. It also gives some analytical results concerning the steady state <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liabilities</b> computed according to the first two approaches. We finally compare the behaviour of these three approaches under situations of stylized demographic change, i. e. a baby-boom and/or a continuous increase in life expectancy.

In our framework, firms are liable under product liability, but also invest in care to prevent consumers' switching to competitors.

Consequently, it may be optimal to reduce liability below a given level of incomplete compensation in order to adjust firms' care incentives.

40|$|Should the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> {{imposed on}} an injurer {{be based on}} the harm he caused or instead on the gain he {{obtained}} from engaging in the harmful act? The main point of this article {{is that there is a}} strong reason to favor liability based on harm rather than gain when account is taken of the possibility of legal error. Notably, even a small underestimate of gain can lead an injurer to commit a harmful act when the harm greatly exceeds his gain, causing a large social loss. In contrast, a comparable error in the estimate of harm will not lead an injurer to engage in the harmful act when the harm significantly exceeds his gain. The general superiority of harm-based liability is shown to hold under the rules of negligence and strict liability and regardless of whether potential injurers know the error that will be made. ...|$|E

Outsourcing becomes less attractive when the supplier is unable to accept large <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> The manufacturer is shown to prefer more testing when she outsources assembly to her supplier as opposed to when she assembles products in house.

40|$|The present paper reassesses {{the role}} of {{monetary}} conservatism in a setting with nominal government debt and endogenous fiscal policy. We assume that macroeconomic policies are chosen by monetary and fiscal policy makers who interact repeatedly but cannot commit to future actions. The real <b>level</b> <b>of</b> public <b>liabilities</b> is an endogenous state variable, and policies are chosen in a non-cooperative fashion. We focus on Markovperfect equilibria and investigate {{the role of}} fiscal impatience and monetary conservatism as determinants of the economy�s steady state and the associated welfare implications. Fiscal impatience creates a tendency of accumulating debt, and monetary conservatism actually exacerbates such excessive debt accumulation. Increased conservatism implies that any given <b>level</b> <b>of</b> real <b>liabilities</b> can be sustained at a lower rate of inflation. However, since this is internalized by the fiscal authority, the Markov-perfect equilibrium generates a steady state with higher indebtedness. As a result, increased monetary conservatism has adverse welfare implications. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{profit sharing}} ratio in equity financed {{projects}} is decided by Islamic banks mainly through applying the relevant {{rate of return}} on capital. After first determining the return sought by the bank, the remainder of the expected profit is usually taken as the share of the joint partner, and the proportion adopted as the profit sharing ratio. Ideally, the profit sharing ratio should be decided through a mutual process considering the contributions of both partners, with due recognition of the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> each had borne. The period, as a factor common to the joint venture, could be redundant. Hence, the profit sharing ratio should be reflective of the capital and labour outlay of both the bank and the client, to the extent possible. In view of the socio-economic function expected of Islamic banks, the method for profit ratio calculation adopted should adequately consider the actual contributions of both partners. Two bases possible are giving capital and labour of both partners equal weightage, and giving capital a weightage different from labour. Muhammad Abdurrahman Sadique 14...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} complex and highly debated {{problems}} in the context of corporate liability for complicity in human ri ghts violations is how to distinguish lawful commercial activities from those that give rise to corporate complicity liability. In many cases in which corporations are accused of aiding and abetting human rights violations, the act of assistance consists of what would usually be regarded as an ordinary and perfectly acceptable business activity, such as providing financing to a government or supplying it with goods or infrastructure. Merely doing business with a bad actor is not sufficient to impose liability on corporations for that actor?s human rights violations, but no clear criteria on what transforms legitimate business transactions into reprehensible acts of complicity exist. This Article approaches the question of determining the relevant liability standards by providing an in-depth analysis of jurisprudence stemming from three different contexts: Alien Tort Statute (ATS) cases on corporate complicity; ad hoc international criminal tribunals on the closely related question of dual-purpose act liability (where the assistance provided could be used for both lawful and unlawful activities); and U. S. criminal cases where the act of assistance consisted of a commercial activity. Jurisprudence stemming from these three different contexts has in common that many courts feel that the generally applicable standards for determining complicity liability need to be adapted and restricted where assistance consists of a commercially motivated or a dual-purpose act. This is largely achieved by requiring either that the assistance reach a certain significance threshold (limitations at the actus reus <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability),</b> or that the mental state with which it was carried out made the assistance particularly reprehensible (limitations at the mens rea <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability).</b> In the particular context of corporate complicity liability in human rights violations, academic debate of liability standards largely focuses on whether the relevant mens rea standard should be one of purpose or one of knowledge. While clearly important, this Article goes beyond this question and argues that the mens rea standard cannot be understood and determined in isolation. Without taking a holistic look at all elements of liability and their interaction, {{it is not possible to}} sufficiently understand the concerns that triggered adoption of a purpose standard of mens rea, the legitimacy of these concerns, and alternative ways of addressing them. The purpose of this Article is not to present detailed liability criteria that will work equally in all contexts. Rather, it serves the more modest aim of analyzing and drawing conclusions from the implications of different approaches to determining the necessary actus reus and mens rea elements of corporate complicity liability, while recognizing that the details need to be developed with reference to the specific contexts in which the question of corporate complicity liability arises...|$|E
