2500|$|While most {{college admissions}} {{involves}} {{high school students}} applying to colleges, transfer admissions are important as well. Estimates {{of the percentage of}} college students who transfer vary from 20% to 33% to 60%, with the consensus position being around a third of college students transfer, and there are many indications that transfer activity is increasing. One report suggested that nearly half of all undergraduates in the nation were attending community colleges. Media coverage of student transfers is generally less than coverage of the high school to college transition. A common transfer path is students moving from two-year community colleges to four-year institutions, although there is considerable movement between four-year institutions. Reasons for transferring include unhappiness with campus <b>life,</b> <b>cost,</b> and course and degree selection. There are no consistent national rules for transfers, and requirements vary by college. Many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year schools, particularly flagship state universities, so that matters such as the transfers of credits are handled appropriately. There are indications that many private colleges are more actively seeking transfer applicants. Still, transferring can be difficult; transfer students have been described in the past as [...] "academic nomads".|$|E

40|$|Costs {{have for}} many years been an {{important}} factor in the defense industry and the analysis of military systems. Many nations have adopted different analyzes, tools and concepts for the evaluation of its expenditure of defense material in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency, were one of these is the <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis. <b>Life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis makes it possible to identify the most significant cost drivers and enable the best combination of resource utilization. Estimates based on <b>life</b> cycle <b>costs</b> also cre- ate a long-term perspective and thus facilitates a more well-made assessment of the investments. This study was carried out at Saab Dynamics in Karlskoga, which produces missile and support systems for the defense industry. Currently at Saab Dynamics, {{they do not have a}} unified approach to the use of <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis. However, the need has emerged because of increased customer demands. The study aims to create better conditions for the use of <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis in the defense industry. To meet the objective, the authors of this study have (1) examined how a reliable and flexible <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model can be designed, (2) examined how the <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model and its underlying activities in the <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis can be adapted to international standards from NATO and ISO/IEC, (3) examined the nature of the input data required to create a reliable and flexible <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model, and (4) ex- amined how a <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model can be presented. The result and the recommendations are based on interviews and a literature review. Through the literature review, the theoretical framework was adopted to international standards from NATO and ISO/IEC. The authors of the study then used this theoretical framework to create the final <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model. Interviews with stakeholders also revealed that the input data required for a <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> analysis are both cost data in terms of purchasing costs and recurrent costs, and technical data in terms of quantity, surcharge, inflation rates, system usage, and the possible need for support systems. The interviews also showed that this type of data often is difficult to estimate accurately due to the systems complexity and long life time. The final <b>life</b> cycle <b>cost</b> model has been prepared and presented in Microsoft Excel, where the user simply can enter the re- quired data.
