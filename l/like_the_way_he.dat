25|$|Montoya won {{the opening}} {{race of the}} season at Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, then {{finished}} on the podium again at the Angie's List Grand Prix of Indianapolis and Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, 5th in the Grand Prix of Louisiana, and on May 24, 2015, Montoya passed Will Power with four laps to go to win the 2015 Indianapolis 500. He finished 2nd in the title standings to Scott Dixon on a count back much <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> won the 1999 CART title from Dario Franchitti.|$|E
500|$|The first {{recording}} of L'Orfeo was issued in 1939, a freely adapted version of Monteverdi's music by Giacomo Benvenuti, {{given by the}} orchestra of La Scala Milan conducted by Ferrucio Calusio. In 1949, for the {{recording of}} the complete opera by the Berlin Radio Orchestra under Helmut Koch, the new medium of long-playing records (LPs) was used. The advent of LP recordings was, as Harold C. Schonberg later wrote, {{an important factor in}} the postwar revival of interest in Renaissance and Baroque music, and from the mid-1950s recordings of L'Orfeo have been issued on many labels. The 1969 recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt and the Vienna Concentus Musicus, using Harnoncourt's edition based on period instruments, was praised for [...] "making Monteverdi's music sound something <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> imagined". In 1981 Siegfried Heinrich, with the Early Music Studio of the Hesse Chamber Orchestra, recorded a version which re-created the original Striggio libretto ending, adding music from Monteverdi's 1616 ballet Tirsi e Clori for the Bacchante scenes. Among more recent recordings, that of Emmanuelle Haïm in 2004 has been praised for its dramatic effect.|$|E
500|$|The Diamondback, the university's student newspaper, had criticized Ward {{for moving}} the team into one dormitory, which forced some other {{students}} out. Ward {{stated that the}} move was done {{on the advice of}} Kehoe—which Kehoe denied—and with the intent of focusing the players on their studies and building camaraderie. Ward and his assistants monitored the players' academic performance, enforced class attendance, and placed curfews on perceived troublemakers. Ward stated that, in his first year, only two of his players failed out of the school that he claimed had a history of poor athlete academics. He complained that he was a scapegoat and that there had been poor communication between him and Kehoe. In fact, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was concerned with the situation surrounding Ward's resignation and {{sent a letter to the}} American Football Coaches Association demanding an investigation. Paterno said:"I don't know who's right or wrong, but...I don't think it's a good thing for a squad to fire a coach. As an association, we ought to know what happened. If a university fired an English professor because his class didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was doing things, I know darn well that the American Association of University Professors would want to know what happened." ...|$|E
5000|$|On her <b>way</b> downstairs, <b>the</b> American wife {{encounters}} the innkeeper, {{with whom}} she has a short conversation. In this encounter, Hemingway specifically emphasizes how the wife [...] "likes" [...] the innkeeper, a word that is repeated often throughout the stories of In Our Time: [...] "The wife liked him. She <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> deadly serious <b>way</b> <b>he</b> received any complaints. She liked his dignity. She <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> wanted to serve her. She <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> felt about being a hotel-keeper. She liked his old, heavy face and big hands".|$|R
60|$|Jacob <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> {{young man}} very much. <b>He</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> looked {{straight}} at him when <b>he</b> talked, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> threw his bicycle cap {{over the top of}} a rose-colored vase on the centre-table.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{pleasure}} to me, and I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> listened. I could have talked {{a long time to}} such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he drank it all in." ...|$|R
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> played it. ... I think he's {{got a sense of}} humor and he's got some good things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Miller, democracy, to Diệm, {{was rooted}} in his dual {{identity}} as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with communitarianism and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as [...] "a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty", not in the US sense of [...] "political right" [...] or political pluralism and {{in the context of}} an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Diệm was not a reactionary mandarin and lacking in interest in democracy <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> has been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking about democracy became key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform. On 4 March 1956, the first RVN National Assembly was held in a more free and fair than the referendum in 1955.|$|E
2500|$|Cruyffista (mainly in Spain), a follower/supporter of Cruyff's views (principles) on {{football}} development philosophy and sports culture. ...Cruyff's admirers don't just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> and his teams played. They believe {{the world could}} {{be a better place}} if his vision of football prevailed. Cruyffian football, they feel, is more beautiful, more fun and more spiritual than other approaches... Until relatively recently, English football was synonymous with long balls, bad ball control and big, clumsy centre-forwards charging into lumbering centre-halves. Now, most of the top coaches at the Premier League's biggest clubs are either Dutch or heavily influenced by the Dutch. There's Arsène Wenger at Arsenal, Van Gaal at Manchester United and Guus Hiddink at Chelsea. Roberto Martínez at Everton and Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool are devout Cruyffians. Next season, Pep Guardiola will start converting Manchester City to tiki-taka. |date=8 March 2016 |accessdate=18 June 2016 }} Some notable Cruyffistas include Joan Laporta, Pep Guardiola, Xavi, Luis Enrique, Ronald Koeman, Frank Rijkaard, Dennis Bergkamp, Roberto Martínez, Óscar García, Arsène Wenger, and Jürgen Klinsmann.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{thought the}} world of Ross Perot. I put him up there with our {{founding}} fathers. I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> talked. He’d say 'We’ve got {{to clean out the}} barn!' and I agreed with everything he said." ...|$|R
50|$|Wood's {{paintings}} were {{a reflection of}} the man. He painted what <b>he</b> <b>liked,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked.</b> When he made a statement on canvas, it was clear, crisp, richly coloured, deliberate and unapologetic. His favorites were those of the sea, where he felt most at peace with the world.|$|R

6000|$|... "The Saltillos are a {{long-lived}} race," [...] I laughed. [...] "I {{shall be}} a gray-haired man, with {{a house and}} family of my own by that time." [...] But I did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had spoken.|$|E
60|$|Niven, {{for that}} was his name, did not appear greatly disconcerted, or was able to face his loss with enviable tranquillity. He was a lanky, thin-faced man, with cunning eyes, and I did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> looked at me.|$|E
5000|$|Hoop Jr. was {{the first}} Thoroughbred horse Fred W. Hooper, an Alabama and Florida {{building}} contractor, ever bought. He paid $10,000 for the colt at the Keeneland Sales and named him after his youngest son, Fred Jr. Hooper was quoted many years later saying, [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> looked, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> walked, everything, and I said, I'm going to own you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Laine {{soon had}} patrons {{lining up to}} hear him sing [...] "Desire"; among them was R artist Hadda Brooks, known for her boogie woogie piano playing. She listened to him every night, and {{eventually}} cut her {{own version of the}} song, which became a hit on the [...] "harlem" [...] charts. [...] "I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did it" [...] Brooks recalled; [...] "he sings with soul, <b>he</b> sings <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> feels." ...|$|R
50|$|We've {{got quite}} a big family and we're all into cycling. I {{remember}} playing out in the garden with my three brothers and sister with little figures that we gave names to. I was usually Greg LeMond, then later I went on to be Miguel Indurain then eventually Laurent Jalabert. I remember LeMond's accent. I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> spoke French. I just {{thought he was a}} nice guy and I liked his style of riding.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, we {{had better}} remain at the inn," [...] rejoined his {{companion}} presently. [...] "I don't think I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> spoke of his house. I don't like stopping {{in the house with}} such a tremendous lot of women." ...|$|E

6000|$|His comrade, however, {{engaged in}} another thought, didn’t {{so much as}} appear to catch it. “I say, I guess we had better remain at the inn.

25|$|Coppola hired Michael Smuin, a {{choreographer}} and {{co-director of}} the San Francisco Ballet, to stage the fight scene between Rusty James and Biff Wilcox because <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> choreographed violence. He asked Smuin to include specific visual elements: a motorcycle, broken glass, knives, gushing water and blood. The choreographer spent a week designing the sequence. Smuin also staged the street dance between Rourke and Diana Scarwid, modeling it after one in Picnic featuring William Holden and Kim Novak.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{a notion}} I could agree with him--I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> talked--and I told him Helen could go, {{but the next}} time he called he was to walk right into the office instead of hanging round the counter. I asked him what he'd done with all the canned truck he'd bought, {{and he said he was}} {{inclined}} to think his partner had eaten most of it. Since then he's been over pretty often, and I figured it was time I gave you a hint." ...|$|R
50|$|Chris Smith {{built his}} first wooden boat in 1874 {{at the age}} of 13. Years later, he built a duck hunting boat. His friends <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> built them, and they asked him to build them one. This was {{technically}} the start of the Chris Craft Boat Co. He soon began to build more boats and joined his brother Hank in 1881 to begin producing boats full-time. In 1922, the brothers joined with other partners to form the Smith and Sons Boat Company. The company name was changed to Chris-Craft in 1930.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Butler's photograph, Sally considered, had flattered him. He was, in the flesh, a {{singularly}} repellent young man. There was a {{mean and}} cruel curve {{to his lips}} and a cold arrogance in his eye; a something dangerous and sinister in the atmosphere he radiated. Moreover, she did not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> smirked at her.|$|E
6000|$|Euphemia didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> said [...] "all right." [...] It {{seemed to}} her, she said, {{as if he}} {{intended}} to do something which {{would be all right}} for him, but not at all so for us. I saw she was nervous about it, for that evening she began to ask me questions about the traveling propensities of soap-makers, upholsterers, and dentists.|$|E

5000|$|Bentley was {{selected}} as the narrator of the Channel 4 (now Channel 5) Reality Television programme Big Brother, which originated in the Netherlands, and this remains his best-known work. The producers of Big Brother gave him the job of narrator because they <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> said [...] "Chickens". His most notable catchphrase is [...] "Day x (in the Big Brother house...)". Bentley has narrated all seventeen series of the show to date, as well as the spin-off shows Celebrity Big Brother, Teen Big Brother, Celebrity Hijack and Ultimate Big Brother.|$|R
5000|$|James {{seems to}} have <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> dramatized his {{material}} in The Other House. In his Notebooks he plans a section of his novel The Ivory Tower [...] "after {{the manner in which}} the first book is a prologue in The Other House. Oh, blest Other House, which gives me thus at every step a precedent, a divine little light to walk by..." [...] But James did not include The Other House in the New York Edition of his fiction (1907-1909), one of the few later novels not to make the cut.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Payne (Martin Lawrence) Martin, {{the title}} character, is a caring family man deep down, {{but on the}} outside a very macho, selfish smart alec. Martin carries himself in a typical urban youth manner, with modern {{expressions}} and mannerisms. His girlfriend turned wife, Gina Waters, has sometimes tried to change him (much to his anger, seeing as <b>he</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> acts), but this rarely worked. Martin is {{not much of a}} physical fighter despite trying to come off as such. He has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Gina's best friend Pam.|$|R
60|$|Having {{decided that}} Wally had swelled head, and not feeling much better, Mr. Goble {{concentrated}} {{his attention on}} the stage. A good deal of action had taken place there during the recently concluded business talk, and the unfortunate Lord Finchley was back again, playing another of his scenes. Mr. Goble glared at Lord Finchley. He did not like him, {{and he did not}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> was speaking his lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{bought that}} horse," [...] Francis admitted. [...] "And I am {{beginning}} to realise {{that there may}} be something in the theory which he advanced when he invited me to accompany him here this evening--that there is a certain piquancy in one's intercourse with an enemy, which friendship lacks. There may be complexities in his character which as yet I have not appreciated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Atherstone has {{improved}} a great deal," [...] Sybil answered, thoughtfully. [...] "There {{are a great}} many things about him which I like very much. He is always well dressed and fresh and nice. He enjoys himself without being dissipated, and he is perfectly natural. He is rather boyish perhaps, but then he is young. He {{is not afraid to}} laugh, and I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> enters into everything. And I think I like his persistence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Larry Drake as Robert G. Durant, a ruthless, sadistic mob {{boss and}} the head of his own {{criminal}} organization. He auditioned for the film and Raimi <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> underplayed <b>the</b> character, [...] "quiet and careful, yet intense," [...] the actor remembers. The director had never seen L.A. Law but found that Drake's face reminded him of [...] "a modern day Edward G. Robinson. He looked so mean, so domineering, yet he had this urban wit about him. I thought, 'My God, this guy is not only threatening-looking, he has a good physical presence – what a perfect adversary for the Darkman!'" ...|$|R
50|$|Norman drives Amy to {{distraction}} {{with his}} misguided, over-the-top attempts {{to win her}} affection. When he unintentionally gets her fired from her day job, Andy hires her as a secretary, just to keep Norman happy (and writing). Then something unexpected happens. Despite despising everything Andy stands for, the conservative Amy discovers (to her great disgust) that she is physically attracted to him and <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> smells, which is rather awkward, since she is scheduled to marry another swimmer in a few weeks. When she informs Andy, he is uncertain how to react. She gets him to kiss her {{to see how it}} feels, at which point Norman walks in.|$|R
5000|$|On October 28, 2011, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim {{announced}} Dipoto {{would be}} their next general manager, replacing Tony Reagins. Angels' owner Arte Moreno said that [...] "one {{of the reasons we}} hired Jerry is that I really <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> viewed baseball analytics." [...] However, Dipoto and manager Mike Scioscia disagreed regarding the use of analytics in baseball decisions, and a rift developed between the two when Dipoto fired Mickey Hatcher from the role of the team's hitting coach. Despite rumors that the Angels might replace either Dipoto or Scioscia after the 2013 season, Moreno announced that both would return to the Angels for the 2014 season.|$|R
