This variant of the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant form used with personal computers throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

In 2008, Rieth Village at Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center of Goshen College became the first platinum-rated LEED building in Indiana. In the spring of 2013, the college took the further step of purchasing 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources through the procurement of renewable energy credits. A computerized building temperature regulation system, motion <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> for indoor and outdoor lighting and open loop ground-source heat pumps further reduce energy consumption on campus. The campus has also converted nearly 20 percent of its lawn space to native plants and prairie restoration. Goshen College students and staff have developed a food composting system, planted a community garden, built a solar hot water collection system and continued to reduce energy consumption campus-wide. In 2014, the college earned a silver rating from the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System (STARS) report for its sustainability efforts. Through an aggressive energy reduction program and efficiency upgrades, Goshen College has reduced electric consumption by 25 percent and gas consumption by 23 percent since 2007.|$|E
500|$|Light gun {{shooters}} employ [...] "light gun" [...] controllers, {{so named}} because they function {{through the use of}} <b>light</b> <b>sensors.</b> Mechanical games using light guns had existed since the 1930s, though they operated differently from those used in video games. Throughout the 1970s mechanical games were replaced by electronic video games and in the 1980s popular light gun shooters such as Duck Hunt emerged. The genre was most popular in the 1990s, subsequent to the release of Virtua Cop, the formula of which was later improved upon by Time Crisis. The genre is less popular in the new millennium, as well as being hampered by compatibility issues, but retains a niche appeal for fans of [...] "old school" [...] gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|Most tunicates {{appear as}} adults in two major forms, {{both of which}} are soft-bodied filter-feeders that lack the {{standard}} features of chordates: [...] "sea squirts" [...] are sessile and consist mainly of water pumps and filter-feeding apparatus; salps float in mid-water, feeding on plankton, and have a two-generation cycle in which one generation is solitary and the next forms chain-like colonies. However, all tunicate larvae have the standard chordate features, including long, tadpole-like tails; they also have rudimentary brains, <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> and tilt sensors. The third main group of tunicates, Appendicularia (also known as Larvacea) retain tadpole-like shapes and active swimming all their lives, and were for a long time regarded as larvae of sea squirts or salps. The etymology of the term Urochorda(ta) (Balfour 1881) is from the ancient Greek οὐρά (oura, [...] "tail") + Latin chorda ("cord"), because the notochord is only found in the tail.

It has a 7-inch E Ink display with 300 ppi and the finish is made from aluminum. It has a similar asymmetric design like the previous Oasis so it works for one-handed use. The Oasis 2 is IPX8 rated so it is water resistant up to 2 meters for 60 minutes. It is frontlit with 12 LEDs and has ambient <b>light</b> <b>sensors</b> to adjust the brightness automatically. It supports playback of Audible audiobooks by pairing with A2DP supported external Bluetooth 4.2 speakers or headphones; the device can store up to 35 audiobooks with 8GB or 160 audiobooks with the 32GB model.

Wendy Carlos's Switched-On Bach (1968), recorded using Moog synthesizers, also influenced numerous musicians of that era {{and is one of the}} most popular recordings of classical music ever made, alongside the records (particularly Snowflakes are Dancing in 1974) of Isao Tomita, who in the early 1970s utilized synthesizers to create new artificial sounds (rather than simply mimicking real instruments) and made significant advances in analog synthesizer programming.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Spatial Sensitivity Function (SSF) {{is used to}} {{quantify}} a detector’s sensitivity to a spatially-distributed input signal. By weighting the incoming signal with the SSF and integrating, the overall scalar response of the detector can be estimated. This project focuses on estimating the SSF of a <b>light</b> intensity <b>sensor</b> consisting of a photodiode. This <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> has been used previously in the Knuth Cyberphysics Laboratory on a robotic arm that performs its own experiments to locate a white circle in a dark field (Knuth et al., 2007). To use the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> to learn about its surroundings, the robot’s inference software {{must be able to}} model and predict the <b>light</b> <b>sensor’s</b> response to a hypothesized stimulus. Previous models of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> treated it as a point sensor and ignored its spatial characteristics. Here we propose a parametric approach where the SSF is described by a mixture of Gaussians (MOG). By performing controlled calibration experiments with known stimulus inputs, we used nested sampling to estimate the SSF of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> using an MOG model with the number of Gaussians ranging from one to five. By comparing the evidence computed for each MOG model, we found that one Gaussian is sufficient to describe the SSF to the accuracy we require. Future work will involve incorporating this more accurate SSF into the Bayesian machine learning software for the robotic system and studying how this detailed information about the properties of the <b>light</b> <b>sensor</b> will improve robot’s ability to learn...|$|R
