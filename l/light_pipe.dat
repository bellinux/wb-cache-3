2500|$|The {{most common}} imaging mode {{collects}} low-energy (<50 eV) secondary electrons that are {{ejected from the}} k-shell of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate within a few nanometers from the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart-Thornley detector, which {{is a type of}} scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a <b>light</b> <b>pipe</b> and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons [...] "escape" [...] from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the [...] "escape" [...] distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5nbsp&nm is possible.|$|E

For shorter pipes, there will be a mirror at the opposite end; for longer ones, there will be a lamp at each end. The overall appearance of a <b>light</b> <b>pipe</b> has been compared to that of a giant-sized fluorescent tube. One sulfur lamp with a <b>light</b> <b>pipe</b> can replace dozens of HID lamps.

Each lamp uses one LED for the high beam, a second one for the low beam {{and one for the}} orange thermoplastic <b>light</b> <b>pipe.</b> The two beams, along with the <b>light</b> <b>pipe,</b> are then housed within one module.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Deep {{plans are}} a common {{practice}} in middle and high-rise office building design, and large open plans have become the preferred office layout by modern businesses due to {{the flexibility of the}} space and economic benefits achieved from maximum plot to gross floor area ratios. Consequently, the deep core areas of these buildings cannot be naturally illuminated by side windows, and depend entirely on electricity for illumination. This paper describes the benefits of daylight piping technologies; in particular, hollow mirrored <b>light</b> <b>pipes</b> coupled with laser cut panel collectors to enhance natural illumination of deep plan office buildings. <b>Light</b> <b>pipes</b> are assessed by testing two scale models of buildings, one with horizontal and the other with vertical <b>light</b> <b>pipes</b> as daylight devices. Testing was carried out under sunny sky conditions and an artificial sky that closely simulates the CIE overcast sky. Results have shown that mirrored <b>light</b> <b>pipes</b> coupled with laser cut panels can achieve required values for ambient illumination in the core of buildings under sunny conditions, with an overall efficiency (input to output lumens) up to 32 %, but their performance drops under overcast conditions...|$|R

50|$|Solar calculators use {{liquid crystal}} {{displays}} {{as they are}} power efficient and capable of operating in the low voltage range of 1.5-2 V.

However, solar calculators may not work well in indoor conditions under ambient lighting if sufficient light is not available.|$|E
50|$|The ACOG is {{available}} {{in a variety of}} configurations from the manufacturer with different reticles, illumination, and other features. Most ACOGs do not use batteries for reticle illumination, being designed to use internal phosphor illumination provided by the radioactive decay of tritium. The tritium illumination has a usable life of 10-15 years. Some versions of the ACOG have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiber optic <b>light</b> <b>pipe.</b> Normally this allows the brightness of the reticle to match the field of view since it collects ambient light from around the sight, although this can lead to a mismatch in lighting - such as sunlight hitting the <b>light</b> <b>pipe</b> directly, or standing in a shadow - causing the reticle to be much brighter or darker than the target. Reticles have other features such as a bullet drop compensator and other different reticle shapes such as chevrons.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{layout of}} a {{collimator}} sight is a closed tube with a lens at its open end and a luminous reticle mounted near the closed {{end at the}} focus of the lens, creating an optical collimator. The reticle is illuminated by an electronic light source (an incandescent light bulb or, more recently, a light-emitting diode) or by ambient light gathered behind the reticle via an opalescent window or fiber optic <b>light</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Light tubes or <b>light</b> <b>pipes</b> are {{physical}} structures {{used for}} transporting or distributing natural or artificial light {{for the purpose}} of illumination, and are examples of optical waveguides. In their application to daylighting, they are also often called tubular daylighting devices, sun pipes, sun scopes, or daylight <b>pipes.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>pipes</b> may be divided into two broad categories: hollow structures that contain the light with a reflective lining, and transparent solids that contain the light by total internal reflection. The principles governing the flow of light through these devices are those of nonimaging optics.|$|R

50|$|Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (abbreviated ACOG) is {{a series}} of {{telescopic}} sights manufactured by Trijicon. The ACOG was originally designed to be used on the M16 rifle and M4 carbine, but Trijicon have also developed ACOG accessories for other firearms. Models provide fixed power magnification levels from 1.5× to 6×. ACOG reticles are illuminated at night by an internal phosphor. Some versions have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiber optic <b>light</b> <b>pipe</b> or are LED-illuminated using a battery.|$|E
50|$|Security {{lighting}} may {{be subject}} to vandalism, possibly to reduce its effectiveness for a subsequent intrusion attempt. Thus security lights should either be mounted very high, or else protected by wire mesh or tough polycarbonate shields. Other lamps may be completely recessed from view and access, with the light directed out through a <b>light</b> <b>pipe</b> or reflected from a polished aluminium or stainless steel mirror. For similar reasons high security installations may provide a stand-by power supply for their security lighting.|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} the day lighting related solar concentration {{devices such as}} <b>light</b> <b>pipes</b> (or tubular daylight guidance systems), optical fibers for light transport, conventional solar concentrators and luminescent solar concentrators (LSC). The principles of study, advantages and disadvantages for application of these day lighting related devices have been explained. Daylight has a disadvantage {{of not being able}} to reach deeper areas in a building such as storerooms, basements and corridors and it also brings the heat gain with the <b>light.</b> <b>Light</b> <b>pipes</b> and optical fibers were expected to transfer daylight to unreached areas, but <b>light</b> <b>pipes</b> have their difficulties in wiring and the optical fiber needs a pointolite for the light transportation. Solar concentrators are only sensitive for the beam radiation and they function poorly in overcast sky conditions. Even under a clear sky condition, trackers are always needed for conventional solar concentrators. Static concentrators always come with a poor concentration rate without a tracker and the light concentrated by normal luminescent solar concentrators could not be transported by optical fibers to a remote place since the light produced by LSCs is not a pointolite. Future studies especially cross disciplinary researches on developing new solar concentration devices in mitigating those limitations as discussed in this study are highly recommended...|$|R
