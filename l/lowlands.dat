The defining factor in the {{geography of}} Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the <b>Lowlands</b> in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the <b>Lowlands</b> into the fertile Central <b>Lowlands</b> and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the Little Ice Age, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century.|$|E

5|$|Maya stelae (singular stela) are monuments {{that were}} {{fashioned}} by the Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. They consist of tall, sculpted stone shafts {{and are often}} associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although their actual function is uncertain. Many stelae were sculpted in low relief, although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region. The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic Period (250–900 AD), and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization. The earliest dated stela to {{have been found in}} situ in the Maya <b>lowlands</b> was recovered from the great city of Tikal in Guatemala. During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern <b>lowlands</b> raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.|$|E
