40|$|International audienceHomogenisation of agrolandscapes {{is one of}} {{the causes}} of {{biodiversity}} loss. Agrolandscapes can be described by the proportion of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and their spatial arrangement. If the proportion of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> has strong implications on the productive performance of farming systems, the spatial arrangement of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> seems to be an important way to improve ecological performances at landscape scale with minor production loss. The objective {{of this study was to}} asses the relative effects of the proportion of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and their spatial arrangement on ecological dynamics. We focused on the conservation of lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) in grassland landscapes. We developed a modelling approach linking grass dynamics in grazed and mown grasslands to lapwing population dynamics. We tested contrasting landscapes composed of different pairs of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> depending on whether they compensate or complement each other. Our results show that the proportion of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> is the first driver of population dynamics. Spatial arrangement of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> in the landscape is an important although secondary driver of bird population trends. Managing the spatial arrangement of <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> could therefore be an important target of conservation policies.
