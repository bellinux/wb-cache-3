500|$|... "Something New" [...] was {{recorded}} in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. [...] "Something New" [...] opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing [...] "Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / You boys better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show" [...] over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, [...] "after a generic dance beat kicks in, {{the rest of the}} track is a mish-mash of rap and mixed solos." [...] As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, [...] "All I want is something new / Something I can hold on to / I don’t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> / Catch me if you can." [...] Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns [...] "to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound." [...] It ends with the group shouting, [...] "Boy you better watch your back / Cause we're the leaders of the pack." [...] A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] (2007), and thought that [...] "Something New" [...] echoed the group's previous single, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), {{not only because of the}} title, [...] "but it also has the same slightly demented feel to it, all distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit." [...] Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's [...] "odd" [...] structure, which is noted as [...] "typical" [...] and the group's [...] "signature style".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2000, Austin {{appeared}} at Backlash, attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. Austin then made an appearance via satellite on SmackDown! in September as him announcing his return at Unforgiven. At Unforgiven, Austin made his official return {{along with his}} new theme song, [...] "Glass Shatters" [...] by Disturbed. Commissioner Mick Foley, meanwhile, led an investigation {{to find out who}} ran Austin down at Survivor Series the previous year. Rikishi finally admitted to being the driver because [...] "he did it for The Rock". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with him gone, Rock, a fellow Samoan, would be able to ascend {{to the top of the}} company. At No Mercy, Austin was back to face Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin mentioned he was going to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, the match being deemed no contest and Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and Kurt Angle, Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head, and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At Survivor Series, Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match (thus repeating the events of the previous year's Survivor Series), but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's automobile with a forklift, then <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> 20 feet. Also, in December, Stone Cold Steve Austin competed in a six-man Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon for the WWF Championship, against Triple H, The Undertaker, Rikishi, Kurt Angle and The Rock. In the end, Austin gave The Rock a stunner and was about to pin him when Triple H came in the way and got a stunner; Angle took advantage of the situation and pinned The Rock and picked up the victory, hence retaining the WWF Championship. After the match, Austin delivered a stunner to Angle, while he was celebrating his victory. On his 36th birthday, December 18, 2000 on the first episode of Raw is War to be held at the BI-LO Center in Greenville, South Carolina, Austin competed and fought in a non-title match against William Regal, in which he was disqualified after taking Regal's European title belt to hit him. Austin won his third Royal Rumble in January 2001, last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at No Way Out in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.|$|E

50|$|An {{eccentric}} contraction is {{the motion}} of an active muscle while it is lengthening under load. Eccentric training is repetitively doing eccentric muscle contractions. For example, in a biceps curl the action of lowering the dumbbell back down from the lift is the eccentric phase of that exercise — {{as long as the}} dumbbell is lowered slowly rather than <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> (i.e., the biceps {{are in a state of}} contraction to control the rate of descent of the dumbbell).|$|R
5000|$|The hostess for {{the first}} series was Evans' then-girlfriend Rachel Tatton Brown, who had {{previously}} worked on The Big Breakfast. Despite being a former model, Tatton Brown was uncomfortable {{in front of the}} cameras and aspired to move onto something else. She was replaced in the second series by his then-new girlfriend, Jadene Doran, who was introduced as [...] "Ms let your hair down!", and would appear on stage with her hair tied up, <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> as she arrived on stage.|$|R
50|$|On rare occasions, such as {{in extra}} innings or the ninth inning of a tie game when a runner is on third base, fielders {{have been known to}} let long foul flies drop rather than risk losing the game on a {{sacrifice}} fly. Sometimes, in that situation, a fielder will not try to catch a ball that is close to the foul line {{in the hope that the}} ball will go foul at the last second—neither catching the ball nor <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> would prevent a defeat.|$|R

The show's producers received a constant trickle of letters each week from viewers who thought this was cruel, so in the final episode's opening credits, a bag of dog food spills out of a nearby cabinet.|$|R

2500|$|Shanties {{might come}} into play for {{miscellaneous}} additional shipboard tasks. For example, songs used to accompany the work of holystoning the deck have been attested. [...] "Poor Old Man" [...] (also known as [...] "Poor Old Horse" [...] or [...] "The Dead Horse") was sung in a ritual fashion once the sailors had worked off their advance pay (the so-called [...] "dead horse") a month into the voyage. The ceremony involved hauling a stuffed facsimile of a horse up to the yardarm, before <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> into the sea, all the while singing this customary shanty.|$|R

5000|$|Sleet, which behaves like a {{thin layer}} of {{quicksand}} on the road. Cars sink in it or drive across the surface and then slide over the slick individual pellets when attempting to brake. Sleet is very difficult to remove from roads. Due to its self-distributive properties and high weight relative to snow, most snow removal equipment is not suited to the task of removing sleet. Sleet has been referred to as [...] "winter's sand" [...] because when walking across it, kicking it, or picking <b>it</b> up and <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> or slide through your fingers, it feels and behaves like sand.|$|R

50|$|Judas, {{desperate to}} save himself from Caiaphas, agrees to turn over Jesus. Noticeably at the Last Supper, when Jesus {{distributes}} the bread and wine {{saying that they are}} his body and blood, Judas refuses to eat. Judas puts the cup to his lips but refuses to drink; he tears off a piece of bread but <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> <b>drop</b> to the ground. Towards the end, Mary confronts her son and tells him to flee from the danger that is coming. Jesus replies that it must be done for the salvation of all peoples. They leave the room but the camera focuses on the table upon which a dove alights for a moment.|$|R
