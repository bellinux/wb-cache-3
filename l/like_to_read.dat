5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the series, he was not sure whether it would be a detective manga or a romantic one. Although he does not like detective stories, Matsui {{nevertheless}} chose to write one because it was a genre that was not covered in the magazine that time. However, Matsui considers Neuro the antithesis to [...] "orthodox detective manga" [...] like Case Closed or Kindaichi Case Files because of Neuro's supernatural powers. Furthermore, he did not want to create a detective's reasoning manga because he does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> or draw it. He said that reasoning scenes are superfluous, so he placed some jokes in these scenes.|$|E
500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E

500|$|Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre {{develops}} {{a friendship with}} Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. Initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiancée. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's {{first thought was that}} it was [...] "one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want" [...] since most of the series pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> Nolasco was amazed that the script was a [...] "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role.|$|E
500|$|Described as a [...] "caustic right-wing bully", an [...] "arch-conservative blowhard", {{and by his}} {{creator and}} namesake as a [...] "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high status idiot", Colbert is egomaniacal, xenophobic and {{fiercely}} anti-intellectual. He claims to be politically independent, like his idol Bill [...] "Papa Bear" [...] O'Reilly; although in fact the character fawns over the Bush administration and the Republican Party, and frequently asks his guests, [...] "George Bush: Great president, or the greatest president?" [...] Following the election of Barack Obama in 2008, Colbert continued his right-wing views, but stated he would [...] "support our new President as long as [...] remains popular". Colbert emphasizes that his character is genuinely well-meaning and wants {{to do the right}} thing, but does not have the tools to achieve it [...] "because he has no curiosity, he doesn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and he won't listen to anybody except the voices in his head".|$|E
500|$|When Sarah Waters was 19 years old, {{she joined}} a student house in Whitstable, Kent, sharing {{a bed and}} then {{falling in love with}} another young woman. They lived there for two winters in what became a six-year relationship. She recalled, [...] "It was cold, isolated, romantic and so intense—quite special." [...] In 1995, Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD {{dissertation}} on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era. While learning about the activism in socialism, women's suffrage, and utopianism of the period, she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Specifically, Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting, diverging from previous lesbian-themed books such as Isabel Miller's Patience and Sarah, in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods. She said to herself at the time, [...] "there's so much more to lesbian history than that".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. [...] "I've got myself the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, I can stay in the middle long enough or do that. You can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care at all what is written in the press. I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it but it doesn't go too far into my head." [...] In Tasmania's final {{round-robin}} match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.|$|E
500|$|Today I {{am afraid}} that fish in most of those rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and {{looks down at the}} noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.|$|E
2500|$|In {{support of}} a Lancashire answer for the lost years, Oliver Baker said simply: [...] "In stating that the poet may have found a home with a band of players in Lancashire and passed the most impressionable {{years of his life}} in great houses, and with cultured people, instead of {{remaining}} in a butcher's yard till he married and left for London, I may not have provided the reading public with the sort of detailed narrative of Shakespeare's early life and work which we should all <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> but it is one which puts less strain on their credulity than what has sometimes been offered them, and is at least less insulting to their intelligence." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, he met {{the poet}} Youenn Gwernig who was a Breton American like him in New York, and they became friends. [...] Gwernig used to {{translate}} his Breton language poems in English {{in order to make}} Kerouac read and understand them : [...] "Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn. Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write some of your poems in English? I'd really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> them !...' So I wrote an Diri Dir – Stairs of Steel for him, and kept on doing so. That's why I often write my poems in Breton, French and English." ...|$|E

I see one book lying, next to her bag one day, a new one is there the next day." [...] She played checkers. She enjoyed going on angling trips with Viktor, her father, and Gennady. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and listen to music, but mostly I enjoy a few quiet hours by the water. I love to go fishing. I {{spend a lot of time}} fishing with my father or my coach, either on a lake in a boat, or on the banks of the Neva." [...] She enjoyed cooking and baking. As with many gymnasts she has a fondness for ice cream.|$|E
2500|$|Mitchel's Letter to Lord Clarendon (see below) {{asserted}} that [...] "we {{differ from the}} illustrious conspirators of Ninety-Eight, not in principle – no, not an iota – but, as I shall presently show you, materially as to the mode of action.

They had not learned the charm of open, honest, outspoken resistance to oppression and through their secret organization you wrought their ruin – we defy you, and all the informers and detectives that British corruption ever bred. No espionage can tell you more than we will proclaim once {{a week on the}} house-tops. If you desire to have a Castle detective employed about the United Irishman office in Trinity Street I shall make no objection, provided the man be sober and honest.
