5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer)</b> with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a <b>laptop</b> <b>computer,</b> a camera and a small box, and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the level of}} the extremely low-frequency magnetic field, which is produced by <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> The magnetic field, which is characterized by extremely low frequencies up to 300 Hz is measured due to its hazardous effects to the laptop user's health. The experiment consists of testing 13 different <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> in normal operation conditions. The measuring of the magnetic field is performed in the adjacent neighborhood of the <b>laptop</b> <b>computers.</b> The measured data are presented and then classified. The classification is performed by the K-Medians method {{in order to determine the}} critical positions of the laptop. At the end, the measured magnetic field values are compared with the critical values suggested by different safety standards. It is shown that some of the <b>laptop</b> <b>computers</b> emit a very strong magnetic field. Hence, they must be used with extreme caution. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
