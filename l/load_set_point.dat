METHODS We used {{data from the}} Concerted Action on SeroConversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) collaboration, restricted to those infected since 1996, aged ≥ 15 years, and applied mixed effects models for CD 4 cell count decline and median regression for viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> (mean level 6 - 24 months from seroconversion). RESULTS The analysis included 3364 seroconverters with known HIV- 1 subtypes. Compared with subtype B, CD 4 at seroconversion was significantly higher for subtype CRF 01 and lower for subtype C. Subsequent CD 4 decline was significantly slower for subtypes A and CRF 02 and marginally slower for subtype C compared with B. Mean CD 4 loss at 2 years of seroconversion for white men exposed through sex between men, aged 30 - 39 years, having seroconverted since 2006, enrolled within 6 months of seroconversion, and without acute infection was 88, 142, 100, 130, 103, and 167 cells/µL for subtypes A, B, C, CRF 01 _AE, CRF 02 _AG, and G, respectively.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 97 - 102. It {{has been}} {{recognized}} that significantly more benefit can be derived by operating processes at the economically optimal process conditions than by solely improving the regulatory control performance. This has been the motivation for an increased focus on optimizing control strategies where the set points are adjusted on-line in accordance with an economic criterion. Since plant conditions change, this adjustment {{needs to be made}} on a continual basis, but at a frequency lower than that at which inputs are manipulated at the regulatory control level. In the operation of tumbling mills, the fractional filling of the mill with slurry has a marked effect on the efficiency of the breakage process within the mill. The selection of the set point for this variable is critical in the optimization of throughput and energy efficiency in a grinding circuit. Unfortunately, the optimal value for this set point is a function of both circuit and ore characteristics, which means that it varies as the feed and plant characteristics change. This means that periodic re-evaluation of this optimal value needs to be performed in order to fully maximize circuit throughput. The mechanism for seeking this optimum on-line forms the basis for this thesis. Continuous evaluation of the function relating throughput to mill loading (if that were possible) would reveal the optimal set point for the load which could be regularly updated. A recent strategy tackled this issue by assuming power draw from the mill motors is related to circuit, throughput. With the aim to optimize throughput, power consumption {{can be used as a}} yardstick by which the <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> (set point for fractional filling in mill) can be selected. The <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> is simply adjusted periodically to optimize the power consumption and correspondingly, the circuit through put.

Virological, immunological, and body composition measurements were taken every 4 weeks for 120 weeks. RESULTS: There {{was no difference between}} groups in weight gain, body mass index (BMI), crown-heel length, waist circumference, total tissue mass, lean mass, bone mineral content, or bone mineral density.

In macaques, proinflammatory cytokine production in the genital tract is necessary for target cell recruitment and establishment of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection following vaginal inoculation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection predisposes women to rapid disease progression. Methods. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) from 49 women 6, 17, 30, and 55 weeks after HIV- 1 infection and from 22 of these women before infection. Associations between genital inflammation and viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and blood CD 4 cell counts 12 months after infection were investigated. Results. Elevated genital cytokine concentrations 6 and 17 weeks after HIV- 1 infection were associated with higher viral load set points and, to a lesser extent, with CD 4 depletion. CVL cytokine concentrations during early infection did not differ relative to preinfection but were elevated in women who had vaginal discharge, detectable HIV- 1 RNA in their genital tracts, and lower blood CD 4 counts. Conclusion. Genital inflammation during early HIV- 1 infection was associated with higher viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and CD 4 depletion, which are markers of rapid disease progression.

40|$|The {{properties}} of three variants of cloned simian immunodeficiency virus strain 239 (SIV 239) were compared. One strain (M 5) lacked five sites for N-linked carbohydrate attachment in variable regions 1 and 2 (V 1 and V 2) of the gp 120 envelope protein, one strain (ΔV 1 -V 2) completely lacked V 1 and V 2 sequences, and another (316) had nine mutations {{in the envelope}} that impart high replicative capacity for tissue macrophages. All three strains were capable of significant levels of fusion independent of CD 4, and all three were considerably more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization than the parent strain from which they were derived. Upon experimental infection of rhesus monkeys, these three variant strains replicated to viral loads at peak height around day 14 that were indistinguishable from or only slightly less than those observed in monkeys infected with the parental SIV 239 strain. Viral <b>loads</b> at the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> 20 to 50 weeks after infection, however, were more than 400 - to 10, 000 -fold lower with the variant strains. Depletion of B cells {{around the time of}} infection with M 5 resulted in less effective immunological control and much higher viral <b>loads</b> at the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in two of three monkeys. The differences between SIV 239 infection, where there is not effective immunological control, and SIVM 5 infection, where there is effective immunological control, cannot be easily explained by differences in the inherent replicative capacity of the viruses; rather, they are more readily explained by differences in the effectiveness of the antibody response. These results suggest that resistance of SIV 239 to antibody-mediated neutralization is very important for evading effective immunological control, for allowing continuous viral replication, for maintenance of moderate-to-high viral <b>loads</b> at <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> and for disease progression...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of an effective HIV- 1 vaccine must be considered as one of today s greatest biomedical goals and challenges. The nature of the HIV- 1 virus, characterised by its tropism for the CD 4 + T cells {{of the immune system}} and its integration into the host genome, together with the vast viral variability, allows the HIV- 1 virus to establish a latent infection and evade the host defence mechanisms. In our endeavour to develop a genetic HIV-vaccine that elicits broad and robust immune responses to several virus variants, we have demonstrated major cross-clade Gag responses in patients infected with different subtypes of HIV- 1. This indicates that genetic vaccines encoding Gag from a few strains may act to induce immunity to broad ranges of HIV- 1 clades. We also found that HIV- 1 infection results in release of intracellular perforin into the serum of HIV infected individuals and in SIV/SHIV infected monkeys. As perforin secretion/production {{has been shown to be}} associated with control of HIV- 1 infection, the aberrant perforin release may be a result of a yet unknown viral immune escape mechanism. Individuals enrolled in two therapeutic and one prophylactic HIV- 1 vaccine trial were analysed for their vaccine-specific immune responses. Analyses of the therapeutic vaccine samples revealed that: 1) Multiple injections with recombinant HIV- 1 glycoprotein 160 induces an increased central memory T cell population, which can be associated with increased antigenspecific cellular immune responses in treatment naïve HIV- 1 infected individuals. 2) Topical DNA immunisation, combined with repeated treatment interruptions in patients on successful antiretroviral therapy, induced novel HIV- 1 specific cellular immune responses. Such treatment did permit extended drug-free periods for all participants. Moreover, the viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> were significantly lower after the treatment protocol than before initial onset of any antiretroviral treatment. However, the decreased viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>points</b> were not related to the HIV- 1 immunisation. In the prophylactic study, HIV- 1 DNA followed by a recombinant vaccinia virus vector boost induced strong and broad HIV- 1 specific cellular immune responses. In healthy individuals, we found that previous immunity to vaccinia only moderately reduced the HIV-specific immune responses when vaccinia was used as a vector for HIV genes. This finding suggests that vaccinia-based immunogens can be used despite the presence of pre-existing immunity to this vector. Immunisation of HIV- 1 infected individuals is difficult, as HIV- 1 infection leads to a dysfunctional immune system. Despite efforts to induce new and improve existing immune responses by therapeutic vaccination, no clinical trial has yet been able to show long-term sustained clinical effects of immunisation. The modest and transient effects observed by us with currently available DNA vaccines highlight the need to develop immunisation strategies which combine immunisation with novel antiviral therapies...|$|R

Early HIV-specific CD 8 T-cell responses and subsequent HIV viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> were assayed in participants acquiring HIV, and were correlated with the presence of prior genital infections during HIV acquisition. Results: Thirty-five participants acquired HIV during follow-up, and 16 out of 35 (46 %.) had a classical sexually transmitted infection at the time of acquisition. N. gonorrhoeae coinfection was present during HIV acquisition in 6 out of 35 (17 %), and was associated with an increased breadth and magnitude of systemic HIV-specific CD 8 T-cell responses, using both interferon-gamma gamma and MIP- 1 beta as an Output.

When simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) recovered from two such animals (one Δnef and the other Δ 3) were serially passaged in rhesus monkeys, the SIVs derived from both lineages were found to consistently induce moderate viral loads and disease progression. Analysis of viral sequences in the serially passaged derivatives revealed interesting changes in three regions: (i) an unusually high number of predicted amino acid changes (12 to 14) in the cytoplasmic domain of gp 41, {{most of which were}} in regions that are usually conserved; these changes were observed in both lineages; (ii) an extreme shortening of nef sequences in the region of overlap with U 3; these changes were observed in both lineages; and (iii) duplication of the NF-κB binding site in one lineage only. Neither the polymorphic gp 41 changes alone nor the U 3 deletion alone appeared to be responsible for increased replicative capacity because recombinant SIVmac 239 Δnef, engineered to contain either of these changes, induced moderate viral loads in only one of six monkeys. However, five of six monkeys {{infected with}} recombinant SIVmac 239 Δnef containing both TM and U 3 changes did develop persisting moderate viral loads. These genetic changes did not increase lymphoid cell-activating properties in the monkey interleukin- 2 -dependent T-cell line 221, but the gp 41 changes did increase the fusogenic activity of the SIV envelope two- to threefold.

Plasma viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and HIV-specific T-cell proliferation and cytokine production were now examined post hoc by blinded investigators in the subset of participants who acquired HIV. RESULTS: Pre-acquisition cellular immune assays and post-infection viral load were available for 46 participants, and HIV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell responses had been detected in 25 of 46 (54 %) participants. Pre-acquisition CD 8 (+) T-cell responses were associated with a lower post-acquisition HIV viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in both cohorts (pooled analysis, 3. 1 vs. 4. 1 log(10) RNA copies/ml; P= 0. 0002) and with enhanced post-acquisition HIV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell proliferation (3. 8 vs. 1. 0 %, P= 0. 03), but with a trend to reduced post-acquisition CD 8 (+) T-cell interferon-gamma responses. CONCLUSION: HIV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell responses prior to HIV acquisition were associated with a lower HIV viral load and an altered functional profile of post-acquisition CD 8 (+) T-cell responses...|$|E

Although the acute phase of HIV infection {{is associated with}} increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production, the relationship between cytokine concentrations and HIV pathogenesis is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To identify cytokine biomarkers measurable in plasma during acute HIV- 1 infection that predict HIV disease progression. DESIGN: Study including 40 South African women who became infected with HIV- 1 and were followed longitudinally {{from the time of}} infection. METHODS: The concentrations of 30 cytokines in plasma from women with acute HIV- 1 infection were measured and associations between cytokine levels and both viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> 12 months postinfection and time taken for CD 4 cell counts to fall below 350 cells/microl were determined using multivariate and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: We found that the concentrations of five plasma cytokines, IL- 12 p 40, IL- 12 p 70, IFN-gamma, IL- 7 and IL- 15 in women with acute infection predicted 66 % of the variation in viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> 12 months postinfection. IL- 12 p 40, IL- 12 p 70 and IFN-gamma were significantly associated with lower viral load, whereas IL- 7 and IL- 15 were associated with higher viral load. Plasma concentrations of IL- 12 p 40 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor during acute infection were associated with maintenance of CD 4 cell counts above 350 cells/microl, whereas IL- 1 alpha, eotaxin and IL- 7 were associated with more rapid CD 4 loss. CONCLUSION: A small panel of plasma cytokines during acute HIV- 1 infection was predictive of long-term HIV disease prognosis in this group of South African women...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} a whole-genome association {{study of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) set point among a cohort of African Americans (n = 515), and an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the HLA-B gene showed {{one of the strongest}} associations. We use a subset of patients to demonstrate that this SNP reflects the effect of the HLA-B* 5703 allele, which shows a genome-wide statistically significant association with viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> (P = 5. 6 x 10 (- 10)). These analyses therefore confirm a member of the HLA-B* 57 group of alleles as the most important common variant that influences viral load variation in African Americans, which is consistent with what has been observed for individuals of European ancestry, among whom the most important common variant is HLA-B* 5701...|$|E
40|$|Broadly {{reactive}} neutralizing antibodies are {{the focus}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 vaccine design. However, only little is known about their role in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pathogenesis and the factors associated with their development. Here we used a multisubtype panel of 23 HIV- 1 variants to determine the prevalence of cross-reactive neutralizing activity in serum samples obtained similar to 35 months after seroconversion from 82 HIV- 1 subtype B-infected participants from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies on HIV Infection and AIDS. Of these patients, 33 %, 48 %, and 20 %, respectively, had strong, moderate, or absent cross-reactive neutralizing activity in serum. Viral RNA <b>load</b> at <b>set</b> <b>point</b> and AIDS-free survival were similar for the 3 patient groups. However, higher cross-reactive neutralizing activity was significantly associated with lower CD 4 (+) T cell counts before and soon after infection. Our findings underscore the importance of vaccine-elicited immunity in protecting from infection. The association between CD 4 + T cell counts and neutralizing humoral immunity may provide new clues as to how to achieve this goa...|$|R

Numerous studies on this domain mention that excessive heat during {{the extraction}} process will degrade the quality of oil and produced poor output. Recently, researchers take efforts to fix this problem by develop intelligent control technique in order to regulate the temperature. This study proposed the self-tuning fuzzy PID (STFPID) controller using online method. The STFPID controller will regulate the steam temperature below 100 OC where very little publication so far discussed on that range. The robustness of STFPID controller was test using <b>load</b> disturbance and <b>set</b> <b>point</b> tracking. The performance effectiveness was evaluated based on rise time, settling time, percent overshoot, and steady stare error.

40|$|HLA class I alleles {{have been}} shown to have {{differential}} impacts on the viral load and the outcome of HIV- 1 disease progression. In this study, HLA class I types from residents of China with acute HIV- 1 infection, diagnosed between 2006 and 2011, were identified and the association between expression of individual HLA alleles and the level of the <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral <b>load</b> was analyzed. A lower level of <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral <b>load</b> was found {{to be associated with the}} Bw 4 homozygote on HLA-B alleles. B* 44 and B* 57 alleles have also been found to be associated with lower <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral <b>load.</b> The <b>set</b> <b>point</b> viral <b>load</b> of B* 44 -positive individuals ho-mozygous for Bw 4 was significantly lower than that of B* 44 -negative individuals homozygous for Bw 4 (P 0. 030). The CD 4 count declined to< 350 in fewer B* 44 -positive individuals than B* 44 -negative individuals (X 2 7. 295, P 0. 026). B* 44 -positive individuals had a lower magnitude of p 24 pool-specific T cell responses than B* 44 -negative individuals homozygous for Bw 4, though this was not statistically significant. The p 24 pool-specific T cell responses were also inversely correlated with lower viral load (rs 0. 88, P 0. 033). Six peptides within p 24 were recognized to induce the specific-T cell response in B* 44 -positive indi-viduals, and the peptide breadth of response was same as that in B* 44 -negative individuals homozygous for Bw 4, but the median magnitude of specific-T cell responses to the recognized peptides in B* 44 -positive individuals was lower than that in B* 44 -nega-tive individuals homozygous for Bw 4 (P 0. 049). These findings imply that weak p 24 -specific CD 8 T cell responses might play an important role in the control of HIV viremia in B* 44 allele-positive individuals. Such studies might contribute to the develop-ment of future therapeutic strategies that take into account the genetic background of the patients...|$|R

40|$|Natural killer (NK) cells may be {{important}} in modulating HIV replication in early course of HIV infection. The effector function of NK cells is finely tuned by a balance between signals delivered by activating and inhibitory receptors. However the influence of expression of these receptors on the early course of HIV replication and subsequent disease progression is not explored in context of HIV- 1 C infection. The expression pattern of activating (NKp 46,NKp 44, NKp 30, NKG 2 D,NKG 2 C) and inhibitory (CD 158 b, NKG 2 A and ILT 2) receptors was determined in 20 patients with recent HIV- 1 C infection within 3 - 7 months of acquiring HIV infection and was compared with the expression pattern in individuals with progressive (N= 12), non progressive HIV- 1 C infection (LTNPs, N= 12) and healthy seronegative individuals (N= 20). The association of the expression of these receptors on the rate of disease progression was assessed using viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in recently infected individuals as a marker of disease progression. The study showed that higher cytotoxic potency of NK cells was associated with low viral <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in recent HIV infection (r=- 0. 701; p= 0. 0006) and higher CD 4 counts (r= 0. 720; p= 0. 001). The expression of activating receptors (NKp 46, NKp 30 and NKG 2 D) on cytotoxic NK cells but not on regulatory NK cells {{was significantly associated with}} low viral set point(p< 0. 01) and viral load in LTNPs (p< 0. 01). The study also indicated that cytotoxic NK cells might show the ability to specifically lyse HIV infected CD 4 cells. This data collectively showed that early and sustained higher expression of activating receptors on cytotoxic NK cells could be responsible for increased cytotoxicity, reduced viral burden and thus delaying the disease progression. The study to identify the influence of HIV on the molecular mechanism of the expression of these receptors will be helpful in further understanding of NK cell mediated control in early HIV infection...|$|E

The control data, which are available in most of machines, including armature current, <b>load</b> <b>set</b> <b>point,</b> speed demand, motor current, torque feedback and speed feedback have been explored based on a gearbox test system. A non linear regression model is adopted to correlate the datasets to obtain residuals from the observed and the predicted control parameters.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the real-time {{implementation of a}} fuzzy coordinated classical PI control scheme for controlling the pressure in a pilot pressure tank system. The fuzzy system {{has been designed to}} track the variation parameters in a feedback loop and tune the classical controller to achieve a better control action for <b>load</b> disturbances and <b>set</b> <b>point</b> changes. The error and process inputs are chosen as the inputs of fuzzy system to tune the conventional PI controller according to the process condition. This online conventional controller tuning technique will reduce the human involvement in controller tuning and increase the operating range of the conventional controller. The proposed control algorithm is experimentally implemented for the real-time pressure control of a pilot air tank system and validated using a high-speed 32 -bit ARM 7 embedded microcontroller board (ATMEL AT 91 M 55800 A). To demonstrate the performance of the fuzzy coordinated PI control scheme, results are compared with a classical PI and PI-type fuzzy control method. It is observed that the proposed controller structure is able to quickly track the parameter variation and perform better in load disturbances and also for <b>set</b> <b>point</b> changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{genome-wide}} {{screen for}} large structural variants {{showed that a}} copy number variant (CNV) in the region encoding killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) associates with HIV- 1 control as measured by plasma viral <b>load</b> at <b>set</b> <b>point</b> in individuals of European ancestry. This CNV encompasses the KIR 3 DL 1 -KIR 3 DS 1 locus, encoding receptors that interact with specific HLA-Bw 4 molecules to regulate the activation of lymphocyte subsets including natural killer (NK) cells. We quantified the number of copies of KIR 3 DS 1 and KIR 3 DL 1 in a large HIV- 1 positive cohort, and showed that an increase in KIR 3 DS 1 count associates with a lower viral <b>set</b> <b>point</b> if its putative ligand is present (p = 0. 00028), as does an increase in KIR 3 DL 1 count {{in the presence of}} KIR 3 DS 1 and appropriate ligands for both receptors (p = 0. 0015). We further provide functional data that demonstrate that NK cells from individuals with multiple copies of KIR 3 DL 1, in the presence of KIR 3 DS 1 and the appropriate ligands, inhibit HIV- 1 replication more robustly, and associated with a significant expansion in the frequency of KIR 3 DS 1 +, but not KIR 3 DL 1 +, NK cells in their peripheral blood. Our results suggest that the relative amounts of these activating and inhibitory KIR play a role in regulating the peripheral expansion of highly antiviral KIR 3 DS 1 + NK cells, which may determine differences in HIV- 1 control following infection. © 2011 Pelak et al...|$|R
40|$|Discussion on {{improving}} {{the power of}} genome-wide association studies to identify candidate variants and genes is generally centered on issues of maximizing sample size; less attention {{is given to the}} role of phenotype definition and ascertainment. The authors used genome-wide data from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) to assess whether differences in type of population (622 seroconverters vs. 636 seroprevalent subjects) or the number of measurements available for defining the phenotype resulted in differences in the effect sizes of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms and the phenotype, HIV- 1 viral <b>load</b> at <b>set</b> <b>point.</b> The effect estimate for the top 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms was 0. 092 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 074, 0. 110) log(10) viral load (log(10) copies of HIV- 1 per mL of blood) greater in seroconverters than in seroprevalent subjects. The difference was even larger when the authors focused on chromosome 6 variants (0. 153 log(10) viral load) or on variants that achieved genome-wide significance (0. 232 log(10) viral load). The estimates of the genetic effects tended to be slightly larger when more viral load measurements were available, particularly among seroconverters and for variants that achieved genome-wide significance. Differences in phenotype definition and ascertainment may affect the estimated magnitude of genetic effects and should be considered in optimizing power for discovering new associations...|$|R
