5000|$|... 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate (N5,N10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH2-THF) is the {{substrate}} {{used by the}} enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to generate 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF, or <b>levomefolic</b> <b>acid).</b>|$|E
50|$|Levomefolate calcium, a {{calcium salt}} of <b>levomefolic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{developed}} and produced by Merck KGaA, is sold under the brand names Metafolin (a registered trademark of Merck KGaA) and incorporated in Deplin (trademark of Pamlab, LLC).|$|E
50|$|Preliminary {{research}} suggests that <b>levomefolic</b> <b>acid</b> (L-methylfolate) taken with a first-line antidepressant may provide an adjunctive antidepressant effect for individuals who do not respond or have only a partial therapeutic response to SSRI or SNRI medication.|$|E
50|$|It is {{synthesized}} in the absorptive {{cells of}} the small intestine from polyglutamylated dietary folate. It is a methylated derivative of tetrahydrofolate. <b>Levomefolic</b> <b>acid</b> is generated by MTHFR from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) and used to recycle homocysteine back to methionine by methionine synthase (MS).|$|E
50|$|<b>Levomefolic</b> <b>acid</b> (and {{folic acid}} in turn) has been {{proposed}} for treatment of cardiovascular disease and advanced cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. It bypasses several metabolic steps {{in the body and}} better binds thymidylate synthase with FdUMP, a metabolite of the drug fluorouracil.|$|E
5000|$|Ethinylestradiol/drospirenone/levomefolic acid (trade names Beyaz, Safyral) is an oral {{contraceptive}} developed by Bayer. Its contraceptive ingredients are ethinylestradiol, an estrogen and drospirenone, a synthetic progestogen, {{making it a}} combined {{oral contraceptive}} (COC). It also contains folate as <b>levomefolic</b> <b>acid</b> calcium salt, to {{lower the risk of}} complications such as fetal neural tube defects should the drug fail as contraceptive. [...] The drug was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on 24 September 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levomefolic</b> <b>acid</b> (INN) (also {{known as}} L-5-MTHF, L-methylfolate and L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate and (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and (6S)-5-MTHF) {{is the primary}} biologically active form of folate used at the {{cellular}} level for DNA reproduction, the cysteine cycle and the regulation of homocysteine. It is also the form found in circulation and transported across membranes into tissues and across the blood-brain barrier. In the cell, L-methylfolate {{is used in the}} methylation of homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is the immediate acceptor of one carbon units for the synthesis of thymidine-DNA, purines (RNA and DNA) and methionine. The un-methylated form, folic acid (vitamin B9), is a synthetic form of folate, and must undergo enzymatic reduction by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) to become biologically active.|$|E
