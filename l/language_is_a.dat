5|$|The {{narrative}} {{draws on}} various Romantic literary traditions, {{such as the}} comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, {{such as those of}} Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail.

5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> set of syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{northern}} Afro-Asiatic language {{closely related}} to the Berber and Semitic languages. It has the second longest known history of any language (after Sumerian), having been written from c. 3200BC to the Middle Ages and remaining as a spoken language for longer. The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic. Egyptian writings do not show dialect differences before Coptic, but it was probably spoken in regional dialects around Memphis and later Thebes.|$|E

5|$|Religious <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{philosophical}} problem {{arising from}} the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E

25|$|<b>Language</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> central {{question}} in post-colonial studies. Many post-colonial scholars and writers detail the colonial practice of imposing the colonizer's own native languages onto the peoples they colonized, even forbidding {{the use of}} the colonized people's native tongue. They examine this practice as part of the systematic oppression of imperialism in neocolonial societies, and they investigate its ramifications on the psychological, physical, and cultural well-being of colonized peoples. Within the context of post-colonial studies, <b>language</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> weapon and a site of intense neocolonial conflict.|$|E
