Results on causes indicated a range of “push” factors leading children to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and “pull” factors that keep children <b>living</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Findings also showed a range of internalizing and externalizing mental health symptoms among children <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and within orphanages.
