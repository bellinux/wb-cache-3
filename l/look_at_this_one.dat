Differently from previous studies on the topic (Volpato, Verin, Cardinaletti, 2012), the agent was partly covered, to prevent the child from using an active sentence containing the agent and an object clitic pronoun referring to the patient. We made use of a specific property of passives, that of allowing the agent to be omitted, when unknown. Results show that the amount of passive sentences slowly increases with age (from 11...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolutionary}} theory {{has suggested that}} there are specific bodily traits that humans find attractive when looking for a potential partner. If the aspiration levels of attractiveness were based on personality measures such as self-perceived attractiveness, self-esteem, narcissism and self-perceived mating success then those who score highly in these measures would have higher aspirational levels and rate bodies with sexually dimorphic traits as more attractive. This study aimed to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>this.</b> <b>One</b> hundred and twelve participants, 46 males (M = 22. 57, SD = 3. 00) and 66 females (M= 20. 10 years, SD = 1. 95), rated the attractiveness of 50 3 D scanned images of rotating bodies {{of the opposite sex}} to themselves on a scale from 1 to 10 and completed four questionnaires: self perceived attractiveness, RSES (Rosenberg, 1965), NARQ (Back et al., in press) and self-perceived mating success (Landolt et al., 1995). Using correlations and t-tests, the results show that: stimuli with sexually dimorphic traits did not correlate significantly with attractiveness ratings and those who scored highly on the personality measures did not prefer sexually dimorphic traits significantly more than those who scored low. Whilst traits indicated by {{evolutionary theory}} may have governed ideas of what is attractive in the past, {{the results of this study}} show that at least amongst young people, society's views may have become more diverse.

In the last century, scholars have often <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> theory as <b>one</b> in opposition to that of the study from nature. However, men like van Mander or Agucchi thought, instead, that only Caravaggio’s obsessive naturalism was incompatible with the study of sixteenth century painting. Passages from the Schilder-Boeck from the lives of Dürer and Cornelisz, which depend on Vasari’s Lives, clearly confirm this point. The relation between the theory of the eclecticism and the theory of the selection of the ‘Idea del Bello’ from Nature is somewhat implied in van Mander’s book and would go on to be clarified later in the seventeenth century by Bellori and Malvasia. </p...|$|R
