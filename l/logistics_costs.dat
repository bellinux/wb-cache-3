The objectives of this paper are to study the mangosteen supply chain in eastern Thailand and analyze the <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> structure for mangosteen farmers.

In addition, we found that the <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> structure varies by the size of farms; also, the yield of mangosteens increases as the size of the farm increases. To reduce the <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> and increase the efficiency of logistics operations, mangosteen farmers should reduce non value-added activities and increase the utilization of resources during production, harvest, postharvest, grading, packing, storage and delivery.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we examine how fuel price {{variation}} affects the optimal mix of services in intercity transportation. Towards this end, we make two main contributions. The {{first is the}} development of an analytic total <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> model of intercity transportation, which is sensitive to fuel price and incorporates multiple classes of vehicles serving passengers with differentiated values of time. The second is an empirical investigation of the cost relationship between fuel price and operating cost for intercity transportation vehicles. The analytic total <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> models are combined with the empirical models to gain insights into the impact of fuel price on optimal service mixes in representative corridors. We consider a scheduled intercity transportation corridor on which different classes of intercity transportation vehicles serve passengers with differentiated values of time. In determining optimal service mix, we consider a central planner choosing the vehicles and service frequencies that provide the minimum total <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> for an intercity transportation corridor. The total <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> is the sum of the two main intercity transportation cost components: vehicle operator cost and passenger cost.

The case study {{estimates that the}} <b>logistics</b> <b>cost</b> of corn stover and sweet sorghum stalk to be $ 52. 95 /dry metric ton and $ 52. 64 /dry metric ton, respectively, for the current labor-based biomass logistics system.
