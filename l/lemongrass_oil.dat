40|$|Background: It {{has been}} long {{recognized}} that periodontal diseases are infections of the periodontium, comprising the bacterial etiology, an immune response, and tissue destruction. Treatment strategies aiming primarily at suppressing or eliminating specific periodontal pathogens include adjunct use {{of local and}} systemic antibiotics as part of nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Unwanted side effects and resistance of microorganisms toward antibiotics due to their widespread use have modified the general perception about their efficacy. Research in phytosciences has revealed various medicinal plants offering a new choice of optional antimicrobial therapy. Cymbopogon citratus, Stapf. (lemongrass) is a popular medicinal plant. At a concentration ≤ 2 %, <b>lemongrass</b> essential <b>oil</b> inhibits the growth of several kinds of microorganisms including periodontal pathogens, especially the reference strains Actinomyces naeslundii and Porphyromonas gingivalis, which were resistant to tetracycline hydrochloride. Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of locally delivered 2 % <b>lemongrass</b> essential <b>oil</b> in gel form {{as an adjunct to}} scaling and root planing, as compared to scaling and root planing alone for the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: 2 % <b>Lemongrass</b> essential <b>oil</b> gel was prepared and placed in moderate to deep periodontal pockets after scaling and root planing. Results: Statistically significant reduction in probing depth and gingival index and gain in relative attachment level were noted in the experimental group as compared to the control group at 1 and 3 months. Conclusion: Locally delivered 2 % <b>lemongrass</b> essential <b>oil</b> gel offers a new choice of safe and effective adjunct to scaling and root planing in periodontal therapy...|$|R

50|$|Coatings are {{sometimes}} applied to copper. Clear coatings preserve the natural color, warmth, and metallic tone of copper alloys. Oils exclude moisture from copper roofs and flashings and simultaneously enhance their appearance by bringing out a rich luster {{and depth of}} color. The most popular oils are lemon oil, U.S.P., <b>lemongrass</b> <b>oil,</b> Native E.I., paraffin oils, linseed oil, and castor oil. On copper roofing or flashing, reapplication once every three years can effectively retard patina formation. In arid climates, the maximum span between oilings may be extended up to five years. Opaque paint coatings are primarily applied over copper when substrate integrity and longevity are desired but a specific color other than the naturally occurring copper hues is required. Lead-coated copper coatings are used when the appearance of exposed lead is desired or where water runoff from uncoated copper alloys would ordinarily stain lighter-colored building materials, such as marble, limestone, stucco, mortar, or concrete. Zinc-tin coatings are an alternative to lead coatings since they have approximately the same appearance and workability.|$|E

The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) founded were: 7. 81 μL/mL (S. aureus) and 3. 90 μL/mL (E. coli and P. aeruginosa), for C. nardus essential oil; and 3. 90 μL/mL (S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa), for C. citratus essential oil. The essential oils used were shown as promising natural antibacterials for pathogenic bacteria control in the food industry...|$|R
