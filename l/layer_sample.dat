40|$|Si/Nb/Si trilayers {{formed with}} 9. 5 and 1. 3 nm thick niobium layer buried in {{amorphous}} silicon were prepared by magnetron sputtering and studied using XPS depth-profile techniques {{in order to}} investigate the change of Hall coefficient sign with thickness. The analysis of high-resolution (HR) XPS spectra revealed that the thicker <b>layer</b> <b>sample</b> has sharp top interface and metallic phase of niobium, thus holes dominate the transport. In contrast, the analysis indicates that the thinner <b>layer</b> <b>sample</b> has a Nb-rich mixed alloy formation at the top interface. The authors suggest that the main effect leading to a change of sign of the Hall coefficient for the thinner <b>layer</b> <b>sample</b> (which is negative contrary to the positive sign for the thicker <b>layer</b> <b>sample)</b> {{may be related to}} strong boundary scattering enhanced by the presence of silicon ions in the layer close to the interface/s.

40|$|Ultrathin Si/Nb/Si trilayer is an {{excellent}} example of a system for which dimensionality effects, together with other factors like type of a substrate material and growth method, influence strongly its superconducting properties. This study offers some important insights into experimental investigation of density of states of such a system with the aim to identify an electronic structure of the interface as a function of niobium layer thickness. For that, two Si/Nb/Si trilayers with 9. 5 and 1. 3 nm thick niobium layer buried in amorphous silicon were studied using high-resolution (HR) XPS depth-profile techniques. Strong influence of sputtering was observed, which resulted in severe intermixture of Si and Nb atoms. Nevertheless, a sharp top interface and metallic phase of niobium were detected for the thicker <b>layer</b> <b>sample.</b> On the contrary, a Nb-rich mixed alloy at top interface was observed for the thinner <b>layer</b> <b>sample...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{promising}} {{method for}} the elimination of undesired capacitive currents in view of realizing a potentially calibration free coulometric ion detection system is presented. The coulometric cell is composed of a porous polypropylene tube doped with a liquid calcium-selective membrane and a silver/silver chloride wire as an inner electrode, forming a thin <b>layer</b> <b>sample</b> between wire and tubing. The total charge passed through the system during potential controlled electrolysis of the thin <b>layer</b> <b>sample</b> is indeed found to be proportional to the amount of calcium present, but non-Faradaic processes do contribute to the obtained signal. We introduce here a multi-pulse procedure that allows one to perform a second excitation pulse at the same excitation potential after exhaustive ion transfer voltammetry of calcium has taken place. The intercept of the calibration curve after background subtraction is found as 20. 6 ± 0. 6 μC, significantly lower than the value of 54. 1 ± 0. 8 μC for the uncorrected curve. Changes in sample temperature (from 23 °C to 38 °C) did equally not affect the background corrected coulometric readings, supporting that the procedure renders the readout principle more robust...|$|E

The present study assessed the cytotoxicity of different materials, using sample preparation methods that mirror clinical conditions. Composite and bonding resins were used and divided into four groups according to sample preparation method: uncured; directly cured samples, which were cured after being placed on solidified agar; post-cured samples were polymerized before being placed on agar; and “removed unreacted layer” samples had their oxygen-inhibition layer removed after polymerization. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using an agar diffusion test, MTT assay, and confocal microscopy. Uncured samples were the most cytotoxic, while removed unreacted <b>layer</b> <b>samples</b> were the least cytotoxic (p < 0. 05). In the MTT assay, cell viability increased significantly in every group as the concentration of the extracts decreased (p < 0. 05). Extracts from post-cured and removed unreacted <b>layer</b> <b>samples</b> of bonding resin were less toxic than post-cured and removed unreacted <b>layer</b> <b>samples</b> of composite resin. Removal of the oxygen-inhibition layer resulted in the lowest cytotoxicity.

Alternate layer structures, in which each siloxane copolymer is co-deposited with a monomeric eicosylamine, have been prepared in order to measure their static pyroelectric coefficients. The magnitude of the coefficient increases as the length of the aliphatic acid side-chain is reduced. The thickness dependence of the coefficient has also been characterised for one of the copolysiloxane derivatives and shows that the pyroelectric effect is greatest for a 25 <b>layer</b> <b>sample</b> (13 layers of copolysiloxane 8 / 12 layers of eicosylamine) ...|$|E
