25|$|Six of the Cázares men, Rodolfo Cázares Garza, Manuel Alberto Cázares Garza, Héctor Cázares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio Cázares Solís, Rubén Luna Mendoza, and Rodolfo Garza Solís, {{were kept}} together. The women and children, {{along with one}} of the grandfathers, were kept in a {{separate}} vehicle throughout most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers drove several of the vehicles they took from the family's homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men were drinking and smoking cannabis. The windows in this disclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises and the victims were transported to another location in another SUV (while in the vehicle, the family was blindfolded and placed next to a corpse). The Cázares had the impression that they kidnappers were looking where to hide their victims. The family believes that the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to find a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> houses where they carried out the abductions.|$|E
500|$|After Neil Young {{played a}} few concerts with Pearl Jam and {{recorded}} the album Mirror Ball with them, {{some members of}} the media gave him the title [...] "Godfather of Grunge". This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps—but also his dress and persona. A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "Neurotica was a life changer for me and for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Seattle music community." ...|$|E

[...] "She doesn't do small talk. She {{is never going to}} be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would {{have to be in the}} elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2011, Tom Hanks, who voiced Woody in the Toy Story series, {{implied that}} Toy Story 4 was [...] "in the works," [...] {{although}} it {{had not yet been}} confirmed by the studio. In April 2013, Finding Dory, a sequel to Finding Nemo, was announced for a June 17, 2016, release. In March 2014, The Incredibles 2 and Cars 3 were announced as films in development. In November 2014, Toy Story 4 was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director. In an interview, Lasseter stated that [...] " [...] <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry view us doing sequels as being for the business of it, but for us, it's pure passion...One {{of the things that was}} very important for me as an artist is to continue directing. When I direct, I get to work with the individual artists, with the animators." [...] In August 2015, at the D23 Expo, Lasseter said that the film would focus on the romance between Woody and Bo Peep. Its story will be built on the fact that Bo Peep was absent in Toy Story 3, with Woody and Buzz Lightyear trying to find her and bring her back.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed by a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality {{and it was quite}} hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to {{have been a part of}} a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E

2500|$|On July 12, 2007, President Bush held a {{press conference}} and was asked about his {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence. Bush told reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter?

2500|$|On March 26, 2007, a senatorial aide of Webb, Phillip Thompson, {{was arrested}} for {{carrying}} Webb's loaded pistol {{as he entered the}} Russell Senate Office Building and for carrying unregistered ammunition. The weapon was discovered when Thompson went through an X-ray machine with a briefcase that contained a loaded pistol and two additional loaded magazines. Charges against the aide were dismissed after prosecutors concluded it could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Thompson was aware that the gun and ammunition were in the briefcase. Webb responded to his aide's arrest by reiterating his support for gun-owners' rights:"I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment; I have had a permit to carry a weapon in Virginia for a long time; I believe that it's important; it's important to me personally and to a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> situation that I'm in to be able to defend myself and my family." ...|$|E

Sperlich {{characterizes the}} {{linguist}} and activist as [...] "one {{of the most}} notable contemporary champions of the people", while journalist John Pilger described him as a [...] "genuine people's hero; an inspiration for struggles {{all over the world}} for that basic decency known as freedom. To a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> margins – activists and movements – he's unfailingly supportive." [...] Arundhati Roy called him [...] "one of the greatest, most radical public thinkers of our time", and Edward Said thought him to be [...] "one of the most significant challengers of unjust power and delusions". Fred Halliday stated that by the start of the 21st century, Chomsky had become a [...] "guru" [...] for the world's anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist movements. The propaganda model of media criticism that he and Herman developed has been widely accepted in radical media critiques and adopted to some level in mainstream criticism of the media, also exerting a significant influence on the growth of alternative media, including radio, publishers, and the Internet, which in turn have helped to disseminate his work.|$|E
