50|$|During the Anglo-Russian {{invasion}} of Holland in 1799, Cornelis Krayenhoff protected the capital by erecting the Linie van Noord-Holland ("North Holland Line"). He flooded the lower-lying areas between Monnickendam and Krommeniedijk, and protected the higher situated areas using earthen walls and field artillery. A year later, Krayenhoff oversaw {{the construction of}} a second defensive line, west of Amsterdam, the Linie van Beverwijk ("Beverwijk Line"), consisting of three lines of <b>lunettes.</b> The <b>lunettes</b> were spaced at a distance of 400 metres from each other. Ten of these <b>lunettes</b> still remain.|$|R

5|$|They are an {{essential}} part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the Creation of Adam. Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel <b>lunette</b> are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab <b>lunette,</b> but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the <b>lunette</b> of Jesse.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{took over}} Malta in 1800, the lines {{remained}} a functional military establishment. A number of minor alterations were made, including the enlargement of Porte des Bombes, {{the demolition of}} a <b>lunette</b> and some other gates, {{and the addition of}} gunpowder magazines and traverses.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} Fort Tigné was mainly {{based on the}} <b>Lunette</b> d'Arçon, {{as well as the}} work of Marc René, marquis de Montalembert. The final design by Antoine Étienne de Tousard {{resulted}} in a revolutionary fortification, which made it one of the oldest polygonal forts in the world.|$|E
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three <b>lunette</b> windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, the house had its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller <b>lunette</b> windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on {{a small portion of the}} Eleazar and Matthan <b>lunette.</b>|$|E

Carr's men achieved a small breakthrough at the 2nd Texas <b>Lunette</b> and requested reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The main façade is {{topped by}} a simple wooden raking cornice that surmounts an {{ornamental}} corbel brick pendant. A semicircular fanlight, or <b>lunette,</b> {{is located in the}} center of the gable of the building's main façade, providing lighting to the building's attic. Chambers described this window as the most antiquated of the building's architectural elements and may have been based on the fanlight of the county's earlier courthouse built in 1833, which was located to the building's east.|$|E
5|$|The {{space between}} the large {{fortification}}s was covered {{by a series of}} smaller redans (chevron-shaped forts) and barkans (trapezoidal forts). The strongest fortification in the outer line of defences was Fort 56 in the suburb of Wola, built around the St Lawrence's Church. It was supported by <b>Lunette</b> 57 in front of it, and two forts (54 and 55) to the south of it. The headquarters was in Fort 73 between Rakowiec and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a <b>lunette</b> and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular spandrels filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E
5|$|St. Helen and St. Anthony Bastions {{are located}} on the seaward side, facing Valletta. They {{originally}} had echaugettes and gunpowder magazines, but the echaugettes on both bastions were dismantled in the 19th century, and the magazine on St. Anthony Bastion was demolished {{to make way for}} three QF 12-pounder gun emplacements. The magazine on St. Helen Bastion is still intact. The curtain wall linking these two bastions contains the main gate, which is protected by a <b>lunette</b> known as the Couvre Porte.|$|E
5|$|The fort is {{designed}} as a defensible battery, rather than a defensive strongpoint. The faces of the fort join to form a half-moon shape or <b>lunette.</b> The guns' primary role was to defend Port Adelaide and the Semaphore anchorage rather than the fort itself, and the design reflects this. It {{was intended to be}} supported by field artillery, cavalry and infantry for self-defence and to repel landings. While the fort retains its original form, the ditch and glacis (embankment) have been modified and are largely non-existent in some areas. Ground levels have been changed to accommodate paths and a caravan park, and the original western fence no longer exists.|$|E

50|$|He also frescoed, with {{numerous}} aids, the two boxes above the portals, the second bezel With the Garden of the Hesperides {{and the space}} between the <b>lunettes</b> and the windows and the <b>lunettes.</b> The elaborate and fantastic compositions with floral, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures are typical of the taste for the whim that is typical of the time.|$|R
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the <b>Lunette</b> d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to mount a single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E
5|$|The British {{proposed}} {{the demolition of}} the fortifications {{a number of times}} in the 19th century. The first proposal was made by Major-General Henry Pigot {{at the beginning of the}} century. In 1853, a proposal was made to demolish Saint James Cavalier to make way for a military hospital. In 1855, Sir John Lysaght Pennefather {{proposed the}} construction of a citadel on the high ground of the Sciberras peninsula, on the site of the Valletta Land Front and the surrounding area. In 1872, the demolition of the city's outworks was proposed, while the demolition of the entire land front was suggested in 1882. Eventually, the fortifications were left largely intact, and the only part that was demolished was St. Madeleine's <b>Lunette,</b> which was located near the entrance to the city (on the site now occupied by the Triton Fountain).|$|E
5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the <b>lunette</b> shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E
50|$|The term is usefully {{employed}} {{to describe the}} section of interior wall between the curves of a vault and its springing line. A system of intersecting vaults produces <b>lunettes</b> on the wall surfaces above a cornice. The <b>lunettes</b> {{in the structure of}} the Sistine Chapel inspired Michelangelo to come up with inventive compositions for the spaces.|$|R
