Sister Jude knows her to be the Angel of Death, but {{questions}} her about why she has appeared now, instead of the many other times when she attempted suicide: the night her husband left her after she {{told him he had}} infected her with syphilis, leaving her barren, or the night she committed the hit-and-run. Shachath tells her that the other times, she still had hope and purpose, but now she is willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one <b>last</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>She</b> visits the parents of the girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She is intent on telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that she had in fact survived the accident. Sister Jude is stunned and the parents recount that they never learned who was responsible, but have made peace with it.|$|E

In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|Later {{that year}} the serial {{included}} a storyline which was branded [...] "bizarre" [...] after it mirrored {{a real life}} scandal that had occurred weeks earlier. Lewis who plays love interest Geoff had been {{caught up in a}} sex tape scandal which leaked onto the internet, the serial decided to include Nicole making a sex tape with Trey Palmer (Luke Bracey) and having it leaked. Trey filmed without Nicole's consent, when she found out the truth she ended their relationship. Trey thought she and Geoff were getting back together so aired the tape at a local film festival to gain revenge. James described Nicole's state of mind adding, [...] "She's quite vulnerable at the moment, with her dad, Roman, in prison. She's relying on Trey, so this is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> needs." ...|$|E

500|$|... is {{the only}} female ninja in Akatsuki. As such, Kishimoto {{originally}} wanted her to have an obscene appearance showing more of her bust. Being the partner of Pain, Konan was also a pupil under Jiraiya after she was orphaned as a child by one of Amegakure's many wars and forced to fend for herself. Because she serves under Pain, she is referred to by villagers of Amegakure as [...] "God's angel". While under Jiraiya, Konan learned {{to take advantage of}} her natural talent with origami, using it as a key component in her battle style. Konan can divide her body into countless sheets of paper, which she controls and reshapes remotely to scout out an area, form weapons for attack, or create wings that mirror her title. While Konan's abilities are restricted when the paper is wet, since paper will cling to itself and lose its stiffness, she is able to use this weakness to her advantage as she implements explosive tags into her paper clones. After Nagato's death, Konan withdraws her position in Akatsuki and proclaims loyalty to Naruto. Later, she is confronted by Obito over the location of Nagato's Rinnegan eyes. She fights him in a suicide assault, though is killed after being forced to reveal Nagato's resting place. [...] The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> sees the endless rain of Amegakure stop for the first time. In the Japanese anime, Konan is voiced by Atsuko Tanaka and in the English anime, her voice actress is Dorothy Elias-Fahn.|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} {{illustrated}} by Fiona Staples, who was introduced to Vaughan by their mutual friend, writer Steve Niles, with whom Staples worked on Mystery Society. Vaughan, who did not meet Staples in person until just before their panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, explained his selection of Staples by describing his reaction upon first seeing her work, saying [...] "Her artwork is incredible. [...] doesn't look like anyone else. She is very unique. When I opened up this file I was like, 'This is going to work! Staples is co-owner of Saga and was given first billing {{on the cover of}} issue 31. In addition to designing all the characters, vehicles and alien races in the story, she provides painted covers and hand-letters Hazel's narration using her own handwriting, which is the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> does after finishing the artwork on a page. Staples renders the characters in a pen-and-ink style line while using all-color settings inspired by video games and Japanese animation. At the 2012 Image Expo, Staples described the process by which she produces her art as harkening back to animation cels, in which emphasis is placed on figures and backgrounds. Vaughan has stated that Staple's style has influenced the direction of the story. The character Ghüs, for example is entirely Staples' creation. Another example is the organic forms of most of the series' technology, such as the main characters' wooden rocket ship, which is derived from Staples' dislike of drawing mechanical objects. To design the series' various planetary settings, Staples looks to the real world for inspiration and then exaggerates some elements of them. Some rooms on the planet Cleave, for example, were inspired by Cambodian architecture.|$|E

In a dream he hears his wife tell him that although he killed {{his family and friends}} to see her, he still has to kill the doctor ("'The doctor has to go,' was the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> said as I felt my body back in bed. But then I guess it's always been his job to fix this.") ...|$|R

On day when she was going away she said, 'Now, my dears, don't let baby fall out of window, don't play with the matches, and don't put beans up your noses.' Now the children had never dreamed of doing that <b>last</b> <b>thing,</b> but <b>she</b> put it into their heads, and the minute she was gone, they ran and stuffed their naughty little noses full of beans, just to see how it felt, and she found them all crying when she came home." ...|$|R
5000|$|Five {{years later}} the narrator, visiting a hospital, meets Domna Platonovna, {{who is now a}} nurse. She is out of her 'business', looks shabby and is on the brink of madness. It turns out that she'd fallen in love with a 21-year-old man (currently in jail for some petty crime) and gave him all of her property. She spends the next month praying, asking God to relieve her from this horrible disease, 'love'; then dies, from what seems to be [...] "life force extinction." [...] Before her death she gives the narrator the <b>last</b> two <b>things</b> <b>she's</b> been left with, her pillow and a can of jam, to be sent to her jailed sweetheart.|$|R
2500|$|On Ashley's {{first day}} of college, {{investigators}} came to her school to question her about her father's death and to inform {{her that he had}} been poisoned instead of having died of a heart attack. An upset Ashley called Castor. Soon after, she says that Castor invited her to come to the family home in Weedsport and drink together. Castor said that they had been through enough emotional stress and needed to relax. Ashley agreed because Castor was not only her mother but her [...] "best friend". The following day, Castor invited Ashley to drink together at home again. She says that her mother offered her a [...] "nasty-tasting" [...] drink that she at first refused but eventually drank because she trusted Castor. Seventeen hours later, Ashley was found comatose on her bed by her younger sister Bree Wallace. Castor made the 911 call. Ashley's sister left her side for a moment and when she returned, she found a suicide note beside Ashley. The note appeared to be Ashley's [...] "murder confession", in which she [...] "admits" [...] to having killed her father and stepfather. Castor quickly took the note from the sister and later gave it to the paramedics. Tests revealed that potentially fatal painkillers had been found in Ashley's system, and that she most likely would have died if brought to the hospital just a few minutes later. When Ashley awakened, with police questioning her about the murders and the suicide note found beside her, she said that the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> remembered was her mother making her an alcoholic drink, something she had never done before. She told the officers that she did not write the note and was confused about their questions and accusations.|$|E

60|$|No safe {{opportunity}} of secretly putting the clock right again had occurred, until the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> at night. <b>She</b> had then moved the hands {{back to the}} right time. At the hour of the evening when Mr. Dubourg had called on her mistress, she positively swore that the clock was {{a quarter of an}} hour too fast. It had pointed, as her mistress had declared, to twenty-five minutes to nine--the right time then being, as Mr. Dubourg had asserted, twenty minutes past eight.|$|R
60|$|Lady Honoria, it is {{scarcely}} necessary to say, had little {{idea that she}} was driving her husband to such dangerous and determined councils. She wanted to frighten Geoffrey, not to lose him and all he meant to her; this was the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> would wish to do. She did not greatly care about the Beatrice incident, but her shrewd common sense told her that it might well {{be used as an}} engine to ruin them all. Therefore she spoke as she did speak, though in reality matters would have to be bad indeed before she sought the aid of a court of law, where many things concerning herself might come to the light of day which she would prefer to leave in darkness.|$|R
60|$|Talking at this rate, Mrs. Bargrave {{thought that}} a fit was coming upon her, and so placed herself in a chair just before her knees, {{to keep her from}} falling to the ground, if her fits should {{occasion}} it: for the elbow-chair, she thought, would keep her from falling on either side. And to divert Mrs. Veal, as she thought, took hold of her gown-sleeve several times, and commended it. Mrs. Veal told her, it was a scowered silk, and newly made up. But for all this, Mrs. Veal persisted in her request, and told Mrs. Bargrave, she must not deny her: and she would have her tell her brother all their conversation, when she had opportunity. Dear Mrs. Veal, says Mrs. Bargrave, this seems so impertinent, that I cannot tell how to comply with it; and what a mortifying story will our conversation be to a young gentleman? Why, says Mrs. Bargrave, it is much better, methinks to do it yourself. No, says Mrs. Veal, though it seems impertinent to you now, you will see more reason for it hereafter. Mrs. Bargrave then, to satisfy her importunity, was going to fetch a pen and ink; but Mrs. Veal said, Let it alone now, but do it when I am gone; but you must be sure to do it: {{which was one of the}} <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> enjoined her at parting; and so she promised her.|$|R

60|$|When Sally left Detroit on the {{following}} Saturday, accompanied by Fillmore, who was returning to the metropolis {{for a few days}} in order to secure offices and generally make his presence felt along Broadway, her spirits had completely recovered. She felt guiltily that she had been fanciful, even morbid. Naturally men wanted to get on in the world. It was their job. She told herself that she was bound up with Gerald's success, and that the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> of which <b>she</b> ought to complain was the energy he put into efforts of which she as well as he would reap the reward.|$|R
500|$|Hathaway {{prepared}} for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was [...] "put through the wringer" [...] according to Weisberger, who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour. Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was the <b>last</b> nice <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|R

60|$|It {{surprised}} her. It {{amounted to}} a rebuff at the very outset, before she had uttered a word; {{and that was the}} <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>she</b> had expected from Andre-Louis.

60|$|Kenton came heavily {{upon the}} courage of his wife, who was urging forward their {{departure}} with so much energy that he obscurely accused her of being the cause of it, and could only be convinced of her innocence when she offered to give {{the whole thing up}} if he said so. When he would not say so, she carried the affair through to the bitter end, and she did not spare him some, pangs which she perhaps need not have shared with him. But people are seldom man and wife for half their lives without wishing to impart their sufferings as well as their pleasures to each other; and Mrs. Kenton, if she was no worse, was no better than other wives in pressing to her husband's lips the cup that was not altogether sweet to her own. She went about the house the night before closing it, to see that everything was in a state to be left, and then she came to Kenton in his library, where he had been burning some papers and getting others ready to give in charge to his son, and sat down by his cold hearth with him, and wrung his soul with the tale of the <b>last</b> <b>things</b> <b>she</b> had been doing. When she had made him bear it all, she began to turn the bright side of the affair to him. She praised the sense and strength of Ellen, in the course the girl had taken with herself, and asked him if he, really thought they could have done less for her than they were doing. She reminded him that they were not running away from the fellow, as she had once thought they must, but Ellen was renouncing him, and putting him out of her sight till she could put him out of her mind. She did not pretend that the girl had done this yet; but it was everything that she wished to do it, {{and saw that it was}} best. Then she kissed him on his gray head, and left him alone to the first ecstasy of his homesickness.|$|R
40|$|When someone takes {{a bite of}} {{a chicken}} filet sandwich, the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he or <b>she</b> {{wants to do is}} to bite down a piece of bone in the meat. That is also the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> the food {{industry}} wants. Because there is an increase of demand for larger sortments of food products there was a need for automation of the processes involved in the preparation of the meat, fish or other food products. Using this kind of automation systems for processing the food, a higher production capacity is obtained than using manual prelucration of the food products. One of the most important processes is de debonning one. Many fast and automated systems have been developed and are being used in the food industry to separate the meat and bones [Elsten, 1991], [Hazenbroek, 1991], [Jones et al., 1999], [Heidke et al., 1999], [Wols, 2000]. During the automated meat processing stage, foreign bodies can remain in the meat. At a later stage the meat has to be inspected and the foreign bodies removed. With the deboning process there is the same problem. The speed with which the meat is deboned is direct proportional with the amount of fragments of bone...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Superintendent {{proved to}} be a little too sharp with Penelope at starting. [...] "Now, young woman, attend to me, and mind you speak the truth." [...] Penelope fired up instantly. [...] "I've never been taught to tell lies Mr. Policeman!--and if father can stand there and hear me accused of {{falsehood}} and thieving, and my own bed-room shut against me, and my character taken away, which is all a poor girl has left, he's not the good father I take him for!"

50|$|Shingo is {{the insane}} brother of Akiko Kiryu. They lived {{together}} in the Kiryu Manor shortly before the Russo-Japanese War. Yuta worked there temporarily and saw Shingo's cruel and sadistic behavior firsthand. Akiko tried to prevent her brother from hurting anymore people by poisoning him. She did not realize though that the poison was actually the flesh of a mermaid. Shingo seemed to die after eating it, but {{he was able to}} dig himself out of his grave and return home. His father was so upset to see him that he tried to kill him again, but that failed as well. Because of Shingo's insanity, he was kept in a cell {{in the basement of the}} Kiryu home. Once he was released, he ripped the eye out of his sisters corpse and fled. Because it is his sisters eye, every time he murders someone he sees the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>she</b> saw, his own twisted face reaching down to rip her eye out. Shingo believes that by killing his sister he can finally make the visions stop, so he continually harasses the elderly women who now live in his home. After a battle with Yuta, Yuta decapitated Akiko, then attempted to do the same with Shingo. After Shingo suffered another vision, he came to realize he would forever be tormented by his sister's last sight, and he took Yuta's sword and decapitated himself.|$|R
