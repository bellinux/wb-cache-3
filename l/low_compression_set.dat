40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{the effect}} of {{hydroxyl-terminated}} polybutadiene (HTPB) on processability, mechanical properties, thermal aging and oil resistance of 80 / 20 ethylene-propylene diene rubber/epoxidized natural rubber (EPDM/ENR) blend was investigated. The amount of HTPB used was varied from 0 - 4 parts per hundred of rubber (phr). The results revealed that addition of HTPB into EPDM/ENR blend decreased the compound viscosity, while scorch time and cure time slightly increased with increasing HTPB content. Furthermore, hardness, tensile and tear strengths of the blend decreased due to the poor dispersion of fillers {{in the presence of}} HTPB. After thermal aging treatment, the crosslink density of all EPDM/ENR blends increased leading to increasing in 100 % modulus, tensile strength and swelling resistance, as well as reducing in elongation at break. However, it had additional plus features that high resilience with <b>low</b> <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> was achieved in the blend containing 2 phr of HTPB...|$|E

40|$|A {{universal}} docking and berthing {{system is}} being developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to support all future space exploration missions to low-Earth orbit (LEO), to the Moon, and to Mars. The Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) is being designed to operate using a seal-on-seal configuration in numerous space environments, each having unique exposures to temperature, solar radiation, reactive elements, debris, and mission duration. As the LIDS seal {{is likely to be}} manufactured from an elastomeric material, performance evaluation of elastomers after exposure to atomic oxygen (AO) and ultraviolet radiation (UV) was conducted, of which the work presented herein was a part. Each of the three candidate silicone elastomer compounds investigated, including Esterline ELA-SA- 401, and Parker Hannifin S 0383 - 70 and S 0899 - 50, was characterized as a low outgassing compound, per ASTM E 595, having percent total mass loss (TML) less than 1. 0 percent and collected volatile condensable materials (CVCM) less than 0. 1 percent. Each compound was compatible with the LIDS operating environment of - 50 to 50 C. The seal characteristics presented include <b>compression</b> <b>set,</b> elastomer-to-elastomer adhesion, and o-ring leakage rate. The ELA-SA- 401 compound had the <b>lowest</b> variation in <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> with temperature. The S 0383 - 70 compound exhibited the <b>lowest</b> <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> after exposure to AO and UV. The adhesion for all of the compounds was significantly reduced after exposure to AO and was further decreased after exposure to AO and UV. The leakage rates of o-ring specimens showed modest increases after exposure to AO. The leakage rates after exposure to AO and UV were increased by factors of up to 600 when compared to specimens in the as-received condition...|$|R
40|$|Two novel {{thermoplastic}} {{polyester elastomer}} (TPEE) were developed. One is an alloy of TPEE and SBC (styrene block copolymer). It exhibits a <b>low</b> <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> (Cs), high softness and high adhesiveness to PS (polystyrene), ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer), PC (polycarbonate), etc. Adhesion after double injection is extremely stable and durable. By these alloys, many new superimposed products {{can be produced}} easily with double injection. The other is TPEE modified by the grafting of an acid-anhydride group. It bonds polyester to PA (polyamide) or EVOH (ethylene vinylalcohol copolymer) with sufficient adhesion even at elevated temperatures (80 – 120 C). These properties {{have been used to}} create many new multi-layer products. This modified TPEE also improves properties of PA or EVOH, such as pinhole resistance.

40|$|Segmented blockcopolymers {{based on}} poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) soft {{segments}} and uniform crystallisable tetra-amide segments (TxTxT) are made via polycondensation. The PTMO soft segments, with a molecular weight of 1000 g/mol, are extended with terephthalic groups to a molecular weight of 6000 g/mol. The crystallisable segment is uniform of length {{and is based}} on a tetra-amide with terephthalamide groups. The length of the aliphatic diamine (x) in the tetra-amide segment is varied from x= 2 to 8. The thermal properties of the blockcopolymers were studied with dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Due to the use of uniform TxTxT segments a fast and almost complete crystallization of the hard segments is obtained. The melting temperature of the blockpolymers increases with decreasing diamine length and the well-known odd–even effect is observed.

40|$|The {{influence}} of modifying of elastomer compositions based on nitrile rubber {{in the medium}} of low molecular weight polyethylene oxide on resistance of rubbers to liquid aggressive mediawas studied. Standard hydrocarbon oils – oil ASTM № 1 and ASTM № 3, having a constant chemical composition and properties, were used as aggressive fluids. Resistance of elastomer compositions to standard oil was evaluated by change in weight, volume and relative compression set after keeping the samples in these oils at elevated temperatures. The {{influence of}} aggressive environment {{on the degree of}} swelling and the value of compression set of compositions modified in polyethylene oxides medium was established. It has been shown that the mass/volume of modified rubbers during aging in oil ASTM № 1 reduced to a lesser degree compared to unmodified samples, which is probably due to the influence of low molecular weight polyethylene oxides for the formation of vulcanizates structure. At the same time exposure to oil ASTM № 3 of elastomer compositions increases the degree of swelling of modified rubber more than unmodified, which can be due to destruction by the action of aggressive medium additional intermolecular bonds between macromolecules of polyethylene oxide and rubber, resulting in increased flexibility of the elastomeric matrix segments. It revealed that modification of rubbers in low molecular weightpolyethylene oxides facilitates preparation of rubber with <b>low</b> <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> after aging in standard oils at elevated temperatures...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stacks require sealing {{around the perimeter of}} the cells to prevent the gases inside the cell from leaking. Elastomeric materials are commonly used for this purpose. The overall performance and durability of the fuel cell is heavily dependent on the long-term stability of the gasket. In this study, the degradation of three elastomeric gasket materials (silicone rubber, commercial EPDM and a developed EPDM 2 compound) in an accelerated ageing environment was investigated. The change in properties and structure of a silicone rubber gasket caused by use in a real fuel cell was studied and compared to the changes in the same silicone rubber gasket material brought about by accelerated aging. The accelerated aging conditions were chosen to relate to the PEM fuel cell environment, but with more extreme conditions of elevated temperature (140 °C) and greater acidity. Three accelerated ageing media were used. The first one was dilute sulphuric acid solution with the pH values of 1, 2 and 4. Secondly, Nafion ® membrane suspended in water was used for accelerated ageing at a pH 3 to 4. Finally, diluted trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) solution of pH 3. 3 was chosen. Weight change and the tensile properties of the aged gasket samples were measured. In addition, compression set behaviour of the elastomeric seal materials was investigated in order to evaluate their potential sealing performance in PEM fuel cells. The results showed that acid hydrolysis was the most likely mechanism of silicone rubber degradation and that similar degradation occurred under both real fuel cell and accelerated aging conditions. The effect of TFA solution on silicone rubber was more aggressive than sulphuric acid and Nafion® solutions with the same acidity (pH value) suggesting that TFA accelerated the acid hydrolysis of silicone rubber. In addition, acid ageing in all three acidic solutions caused visible surface damage and a significant decrease in tensile strength of the silicone rubber material, but did not significantly affect the EPDM materials. EPDM 2 compound had a desirable (<b>low)</b> <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> value which was similar to silicone rubber and much better than the commercial EPDM.

40|$|Background: Aseptic {{loosening}} [AL] of cementless implants {{is causing}} approximately 60 % of total knee and {{total hip arthroplasty}} revisions. AL is caused among other factors by micromotion. The {{result is that the}} bone around the prosthesis is replaced by a fibrous membrane. This fibrous membrane allows for more micromotion and we thus enter a vicious circle of loosening. In-vivo research for treatments of AL and research into preventing AL is rare. When in vivo research is conducted, this is commonly done in large animals such as sheep and dogs. To bring down costs and increase reproducibility it is desired to recreate the fibrous membrane in a smaller animal. Therefore, an unstable knee hemiprosthesis was designed for the femur of the Wistar rat. Methods: First a test was conducted on cadaverous adult male Wistar rat femurs to assess whether it was easier to access the medullary canal of the femur from the hip or the knee side. Then, a second test was conducted on cadaverous rat femurs (n= 8) to assess the depth and width to which we could implant a cylindrical prosthesis. The third set of tests was to see if the conceptual unstable prosthesis allowed micromotion of 200 μm. Miniature silicone rubber and polyurethane resin [PUR(r) ] springs were tested and a mock implantation in bone surrogate was conducted. Results: The results obtained from the first test show that it is easier to access the medullary canal of the femur from the knee side. The straight canal of the distal femur was also found to be more suitable to allow for micromotion than the curved canal of the proximal femur. The second test showed that we could implant a cylinder with a diameter of 2. 3 mm and a length of 2. 3 cm in the femoral canal. The third test showed that the conceptual prosthesis allowed for micromotion, but the spring’s material needs to be optimized. PUR(r) ’s creep and compression set were too high. Silicone showed the most potential, because of its <b>low</b> <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> (permanent compressive deformation). However, the stiffness of the silicone needs to be increased and it showed high wear during fatigue testing with respect to the PUR(r). Conclusion: The conceptual prosthesis showed promise, but improvements on the spring material are necessary. The silicone can be made stiffer and altering the design can also increase the stiffness of the prosthesis. A flaw in the conceptual design is that micromotion is restricted in vivo, because the femoral prosthesis is abutted by the distal cortical bone. A change {{in the design of the}} prosthesis can remedy this problem. Another remaining challenge is to design a prosthesis which allows for localized application of wear debris particles and treatment solutions in the peri-prosthetic tissue, fully simulating the circumstances that occur during AL.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} development of novel methods and techniques to measure the mechanical properties of very low density polymer cellular solids (foams) particularly their response to dynamic impact. Two foams are extensively studied; Zotefoams Nylon based ZOTEK N BSD and N A 30 with nominal densities of 50 and 30 kg/m 3 respectively. This work has developed a verified adaptation of the traditional Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar. This method no longer uses a stress pressure pulse to load the sample. This has greatly simplified and eliminated many of the technical problems presented by the SHPB method for <b>low</b> stiffness/density foams. <b>Compression</b> <b>set</b> (fixed strain) were undertaken on these foams at various temperatures (- 5 °C to 90 °C) and the foam recovery monitored over time periods in excess of those dictated by standard methods. This data produced a strong log relationship of strain recovery {{as a function of}} time. This recovery dependency was also found to be a function of temperature. Based on the results, it was possible to fit the data to produce a useful surface fitted, constitutive equation that described <b>compression</b> <b>set</b> as a function of both initial compressive strain and temperature. Visual observation during compressive tests showed that lateral expansion 01 the materials was non zero. A novel method was developed to determine Poisson's ratio as a function of compressive strain. For N BSD and N A 30 Poisson's ratio was found to be less than 0. 014 and to be dependent on the compressive strain. Unusual behaviour was observed during tensile tests for N A 30 as a function of temperature. The results indicated that over the strain range 0. 01 - 0. 10 the modulus of elasticity is not a constant and increased. This behaviour is very unusual and believed to be a result of the base polymer being a blend of two polymers. Compressive tests showed that for low density foams the supporting gas pressure has a dominating effect on the stress strain behaviour of the materials. During heating, proportionally, the change in gas pressure within the foam effects the stress strain curve {{to such an extent that}} this affect must be included in the Nagy and William Landel Ferry constitutive equations...|$|R
