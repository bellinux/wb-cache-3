50|$|The {{church is}} medieval but {{seems to have}} been subject to {{additions}} over a long period. The Tower shows three separate periods of construction. The <b>lowest</b> <b>section</b> is 13th century, the middle section is 14th century and the top is 15th century.|$|R

40|$|Serial section Microscopy is an {{established}} method for volu-metric anatomy reconstruction. <b>Section</b> <b>series</b> imaged with Electron Microscopy are currently vital for the reconstruc-tion of the synaptic connectivity of entire animal brains {{such as that}} of Drosophila melanogaster. The process of remov-ing ultrathin layers from a solid block containing the speci-men, however, is a fragile procedure and has limited preci-sion with respect to section thickness. We have developed a method to estimate the relative z-position of each individ-ual section as a function of signal change across the <b>section</b> <b>series.</b> First experiments show promising results on both se-rial section Transmission Electron Microscopy (ssTEM) data and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) series. We made our solution available as Open Source plugins for the TrakEM 2 software and the ImageJ distributio...|$|R

50|$|The {{reminiscent}} fast section begins againthis time in {{a different}} key, with an altered melody. This section is far less angry, but houses {{a different sort of}} velocity, the emphasis on the <b>low</b> <b>sections</b> of the band as opposed to the higher sections the first time.|$|R
