40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{fundamental}} trade-off between information transfer and power gain {{by means of}} an information-theoretic framework in communications cir-cuits. This analysis is of interest as many of today’s applications require that maximum information and maximum signal power are extracted (or transferred) through the circuit at the same time for further processing so that a compromise concerning the signal spectral shape as well as the matching network has to be found. To this end, the optimization framework is applied to a two-port circuit, which is used as an abstraction for a broadband amplifier. Thereby, we characterize the involved Pareto bound by considering different optimization problems. The first one aims at optimizing the input power spectral density (PSD) as well as the source and <b>load</b> <b>admittances,</b> whereas the second approach assumes the PSD to be fixed and uniformly distributed within a fixed bandwidth and optimizes the source and <b>load</b> <b>admittances</b> only.

30|$|Voltage {{stability}} has {{the system}} {{ability to maintain}} voltage so that both power and voltage are controllable when the <b>load</b> <b>admittance</b> increases or load power increases [20]. The lack of adequate real and reactive power resources during system heavy load conditions and severe system contingencies has been recognized as {{a major factor in}} a voltage collapse process. Voltage collapse is a dynamic and normally large disturbance phenomenon [1]. System voltage collapses when one bus reaches its collapse point [21]. When a failure occurs in a power system, the impedance X of the equivalent generator from a bus will change, and the maximum real and reactive power supplied by the system will also be affected. Therefore, system voltage collapse point will also change. The large area blackouts are initialized by the voltage collapse at one or more buses during a system failure. Therefore, it is a basic reliability requirement to prevent the system from the voltage collapse point under various operating conditions and contingencies through providing sufficient contingency real and reactive power reserves and curtailing the real and reactive power load in the worst scenarios.|$|E
40|$|This paper first derives a usable formula {{based on}} the {{parallel}} R, L, C load and the conclusions from frequency shift islanding detection methods in current literature: the angle by which the total output current of the distributed resources (DR) units leads the {{point of common coupling}} (PCC) voltage must be conducted to have the same shifting direction as the <b>load</b> <b>admittance</b> angle during the variation of the frequency. On the basis of the formula and multi-DR operation, the scenarios in which the classic frequency shift methods are applied to energy storage converters are analyzed. The results indicate that the setting of the angle by which the energy storage converter current leads the PCC voltage may need to be modified when running state changes. It results in the problems that the classic methods are not applicable for non-UPF (unity power factor) control and have to distinguish between generation mode and consumption mode for UPF control. On account of the problems, a coping strategy, i. e. an improved method, is proposed. The analyses indicate that the improved method is applicable in every state.

40|$|Voltage {{instability}} is {{a phenomenon}} which often contributes {{to the development of}} power system disturbances. While increasing <b>load</b> <b>admittance,</b> bus voltage decreases {{to such a degree that}} the apparent power (V^ 2 Y) does not increase. As a result, voltage collapses with all consequences resulting from it. During the large-scale power system disturbance, the last line of defense is the load shedding at the stations, where the stability margin becomes dangerously low. To do that, there is a need to use automatic devices which process local signals, detect the decreased margin, and activate the load shedding. As a criteria of operating such devices, the voltage level is adopted. The disadvantage of such an approach results from the fact that the relations between the voltage level and the stability limit depend very much on the load power factor. To overcome this weakness, this paper presents a criterion which is directly based on the definition of voltage stability. It calculates the derivative of apparent power against the admittance (dS/dY). It may be easily accomplished, because both the power and the admittance are measurable, and the changes of load occurs continuously, as a result of switching on and off the impedances, and/or actions of the transformer on load tap-changing devices...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a published counterpart {{to the address}} of the same title at the 2010 SAE World Congress. A vehicle on the road encounters an unsteady flow due to turbulence in the natural wind, due to the unsteady wakes of other vehicles {{and as a result of}} traversing through the stationary wakes of road side obstacles. This last term is of greatest significance. Various works related to the characterization, simulation and effects of on-road turbulence are compared together on the turbulence spectrum to highlight differences and similarities. The different works involve different geometries and different approaches to simulating cross wind transients but together these works provide guidance on the most important aspects of the unsteadiness. On-road transients include a range of length scales spanning several orders of magnitude but the most important scales are in the in the 2 - 20 vehicle length range. There are significant levels of unsteadiness experienced on-road in this region and the corresponding frequencies are high enough that a dynamic test is required to correctly determine the vehicle response. Fluctuations at these scales generate significant unsteady <b>loads</b> (aerodynamic <b>admittance</b> typically 0. 6 - 1. 4) and the corresponding frequencies can adversely affect vehicle dynamics. The generation of scales larger than the scale of the vehicle is impractical with passive grids and so active turbulence generation systems are preferred. These can be classified into lift and drag-based devices. Lift-based devices provide better control of the turbulence but can only just reproduce the smaller scales in the 2 - 20 vehicle length range. Different moving model approaches are also discussed.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to introduce a neural network based solution for the problem of measuring the actual amount of harmonic current injected into a power network by an individual nonlinear load. Harmonic currents from nonlinear loads propagate through the system and cause harmonic pollution. As a result, voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) is rarely sinusoidal. The IEEE 519 harmonic standard provides customer and utility harmonic limits and many utilities are now requiring their customers to comply with IEEE 519. Measurements of the customer’s current at the PCC are expected to determine the customer’s compliance with IEEE 519. However, results in this research show that the current measurements at the PCC are not always reliable in that determination. In such a case, {{it may be necessary to}} determine what the customer’s true current harmonic distortions would be if the PCC voltage could be a pure sinusoidal voltage. However, establishing a pure sinusoidal voltage at the PCC may not be feasible since that would mean performing utility switching to reduce the system impedance. An alternative approach is to use a neural network that is able to learn the customer’s <b>load</b> <b>admittance.</b> Then, it is possible to predict the customer’s true current harmonic distortions based on mathematically applying a pure sinusoidal voltage to the learned <b>load</b> <b>admittance.</b> The proposed method is called load modeling. Load modeling predicts the true harmonic current that can be attributed to a customer regardless of whether a resonant condition exists on the utility power system. If a corrective action is taken by the customer, another important parameter of interest is the change in the voltage distortion level at the PCC due to the corrective action of the customer. This issue is also addressed by using the dual of the load modeling method. Topologies of the neural networks used in this research include multilayer perceptron neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The theory and implementation of a new neural network topology known as an Echo State Networks is also introduced. The proposed methods are verified on a number of different power electronic test circuits as well as field data. The main advantages of the proposed methods are that only waveforms of voltages and currents are required for their operation and they are applicable to both single and three phase systems. The proposed methods can be integrated into any existing power quality instrument or can be fabricated into a commercial standalone instrument that could be installed in substations of large customer loads, or used as a hand-held clip on instrument.

40|$|A {{practical}} electric {{distribution system}} is a nonlinear network, which is generally governed by {{a large number of}} differential and algebraic equations (DAE). For instance, the ordinary differential equations are defined by the dynamics of the generators (e. g., small-scale hydro generation units) and the loads, as well as distributed generation (DG) units and their controllers. Algebraic equalities are described by the distribution network current balance equations and internal static behaviors of passive devices. In this paper, a rigorous approach is used to convert a semi-explicit DAE system into an explicit ordinary differential equations (ODE) system.

40|$|An {{improvement}} of unbalanced distribution system operation {{is carried out}} by reactive power compensation. The lagging reactive power demand is compensated by allocating a number of three-phase shunt capacitors. At the stage, the compensation devices are determined tentatively in term of number, size and location. The effects of the installed shunt capacitors are then analyzed. The unbalanced condition of distribution system is taken into account {{due to the fact}} that distribution system is inherently imbalance. For three-phase unbalanced power flow analyses, forward-backward propagation algorithm is proposed. The algorithm works directly on the system without any modification.

40|$|Skeletal {{muscles are}} the primary {{actuators}} that power, stabilize and control locomotive and functional motor tasks in biological systems. It {{is well known that}} coordinated action and co-activation of multiple muscles give rise to desirable effects such as enhanced postural and dynamic stability. In this thesis, we study the role of muscle co-activation from an energetics perspective: Are there situations in which antagonist co-activation leads to enhanced power generation, and if so, what is the underlying mechanism? The mechanical energetics of muscles are traditionally characterized in terms of workloop measures where muscles are activated against oscillating, zero-admittance motion sources. We extend these measures to more natural, "mid-range" <b>admittance</b> <b>loads,</b> actuated by multiple muscles. Specifically, we set up the problem of a second-order mechanical system driven by a pair of antagonist muscles. This is the simplest problem where the influences of load dynamics and muscle co-activation on the output energetics may be investigated. To enable experimentation, a muscle testing apparatus capable of real-time servo emulation of the load is developed and utilized for identification and workloop measurements. (cont.) Using this apparatus, an experimentally identified model predicting muscle contractile force is proposed. Experimental data shows that with a simple Weiner structure, the model accounts for 74 % (sigma = 5. 6 %) of the variance in muscle force, that force dependence on contraction velocity is minimal, and that a bilinear approximation of the output nonlinearity is warranted. Based on this model we investigate what electrical stimulation input gives rise to maximal power transfer for a particular load. This question is cast in an optimal control framework. Necessary conditions for optimality are derived and methods for computing solutions are presented. Solutions demonstrate that the optimal stimulation frequencies must include the effects of muscle impedances, and that optimal co-activation levels are indeed modulated to enable a pair of muscles to produce more work synergistically rather than individually. Pilot experimental data supporting these notions is presented. Finally, we interpret these results {{in the context of the}} familiar engineering notion of impedance matching. These results shed new light on the role of antagonist co-activation from an energetics perspective. by Walled A. Farahat. Thesis (Ph. D.)
