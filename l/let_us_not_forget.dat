5|$|This {{bridge is}} {{named in honor}} and remembrance of Charles West Cullen (18651948), a man who {{dedicated}} his life to public service and {{to the citizens of}} Delaware. Between 1930 and 1940, he served on the State Highway Commission, eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938-1939. While he was Chairman, work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet. In recognition for his service on the Commission, the bridge was dedicated on May 28, 1940, in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River. Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time. This, the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway, is also being dedicated in his name. As this bridge serves the public, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the lifetime of service that he gave.|$|E

60|$|My friends, {{these things}} are true; and have been true for centuries. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not</b> try to <b>forget</b> them by denouncing them as the utterances of the malevolent and the unbelieving. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> rather imitate the wise man who said, that he was always {{grateful}} to his critics, for, however unjust their attacks, they were certain to attack, and therefore to show him, his weakest points. And here is our weakest point; namely, in our unhappy divisions--which are the fruits of self-will and self-conceit, and of the vain attempt to do that which God incarnate has told us we cannot do--to part the wheat from the tares.|$|R
6000|$|Scott {{notes that}} the [...] "tone of aigreur," [...] which is more {{distinctly}} felt in the second of these tracts, intimates a [...] "deep dissatisfaction with late ecclesiastical preferments, which may perhaps be traced as much to personal disappointment as to any better cause;" [...] a statement which it was hardly worth making; since, however deep may have been Swift's personal feelings, he never allowed them to be the impelling motive to his work. It should suffice us {{to know that the}} cause which Swift espoused was a disinterested one. As Vicar of Laracor he knew what it was to make a shift of living on an insufficient income; and it may have been, this experience as much as [...] "personal disappointment" [...] which gave pungency to his criticism. It is easy enough to find questionable motives for a satirist, especially when that satirist is Swift; <b>let</b> <b>us</b> <b>not,</b> however, <b>forget</b> that in his case the personal element was never permitted to overweight the impersonal purpose. Other men when they reach prosperity often forget or ignore the hard conditions of their previous state; to Swift these conditions were always existing factors in his considerations for the amelioration of his fellow-men. This it is which gives to his writings so much of the [...] "tone of aigreur." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>us</b> {{strengthen}} {{the hands of}} those in authority over us, and curb our own tongues, remembering that General Wait commonly proves in the end more than a match for General Headlong, and that the Good Book ascribes safety to a multitude, indeed, but not to a mob, of counsellours. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> remember and perpend the words of Paulus Emilius to the people of Rome; that, 'if they judged they could manage the war to more advantage by any other, he would willingly yield up his charge; but if they confided in him, they were not to make themselves his colleagues in his office, or raise reports, or criticise his actions, but, without talking, supply him with means and assistance necessary to the carrying on of the war; for, if they proposed to command their own commander, they would render this expedition more ridiculous than the former.' (Vide Plutarchum in Vitâ P.E.) <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> also <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> what the same excellent authour says concerning Perseus's fear of spending money, and not permit the covetousness of Brother Jonathan to be the good fortune of Jefferson Davis. For my own part, till I am ready to admit the Commander-in-Chief to my pulpit, I shall abstain from planning his battles. If courage be the sword, yet is patience the armour of a nation; and in our desire for peace, <b>let</b> <b>us</b> never be willing to surrender the Constitution bequeathed us by fathers at least as wise as ourselves (even with Jefferson Davis to help us), and, with those degenerate Romans, tuta et præsentia quam vetera et periculosa malle.|$|R
40|$|Advances in 3 D {{computer}} modelling technology have literally opened up doors for CAD designers, {{enabling them to}} take their designs into a whole new dimension. In the universe of 3 D design, solid modelling has become an essential tool in the design world. Within that world, the final design still exists on a 2 D plane showing a top, front, and side orthographic views, as well as isometric views, sections, and details. Ironically, although this method is what is traditionally needed in working (shop) drawings for manufacturing, a 3 D solid model is {{the easiest way to}} achieve the final 2 D drawing. Once in 3 D form, the drawing can be maintained parametrically, even in its 2 D state. Once the model is in a solid form, all types of analyses are available, including mass properties, finite element analysis, fluid analysis, interference analysis and motion analysis, among others. Models generally are not created in a void. Much of the time, each individual model is a component part of a larger assembly. The designer has the ability to work within the assembly to create or modify component parts in much the same manner, as you would work on a fully functioning machine. In this way, designers can test out the functionality of the design as well as produce finished assembly drawings. <b>Let</b> <b>us</b> also <b>not</b> <b>forget</b> the glitz of 3 D design. From a 3 D model you can add materials, textures, lights, shadows and reflections. You have the ability to create a photograph of something, from any viewing angle, exterior or interior, which does not exist in reality. Using a solid modeller is not as difficult as it may first appear. In fact, it is much easier than working with other 3 D interfaces. The design procedures are relatively natural and intuitive to a 3 D designer. The time investment is equal to or less than that of 2 D drafting, but the final pay off is overwhelming. Not only do you have a parametric model with all of the uses described, but also more importantly, you are building a third-generation 3 D database that will serve your company for years to come. This presentation will demonstrate the construction of 3 D computer models using AutoCAD and 3 D Studio Max, showing the benefits of technology, and {{how easy it is to}} use, even in the application of complex features.
