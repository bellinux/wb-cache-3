5|$|Le Guide Culinaire deemphasized the use {{of heavy}} sauces and <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> lighter fumets, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose {{function}} is {{to add to the}} flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Carême, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's Viander, which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of haute cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Thompson still {{wished to}} leave Alaska, however, and in 1915, he sold a {{majority}} share of News-Miner stock on option to O.P. Gaustad, a Republican Party booster. Scandal erupted {{when it was}} revealed that Gaustad was merely a stand-in for James Wickersham, who was Alaska's delegate to Congress. Partially because of the scandal, Gaustad was unable to sell the shares he held an option for, and Thompson returned to Alaska in spring 1916 to reassume his role as publisher. Later that year, Republican interests took over the Fairbanks Times, which had <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the Democratic Party. The new owners of the Times were unable to come up with financing for new equipment, however, and the Times went out of business in October 1916.|$|E
25|$|In the {{few days}} leading up to the operation, Peres and Rabin <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> {{different}} solutions. Rabin took steps to initiate negotiations, seeing no other option. Peres, however, felt that negotiating with terrorists, who were demanding the release of prisoners, would in effect be surrender, and thought a rescue operation should be planned.|$|E
25|$|Each Singaporean's {{behaviours}} {{and attitudes}} are influenced by, among other things, {{his or her}} home language and his religion.

Malay-speaking Singaporeans tend to <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> Malay culture, which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture.|$|R
5000|$|They met November 21, 2010. After {{developing}} {{a crush on}} Grace, Tony asked her to jam when he was between bands, and the [...] "punkgrass" [...] sound that evolved was a natural fusion of their music backgrounds: playing punk rock tunes on acoustic instruments such as guitar, banjo, mandolin, and ukulele. [...] Typically Tony <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> the melodic side of songwriting while Grace <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> the lyrical.|$|R

25|$|Politically, he <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the {{mainstream}} Conservative Party, which had Maiorescu as chief doctrinaire. It {{is probable that}} Bassarabescu began frequenting the Ploiești Conservative chapter in or around 1901, making friends with political boss Temelie Dinescu, and courting his intellectual daughter, Ecaterina Dinescu. From about 1906, he registered formally with the Conservative Party.|$|E
25|$|Graham <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the Republicans {{during the}} {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon whom he had met and befriended as vice president under Dwight Eisenhower.

25|$|In Cairo, Egypt's King Farouk {{asked her}} to sing; she refused because Egypt had not {{recognized}} Free France and remained neutral. However, she offered to sing in Cairo at a celebration of honor for the ties between Free France and Egypt, and asked Farouk to preside, a subtle indication of which side his officially neutral country <b>leaned</b> <b>toward.</b>|$|E
40|$|In Dec. 2008 /Jan. 2009 I {{conducted}} a web-based survey of economists in my native {{country of the}} Czech Republic, and received 182 responses (a response rate of over 25 percent). The survey included 21 policy questions, each anchored in {{the status quo and}} soliciting judgment on whether policy should be liberalized, kept the same, or made more restrictive. Of the 21 issues, on 13 the average judgment <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> liberalization (often dramatically so), on 3 is very close to the status quo, and on 5 <b>leans</b> <b>toward</b> greater restriction (never dramatically so). I create a liberalization score for each respondent and find that a majority <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> liberalization. Comparing Czech economists to American economists, we notice some interesting differences. The paper provides links to the survey instrument (in Czech and in English) and the data. survey,policy views,economists,liberalization,intervention...|$|R

25|$|Western comics have {{included}} serious entries (such as the classic comics {{of the late}} 1940s and early 1950s), cartoons, and parodies (such as Cocco Bill and Lucky Luke). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the Weird West subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in Preacher. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., Jonah Hex and Loveless).|$|E
25|$|Although educated by Presbyterian clergymen, young Madison {{was an avid}} {{reader of}} English deist tracts. As an adult, Madison paid little {{attention}} to religious matters. Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college, some scholars indicate he <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> deism. Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets and formed his outlook on life with a Christian world view.|$|E
25|$|Rabbinic {{authorities}} (poskim) {{historically have}} differed {{about the use}} of a cane, wheelchair, or other similar devices by the less able-bodied. Some have allowed their use even without an eruv and others have not. In recent years, however, the majority of poskim have <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> allowing these devices, since, if they were prohibited, disabled individuals might attempt to leave their homes on Shabbat without the device(s) and therefore risk serious injury.|$|E

25|$|The newspaper's {{editorial}} page is conservative in its political stance, and has long <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the Republican Party, {{although this is}} gradually changing under its current publisher to reflect the current population and opinion trends of newer Valley residents. As a result, it will often publish two opinion pieces of opposing persuasions, side-by-side. The featured writers in them increasingly are local residents with strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.|$|E
25|$|Fred and Rose West {{were brought}} before a magistrates' court in Gloucester on 30 June 1994; {{he was charged}} with 11 murders and she with nine.

Prior to hearing the formal charges against them, Fred <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> his wife and gently placed his hand upon her shoulder; in response, Rose—having ignored her husband's presence—visibly winced in discomfort. Both were ordered held on remand.|$|E
25|$|The First Great Awakening divided Congregationalists {{into the}} pro-revival New Lights and the anti-revival Old Lights (who were {{themselves}} divided between tradtional, Old Calvinists and liberal Calvinists who <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> Arminianism). It was New Light theologian and revivalist Jonathan Edwards {{who would have}} the most profound affect on New England Congregationalism in the post-Awakening period. After his death, his followers would found a school of thought known as the New Divinity that would dominate Congregational thinking into the 19th century.|$|E

In Syria, the governor of Damascus, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri, <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> Ibn al-Zubayr, while the governors of Jund Hims (Homs District) and Qinnasrin, al-Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari and Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, respectively, the Qaysi tribes in general, and even members of the extended Umayyad family offered their full-fledged recognition Ibn al-Zubayr's sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{has been}} {{historically}} dominant in county-level politics. For statewide and national-level candidates, Pike County has <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the Republican Party. In 2000 Republican George W. Bush won 53% to Democrat Al Gore's 42%. In 2004 Republican George W. Bush won 58% to Democrat John Kerry's 40%. In 2008 Republican John McCain won 51% to Democrat Barack Obama's 47%. But, due to population growth, new residents have led {{an increase in}} Democratic voting. In 2006, Democratic Governor Ed Rendell won Pike with 53%. Of the four statewide Democratic candidates in the 2008 election, {{the only one to}} carry Pike was Jack Wagner.|$|E
25|$|Once {{released}} from captivity, Sanielevici returned to occupied Bucharest, and, exposing himself to accusations of collaborationism, began {{his contribution to}} Lumina, a newspaper put out by Germanophile-Poporanist Constantin Stere. His articles there, Boia notes, were apolitical, but his correspondence of the time showed that he <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> the Germanophile camp. This change occurred in mid 1918, after Romania agreed to a separate peace with the enemy, when he resumed contacts with the Poporanists who had fled to Moldavia. In October 1918, believing that the turn of events had confirmed the Germanophiles' justness, and their leadership position in Romanian culture, Sanielevici began working on a literary supplement for Stere's newspaper.|$|E

25|$|The Lê dynasty {{carried out}} land reforms {{to revitalize the}} economy after the war. Unlike the Lý and Trần kings, who were more {{influenced}} by Buddhism, the Lê kings <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> Confucianism. A comprehensive set of laws, the Hồng Đức code was introduced with some strong Confucian elements, yet also included some progressive rules, such as the rights of women. Art and architecture during the Lê dynasty also became more influenced by Chinese styles than during the Lý and Trần dynasty. The Lê dynasty commissioned the drawing of national maps and had Ngô Sĩ Liên continue the task of writing Đại Việt's history up {{to the time of}} Lê Lợi. King Lê Thánh Tông opened hospitals and had officials distribute medicines to areas affected with epidemics.|$|E
25|$|To {{the south}} in the Saar-Palatinate region, Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. 3rd Army had dealt a devastating blow to the German 7th Army and, in {{conjunction}} with the U.S. 7th Army, had nearly destroyed the German 1st Army. In five days of battle, from 18–22 March, Patton's forces captured over 68,000 Germans. These bold actions eliminated the last German positions west of the Rhine. Although Montgomery's drive was still planned as the main effort, Eisenhower believed that the momentum of the American forces to the south should not be squandered by having them merely hold the line at the Rhine or make only limited diversionary attacks beyond it. By the end of March, the Supreme Commander thus <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> a decision to place more responsibility on his southern forces. The events of {{the first few days of}} the final campaign would be enough to convince him that this was the proper course of action.|$|E
