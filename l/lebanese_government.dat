5|$|In 1999 the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>government</b> {{started a}} massive {{campaign}} to recover antiquities that were stolen or traded {{during the civil}} war. Many artifacts were recovered from warehouses or private homes since Lebanese law dictates that any item more than 300 years old belongs to the state. In 2011, the ground floor restoration lab was moved and a new exhibition hall, named after prince Maurice Chehab was opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Government</b> to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would not attack civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 15 July, U.S. Marines from the Sixth Fleet landed at Beirut and secured the Beirut airport. The {{following}} day, the 24th Division's 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry deployed to Turkey and flew to Beirut on 19 July. They were joined by a medium tank battalion (seemingly 3rd Battalion, 35th Armor Regiment) and support units, which assisted the Marines in forming a security cordon around the city. The force stayed until late October, providing security, making shows of force, including parachute jumps, and training the Lebanese Army. When factions of the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>government</b> worked out a political settlement, they left. The 24th Division's 1/187th lost one soldier killed by a sniper.|$|E

Hezbollah also collaborated with the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>government</b> in 2006 to detect Adeeb al-Alam, a former colonel, as an Israeli spy. Also, the organization recruited IDF Lieutenant Colonel Omar al-Heib, who was convicted in 2006 of conducting surveillance for Hezbollah.

5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl. Bitakat Al Hawiya); French: Carte D'identité) is conclusive (and {{not just}} prima facie) proof of Lebanese citizenship, {{and has the}} same force and effect as proof of Lebanese citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a Lebanese citizen for the full period allowed by law. The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the <b>Lebanese</b> <b>Government</b> upon demand.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Armenians are {{allocated}} six {{seats in}} Lebanon's 128-member National Assembly. The Lebanese {{branch of the}} ARF has usually controlled {{a majority of the}} Armenian vote and won most of the ethnic Armenian seats in the National Assembly. A major change occurred in the parliamentary election of 2000. With a rift between ARF and the Mustaqbal (Future) party of Rafik Hariri and the ARF was left with only one parliamentary seat, its worst result in many decades. The ARF called for a boycott of the 2005 Beirut elections. Relations soured further when on August 5, 2007 by-election in the Metn district, which includes the predominantly Armenian area of Bourj Hammoud, ARF decided to support Camille Khoury, the candidate backed by opposition leader Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement against Phalangist leader Amine Gemayel and subsequently won the seat. In the 2009 Lebanese general elections, the ARF won 2 seats in parliament which it holds presently. In June 2011, a new <b>Lebanese</b> <b>government</b> was formed where ARF party members were appointed to two ministerial positions, including Ministry of Industry, as part of the March 8 alliance.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon’s economy {{follows a}} laissez-faire model. Most {{of the economy}} is dollarized, and the country has no {{restrictions}} on the movement of capital across its borders. The <b>Lebanese</b> <b>government’s</b> intervention in foreign trade is minimal.|$|R

50|$|Both the Iranian and <b>Lebanese</b> <b>governments</b> {{have tried}} to gain {{information}} about their whereabouts.
