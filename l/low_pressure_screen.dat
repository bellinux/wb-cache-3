Environmental stresses of high salinity, low temperature, and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> were <b>screened</b> alone and in combination for effects on bacterial survival and replication, and then cells were tested in Mars analog soils under simulated Mars conditions. Survival and replication of E. coli and S. liquefaciens cells in liquid medium were evaluated for 7 days under low temperatures (5, 10, 20, or 30 °C) with increasing concentrations (0, 5, 10, or 20 %) of three salts (MgCl 2, MgSO 4, NaCl) reported to be present {{on the surface of}} Mars. Moderate to high growth rates were observed for E. coli and S. liquefaciens at 30 or 20 °C and in solutions with 0 or 5 % salts. In contrast, cell densities of both species generally did not increase above initial inoculum levels under the highest salt concentrations (10 and 20 %) and the four temperatures tested, with the exception that moderately higher cell densities were observed for both species at 10 % MgSO 4 maintained at 20 or 30 °C. Growth rates of E. coli and S. liquefaciens in low salt concentrations were robust under all pressures (2. 5, 10, or 101. 3 kPa), exhibiting a general increase of up to 2. 5 orders of magnitude above the initial inoculum levels of the assays. Vegetative E. coli cells were maintained in a Mars analog soil for 7 days under simulated Mars conditions that included temperatures between 20 and − 50 °C for a day/night diurnal period, UVC irradiation (200 to 280 nm) at 3. 6 W m− 2 for daytime operations (8 h), pressures held at a constant 0. 71 kPa, and a gas composition that included the top five gases found in the martian atmosphere. Cell densities of E. coli failed to increase under simulated Mars conditions, and survival was reduced 1 to 2 orders of magnitude by the interactive effects of desiccation, UV irradiation, high salinity, and <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> (in decreasing order of importance).

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on <b>pressure</b> <b>screen</b> and hydrocyclone performance. The general contradictory interrelationships between capacity and selectivity in <b>pressure</b> <b>screening</b> and cleaning are commonly recognized, but deep understanding of the effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the state of operation is missing. As separation selectivity is closely dependent on thickening and pulp passage, an operation curve for separation was applied and its application further developed to examine the parameters affecting <b>pressure</b> <b>screen</b> and hydrocyclone separation. New information was found on the geometry of the screen plate, furnish quality parameters in <b>pressure</b> <b>screen</b> fibre fractionation, and the hydrocyclone separation of fibres, sand and gases. The capacity increases achieved by changes in the wire screen plate geometry were found to be achieved at the cost of separation selectivity in probability screening. The capacity of the screen plate was affected by the flow on the screen plate and through it. The hydraulic resistance both in the forward and reverse flow directions was found to be of great importance for the capacity of the screen plate. Previously unreported knowledge was found regarding the effects of wire width, height and shape. <b>Pressure</b> <b>screening</b> capacity was found to decrease with increasing fibre length, fibre network strength and flocculation. <b>Pressure</b> <b>screen</b> fibre fractionation selectivity was increased by broadening of the fibre length distribution of the feed furnish. The furnish properties also affected the separation selectivity of fibres, sand and gases in the hydrocyclone. An increase in fibre network strength reduced the separation selectivity of the hydrocyclone separation of fibres and sand. Any increase in the specific surface area, and especially in the amount of fines, was found to make gas removal more challenging. It was concluded that a broader range of the specific surface distribution can increase the selectivity of fibre fractionation in the hydrocyclone. Knowledge of the general effects of design, operational and furnish quality parameters on the performance of <b>pressure</b> <b>screen</b> and hydrocyclone separation was deepened as a result of this work, which provides a framework for studying these effects further in pursuit of the general {{objective of}} maximizing capacity and selectivity while minimizing energy and investment costs...|$|R
