40|$|Abstract: Debate among <b>labor</b> <b>economists</b> on {{the pros}} and cons of a minimum wage law has come to focus on whether labor markets are {{competitive}} or monopsonistic. The purpose of this paper is, first, to suggest that this perspective is too narrow and, second, to use principles and concepts of institutional economics to demonstrate why. In particular, I use institutional theory to develop four theoretical rationales for minimum wage legislation: imperfect competition and inequality of bargaining power; involuntary unemployment and destructive competition; efficiency and growth; and labor market externalities and social costs of labor. One revisionist implication is that a minimum wage under plausible conditions may increase economic efficiency even in a purely competitive labor market. The minimum wage once had strong support among <b>labor</b> <b>economists,</b> most of who were affiliated with or sympathetic to the institutional school. Among this group were self-professed institutionalists, such as John Commons and colleagues of the Wisconsin School; more mainstream but institutionally sympathetic <b>labor</b> <b>economists</b> of the 1930 s and 1940 s, such as Chicago <b>labor</b> <b>economists</b> Paul Douglas and Harry Millis; and post-World War II “industrial relations ” <b>labor</b> <b>economists,</b> such as Dunlop, Kerr, Lester, an...|$|R

2500|$|Studies of refugees' {{impact on}} native welfare are scant but the {{existing}} literature shows a positive fiscal impact and mixed results (negative, positive and no significant effects) on native welfare. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that refugees to the United States pay [...] "$21,000 more in taxes than they receive in benefits over their first 20 years in the U.S." [...] An internal study by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which was suppressed and not shown to the public, found that refugees to the United States brought in $63 billion more in government revenues than they cost the government. According to <b>labor</b> <b>economist</b> Giovanni Peri, {{the existing literature}} {{suggests that there are}} no economic reasons why the American labor market could not easily absorb 100,000 Syrian refugees in a year. Refugees integrate more slowly into host countries' labor markets than labor migrants, in part due to the loss and depreciation of human capital and credentials during the asylum procedure.|$|E
