40|$|Objective: Determination and {{comparison}} {{of the effect of}} infusion time on the antioxidant activity and total polyphenol contents of bagged and <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> black teas. Materials and Methods: For twenty <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> and eleven bagged tea samples, the antioxidant activity and total polyphenol content were analyzed using FRAP and Folin-Ciocalteau methods, respectively. The ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc test and independent t-test were used for statistical analysis. Results: The antioxidant activity and polyphenol content of various brands of tea samples were significantly different. There were significant differences in the antioxidant activity of <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> teas between 5, 15 (p= 0. 03), 30 (p= 0. 02) and 60 (p= 0. 007) minutes of brewing times.

40|$|Massive {{failure of}} {{submerged}} slopes form {{a major threat}} for many dikes along estuaries in the Netherlands, the subsoil of which consists of alternating layers of <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> and more densely packed sand. Static liquefaction in the <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> sand plays an important role. Insufficient knowledge is available to predict the flow of sand and the retrogression of the instability after initial liquefaction. Liquefaction flow slides have been studied during an extensive experimental research program in the period 1973 - 1977 {{on behalf of the}} design of the storm surge barrier in the Oosterschelde estuary. Results of this program are revisited to learn about the response of a <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> sand layer to a local instability. The program included more than a hundred of tests in a large and medium sized flume that were filled with sand. Each sand body had a horizontal surface and a slope as boundaries. A remarkable difference was observed between the tests in which retrogressive liquefaction flow slides did and those where such slides did not occur. This may be quite relevant for the understanding of flow slides in natural slopes with pockets of <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> sand. The test set-up, measurements and main results of the large scale tests are described in this paper...|$|R

On {{the basis of}} TEM investigations a quantitative description {{of the structure of}} the films is given. The irreversibly incorporated oxygen {{contents of}} the films are nearly independent of the film structures. In contrast, the irreversibly incorporated carbon contents are proportional to the inner surfaces of the <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> films and to the C-contaminations of appropriate surfaces of compact fluoride samples. It is concluded that the irreversibly incorporated C covers the grain surfaces and the irreversibly incorporated C is located preferably within the grains...|$|R

40|$|We used site-directed spin {{labeling}} and {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} spectroscopy {{to investigate}} dynamics and helical packing in the four-helix transmembrane domain of the homodimeric bacterial chemoreceptor Trg. We focused on the first transmembrane helix, TM 1, particularly on the nine-residue sequence nearest the periplasm, because patterns of disulfide formation between introduced cysteines had identified that segment as the region of closest approach among neighboring transmembrane helices. Along this sequence, mobility and accessibility of the introduced spin label were characteristic of <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> or solvent-exposed side chains. This was also the case for eight additional positions around the circumference and {{along the length of}} TM 1. For the continuous nine-residue sequence near the periplasm, mobility and accessibility varied only modestly as a function of position. We conclude that side chains of TM 1 that face the interior of the four-helix domain interact with neighboring helices but dynamic movement results in loose packing. Compared to transmembrane segments of other membrane proteins reconstituted into lipid bilayers and characterized by site-directed spin labeling, TM 1 of chemoreceptor Trg is the most dynamic and <b>loosely</b> <b>packed.</b> A dynamic, <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> chemoreceptor domain can account for many experimental observations about the transmembrane domains of chemoreceptors...|$|R
40|$|It is {{discussed}} that dielectric properties of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) composites {{are influenced by}} the particle size of titania as a result of changes in the structure and dynamics of polymer chains in the interphase regions around the particles. It is hypothesized that a <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> interphase layer, resulted from high stiffness and high cohesion energy of PMMA chains, provides enough free volume for segmental chain movements and dipole orientation along the applied electric field and causes an increase in dielectric properties of nanocomposites at low filler contents. It is shown that the attraction of PMMA toward micro-titania and nano-titania is similar by measuring the surface energy of fillers. Dynamics of polymer chains around fillers is investigated by dynamic-mechanical-thermal analysis and broadband-dielectric spectroscopy, and presence of a <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> layer is confirmed by measuring thermal and mechanical glass transition temperature of composites. It is concluded that the anomalous enhancement in dielectric properties of 2 vol% nanocomposite, compared to the corresponding microcomposite, {{can be attributed to the}} higher volume fraction of <b>loosely</b> <b>packed</b> interphase layers in the nanocomposite.

40|$|The {{effect of}} glutardialdehyde on the dynamic {{organization}} of gap junctions cannot only {{be seen by}} electrophysiological measurements where the uncoupling of cells occurs within 3 min, but also by freeze fracturing the cells.

Whether these different structures correspond with different functional states, or whether they depend on the local configuration of the contacting membranes is difficult to decide.
