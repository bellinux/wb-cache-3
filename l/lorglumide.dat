Bombesin (90 pmol/kg per h) and caerulein (30 pmol/kg per h) were infused into seven dogs in doses giving similar plasma cholecystokinin peak increments as a meal (mean (SEM) 6. 8 (0. 8), 6. 3 (1. 2), and 5. 7 (0. 8) pM, respectively), together with either saline or 2 mg/kg per h of <b>lorglumide.</b> A background infusion of synthetic secretin 20. 5 pmol/kg per h was given in each experiment. In addition, gastric acid secretion was determined in the experiments with bombesin and caerulein infusion. Pancreatic protein responses to bombesin (1231 (247) mg/h) and food (1430 (220) mg/h) were similar to the responses to caerulein (1249 (201) mg/h). <b>Lorglumide</b> inhibited pancreatic protein output during stimulation with bombesin by 60 %, after the meal by 45 %, and during caerulein infusion by 68 %. Pancreatic bicarbonate output by bombesin, caerulein, and food was inhibited by <b>lorglumide</b> by 28 %, 40 %, and 38 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Cholecystokinin (CCK) {{has been}} found to be a growth {{stimulant}} through its special receptor pathway, especially for gastrointestinal malignancies. Although the CCK- 1 receptor has been shown to be highly expressed in resected human pancreatic cancer samples, its role is less clear. Objective: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the CCK- 1 receptor expression and the function of the CCK-CCK- 1 receptor pathway in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, Mia PaCa- 2. Methods: The expression of the CCK- 1 receptor in Mia PaCa- 2 cells was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. CCK- 1 receptor agonist CCK- 8 S (the major transmitter form of CCK) and antagonist <b>lorglumide</b> were cultured respectively with Mia PaCa- 2. Three groups were created for this study: CCK- 8 S group (Mia PaCa- 2 cells treated with CCK- 8 S), <b>lorglumide</b> group (Mia PaCa- 2 cells treated with <b>lorglumide),</b> and the control group (Mia PaCa- 2 cells alone). Investigators were blinded to group designation. 3 -[4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry were used to detect the cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Apoptosis index rate was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling. Cell invasion ability was observed by invasion assay. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 (MMP- 2) was measured by Western blotting. Results: Mia PaCa- 2 cells were found to express the CCK- 1 receptor. Compared with the control group (70. 2 % [1. 5 %]), CCK- 8 S was associated with significant mean (SD) cell proliferation (85. 1 % [1. 7 %]; P = 0. 039), and the ratio in the S stage of the cell cycle increased significantly (50. 5 % [1. 7 %] vs 42. 2 % [1. 4 %]; P = 0. 021). CCK- 8 S was also associated with increased Mia PaCa- 2 cell invasion ability (123. 8 [1. 7] vs 102. 1 [5. 8]; P = 0. 005 vs control). Compared with the control group, <b>lorglumide</b> was associated with significantly inhibited cell growth (52. 1 % [1. 8 %]; P = 0. 002) and cell invasion (77. 6 % [1. 2 %]; P = 0. 003). <b>Lorglumide</b> also induced G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (27. 1 % [3 – 5 %] vs 3 – 7 % [0. 6 %]; P = 0. 003 vs control). The change of invasion ability appeared to be mediated by MMP- 2 expression, which was upregulated by CCK- 8 S and downregulated by <b>lorglumide.</b> Conclusion: The findings of this in vitro study suggest that CCK may exert a trophic action on the Mia PaCa- 2 cell line, while <b>lorglumide</b> inhibited the cell growth and invasion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{investigation}} was to establish and compare the reversibility of tolerance to the antitransit effects of morphine by three different procedures: (a) acute inflammation of the gut, (b) <b>lorglumide</b> a cholecystokininA (CCKA) receptor antagonist, or (c) MK- 801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ion channel blocker. The type of interaction between morphine and <b>lorglumide</b> or MK- 801 on the inhibition of gastrointestinal transit (GIT) in naive animals was also evaluated. Male Swiss CD- 1 mice were implanted with 75 [*]mg of morphine base or placebo pellets. Gastrointestinal transit was assessed with a charcoal meal and results expressed as % inhibition of GIT. Inflammation was induced by the intragastric (p. o.) administration of croton oil (CO), while controls received castor oil (CA) or saline (SS). Morphine was administered by subcutaneous (s. c.) or intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) injection, to naive and tolerant animals treated with CO, CA or SS. Dose-response curves for s. c. morphine were also perforrmed in naive and tolerant mice receiving 5. 2 or 7. 4 [*]nmol (s. c.) <b>lorglumide</b> or MK- 801, respectively. The ED 50 values for inhibition of GIT by s. c. morphine were: 45. 9 ± 2. 7 and 250. 1 ± 3. 1 [*]nmol in naive and tolerant animals, respectively, demonstrating a five fold decrease in the potency of morphine. In naive animals, inflammation (CO) decreased the ED 50 of morphine three times (14. 4 ± 2. 2 [*]nmol). However, no tolerance to s. c. morphine (ED 50 16. 4 ± 2. 6 [*]nmol) was manifested during intestinal inflammation. After i. c. v. administration, a similar degree of tolerance to morphine was observed (4. 8 fold decrease in potency). Intestinal inflammation {{had no effect on}} the ED 50 values of i. c. v. morphine in naive and tolerant animals, showing that reversal of tolerance is related to local mechanism/s. Mean values for intestinal pH were 6. 9 ± 0. 04 and 6. 2 ± 0. 04 in SS and CO treated mice, respectively. In addition, morphine was 74 times more potent by the i. c. v. than by the s. c. route (naive-SS). Morphine and <b>lorglumide</b> interacted synergistically in naive animals; in addition, the administration of <b>lorglumide</b> reversed tolerance to s. c. morphine. No interaction (additivity) was observed in naive animals when morphine and MK- 801 were administered in combination. However, the drug completely reversed tolerance to the antitransit effects of morphine. The present investigation shows that acute inflammation of the gut reverses tolerance to the antitransit effects of s. c. morphine by a peripheral mechanism. Qualitatively similar results were obtained after the administration of <b>lorglumide</b> or MK- 801. Our results suggest that a local decrease in pH could play an important role during inflammation, while antagonism of endogenous compensatory systems would explain the reversal of tolerance induced by <b>lorglumide</b> or MK- 801...|$|E
40|$|Prolactin (PRL) is {{essential}} for the lactating mammals, while cholecystokinin (CCK) does inhibit gastric emptying (GE). Present study attempted to determine whether both peptides interacted on the male rat GE, particularly the role of putative CCK 1 receptor. Methods Acute hyperprolactinemia of male rats was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of ovine PRL (oPRL) in several divided doses 15 minutes before motility study. Rat chronic hyperprolactinemia was induced by the graft of 2 pituitary glands into the cap-sule of left kidney, while control rats received cerebral cortex graft only. Motility study was conducted 6 weeks later after graft surgery. Fifteen minutes after the intragastric feeding of radiochromium, rat was sacrificed to measure GE via the distribution of radioactivities within stomach and intestine. Among the CCK 1 receptor blocking study using <b>lorglumide,</b> rats were divided to receive the regimens in terms of oPRL-vehicle plus lorglumide-vehicle, oPRL plus lorglumide-vehicle, oPRL-vehicle plus lorglu-mide and oPRL plus <b>lorglumide.</b> Plasma CCK level was measured using a homemade radioimmunoassay kit. Results Compared to vehicle treatment, acute hyperprolactinemic rats under highest dose (2. 0 mg/kg) of oPRL treatment showed de-layed GE (70. 6 % ± 3. 0 % vs 42. 1 % ± 6. 6 %, P ＜ 0. 05). Chronic hyperprolactinemic rats under graft surgery also showed in-hibited GE (70. 5 % ± 1. 7 % vs 54. 5 % ± 4. 7 %, P ＜ 0. 05).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{amphetamine}} on gastrointestinal (GI) transit and the plasma levels of cholecystokinin (CCK) were studied in male rats. Gastric emptying was inhibited both acutely and chronically {{by the administration}} of amphetamine. GI transit was decreased by the acute administration of amphetamine but not affected by the chronic administration of amphetamine. Plasma CCK levels were increased dose-dependently by amphetamine. Proglumide, a CCK receptor antagonist, prevented amphetamine-induced inhibition of gastric emptying and the decrease in GI transit in male rats. The selective CCKA receptor antagonist, <b>lorglumide,</b> dose-dependently attenuated the amphetamine-induced inhibition of gastric emptying in male rats. In contrast, the selective CCKB receptor antagonist, PD 135, 158, did not reverse the effect of amphetamine on gastric emptying.

40|$|The {{ability of}} CCKA ant{{agonists}} to inhibit full and partial CCK agonists {{of the rat}} pancreatic acinar cell CCKA receptor has been studied. When isolated rat pancreatic acini were superfused with CCK- 8 (10 pM- 1 nM) or CCK- 4 (1 [mu]M), an increase in [Ca 2 +]i signal was initiated. Concurrent superfusion of either L- 364, 718 (0. 1 [mu]M) or <b>lorglumide</b> (10 [mu]M), chemically distinct, specific, potent antagonists of the CCKA receptor, resulted in a rapid inhibition of the [Ca 2 +]i signal initiated by all concentrations of CCK- 8. In contrast, Ca 2 + oscillations, initiated by JMV- 180 (25 nM- 1 [mu]M), a partial agonist analogue of CCK- 8, were essentially unaffected by concurrent superfusion of either L- 364, 718 or <b>lorglumide.</b> When JMV- 179, an analogue of JMV- 180 that exhibits characteristics of a pure antagonist, was superfused concurrently with either CCK- 8 or JMV- 180, Ca 2 + oscillations were inhibited, even {{in the presence of}} 0. 1 [mu]M L- 364, 718. In a similar fashion, amylase secretion stimulated by CCK- 8 was markedly attenuated by L- 364, 718, <b>lorglumide,</b> and JMV- 179, whereas secretion stimulated by JMV- 180 was only inhibited by JMV- 179.

40|$|Estrogen plays a {{critical}} role in inducing LH surge. In the pituitary, estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) mediates the action of estrogen, while the downstream pathway of ERalpha activation is yet to be elucidated. Here, we report the finding that cholecystokinin type A receptor (CCK-AR) is an ERalpha downstream gene in the mouse anterior pituitary. In the cycling mouse pituitary, the expression of CCK-AR mRNA is markedly higher in the afternoon of proestrus compared with metestrus. Both ovariectomy (OVX) and null mutation of the ERalpha gene completely abolish CCK-AR mRNA expression. Injection of 17 beta-estradiol to OVX wild-type mice induces recovery of CCK-AR mRNA expression to levels observed at proestrus, but no such recovery is induced in OVX ERalpha knockout mice. The same pattern of estrogen dependency in inducing CCK-AR mRNA expression was seen in cultured primary anterior pituitary cells, indicating that estrogen directly acts on pituitary cells to induce CCK-AR expression. Immunohistological analysis revealed that more than 80 % of gonadotrophs express CCK-AR in the afternoon of proestrus. To test whether CCK-AR mediated the sensitizing effect of estrogen in GnRH-induced LH secretion, primary pituitary cells were primed with estrogen followed by treatment with GnRH in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>lorglumide,</b> a CCK-AR antagonist. While both groups secreted LH upon GnRH treatment, <b>lorglumide</b> treatment significantly decreased LH secretion.

40|$|Initial {{studies on}} the {{digestive}} hormone neurotensin (NT) showing that intestinal NT mRNA expression and blood levels were altered in rats fed chow containing bile acid (BA) and the BA chelator cholestyramine led us to investigate the role of NT in the enterohepatic circulation of BA. In fasted, anesthetized rats with common bile ducts cannulated for bile collection, intravenous NT infusion (10 pmol. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) enhanced BA output relative to control over 3 h in animals administered donor bile into the duodenum (30 microl/min). This suggested {{that the effect of}} NT was on the return of BA from the intestine to the liver, which is rate determining in the normal process. In rats prepared as described above and administered [(3) H]taurocholate ([(3) H]TC; 5 mM, 1 ml) duodenally, NT infusion (3 - 10 pmol x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)) increased the [(3) H]TC recovery rate in bile approximately twofold, whereas sulfated CCK- 8 (12 - 50 pmol x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)) had no effect. To investigate the roles of endogenous NT and CCK, we administered [(3) H]TC into the rat duodenum or lower jejunum and tested the effect of the NT antagonist SR- 48692 (2 nmol x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)) or CCK-A antagonist <b>lorglumide</b> (100 nmol x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)). SR- 48692 reduced the [(3) H]TC recovery rate by congruent with 50 % and congruent with 24 % in the duodenum and jejunum, respectively, whereas <b>lorglumide</b> had no effect.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of the cholecystokinin (CCK) -A receptor in fever was studied. The polyphasic febrile responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 μg kg− 1, i. v.) were compared between wild-type Long-Evans (LE) rats and the CCK-A-receptor-deficient Otsuka LE Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats. The response of the wild-type rats was biphasic, which is typical for LE rats. Phases 1 and 2 of {{the response of the}} OLETF rats were {{similar to those of the}} LE rats, but the OLETF rats also developed a robust phase 3. This late enhancement of the febrile response could reflect either the absence of the A receptor per se or a secondary trait of the mutant strain. To distinguish between these possibilities, we conducted a pharmacological analysis. We studied whether the normally low phase 3 of LE rats can be enhanced by a CCK-A-receptor antagonist, sodium <b>lorglumide</b> (4. 3 μg kg− 1 min− 1, 120 min, i. v.), and whether the normally high phase 3 of Wistar rats can be attenuated by a CCK-A receptor agonist, sulphated CCK- 8 (up to 0. 17 μg kg− 1 min− 1, 120 min, i. v.). The dose of sodium <b>lorglumide</b> used was sufficient to increase food intake (to block satiety), but it did not affect the fever response. In both febrile and afebrile rats, CCK- 8 induced dose-dependent skin vasodilatation and decreased body temperature, but it failed to produce any effects specific for phase 3. We conclude that the exaggeration of phase 3 in OLETF rats reflects a secondary trait of this strain and not the lack of the CCK-A receptor per se.

40|$|Both {{inhibitory}} (satiety) and stimulatory (orexigenic) {{factors from}} the gastrointestinal tract regulate food intake. In {{the case of}} the satiety hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), these effects are mediated via vagal afferent neurons. We now report that vagal afferent neurons expressing the CCK- 1 receptor also express cannabinoid CB 1 receptors. Retrograde tracing established that these neurons project to the stomach and duodenum. The expression of CB 1 receptors determined by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in rat nodose ganglia was increased by withdrawal of food for � 12 hr. After refeeding of fasted rats there was a rapid loss of CB 1 receptor expression identified by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. These effects were blocked by administration of the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist <b>lorglumide</b> and mimicked by administration of CCK to fasted rats. Because CCK is a satiety factor that acts via the vagus nerve and CB 1 agonists stimulate food intake, the data suggest a new mechanism modulating the effect on food intake of satiety signals from the gastrointestinal tract.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} sulfated cholecystokinin- 8 (CCK- 8 S) on calcium mobilization in cultured murine gastric antral interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and its possible mechanisms. METHODS: ICC were isolated from the gastric antrum of mice and cultured. Immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody for c-Kit was used to identify ICC. The responsiveness of ICC to CCK- 8 S was measured using Fluo- 3 /AM based digital microfluorimetric measurement of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i). A confocal laser scanning microscope was used to monitor [Ca 2 +]i changes. The selective CCK 1 receptor antagonist <b>lorglumide,</b> the intracellular Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, the type III inositol 1, 4, 5 -triphosphate (InsP 3) receptor blocker xestospongin C and the L-type voltage-operated Ca 2 + channel inhibitor nifedipine were {{used to examine the}} mechanisms of [Ca 2 +]i elevation caused by CCK- 8 S. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were used to determine the regulatory effect of PKC on phosphorylation of type III InsP 3 receptor (InsP 3 R 3) in ICC. Protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) and inhibitor chelerythrine were used to assess the role of PKC in the CCK- 8 S-evoked [Ca 2 +]i increment of ICC. RESULTS: ICC were successfully isolated from the gastric antrum of mice and cultured. Cultured ICC were identified by immunofluorescence staining. When given 80 nmol/L or more than 80 nmol/L CCK- 8 S, the [Ca 2 +]i in ICC increased and 100 nmol/L CCK- 8 S significantly increased the mean [Ca 2 +]i by 59. 30 % 1; 4. 85 % (P < 0. 01). Pretreatment of ICC with 5 &#x 3 BC;mol/L <b>lorglumide</b> inhibited 100 nmol/L CCK- 8 S-induced [Ca 2 +]i increment from 59. 30 % 1; 4. 85 % to 14. 97 % 1; 9. 05 % (P < 0. 01), suggesting a CCK 1 R-mediated event. Emptying of intracellular calcium stores by thapsigargin (5 &#x 3 BC;mol/L) prevented CCK- 8 S (100 nmol/L) from inducing a [Ca 2 +]i increase. Moreover, pretreatment with xestospongin C (1 &#x 3 BC;mol/L) could also abolish the CCK- 8 S-induced effect, indicating that Ca 2 + release from InsP 3 R-operated stores appeared to be a major mechanism responsible for CCK- 8 S-induced calcium mobilization in ICC. On the other hand, by removing extracellular calcium or blocking the L-type voltage-operated calcium channel with nifedipine, a smaller but significant rise in the [Ca 2 +]i could be still elicited by CCK- 8 S. These data suggest that the [Ca 2 +]i release is not stimulated or activated by the influx of extracellular Ca 2 + in ICC, but the influx of extracellular Ca 2 + can facilitate the [Ca 2 +]i increase evoked by CCK- 8 S. CCK- 8 S increased the phosphorylation of InsP 3 R 3, which could be prevented by chelerythrine. Pretreatment with <b>lorglumide</b> (5 &#x 3 BC;mol/L) could significantly reduce the CCK- 8 S intensified phosphorylation of InsP 3 R 3. In the positive control group, treatment of cells with PMA also resulted in an enhanced phosphorylation of InsP 3 R 3. Pretreatment with various concentrations of PMA (10 nmol/L- 10 &#x 3 BC;mol/L) apparently inhibited the effect of CCK- 8 S and the effect of 100 nmol/L PMA was most obvious. Likewise, the effect of CCK- 8 S was augmented by the pretreatment with chelerythrine (10 nmol/L- 10 &#x 3 BC;mol/L) and 100 nmol/L chelerythrine exhibited the maximum effect. CONCLUSION: CCK- 8 S increases [Ca 2 +]i in ICC via the CCK 1 receptor. This effect depends on the release of InsP 3 R-operated Ca 2 + stores, which is negatively regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of InsP 3 R 3...|$|E

40|$|Among the {{environmental}} {{factors that can}} affect food intake is the extent of dietary variety available in the environment. Numerous {{studies have demonstrated that}} variety in a meal can increase the amount of food consumed in humans, rats, and other species. A physiological mechanism that has been demonstrated to affect food intake is the gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) which is released from the upper small intestine during the ingestion of food. Peripherally administered CCK has a robust inhibitory effect on the intake of a single-food meal. Thus, dietary variety and CCK both affect meal size, with dietary variety increasing intake and CCK decreasing intake. This raises the question ofhow dietary variety and CCK might interact to affect meal size. Previous studies of CCK's effects have focused on situations in which only one food was available for consumption. However, in an animal's natural environment it would frequently occur that the animal would come across a number of foods either simultaneously or in quick succession, thus providing the animal access to a variety of foods during a meal. Accordingly, the effect ofCCK on food intake in single-food and multiple-food meals was examined. It was found that food intake was greater in multiple-food than in single-food meals provided that foods in the multiplefood meal were presented either simultaneously or in increasing order of preference. When foods in the multiple-food meal were presented in decreasing order of preference, intake was similar to that observed in single-food meals. In addition, it was found that CCK inhibited food intake in a dose-dependent manner, and that its effects on food intake were similar regardless of meal type. Therefore, the inhibitory effects ofCCK were not diminished when a variety of foods were available for consumption. Furthermore, the finding that CCK did not differentially affect the intake of the two types of meals does not provide support for the recent-foods hypothesis which postulates that CCK decreases food intake by reducing the palatability of only recently consumed foods. However, it is consistent with the all-foods hypothesis, which predicts that CCK reduces food intake by decreasing the palatability of all foods. The 600 ng/kg dose of the CCK^-antagonist <b>lorglumide</b> significantly antagonized the inhibitory effect of exogenous CCK on food intake, and the magnitude of this effect was similar for both types of meal. These results suggest that exogenous CCK inhibits food intake through the activation ofCCK^ receptors. However, when administered by itself, the 600 ^ig/kg dose of <b>lorglumide</b> did not increase food intake in either single-food or multiple-food meals, suggesting that peripheral endogenous CCK may not {{play a major role in}} the control of food intake...|$|E

The {{aim of the}} present study was to determine whether CCK has any effect on isolated duodenum longitudinal muscle activity and to characterize the mechanisms involved. Isolated segments of the rat proximal duodenum were mounted for the recording of isometric contractions of longitudinal muscle in the presence of atropine and guanethidine. CCK- 8 S (EC 50 : 39; 95 % CI: 4. 1 - 152 nM) and cerulein (EC 50 : 58; 95 % CI: 18 - 281 nM) induced a concentration-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive relaxation. Nomeganitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) reduced CCK- 8 S- and cerulein-induced relaxation (IC 50 : 5. 2; 95 % CI: 2. 5 - 18 µM) in a concentration-dependent manner. The magnitude of 300 nM CCK- 8 S-induced relaxation was reduced by 100 µM L-NOARG from 73 ± 5. 1 to 19 ± 3. 5 % in an L-arginine but not D-arginine preventable manner. The CCK- 1 receptor antagonists proglumide, <b>lorglumide</b> and devazepide, but not the CCK- 2 receptor antagonist L- 365, 260, antagonized CCK- 8 S-induced relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner.

40|$|Capsaicin {{treatment}} destroys vagal afferent C {{fibers and}} markedly attenuates reduction of food intake and induction of hindbrain Fos expression by CCK. However, both anatomical and electrophysiological {{data indicate that}} some gastric vagal afferents are not destroyed by capsaicin. Because CCK enhances behavioral and electrophysiological responses to gastric distension in rats and people, we hypothesized that CCK might enhance the vagal afferent response to gastric distension via an action on capsaicin-insensitive vagal afferents. To test this hypothesis, we quantified expression of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos) in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of capsaicin- treated (Cap) and control rats (Veh), following gastric balloon distension alone and in combination with CCK injection. In Veh rats, intraperitoneal CCK significantly increased DVC Fos, especially in nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), whereas in Cap rats, CCK did not significantly increase DVC Fos. In contrast to CCK, gastric distension did significantly increase Fos expression in the NTS of both Veh and Cap rats, although distension-induced Fos was attenuated in Cap rats. When CCK was administered during gastric distension, it significantly enhanced NTS Fos expression in response to distension in Cap rats. Furthermore, CCK's enhancement of distension-induced Fos in Cap rats was reversed by the selective CCK-A receptor antagonist <b>lorglumide.</b> We conclude that CCK directly activates capsaicin- sensitive C-type vagal afferents. However, in capsaicin- resistant A-type afferents, CCK's principal action may be facilitation of responses to gastric distension...|$|E

Nifedipine, verapamil, diltiazem, Cd 2 +, Ni 2 +, Co 2 +, R-(+) -Bay K 8644 and pimozide inhibited and relaxed high potassium-induced contraction of rat spleen with IC 50 and EC 50 values much higher than those values in rat aorta. In addition, high potassium-stimulated contraction of rat spleen was insensitive to ω-conotoxin GVIA, ω-conotoxin MVIIC and ω-agatoxin IVA. The high potassium-induced contraction of rat spleen was also unaffected by tetrodotoxin (TTX), prazosin, chloroethylclonidine (CEC), yohimbine, propranolol, atropine, diphenhydramine, cimetidine, ketanserin, 3 -tropanyl-indole- 3 -carboxylate, saralasin, indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, GR 32191 B, domperidone, naloxone, chlorpromazine, suramin, (±) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid, 6, 7 -dinitroquinoxaline- 2, 3 -dione (DNQX), L- 659, 877, L- 703, 606, <b>lorglumide,</b> PD 135, 158 N-methyl-D-glucamine, benextramine, amiloride, dantrolene, TMB- 8, econazole, staurosporine and neomycin.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intestinal}} hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) delays gastric emptying and inhibits {{food intake}} by actions on vagal afferent neurons. Recent studies suggest plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1 suppresses {{the effect of}} CCK on food intake. In this study we asked whether PAI- 1 also modulated CCK effects on gastric emptying. Five minute gastric emptying of liquid test meals was studied in conscious wild type mice (C 57 BL/ 6) and in transgenic mice over-expressing PAI- 1 in gastric parietal cells (PAI- 1 H/Kβ mice), or null for PAI- 1. The effects of exogenous PAI- 1 and CCK 8 s on gastric emptying were studied after ip administration. Intragastric peptone delayed gastric emptying in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by a mechanism sensitive to the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist <b>lorglumide.</b> Peptone did not delay gastric emptying in PAI- 1 -H/Kβ mice. Exogenous CCK delayed gastric emptying of a control test meal in C 57 BL/ 6 mice and this was attenuated by administration of PAI- 1; exogenous CCK {{had no effect on}} emptying in PAI- 1 -H/Kβ mice. Prior administration of gastrin to increase gastric PAI- 1 inhibited CCK-dependent effects on gastric emptying in C 57 BL/ 6 mice but not in PAI- 1 null mice. Thus, both endogenous and exogenous PAI- 1 inhibit the effects of CCK (whether exogenous or endogenous) on gastric emptying. The data are compatible with emerging evidence that gastric PAI- 1 modulates vagal effects of CCK...|$|E
40|$|Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a gut hormone {{released}} from enteroendocrine cells. CCK functions as an anorexigenic factor by acting on CCK receptors expressed on the vagal afferent nerve and hypothalamus with a synergistic interaction between leptin. In the gut, tastants such as amino acids and bitter compounds stimulate CCK release from enteroendocrine cells via activation of taste transduction pathways. CCK is also expressed in taste buds, suggesting potential roles of CCK in taste signaling in the peripheral taste organ. In the present study, {{we focused on}} the function of CCK in the initial responses to taste stimulation. CCK was coexpressed with type II taste cell markers such as Gα-gustducin, phospholipase Cβ 2, and transient receptor potential channel M 5. Furthermore, a small subset (~ 30 %) of CCK-expressing taste cells expressed a sweet/umami taste receptor component, taste receptor type 1 member 3, in taste buds. Because type II taste cells are sweet, umami or bitter taste cells, the majority of CCK-expressing taste cells may be bitter taste cells. CCK-A and -B receptors were expressed in both taste cells and gustatory neurons. CCK receptor knockout mice showed reduced neural responses to bitter compounds compared with wild-type mice. Consistently, intravenous injection of CCK-Ar antagonist <b>lorglumide</b> selectively suppressed gustatory nerve responses to bitter compounds. Intravenous injection of CCK- 8 transiently increased gustatory nerve activities in a dose-dependent manner whereas administration of CCK- 8 did not affect activities of bitter-sensitive taste cells. Collectively, CCK may be a functionally important neurotransmitter or neuromodulator to activate bitter nerve fibers in peripheral taste tissues...|$|E
40|$|The nucleustractus solitarius (NTS) {{receives}} dense terminations from cranial visceral afferents, {{including those}} from the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Although the NTS integrates peripheral satiety signals and relays this signal to central feeding centers, {{little is known about}} which NTS neurons are involved or what mechanisms are responsible. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are good candidates for GI integration, because disruption of the POMC gene leads to severe obesity and hyperphagia. Here, we used POMC– enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgenic mice to identify NTS POMC neurons. Intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) induced c-fos gene expression in NTS POMC–EGFP neurons, suggesting that they are activated by afferents stimulated by the satiety hormone. We tested the synaptic relationship of these neurons to visceral afferents and their modulation by CCK and opioids using patch recordings in horizontal brain slices. Electrical activation of the solitary tract (ST) evoked EPSCs in NTS POMC–EGFP neurons. The invariant latencies, low failure rates, and substantial paired-pulse depression of the ST-evoked EPSCs indicate that NTS POMC–EGFP neurons are second-order neurons directly contacted by afferent terminals. The EPSCs were blocked by the glutamate antagonist 2, 3 - dihydroxy- 6 -nitro- 7 -sulfonyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline. CCK increased the amplitude of the ST-stimulated EPSCs and the frequency of miniature EPSCs, effects attenuated by the CCK 1 receptor antagonist <b>lorglumide.</b> In contrast, the orexigenic opioid agonists [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5) ]-enkephalin and met-enkephalin inhibited both ST-stimulated EPSCs and the frequency of miniature EPSCs. These findings identify a potential satiety pathway in which visceral afferents directly activate NTS POMC–EGFP neurons with excitatory inputs that are appropriately modulated by appetite regulators...|$|E
40|$|The peptide {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) originally {{described as}} a gut hormone secreted from duodenum (intestine) is a ubiquitous neuropeptide involved {{in a variety of}} homeostatic and physiological functions. A product of obese (Ob) gene leptin is circulating protein synthesized by the white adipose tissue. Both of these are functioning as signaling messengers involved in regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis, whereas their receptor localization, physiological interaction and functional compensation between receptors / or its receptor subtypes in the hypothalamic satiety centers are not well characterized. In the present study, we examined fura- 2 based intracellular Ca^ imaging in acutely isolated mouse hypothalamic slices to analyze leptin and CCK-mediated signaling in details using gene knockout mice lacking CCK- 1 receptors (CCK 1 R-/-). The CCK receptors are categorized into two subtypes, CCK- 1 and - 2, both of which share a common phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway to mobilize intracellular Ca^ following receptor stimulations. We focused CCK-mediated Ca^ signaling in parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (PVN) cells, which control satiety and represent highest expression of CCK- 1 receptors in the brain. Analysis of mouse hypothalamic slices demonstrated that the general CCK receptor agonist CCK- 8 s (10 nM) triggered Ca^ transients most significantly in the posterior sub-region of the PVN (PaPo). This 10 nM CCK- 8 s-induced response was absent in CCK 1 R-/- slices, showing that the response is mediated by CCK- 1 receptors. CCK- 8 s concentrations higher than 30 nM triggered a Ca^ rise similarly in wild-type and CCK 1 R-/- slices. The large CCK- 8 s (100 nM) -induced Ca^ responses in CCK 1 R-/- slices were blocked by a CCK- 2 receptor antagonist (CI- 988), whereas those in wild-type slices required a mixture of CI- 988 and <b>lorglumide</b> (a CCK- 1 receptor antagonist) for complete antagonism. Therefore, CCK- 1 and - 2 receptors may function synergistically in single PaPo neurons and deletion of CCK- 1 receptors may facilitate CCK- 2 receptor signaling. This hypothesis was supported by results of real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence double labeling and western blotting assays, which indicated CCK- 2 receptor over expression in PaPo neurons of CCK 1 R-/- mice. Furthermore, behavioral studies showed that intraperitoneal injections of <b>lorglumide</b> up-regulated food accesses in wild-type but not in CCK 1 R -/- mice, whereas CI- 988 injections up-regulated food accesses in CCK 1 R-/- but not in wild-type mice. The compensatory CCK receptor signaling shed light on currently controversial satiety-controlling mechanisms in CCK 1 R-/- mice. Because of regular food intake activities and body weights are also reported for CCK null mutant mice, functional compensation for molecules underlying CCK-mediated satiety controls may not be limited to the two CCK receptor subtypes, and may also include other receptor signaling molecules such as leptin. So, we further extended our study focused on leptin and CCK signaling in hypothalamic neurons. Our preliminary data based on Ca 2 + imaging and real time RT-PCR assay indicated that leptin and CCK- 1 receptor signaling were synergistically interacted in PVN neurons {{as in the case of}} CCK- 1 and - 2 receptors. These results suggested receptor-wide as well as subtype-wide compensatory mechanisms in the regulation of satiety via metabotropic receptors. 富山大学・富生命博甲第 52 号・Shahid Mohammad・ 2013 / 09 / 27 富山大...|$|E
40|$|The {{actions of}} {{cholecystokinin}} (CCK) on gastrointestinal functions occur mainly via paracrine effects on peripheral sensory vagal fibers, which engage vago-vagal brain stem circuits to convey effector responses {{back to the}} gastrointestinal tract. Recent evidence suggests, however, that CCK also affects brain stem structures directly. Many electrophysiological studies, including our own, have shown that brain stem vagal circuits are excited by sulfated CCK (CCK- 8 s) directly, and we have further demonstrated that CCK- 8 s induces a remarkable degree of plasticity in GABAergic brain stem synapses. In the present study, we used fasted, anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats to investigate the effects of brain stem administration of CCK- 8 s on gastric tone before and after activation of the esophageal-gastric reflex. CCK- 8 s microinjected in the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) or applied {{on the floor of}} the fourth ventricle induced an immediate and transient decrease in gastric tone. Upon recovery of gastric tone to baseline values, the gastric relaxation induced by esophageal distension was attenuated or even reversed. The effects of CCK- 8 s were antagonized by vagotomy or fourth ventricular, but not intravenous, administration of the CCK-A antagonist <b>lorglumide,</b> suggesting a central, not peripheral, site of action. The gastric relaxation induced by DVC microinjection of CCK- 8 s was unaffected by pretreatment with systemic bethanecol but was completely blocked by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, suggesting a nitrergic mechanism of action. These data suggest that 1) brain stem application of CCK- 8 s induces a vagally mediated gastric relaxation; 2) the CCK- 8 s-induced gastric relaxation is mediated via activation of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic pathways; and 3) CCK- 8 s reverses the esophageal-gastric reflex transiently...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{control of}} cell {{proliferation}} by gastrin {{has been investigated}} in a rat pancreatic tumour cell line, AR 4 - 2 J. Exogenous gastrin, 10 - 12 to 10 - 8 M, stimulated cell growth of thymidine-synchronised AR 4 - 2 J cells cultured over 48 h in serum-free medium. Cell lysates of AR 4 - 2 J cells contained an average of 4. 5 and 3. 5 pg gastrin per 106 cells, when grown in serum-supplemented or serum-free media, respectively, as revealed by radioimmunoassay. In serum-free medium, AR 4 - 2 J secrete 34 ngl 10 - 6 cells of gastrin over 48 h. Addition of an anti-gastrin immunoglobulin preparation, but not control immunoglobulins, caused a maximum 52 % reduction in cell growth. These data are consistent with an autocrine role for gastrin in the control of AR 4 - 2 J cell growth. These results were supported by studies with gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Six non-peptide gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists inhibited AR 4 - 2 J cell growth in a concentration-related manner. The concentration required for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) of cell growth by the amino acid-derived antagonists proglumide (3. 5 x 10 - M), benzotript (1. 8 x 10 - 3 M), loxiglumide (1. 1 x 10 - 4 M) and <b>lorglumide</b> (6. 7 x 10 - 5 M) were of the same order and significantly correlated with their IC 50 for inhibition of 1251 -gastrin binding to AR 4 - 2 J cells.

40|$|We {{examined}} the interaction among secretagogues that stimulate pepsinogen secretion through different pathways in vivo and in vitro. In in vitro study, a combined administration of secretin and carbachol or cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK- 8) {{to the culture}} medium of chief cells potentiated pepsinogen secretion. Moreover, the response induced by carbachol or CCK- 8 with forskolin was greater than that with secretin. We {{examined the}} interaction among receptor-related second mediators, and found that carbachol-or CCK- 8 -induced intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) increase was not affected by secretin or forskolin. Both these substances, however, significantly reduced secretin-induced cAMP production. On the contrary, CCK- 8 significantly increased forskolin-induced cAMP production, while carbachol increased it slightly. Calcium ionophore, A 23187, or protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA), did not alter secretin-or forskolin-induced cellular cAMP production; and the reductive effect of carbachol or CCK- 8 on secretin-induced cAMP production was restored by their competitive antagonists, atropine or <b>lorglumide.</b> EC 50 of those antagonists was almost the same value as IC 50 on pepsinogen secretion and [Ca 2 +] i increase. These results indicate that secretin-induced cAMP production is interfered with by receptor related agonists like CCK- 8 and carbachol. It may be suggested {{that there is a}} kind of "cross-talk, " between the adenylate cyclase system, that is, the secretin receptor, and carbachol or CCK- 8 receptor. The interactions between secretin and other secretagogues (carbachol, CCK- 8, tetragastrin and histamine) were examined using the perfused rat stomach. The infusion of CCK- 8 induced high pepsin secretion initially, which gradually decreased; with a simultaneous injection of secretin, however, high pepsin secretion was maintained. High pepsin secretion induced by an infusion of carbachol was obtained when secretin was injected simultaneously. Although tetragastrin or histamine did not stimulate significant pepsin secretion, pepsinogen secretion was stimulated if secretin injected simultaneously. These results suggest that pepsinogen secretion in the rat is not controlled only by pepsinogen secretagogues but by its combination with acid secretagogues...|$|E

IQM- 95, 333 displaced [3 H]-CCK- 8 S binding to CCKA receptors from rat pancreas with a high potency in the nanomolar range. Conversely, the affinity of this new compound at brain CCKB receptors was negligible (IC 50 > 10 [*]μM). IQM- 95, 333 was a more selective CCKA receptor ligand than devazepide and other CCKA receptor antagonists. Like devazepide, IQM- 95, 333 was a more potent antagonist of CCK- 8 S- than of CCK- 4 -induced contraction of the longitudinal muscle from guinea-pig ileum, suggesting selective antagonism at CCKA receptors. IQM- 95, 333 and devazepide were also potent inhibitors of CCK- 8 S-stimulated amylase release from isolated pancreatic acini, a CCKA receptor-mediated effect. The drug concentrations required (IC 50 s around 20 [*]nM) were higher than in binding studies to pancreas homogenates. Low doses (50 – 100 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) of IQM- 95, 333 and devazepide, without any intrinsic effect on food intake or locomotion, blocked the hypophagia and the hypolocomotion induced by systemic administration of CCK- 8 S, two effects associated with stimulation of peripheral CCKA receptors. IQM- 95, 333 showed an anxiolytic-like profile in the light/dark exploration test in mice over a wide dose range (10 – 5, 000 [*]μg[*]kg− 1). Typical CCKA and CCKB antagonists, devazepide and L- 365, 260 respectively, were only effective within a more limited dose range. In a classical conflict paradigm {{for the study of}} anxiolytic drugs, the punished-drinking test, IQM- 95, 333, devazepide and L- 365, 260 were effective within a narrow dose range. The dose-response curve for the three drugs was biphasic, suggesting that other mechanisms are operative at higher doses. In conclusion, IQM- 95, 333 is a potent and selective CCKA receptor antagonist both in vitro and in vivo with an anxiolytic-like activity in two different animal models, which can only be attributed to blockade of this CCK receptor subtype...|$|E
40|$|Obesity is a world-wide {{health problem}} with {{tremendous}} health care costs. Weight maintenance {{is a complex}} system in which different mechanisms are involved. One of these mechanisms involves the cholecystokinin receptor type 1 (CCK 1 R). The CCK 1 R is a GPCR (G-protein coupled receptor) localized in the gastrointestinal tract that induces a feeling of satiety upon activation by its natural hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). Bioactive peptides, which can be released from food protein, can mimic the effect of CCK and have an influence on satiety. Such peptides {{could be used as}} a satiating ingredient in the development of new functional foods for the prevention and treatment of obesity. We set up a cell-based bioassay in 96 well-plates to screen for such bioactive peptides that can activate the CCK 1 R, based on the fluorescent visualization of a Ca-flux when the receptor is activated. Fluorescence measurements were done using a plate reader and a confocal microscope and the assay was benchmarked with CCK- 8 S (sulfated octapeptide), JMV- 180 and <b>lorglumide.</b> The confocal microscope appeared to be the preferred measuring device when complex samples had to be measured, as measurements with the plate reader could easily be biased by background fluorescence of the sample. Screening of different food protein hydrolysates showed that some food protein hydrolysates, such as soy protein hydrolysates, possess significant CCK 1 R activity. The peptides in the active soy protein hydrolysates were separated by use of size exclusion chromatography, the CCK 1 R activity of the resulting fractions was re-evaluated and significant in vitro CCK 1 R activity was found. The effect on food intake of the active fractions with a physiological relevant molecular weight was evaluated in vivo with rats, but no significant effect could be measured. The amino acid sequences of the peptides present in some promising fractions was identified, however it remained not possible to identify which particular peptide(s) accounted for the CCK 1 R activity as more than 100 peptides were still present in the fractions. Hence, a highly-selective tool to extract and identify the active peptides was necessary. Therefore, a first onset was made to incorporate the CCK 1 R into NABBs (nanoscale apo-lipoprotein bound bilayer particles), a unique native-like bilayer membrane system for incorporation of GPCRs, as such nanoparticles {{could be used as a}}n affinity-selection-mass spectrometry technique to identify CCK 1 R-binding peptides.

These data are consistent with an autocrine role for gastrin in the control of AR 4 - 2 J cell growth. These results were supported by studies with gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists. Six non-peptide gastrin/CCK receptor antagonists inhibited AR 4 - 2 J cell growth in a concentration-related manner. The concentration required for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) of cell growth by the amino acid-derived antagonists proglumide (3. 5 x 10 (- 3) M), benzotript (1. 8 x 10 (- 3) M), loxiglumide (1. 1 x 10 (- 4) M) and <b>lorglumide</b> (6. 7 x 10 (- 5) M) were of the same order and significantly correlated with their IC 50 for inhibition of 125 I-gastrin binding to AR 4 - 2 J cells. Inhibition of cell growth by these antagonists was partially reversed {{by the addition of}} exogenous gastrin. In contrast, the IC 50 for inhibition of cell growth with two benzodiazepine-derived antagonists, the CCK-B receptor antagonist L- 365, 260 (4. 6 x 10 (- 5) M) and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (1. 7 x 10 (- 5) M) were two-three orders of magnitude greater than those required to inhibit gastrin binding (10 (- 8) - 10 (- 7) M). The growth inhibitory effects of L- 365, 260 and devazepide were not reversed by exogenous gastrin suggesting these benzodiazepine-derived antagonists do not inhibit cell growth by interaction with gastrin receptors. The results are consistent with gastrin being an autocrine growth factor in AR 4 - 2 J cells, and that stimulation of cell growth is due to stimulation of the gastrin, rather than CCK-B, receptor sub-type. This study highlights that gastrin receptor antagonists warrant further investigation as agents to control growth of tumours, such as those from the gastrointestinal tract, which express gastrin receptors...|$|E
