However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E

5|$|During {{the scene}} where Ray's stolen minivan is {{attacked}} by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps, oil lanterns, flashlights and Maglights. The IL crew admitted that {{the destruction of the}} Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film.|$|E

The relations of the homogenized model with microlocal parameters for the case of <b>layering</b> parallel <b>to</b> the boundary are transformed to conform to requirements of the composite geometry. The plane problem of periodically stratified half-space with slant layering heated by given boundary temperature is solved analytically. The obtained results are analyzed and compared with the solutions for special cases: (1) homogenized half-space, (2) half-space with parallel <b>layering</b> <b>to</b> the boundary, (3) half-space with vertical <b>layering</b> <b>to</b> the boundary...|$|R
5|$|Rounded arches, vaults, and domes {{distinguish}} Roman architecture {{from that}} of Ancient Greece and were facilitated {{by the use of}} concrete and brick. By varying the weight of the aggregate material in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> be laid at the top of concrete domes. But concrete domes also required expensive wooden formwork, also called shuttering, to be built and kept in place during the curing process, which would usually have to be destroyed to be removed. Formwork for brick domes need not be kept in place as long and could be more easily reused.|$|E

5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed to have a high contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} the original PlayStation era graphics of Rally 2.0 would not hold up to modern standards on a high pixel density mobile display. To improve the graphical quality they introduced modern shader-based rendering and overhauled the textures. The engine specifications for the vehicles were retained from the classic Rally games. Although the models for the vehicles were also preserved, developers increased their resolution and added more detail and graphical <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> the car bodies. Other features that were carried over include the chassis deformation effects and realistic buildup of dirt on the vehicles. PhysX-based collision detection was implemented to enable more objects and debris to scatter. Changes were also made to lighting, audio, controls, and user interface. The team decided to omit a number of Rally 2.0 features, such as multiplayer, manual transmission, variable gear ratios, weather reports, and the cockpit camera view. Game producer Pete Harrison cited creating a polished, core rallying experience for mobile as {{the focal point of}} the project and felt that some features would not be suitable for the short play sessions that they expected from a portable racing game.|$|E

25|$|Once {{they have}} {{exhausted}} their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion, medium- to low-mass stars shed their outer <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> form a planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs. While most clusters become dispersed before {{a large proportion}} of their members have reached the white dwarf stage, the number of white dwarfs in open clusters is still generally much lower than would be expected, given the age of the cluster and the expected initial mass distribution of the stars. One possible explanation for the lack of white dwarfs is that when a red giant expels its outer <b>layers</b> <b>to</b> become a planetary nebula, a slight asymmetry in the loss of material could give the star a 'kick' of a few kilometres per second, enough to eject it from the cluster.|$|E
