5000|$|The {{time period}} of the Gen X {{childhood}} saw an increase in <b>latchkey</b> <b>children,</b> leading to the terminology of the [...] "latchkey generation" [...] for Generation X. These <b>latchkey</b> <b>children</b> lacked adult supervision in the hours {{between the end of}} the school day and when a parent returned home from work in the evening, and for longer periods of time during the summer. <b>Latchkey</b> <b>children</b> became common among all socioeconomic demographics, but were particularly common among middle and upper class children. The higher the educational attainment of the parents, the higher the odds the children of this time would be <b>latchkey</b> <b>children,</b> due to increased maternal participation in the workforce at a time before childcare options outside the home were widely available. McCrindle Research Center described the cohort as [...] "the first to grow up without a large adult presence, with both parents working", stating this led to Gen Xers being more peer-oriented than previous generations.|$|R

5000|$|The {{effects of}} being a <b>latchkey</b> <b>child</b> differ with age. Loneliness, boredom and fear are most common for those younger than 10 years of age. In the early teens, {{there is a greater}} {{susceptibility}} to peer pressure, potentially resulting in such behaviors as alcohol abuse, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and smoking. The behaviors might stem from [...] "unspent energy, peer pressure to misbehave, or hostility {{because of the lack of}} appropriate adult attention". However, some children experience positive effects, such as an early development of self-reliance, adaptation to difficult situations, and a desire to contribute to a visible need in the household.|$|E

[...] Additionally, Nara was raised in the isolated countryside as a <b>latchkey</b> <b>child</b> of working-class parents, so he was often left alone with little to do but explore his young imagination.

The selected demographics were respondents' years of experience as a principal, age, gender, and highest level of education; grade levels and student enrollment in the school; type of district, student enrollment in the district, and operating expense per pupil of the district. The findings of the study indicated that few policies are being developed by school districts on <b>latchkey</b> <b>children.</b> Secondly, few principals identify latchkey students in their buildings for purposes of providing programs or services. Thirdly, principals tend to feel that there is a need to develop policies and to identify latchkey students, but that the operation of latchkey programs should be left to communities and not be a function of the school. Finally, though the most common program for latchkey students is an after-school program, few school districts have developed any type of program for latchkey students...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{prevalence}} and correlates (demographic, personality, and academic) of former latchkey status (children unsupervised by an adult after school during their elementary or middle school years) in a college student sample (N = 188).

Students were surveyed and administered a personality questionnaire, and their academic aptitude test scores were verified through university records. Twenty-five percent of the male and 14 % of the female participants were identified as former latchkey children, resulting in an 18 % latchkey prevalence rate. The mean age of onset of latchkey status was 8. 7 years for the male and 10. 0 years for the female subjects.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{focus of}} this study was to examine the {{literacy}} practices found in the homes of families with 1. 5 generation Korean American parents with three to five year old children. A close examination at the parent's own history as a 1. 5 generation Korean American and their experiences in literacy and the duality of their culture provided a base on the literacy practices in the home. The literacy events and the print environment of the home also provided an insight into the family's literacy practices. The subjects in this study included three Korean American families residing in and around Los Angeles. Data were collected during the spring of 2007 and a follow-up session occurred one year afterwards during the spring of 2008. The first set of data was collected during an eight to ten week period where the investigator met with the families in their homes for approximately two to three hours. Two follow-up sessions occurred for two hours at the homes of the families. The research used a case study methodology to collect the data using interviews, observations, and document analysis. Five findings were obtained from this study. First, the 1. 5 generation Korean Americans all experienced literacy and communication struggles growing up as an immigrant. Second, the parents experienced difficulties growing up with a dual culture and as a <b>latchkey</b> <b>child.</b> Third, the 1. 5 generation Korean Americans all expressed how the lack of cultural capital by their parents left them without the tools necessary to navigate through the school system and the American culture. Fourth, literacy events were often found in the homes of the 1. 5 generation Korean Americans suggesting that the parents are aware of the importance of literacy at an early age. Lastly, the HOME Inventory found that all the families made a point to provide abundant stimulation and support to support their child in her literacy and personal development.; Implications are discussed to caution the use of the data for all 1. 5 generation Korean Americans. Recommendations for future research include a further examination on the effects of growing up as a <b>latchkey</b> <b>child,</b> the effects of navigating through a new culture and school without cultural capital, the second generation's acquisition of the Korean language, further research on three to five year old boys, and examining the 1. 5 generation Korean Americans residing in such places like New York, Chicago, Brazil, and Argentina to see if immigration and literacy practices are different by geographic location...|$|E
40|$|Activity {{monitoring}} in home environments {{has become}} increas-ingly important {{and has the}} potential to support a broad array of ap-plications including elder care, well-being management, and <b>latchkey</b> <b>child</b> safety. Traditional approaches involve wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This paper presents device-free location-oriented activity identification at home through the use of existing WiFi access points and WiFi devices (e. g., desktops, ther-mostats, refrigerators, smartTVs, laptops). Our low-cost system takes advantage of the ever more complex web of WiFi links be-tween such devices and the increasingly fine-grained channel state information that can be extracted from such links. It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activi-ties and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accom-modate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of dif-ferent size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96 % average true positive rate and less than 1 % average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our sys-tem can work with wider signal band (802. 11 ac) with even higher accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Childhood {{obesity is}} a serious problem that affects {{increasingly}} more and more children in the United States today. According to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, “Over the past 3 decades, the childhood obesity rate has more than doubled for preschool children aged 2 - 5 years and adolescents aged 12 - 19 years, and it has more than tripled for children aged 6 - 11 years. ” Today there are anywhere from 8 to 10 million children, 6 years of age and older, who are suffering from childhood obesity. Why is obesity such a serious problem? Besides children having to deal with the emotional day to day struggles of living with obesity (peer humiliation, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc [...] ), they are also at a higher risk of developing many other serious health problems; such as, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, and orthopedic problems just to name a few.

40|$|Many {{children}} of working parents regularly care for themselves after school. Questionable findings {{about the danger}} of children's self-care (latchkey) arrangements are being used in an effort to obtain public funding for after-school care. The use of this evidence poses a dilemma for feminists and others. Arguing that <b>latchkey</b> <b>children</b> are at risk may improve the chances of receiving funds for child care. But it could also lead to unintended negative consequences for women. Emphasizing the risks of self-care could result in greater social opposition to working mothers. From a feminist perspective, the best argument for after-school care would be one that focuses on the special needs and circumstances of working parents, and does not rely on suspect data that suggest negative consequences of self-care for children's development.

40|$|THE {{thesis that}} there is a {{relationship}} between the rate of crime committed by women and women's emancipation is not new to criminological literature.

On the one hand {{it has been argued that}} wage-earning mothers create <b>latchkey</b> <b>children</b> who become tomorrow's delinquents and social misfits, while on the other it has been maintained that women themselves become more criminally oriented because of their association with " masculine " values at work and their contact with opportunities for crime outside the home.

40|$|Self care {{is one of}} {{the options}} for parents in need of after school care for their children. In certain studies self care is seen as {{detrimental}} to development and academic performance, but in other studies children do fairly well notwithstanding their latchkey situation - self care could teach young people a sense of personal responsibility and self reliance. In this article we emphasise the negative influence of self care, especially for primary school children. The after-school hours alone at home can be very risky for children living in low income, dangerous, or disadvantaged environments. Children being left alone for more than three hours often present with low self esteem, low academic efficacy and high levels of depression. They are often not well adjusted and sometimes present with behavioural problems. Educators have expressed concern about the academic adjustment and achievement of self-care children.

40|$|Although {{children}} left at {{home without}} adult supervision may function very well, {{studies have shown}} potential problems with self-care and <b>latchkey</b> <b>children.</b> This study investigated the attitudes of 30 employed parents in New York whose first or third grade children were regularly left home alone after school. The 20 -question survey covered such areas as parents' perceptions of their children's ability {{to take care of}} themselves, use of older siblings as caregivers, activities the child was allowed to engage in while home alone (such as television viewing or playing outside), availability of outside help in case of emergency, satisfaction with the latchkey arrangement, and opinions on after-school programs. Results indicated that while most parents perceived child self-care as a positive experience for their children, most felt guilty, concerned, or ambivalent about leaving their children home alone. Respondents were also dissatisfied with the local school-based after-school program. In terms of common activities while home alone, most children were not allowed outside but were allowed to watch television for entertainment.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focused on}} substance use among children who regularly care for themselves after school (<b>latchkey</b> <b>children).</b> The data, collected from 4932 eighth-grade students, indicated that self-care {{is an important}} risk factor for alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use. Data collected from 2185 parents validated these findings. Eighth-grade students, {{who took care of}} themselves for 11 or more hours a week, were at twice the risk of substance use as those who did not take care of themselves at all. This relationship held at all levels of sociodemographic status, extracurricular activities, sources of social influence, and stress. Of the 186 stratified tests of the relationship, 90 % were significant; even those not found to be significant were in the direction expected. Path analyses suggest that risk-taking, having friends who smoke, and being offered cigarettes may partially explain the relationship between self-care and substance use. Those eighth-grade students who select friends who smoke and place themselves in situations in which they are offered cigarettes may be manifesting a desire to display their sense of maturity and independence. The fact that the increase in substance use occurred among almost all strata tested and the fact that mediation was not complete suggest that more than one mechanism may account for the associated increase in substance use. It is also possible that more time in self-care results in more unnoticed solitary trials of substances, as well as trials motivated by peer offers or peer pressure to use substances...|$|R
40|$|Ann Lane Petry was {{the first}} Black female author to address the {{problems}} African-American women face as they struggle to cope with life in the inner city. Her novel, The Street, published in 1946, {{was the first}} book by an African-American woman to sell over 1. 5 million copies. Ann Lane was born into a middle class family in 1908 in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, where her father, Peter Lane, opened a pharmacy in 1902. Her mother, Bertha James Lane, was a hairdresser, chiropodist, and entrepreneur. Her family {{was one of the few}} Black families in the white, shoreline community. At school Ann Lane had a reputation as a voracious reader. She graduated with a Ph. D. in Pharmacology from the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, following in the footsteps of her aunt, Anna Louise James who graduated from Brooklyn College of Pharmacy and who became Connecticut’s first female druggist. Ann Lane worked as a pharmacist for several years in her father’s business. All the time she was mixing prescriptions, she was observing her customers and writing short stories on the side, which was the basis for her book Country Place. In 1938, Ann Lane married George Petry, a mystery writer. The couple moved to Harlem and her life changed dramatically. Ann did not follow convention or tradition by fading into the background or living in her husband’s shadow. She left the field of pharmacology and began her writing career in earnest. She secured a job writing advertising copy for the influential Black newspaper The Amsterdam News. She later worked as a reporter and editor of the women’s pages of the People’s Voice, a rabble-rousing newspaper founded by Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., the future Congressman from Harlem. This work led to her deep immersion in Harlem life. During the period 1938 to 1944, Mrs. Petry published her short stories in The Crisis, the journal of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Opportunity, the magazine of the Urban League; and other periodicals. She also wrote articles on Harlem describing both its squalor and its wealth. She also worked in a special after-school program in the heart of Harlem and later wrote about <b>latchkey</b> <b>children</b> being raised in foster homes or by their mothers, who were working. In 1943, in The Crisis, she wrote “On Saturday, the Sirens at Noon” which won her a $ 2, 500 Houghton-Mifflin literary award that led to a contract for The Street. The Street was published to critical and popular acclaim in 1946. A runaway success, it sold 1. 5 million copies – the first novel by a Black woman to have achieved this distinction – and secured Mrs. Petry’s literary reputation. During the following year, she also distinguished herself as a writer of short fiction, winning critical accolades for her story, “Like A Winding Sheet,” which was published in Best American Short Stories of 1946. She followed the success of The Street with two other novels, Country Place (1947), and The Narrows (1953). Although she ached to be a published writer, when The Street made her the best-selling Black American woman novelist of her day, the celebrity it brought repulsed her. The financial success of The Street provided Mrs. Petry and her husband the means to purchase a 200 -year old house in Old Saybrook, where they returned in 1948. She continued to write. After the birth of her daughter, Elisabeth, her focus was on books for children and young adults. Ann’s goal in writing historical novels for young readers was to nurture their knowledge of and pride in the achievements and humanity of Black women throughout history. She wrote: The Drugstore Cat (1949), Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad (1955), and Tituba of Salem Village (1964). She also published a collection of her short stories, Legends of the Saints (1970), and another collection, Miss Muriel and Other Stories (1971). The reissue of The Street in the mid 1980 s triggered another round of critical acclaim by a new generation of readers and renewed attention by academics. In the early 1990 s there was a flurry of activity around Mrs. Petry’s work. She was given a Connecticut Arts Award in 1992 and a symposium on her writings was held at Trinity College in 1992. Mrs. Petry was appointed a visiting professor of English at the University of Hawaii (1944 - 45) and she lectured widely throughout the United States. Her contribution to literature has been acknowledged by membership in the Author’s Guild and American P. E. N. (Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists), and by honorary doctorates from several colleges and universities. When Mrs. Petry died in 1997 in Old Saybrook, a short distance from the James Pharmacy, which still bears her aunt’s name. She was widely regarded as a pioneering figure in the twentieth-century African-American writing. [URL]...|$|R
