25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{there was}} {{considerable}} interest {{in the role of}} chronic Otitis media (middle ear disease or 'glue ear') in causing APD and related language and <b>literacy</b> <b>problems.</b> Otitis media with effusion is a very common childhood disease that causes a fluctuating conductive hearing loss, and there was concern this may disrupt auditory development if it occurred during a sensitive period. Consistent with this, in a sample of young children with chronic ear infections recruited from a hospital otolargyngology department, increased rates of auditory difficulties were found later in childhood. However, this kind of study will suffer from sampling bias because children with otitis media {{will be more likely to}} be referred to hospital departments if they are experiencing developmental difficulties. Compared with hospital studies, epidemiological studies, which assesses a whole population for otitis media and then evaluate outcomes, have found much weaker evidence for long-term impacts of otitis media on language outcomes.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} core {{bottleneck}} of literacy-impairment should be {{situated at the}} phonological level or at a more basic sensory level, as postulated by supporters of the auditory temporal processing theory. Phonological ability, speech perception and low-level auditory processing were assessed {{in a group of}} 5 -year-old pre-school children at high-family risk for dyslexia, compared to a group of well-matched low-risk control children. Based on family risk status and first grade literacy achievement children were categorized in groups and pre-school data were retrospectively reanalyzed. On average, children showing both increased family risk and literacy-impairment at the end of first grade, presented significant pre-school deficits in phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, speech-in-noise perception and frequency modulation detection. The concurrent presence of these deficits before receiving any formal reading instruction, might suggest a causal relation with problematic literacy development. However, a closer inspection of the individual data indicates that the core of the <b>literacy</b> <b>problem</b> is situated at the level of higher-order phonological processing. Although auditory and speech perception problems are relatively over-represented in literacy-impaired subjects and might possibly aggravate the phonological and <b>literacy</b> <b>problem,</b> it is unlikely that they would be at the basis of these problems. At a neurobiological level, results are interpreted as evidence for dysfunctional processing along the auditory-to-articulation stream that is implied in phonological processing, in combination with a relatively intact or inconsistently impaired functioning of the auditory-to-meaning stream that subserves auditory processing and speech perception. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addressed the}} following research question: which specific variable has the greatest predictive power of mathematical <b>literacy</b> and <b>problem</b> solving competency while controlling for socioeconomic status (SES) ? The variables that were studied were categorized as follows: demographic and personal history variables, attitudinal variables, behavioral variables, and school organization and structure variables. Much of the existing literature cites SES {{as the most powerful}} predictor of math achievement. Using multiple linear regression modeling, this study found that many variables studied were determined to be significant predictors of mathematical <b>literacy</b> and/or <b>problem</b> solving competency while controlling for SES. Every category of variables had at least one statistically significant predictor: demographic and personal history variables, attitudinal variables, behavioral variables, and school organization and structure variables. The attitudinal variables had the most significant predictors of math <b>literacy</b> and <b>problem</b> solving competency and categorically proved to be the most powerful. The statistically significant predictors were categorized as major predictors and minor predictors of mathematical achievement. The variables with a significant but less powerful effect on math achievement are designated as minor predictors; these minor predictors include: gender, immigration status, student attribution to failure, perceived math support, number of minutes in math class, math education of teachers, and class size. The variables with the greatest significant and powerful effect on math achievement are designated as major predictors; these major predictors include: socioeconomic status, math self-efficacy, math anxiety, and math teacher certification. The associated predictive powers of the major predictors were greater than the predictive power of SES, the control variable. Even when not controlling for SES, the attitudes of students’ self-efficacy was the most powerful predictor of math <b>literacy</b> and <b>problem</b> solving competency. These results hold substantial implications in the areas of math <b>literacy</b> and <b>problem</b> solving competency for practitioners of math education and academic researchers.

40|$|Purpose of review: This review {{examines}} recent {{evidence on}} the comorbidity between <b>literacy</b> <b>problems</b> and psychiatric disorder in childhood and discusses possible contributory factors. Recent findings: Recent studies confirm the substantial overlap of <b>literacy</b> <b>problems</b> {{with a range of}} emotional/behavioural difficulties in childhood. <b>Literacy</b> <b>problems</b> and inattention may share genetic influences, contributing to associations with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. To an extent, links with conduct problems may be also mediated by attentional difficulties. In addition, findings suggest bidirectional influences whereby disruptive behaviours impede reading progress and reading failure exacerbates risk for behaviour problems. Associations between <b>literacy</b> <b>problems</b> and anxiety disorders are not entirely mediated by inattentiveness. Rather, comorbid anxiety disorders seem likely to arise from the stressors associated with reading failure. Findings in relation to depression are less consistent, but suggest that poor readers may be vulnerable to low mood. Children with autism seem more likely to face problems in reading comprehension than the decoding difficulties more prominent in other disorders. Summary: <b>Literacy</b> <b>problems</b> are associated with increased risks of both externalizing and internalizing disorders in childhood, with different mechanisms likely to be implicated in each case. When comorbid problems occur, each is likely to require separate treatment...|$|E

40|$|Data {{from two}} twin studies are {{examined}} to assess genetic and environmental influences on literacy, and the etiological relationship between language and literacy. Study 1 used children from 86 families previously recruited {{for a study}} of the genetics of specific language impairment (see Bishop, North, & Donlam, 1995), who completed tests of single-word reading and spelling. <b>Literacy</b> <b>problems</b> in this sample were common, were strongly heritable, and showed a close genetic relationship with poor nonword repetition. Study 2 included two subsets of children: 37 twin pairs who had taken part in study 1, 3 to 4 years earlier, and 100 twin pairs recruited from the general population by Bishop et al. (1999). All children were given a standardised test of nonword reading. There was no genetic influence on nonword reading ability, either across the normal range, or at the lower extreme, though there were significant associations with some social variables. However, bivariate DeFries-Fulker analysis suggested that in this study, as in study 1, there was shared genetic variance between poor nonword repetition and literacy deficits. It is concluded that poor nonword repetition, which is known to be highly heritable, puts the child at risk for <b>literacy</b> <b>problems.</b> However, in a general population sample, such as that included in study 2, poor nonword repetition is a relatively rare correlate of <b>literacy</b> <b>problems,</b> which {{are more likely to have}} an environmental origin.

Text comprehension was tested by three texts which are called the Skobigotexts. Three reading settings were applied: listening, silent reading and silent reading with textsupport. Following the texts, literal and inference questions were asked. The first text was read out loud to each participant, the next text was read silently and the last text was also read in silence but the participants were allowed to have the text {{in front of them}} whilst answering the questions. Further, phonological awareness and decoding ability was examined. Whether the comprehension differed within and between the groups regarding reading setting and type of question was looked upon. The results showed that all groups were benefited by silent reading with textsupport and performed better on literal questions. Furthermore, it was found that participants without and with <b>literacy</b> <b>problems</b> performed equivalent regarding text comprehension. However did grade 7 and 8 perform significantly worse than standard average for grade 6. Although the study generated low scores, a conclusion was drawn that secondary school students without or with <b>literacy</b> <b>problems</b> didn’t have any substantial difficulties to interpret and answer questions regarding these texts.

Textförståelse undersöktes genom tre texter som kallas Skobigotexterna. Texterna presenterades genom tre olika lässätt och efter varje text fick deltagarna svara på tillhörande fakta- och inferensfrågor. Den första texten fick deltagarna uppläst, nästa text fick de läsa tyst och den sista texten fick de också läsa tyst men ha kvar framför sig som stöd vid besvarande av frågor. Vidare undersöktes fonologisk medvetenhet och avkodningsförmåga. Huruvida förståelsen skiljde sig åt mellan och inom grupperna vad gällande lässätt och frågetyp undersöktes. Resultaten visade att samtliga grupper gynnades av tyst läsning med textstöd och presterade bättre på faktafrågor jämfört med inferensfrågor. Vidare konstaterades att deltagare utan respektive med läs- och skrivsvårigheter presterade likvärdigt på textförståelsetestet. Vidare var normeringsgruppernas medelvärde signifikant lägre än normerat medelvärde för årskurs 6. Trots att textförståelsetestet genererade låga poäng drogs en slutsats om att högstadieelever utan respektive med läs- och skrivsvårigheter ej hade några väsentliga svårigheter att tolka samt svara på frågor om texterna.
