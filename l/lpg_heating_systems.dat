In Jordan, residential space heating accounts for about two thirds of the total residential energy consumption; with kerosene being the most popular fuel used, followed by <b>LPG,</b> for <b>heating</b> purposes. This paper is intended to evaluate space <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> used in Jordan based on a multi-criteria analysis, using two different methods: the fuzzy sets and analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The benefits and costs of each system are considered, and the overall benefit-to-cost ratios are determined. Analyses using both methods showed that <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> based on renewable energy, i. e., wind and solar energy, are most favorable, followed by traditional stoves burning petroleum products and finally the worst <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> is the electric heater. On percentage basis, the cost-to-benefit ratio of wind-based <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> is 4. 3 % and 3. 9 % as obtained by fuzzy sets and by AHP methods, respectively, compared to 28. 5 % and 18. 6 % for electric heating devices, under identical operating conditions.

40|$|Linear {{programming}} <b>Heating</b> <b>systems</b> At substations {{of district}} <b>heating</b> <b>systems,</b> water is <b>heated</b> and transferred by pumps through piping networks to the buildings of each local <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> When they were designed, the operational parameters and system characteris-tics {{of the local}} <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> were selected to provide thermal comfort in all the buildings served by the local <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> After several years of opera-tion, however, these parameters and characteristics change and, as a result, thermal comfort {{may be expected to}} deteriorate. This study investigates one strategy to mitigate this problem; that of retrofitting the local <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> with additional circulation pumps to provide greater system control and, thereby, improved thermal comfort. Using a steady-state, bottom-up ap-proach, heat transfer in the local <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> is described by a system of equations that are then linearized. Mixed integer linear programming is then applied to these equations, implemented in the program PUMP, and used to optimize system characteristics.

When dealing with modeling of a district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> there are two methods that are most common, the Danish- and the German methods. These methods allow for simplification of the network shape, still with good accuracy in system behavior compared to real system behavior. A disadvantage with these two methods is that they cannot handle a district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> that contains loops without making changes compared to the real physical system. A method that allows modeling of loops in the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> has been developed, using the remind-software. This method makes it possible to analyze how loops in the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> are behaving, without making physical changes when modeling the district <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> The model will be used as a default model for redesigning the district <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> when moving the town.
