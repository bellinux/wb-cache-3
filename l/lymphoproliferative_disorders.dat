2500|$|In 2006 a {{total of}} 50,417 first hematopoietic stem cell transplants were {{reported}} as taking place worldwide, according to a global survey of 1327 centers in 71 countries conducted by the Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. [...] Of these, 28,901 (57 percent) were autologous and 21,516 (43 percent) were allogeneic (11,928 from family donors and 9,588 from unrelated donors). [...] The main indications for transplant were <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders</b> (54.5 percent) and leukemias (33.8 percent), and the majority took place in either Europe (48 percent) or the Americas (36 percent).|$|E
2500|$|Lymphomas in {{the strict}} sense are any {{neoplasms}} of the lymphatic tissues ( [...] + [...] ) [...] The main classes are malignant neoplasms (that is, cancers) of the lymphocytes, {{a type of}} white blood cell that belongs to both the lymph and the blood and pervades both. Thus, lymphomas and leukemias are both tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, and as <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorders,</b> lymphomas and lymphoid leukemias are closely related, to the point that some of them are unitary disease entities that can be called by either name (for example, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).|$|E
40|$|Background. We {{investigated}} sensitivity, specificity, positive {{predictive value}}, negative predictive value {{and accuracy of}} 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in 170 cases with suspected or biopsy-proven posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder.</b> Design and Methods. All solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who underwent an 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan between 2003 and 2010 in our center for the indication posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder,</b> were retrospectively reviewed and results were compared with tissue biopsy, whenever possible. One hundred-seventy positron emission tomography-scans in hundred-fifty patients were eligible for evaluation. In 45 cases, the patient had a biopsy-confirmed posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> before positron emission tomography scanning and positron emission tomography was performed for staging purposes. In the remaining 125 cases, positron emission tomography was performed to differentiate between posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> and other diseases. 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake was quantitatively expressed by calculation of maximum and mean standardized uptake value in the most intense lesion, or, {{in the absence of}} attenuation corrected positron emission tomography scans by comparing uptake in target lesion to liver and mediastinal uptake. Results. We found an overall sensitivity of 89 %, specificity of 89 %, positive predictive value of 91 % and negative predictive value of 87 % for posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> detection by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. In a subanalysis of the 125 scans performed for differentiating posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> from other diseases, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 90 %, 89 %, 85 % and 93 % respectively. 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-uptake in posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> was generally high with a median mean and maximum standardized uptake value of 9. 0 [range 2. 0 - 18. 6] and 17. 4 [range 2. 6 - 26. 4]. Posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> often had an atypical presentation on positron emission tomography with high incidence of extranodal involvement. Conclusions. From these data, we can conclude that 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography is highly sensitive for detecting posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> and has an excellent ability to differentiate posttransplant <b>lymphoproliferative</b> <b>disorder</b> from non-malignant diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
