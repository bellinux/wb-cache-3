5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the victim was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they deny any knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed <b>Lauter)</b> confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed <b>Lauter),</b> but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} {{recommended that}} priority {{be given to}} protecting the resources and industries of Lorraine that were vital for the French economy and would become more important for a war economy. The nature of fixed defences was debated during the 1920s, with advocates of the offensive use of fortifications, deep or shallow defences and centralised and decentralised designs. On 12 October 1927, the CSG adopted the system recommended by Pétain, of large and elaborately fortified defences from Metz to Thionville and Longwy, at <b>Lauter</b> and Belfort, on the north-east frontier, with covered infantry positions between the main fortifications. The Minister of War André Maginot (1922–1924, 1929–1930 and 1931–1932) became the driving force for obtaining the money to fortify the north-eastern frontier, sufficient to resist a German invasion for three weeks, to give time for the French army to mobilise. Work began in 1929 on the Région Fortifiée de Metz (Metz Fortified Region) through the Moselle valley to the Nied at Teting, then the Région Fortifiée de <b>Lauter,</b> east of Hagenau from Bitche to the Rhine, {{the extension of the}} Metz region to Longuyon and the <b>Lauter</b> region from Bitche to the Sarre at Wittring.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the concept and}} meaning of igal, an indigenous dance tradition of the Bajau <b>Laut</b> community in Semporna, Sabah. Igal or ‘dance’ to the Bajau <b>Laut</b> community signifies {{more than just a}} ‘dance’. This thesis posits that igal represents Bajau <b>Laut’s</b> culture, heritage, worldview, and cultural memory; through its epistemology and the construction of its form and content. The practice and performance of igal in Bajau <b>Laut</b> cultural landscape articulates the psychological impression of concept and meaning, and is signified as the Bajau <b>Laut</b> restored behavior. Thus, it is necessary to uncover the concept and meaning of igal through investigative studies on its practices and performances within the Bajau <b>Laut</b> traditional landscapes as well as stage performances. This thesis adopted Ferdinand de Saussure’s dyadic model of decoding the sign - signifier and signified; to investigate, interpret and understand the holistic conception of meaning of igal in the Bajau <b>Laut</b> society. This thesis also incorporated Richard Schechner’s concepts of performativity and restored behavior to elucidate the culturally structured movement system of the Bajau <b>Laut</b> community as a performative, symbolic and reflexive “performance. ” This thesis attempts to discuss that igal as a structured movement system, is a performative expressions of an explicit and implicit coded aspect of Bajau <b>Laut</b> cultur...|$|R
25|$|After leaving Rodenbach, Hoche's column {{encountered}} impassable {{roads in}} the Voog Forest and had to detour around the obstacle. His troops stayed {{on the west bank}} of the <b>Lauter</b> and never got into action on the 28th. By strenuous efforts, Ambert crossed the <b>Lauter</b> and moved south through Katzweiler and Sambach. He gamely attacked across the Otterbach stream several times but his 6,000 men were outnumbered by Kalckreuth. Menaced with encirclement, Ambert retreated and came in close proximity to Hoche's center column near Sambach. Despite the lack of success, Hoche determined to deliver the main attack from his left wing the next day. Accordingly, he made preparations to cross the Sambach bridge to join Ambert.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November the French army {{advanced}} in three columns against the Prussian position. with Taponier leading the right, Hoche {{the center and}} Ambert the left. Taponier moved against the village of Vogelweh while Ambert aimed to cross the <b>Lauter</b> at Hirschhorn. Taponier's column {{was the first to}} encounter the Prussians and to open the battle, meeting moderate success. The initial attack carried his troops onto the outer ridge of the Hoheneck heights. Taponier also came up against the Galgenberg (Gallows Hill) which was defended by a Prussian redoubt. Alarmed at the march of Ambert's column, Brunswick reacted by sending Kalckreuth north to block it. Kalckreuth's force took a new position with his left flank on the <b>Lauter,</b> his center at Morlautern and his right near Erlenbach. Another division was placed on the Kaiserberg, while Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar was left to defend the western approaches to Kaiserslautern.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 1945, the {{division}} pierced through Oberhoffen-sur-Moder and captured Lauterborn. The division then crossed the <b>Lauter</b> and advanced into Germany.

Furthermore, Sibu <b>Laut</b> River, which forms the western boundary of the Kuching Wetlands National Park, a wetland classified as a sensitive area also renders it of high research value. What happened to Sibu <b>Laut</b> River and its tributaries now? Is Sibu <b>Laut</b> River suffering from eutrophication, metals contamination or bacterial pollution? The level and the variability in the water quality over neap–spring tidal cycles in this river are yet to be explored in detail. Hence, physicochemical and major water quality data were collected and were employed to determine the water quality characteristics and current health status of the Sibu <b>Laut</b> River and its tributaries. The data presented here provide a snapshot of hydrodynamic conditions and water quality of the Sibu <b>Laut</b> River and its tributaries experienced during high and low tides.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{made by the}} General Staff in 1919 were {{reported}} to the CSG in 1920 and a commission of 1922, chaired by Marshal Joseph Joffre reported in December 1925, in favour of centres of resistance built in peacetime, not a continuous fortified front. From 17 December 1926 to 12 October 1927, the Frontier Defence Commission reported to the CSG that fortifications should be built from Metz to Thionville and Longwy, to protect the Moselle Valley and the mineral resources and industry of Lorraine. The area around the River <b>Lauter,</b> the most north-eastern part of the common border with Germany, should be fortified as an obvious invasion route {{but there was no}} need to fortify the Rhine, because of the Vosges mountains further west and the small number of railways on the German side. Belfort was near the Swiss frontier and partly protected by the Rhine but there was an avenue of invasion to the west, which should be protected. The commission gave emphasis to defence against a surprise attack, with the limited objective of capturing the Metz and <b>Lauter</b> areas.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March 1940 the SF Vosges was reorganized and {{designated}} the 43rd Army Fortress Corps (43e Corps d'Armée de Forteresse), inheriting some elements from the RF <b>Lauter</b> and {{giving up the}} 37th RIF to SF Rohrbach. At {{the midpoint of the}} Battle of France on 1 June 1940, the fortress troops of the 43rd CAF amounted to two fortress infantry regiments in six battalions, comprising 525 officers and 15,250 men. By 13 June the 43rd CAF included the hastily assembled divisions de marche Senselme and Chestenet, previously the fortress units of the SF Vosges and SF Rohrbach, as well as the 30th DIA.|$|E

Pichegru and Hoche met at Niederbronn on the 14th to arrange for their two armies to act together. A series a battles ensued in which François Joseph Lefebvre took command of Jacob's division and Jean-de-Dieu Soult led an independent detachment. The Battle of Froeschwiller ended on 22 December when the Army of the Moselle captured Froeschwiller, Woerth and Reichshoffen. This event prompted Wurmser to abandon Haguenau and begin retreating to the Lines of Wissembourg on the <b>Lauter</b> River, closely pursued by the Army of the Rhine.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the War of the Austrian Succession, the {{regiment}} served in Westphalia, Bavaria, and Bohemia until its return to France in July 1743. It was then sent to Alsace to serve as part of Marshal François de Franquetot de Coigny's army, overwintering at Dijon before being sent to the garrison of Belfort. It then participated in the taking of Wissembourg, and in the defense of the lines of the <b>Lauter,</b> and then the takings of Augenheim and Philippsburg. After overwintering in Pontarlier, the regiment was part of the taking of Kronembourg near Strasbourg in 1745. Called to Flanders in 1746, it figured in the siege of Mons and the battle of Rocoux. It fought in the battle of Lauffeld in 1747, and the siege of Maastricht in 1748, at the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|Hoche {{set up a}} 29-gun battery on the Osterberg height, {{starting}} a mutual bombardment that {{went on for a}} few hours. The French general then hurled a column of 10,000 troops at the Prussian left flank. This part of Kalckreuth's position between the <b>Lauter</b> and Morlautern was separated from the rest of his line by a ravine. Two regiments of Saxon cavalry charged Huet's division in the left flank. Hoche's chief of staff Gabriel Marie Joseph, comte d'Hédouville brought up some French cavalry squadrons from the Osterberg and hit the Saxons in their right flank. More horsemen from both sides joined the melee and ultimately the Saxons prevailed. Shaken by the cavalry charge, the French infantry withdrew to the Otterbach valley. The French attacks on Erlenbach also failed and by 6:00 PM the fusillade died down.|$|E
25|$|The first intimation {{that the}} British {{received}} that a withdrawal had begun was when British patrols probing German outposts towards Serre, found them unoccupied. They then began a slow follow-up but unreadiness, the decrepitude {{of the local}} roads and the German advantage of falling back on prepared lines behind rearguards of machine-gunners, meant that the Germans completed an orderly withdrawal. The new defences were built on a reverse slope (Hinterhanstellung) where there were positions behind the defences, from which artillery observers could see them, experience having showed that infantry equipped with machine-guns needed a field of fire {{only a few hundred}} yards/meters deep. Unfortunately, General Ludwig von <b>Lauter</b> and Colonel Kramer from OHL ignored the new thinking and in much of the new line, artillery observation posts in the front line or in front of it and the front position was on forward slopes, near crests or at the rear of long reverse slopes.|$|E
