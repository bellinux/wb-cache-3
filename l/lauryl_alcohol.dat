40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmThis {{study was}} based on Dioxy MP 14 (DMP), a brand of {{stabilized}} chlorine dioxide (SCD). The active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of DMP is chlorine dioxide (CD) which is a potent oxidant and biocide. These properties have proved invaluable for various applications. The main goals of this study were: {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of DMP for disinfecting Mycobateria tuberculosis (TB) contaminated medical instruments, devices, floors and surfaces; to investigate the stability of DMP; and to explore possibilities for medical application of DMP. Evaluation of disinfectant activity of DMP on TB was performed using the spectrophotometric method, a modification of the European suspension test, EN 14348. M. bovis BCG was employed as surrogate in this test. Results were as follows: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) = 12. 5 ppm; the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) = 15. 4 ppm; the Mycobactericidal Effect (ME) = 8. 8 log reduction; and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₉₀) x minimum exposure time (CT) = 12. 5 ppm. s. The long term stability study of DMP was performed by monitoring the rate of degradation of DMP stored in the fridge (2 - 8 °C), in the oven (40 °C), and under ambient conditions (15 - 30 °C). Analytical methods of assessing DMP concentration was by Iodometric titration method. The shelf life of DMP stored in a transparent bottle at room temperature was 9. 8 weeks, as opposed to 52. 7 weeks when stored in an amber colored reagent bottle at the same temperature. Both oven samples had an expiry date of about 20 weeks and the fridge samples about 70 weeks. Foam formulations for a vaginal douche (VGD), mouth rinse (MRF), and foot/sit bubble bath (F/SBB) ], were developed in the laboratory. DMP and the formulated concentrate were designed to be mixed just prior to administration. During foam evaluation studies, a mechanical overhead stirrer was used to generate foam. Foamability was assessed by quantifying the amount of foam generated. The stability of foams were assessed by: 1) determining the rate of foam decay and the rate of foam drainage observed concurrently from foam loaded in a measuring cylinder; and 2) determining the life span of single bubbles of each foam system i. e. the bubble breaking time (BBT). The density of each foam system was also determined. Potentiometric acid base titration was used to select suitable adjuster alkali, and to show the benefits of employing a buffer. Concentrate development was initiated by a simple mixture of all the ingredients followed by stirring and observing the deviations from desired quality attributes of the product. The subsequent five processes were improvements designed to circumvent the shortcomings of the initial procedure to arrive at the optimized method E. Prototype formulations were employed to optimize excipient quantities to eventually arrive at an optimized master formula. In foam evaluation, it was found that sodium lauryl sulphate/ammonium <b>lauryl</b> sulphate/cocoamidopropyl betaine/cetostearyl <b>alcohol</b> (SLS/ALS/CAPB/CSA) foam system was the most appropriate to use in the formulation. NaOH was selected as the adjuster solution and KHP as the buffer. The dosage formula (DF) of the VGD and F/SBB was determined to be MDF = 5 ml of 50 ppm DMP + 5 ml concentrate + 40 ml water = 50 ml and that of MRF as MDF = 19 ml diluted concentrate + 1 ml of 50 ppm DMP. In conclusion, DMP was found to be a highly effective disinfectant against Mycobacteria. DMP has reasonable shelf life if stored appropriately. Pharmaceutical formulation from DMP was found to be delicate due to the narrow pH window of DMP stability, but is feasible...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} drug-in-adhesive transdermal drug {{delivery}} systems (patch) with different chemical penetration enhancers {{were designed to}} deliver drug through the skin as a site of application. The objective of our effort was to study the influence of various chemical penetration enhancers on skin permeation rate and adhesion properties of a transdermal drug delivery system using Box–Behnken experimental design. The response surface methodology based on a three-level, three-variable Box–Behnken design {{was used to evaluate}} the interactive effects on dependent variables including, the rate of skin permeation and adhesion properties, namely peel strength and tack value. Levulinic acid, <b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and Tween 80 were used as penetration enhancers (patch formulations, containing 0 – 8 % of each chemical penetration enhancer). Buprenorphine was used as a model penetrant drug. The results showed that incorporation of 20 % chemical penetration enhancer into the mixture led to maximum skin permeation flux of buprenorphine from abdominal rat skin while the adhesion properties decreased. Also that skin flux in presence of levulinic acid (1. 594  μg/cm 2  h) was higher than Tween 80 (1. 473  μg/cm 2  h) and <b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (0. 843  μg/cm 2  h), and in mixing these enhancers together, an additional effect was observed.

30|$|In Fig.  2, {{the minimum}} point may be {{attributed}} to the presence of the highly surface-active <b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (dodecyl alcohol or dodecanol) as an impurity in the SDS sample. When micelle formation starts, the impurity becomes dissolved in the micelles because of its hydrophobic nature. This lowers the concentration of <b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> in the bulk and hence its surface concentration. Consequently, the interfacial tension increases and returns to that of pure SDS solution (Dey et al. 2015; Lin et al. 1999; Umlong and Ismail 2007). It is possible that small aggregates (pre-micelles) build up below the CAC and CMC, starting at a concentration with a minimum surface tension (Lin et al. 1999). By start of the pre-micelle formation, IFT increases till the PSP is reached in surface tension plots (0.8 and 0.95 CMC for 250 and 900  mg/L, respectively); then, it decreases till the CMC point. It was expected that by saturation of the polymer chain, the concentration of SDS monomers would increase again at the water/n-hexane interface.|$|E

30|$|The {{frequent}} use of PCPs also raises concerns of environmental contamination, especially water sources, given the large quantities of products released into sewage systems and leaching in landfills [35]. Conclusive research {{on the extent of}} dangers for aquatic environments caused by PCPs is still scarce [36 – 39]. Extensive and continuous discharge of PCPs into the water compartment, however, gives reason for concern as some ingredients are biologically active compounds similar to pharmaceuticals [36]. Some PCPs are readily degraded; others are persistent [40]. For example, many studies have been conducted for synthetic musks highlighting their presence and stability in the environment and their (eco-)toxicological effects [41 – 43]. Cocamidopropyl betaine and <b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> classified as dangerous for the aquatic environment, are frequently used as ingredients of PCPs such as shampoos. The amounts entering the aquatic compartment can be substantial making the relevant concentrations measurable, as is this case with the ingredients OTNE or HHCB [44]. As the number of ingredients in PCPs is massive, the task of assessing these risks is daunting and often beyond budget allocations, particularly in developing countries. Furthermore, the situation and research needs in developed countries compared to developing countries are impacted by different climatic conditions, different technical levels of water treatment and/or various portions of indirect reuse of water. Thus, prevention of hazardous PCPs entering the environment is the best strategy.|$|E

The formulation which showed a highest permeation rate of 47. 15 ± 1. 12 µg cm− 2 h− 1 and appropriate physicochemical properties was optimized as containing 2 % FLZ, 10 % LA, 20 % Lab/EtOH (1 : 1), and 68 % double-distilled water (w/w). The efficiency of microemulsion formulation in the topical delivery of FLZ was dependent upon the contents of water and LA as well as Lab/EtOH mixing ratio. It was concluded that the percutaneous absorption of FLZ from microemulsions was enhanced with increasing the LA and water contents, and with decreasing the Lab/EtOH ratio in the formulation. Candida albicans was used as a model fungus to evaluate the antifungal activity of the best formula achieved, which showed the widest zone of inhibition as compared to FLZ reference. The studied microemulsion formulation showed a good stability for a period of 3 months. These results indicate that the studied microemulsion formulation might be a promising vehicle for topical delivery of FLZ.

40|$|Author abstract]The {{adsorption}} behaviour of the condensation {{polymers of ethylene}} oxides and <b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> was {{studied by}} measuring the differential capacity of the electrical double layers at interfaces between mercury and solutions containing these nonionic surface active agents. The a. c. bridge method using a dropping mercury electrode {{was used for the}} measurements at the a. c. frequency of 3, 900 c/s. The primitive solution was 1 M Na_ 2 SO_ 4, except when a comparison was made by using 1 M KCl. It was found that the complete monomolecular adsorption layer was formed on the mercury surface at the surface active agent concentration of 10 ^ and 5 x 10 ^ M for the mole numbers of the ethylene oxides of 8. 2 and 25, respectively. The differential capacity against the polarisation potential curves showed two well defined desorption peaks in the anodic and cathodic polarisation potentials, although in the case of 1 M KCl used as the primitive solution the anodic peak was masked by the strong specific adsorption of the chloride ions. At lower surface active agent concentrations, the monomolecular layer was not complete and the devistion from the curve for the primitive solution became smaller at lower surface active agent concentrations. [著者抄録]微分容量の測定法として次の 3 法を挙た。 1. U効果ＩＩの理論式から誘導したImpedance Matching法 2. 同理論から誘導したResonance法 3. 滴下水銀電極を用いた交流電橋法測定結果とこれに対する考察は次の通りである。非イオン界面活性剤溶液と接する滴下水銀電極の微分容量を交流ブリッヂ法で測定した。用いた周波数は 3900 c/sで､セルは 3 ± 1 ℃に保ち常に水銀滴の生長開始後 1. 8 secでブリッヂ平衡をとった。用いた非イオン活面活性剤はラウリルアルコールとポリエチレンオキサイドの縮合物である。primitive溶液は 1 NNa_ 2 SO_ 4 、または 1 N KClで、この無関係塩のほかに 10 ^, 2. 5 × 10 ^, 10 ^ および 10 ^ mol/lの濃度で界面活性剤を含む溶液を調整した。微分容量C対電気毛管極大(ecm) 規準のバイアス電位εの実験曲線は、それぞれ+ 0. 25 Vおよび- 1. 5 V付近の電位で動的ピークを示す。これらの容量のピーク、Cp、は界面活性剤濃度cがますと共に増大し、Cp対c曲線はLorenzとMöckelの理論と一致した。primitive溶液として 1 M・KClを用いた場合はクロライドイオンの特異吸着のため異った傾向を示す。陰陽両ピークにはさまれた零電位領域での界面活性剤の吸着はある濃度に至るまでは濃度と共に増大し、単分子吸着は､C対ε曲線はこの電位領域で弓状の山を示した。これらの山は界面活性剤の多分子層吸着への緩除な転移による別の動的ピークと思われる。LA(et・o) xのxの相違による吸着の計算によると、xが増大するほど吸着力がますがxが小さいときには共存する無関係塩の影響か見られ、Cl^-の存在は、SO_ 4 に比べて、この吸着力を著しく増大させている。x〓 30 付近になるとこの効果はほとんど見られない...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study of the}} de-inking process of xerography wastepaper regeneration has been simulated using a method of toner adsorption on plastic films. The {{results of the study}} indicate that a range of proper combinations of solvent, surfactant and toner can form viscous liquids that can be adsorbed on plastic films at ambient temperature. The inks adsorbed on the film can be separated by a screen process. The optimal condition for the present de-inking process was carried out at 20 degrees C for 7 min with de-inking additives consisting of 0. 8 wt%NAISA 20 (a solvent mixture) as de-inking solvent and 0. 3 wt% LAUEO 3 (<b>lauryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> polyethylene glycol) as the surfactant. During toner's adsorption process in the presence of preferred PET films, the residual ink speck population in the regenerated paper could be reduced from 67, 900 ppm to about 12 ppm (99. 98 % improvement) after two-stage treatments. The brightness of the final de-inked pulps could then be improved to 85 % GE (unit of brightness), almost identical to 86 % GE of virgin unprinted paper. Furthermore, the regenerated paper meets the standard of high quality grade paper which are suitable for reuse as the printing paper. The adsorption method as described in the study is advantageous because of its low chemical dosages and energy consumption. Additionally, the wastewater and the plastic films used in the process could be recycled. The simple and practical laboratory method can be adapted to conventional process plants for the economy benefits from scaling up. (C) 2009 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

40|$|O copolímero poli(D,L-lactídeo-co-glicolídeo) apresenta-se como um dos polímeros de maior interesse para aplicação na área médica. O fato de ser biorreabsorvível, biocompatível, atóxico e ter uma cinética de degradação que pode ser modificada pela razão entre os monômeros na copolimerização justifica tal interesse. Neste trabalho, os copolímeros foram sintetizados a 175 ºC, por meio da abertura dos anéis dos dímeros cíclicos dos monômeros D,L-lactídeo e glicolídeo, na presença do iniciador octanoato de estanho e do co-iniciador álcool laurílico. O controle eficiente do vácuo no meio reacional, aliado à adequada agitação, foram fundamentais para o sucesso da síntese. Para caracterização dos copolímeros sintetizados foram empregadas as técnicas de calorimetria exploratória diferencial (DSC), termogravimetria (TG) e espectroscopia na região do infravermelho (FTIR). Foram analisados não somente os produtos de reação, mas também os monômeros de partida. A nova rota de síntese utilizada mostrou-se adequada, sendo os copolímeros poli(D,L-lactídeo-co-glicolídeo) obtidos com sucesso. Poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) {{copolymer}} (PLGA) {{has attracted}} {{a great deal of}} interest due to their special characteristics as biomaterials since it is bioreabsorbable, biocompatible, nontoxic and the kinetics of degradation can be modified by the ratio of monomers in copolymerization.

40|$|Myxococcus xanthus, a nonflagellated gliding bacterium, {{exhibits}} multicellular {{behavior during}} vegetative growth and fruiting body formation. The frizzy (frz) genes {{are required to}} control directed motility for these interactions. The frz genes encode proteins that are homologous {{to all of the}} major enteric chemotaxis proteins, with the exception of CheZ. In this study, we characterized FrzCD, a protein which is homologous to the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins from the enteric bacteria. FrzCD, unlike the other methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, was found to be localized primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells. FrzCD migrates as a ladder of bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reflecting heterogeneity due to methylation or demethylation and to deamidation. FrzCD was shown to be methylated in vivo when cells were exposed to yeast extract or Casitone and demethylated when starved in buffer. We used the methylation state of FrzCD as revealed by Western blot (immunoblot) analyses to search for stimuli that are recognized by the frz signal transduction system. Common amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and sugars were not recognized, but certain lipids and alcohols were recognized. For example, the saturated fatty acids capric acid and lauric acid stimulated FrzCD methylation, whereas a variety of other saturated fatty acids did not. <b>Lauryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and lipoic acid also stimulated methylation, as did phospholipids containing lauric acid. In contrast, several short-chain alcohols, such as isoamyl alcohol, and some other solvents caused demethylation. The relatively high concentrations of the chemicals required for a response may indicate that these chemicals are not the relevant signals recognized by M. xanthus in nature. Isoamyl alcohol and isopropanol also had profound effects on the behavior of wild-type cells, causing them to reverse continuously. Cells of frzB, frzF, and frzG mutants also reversed continuously in the presence of isoamyl alcohol, whereas cells of frzA, frzCD, or frzE mutants did not. On the basis of the data presented, we propose a model for the frz signal transduction pathway in M. xanthus...|$|E
