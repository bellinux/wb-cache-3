5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between <b>leisure</b> <b>and</b> culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between <b>leisure</b> <b>and</b> work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between <b>leisure</b> <b>and</b> social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

Methods. 8301 Canadians ≥ 60 years of age were selected from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Sociodemographic, health-related, mobility-related, <b>and</b> physical <b>and</b> <b>leisure</b> activity variables were analysed using logistic regression to determine, the likelihood of participation in physical <b>and</b> <b>leisure</b> activity, <b>and</b> whether participation in physical <b>and</b> <b>leisure</b> activities mediates the relationship between wheelchair use and perceived health.
