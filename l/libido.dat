5|$|Early {{symptoms}} of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle pain. Other early signs in adults include malaise, fatigue, decreased <b>libido,</b> and problems with sleep. An unusual taste {{in the mouth}} and personality changes are also early signs.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid hormones {{also play}} a role in {{maintaining}} normal sexual function, sleep, and thought patterns. Increased levels are associated with increased speed of thought generation but decreased focus. Sexual function, including <b>libido</b> and the maintenance of a normal menstrual cycle, are influenced by thyroid hormones.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in <b>libido</b> and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5000|$|The action {{revolves}} around the (generally) thwarted <b>libidos</b> of the principal characters. The title of the play is an old legal term habeas corpus, which translates from Latin as [...] "you shall have the body".|$|R
5000|$|In antebellum America, as in {{the past}} (from the initial African-European contact in North America), black women were deemed to be governed by their <b>libidos</b> and portrayed as [...] "Jezebel characters...in every way the counterimage of the mid-nineteenth-century ideal of the Victorian lady." ...|$|R
50|$|In the anime series Captain Earth, Orgone {{energy is}} the source of power and {{sustenance}} for the invading aliens, the Kill-T-Gang, who plan to harvest it from the <b>libidos</b> of all humanity. It is also the power behind the Livlaster guns used by the protagonists.|$|R
5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the <b>libido</b> was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their <b>libido</b> wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his <b>libido,</b> even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
5000|$|At WBBM-TV in March 1971, Jamieson {{reported}} a five-part series on [...] "The Sexualization of America." [...] A newspaper ad promoting the series queried, [...] "Have our sexual outlooks changed? Are we less uptight about our <b>libidos?</b> Is there really a [...] "Sexual Revolution" [...] going on?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Freud {{used the}} term [...] "anti-cathexis" [...] or counter-charge to {{describe}} how the ego blocks such regressive efforts to discharge one's cathexis: that is, when the ego wishes to repress such desires. Like a steam engine, the <b>libido's</b> cathexis then builds up until it finds alternative outlets, {{which can lead to}} sublimation, reaction formation, or the construction of (sometimes disabling) symptoms.|$|R
5000|$|Some open {{marriages are}} one-sided. Some {{situations}} {{giving rise to}} this are where the <b>libidos</b> of partners differ greatly, or illness renders one partner incapable of, or no longer desiring, sex. The couple may remain together while one partner seeks out sexual gratification as he/she sees fit. The difference between these situations and a cheating situation is that both partners in the marriage are aware of, and agree to the arrangement.|$|R
5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in the blood that may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased <b>libido.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced <b>libido,</b> desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased <b>libido</b> and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E
2500|$|While {{speaking}} {{at a conference in}} 2000, Watson had suggested a link between skin color and sex drive, hypothesizing that dark-skinned people have stronger <b>libidos.</b> His lecture argued that extracts of melanin – which gives skin its color – had been found to boost subjects' sex drive. [...] "That's why you have Latin lovers," [...] he said, according to people who attended the lecture. [...] "You've never heard of an English lover. Only an English Patient." ...|$|R
40|$|The acousma is {{result of}} the process that the {{consciousness}} is drew into the unconscious black hole and declined as the unconsciousness by the large “psychological gravitation”, and generates a mass of energies which are dispersed by the depressive and devious way, and replaced by the projection of the dissident attacking consciousness. And it is the {{result of the}} function of the force. The free <b>libidos</b> can flow to the consciousness, release the blocked energies, weaken and even eliminate the acousma...|$|R
50|$|Baboons {{also have}} noticeably high <b>libidos,</b> in {{addition}} to their high level of genital marking, and so Babi was considered the god of virility of the dead. He was usually portrayed with an erection, and due to the association with the judging of souls, was sometimes depicted as using it as the mast of the ferry which conveyed the righteous to Aaru, a series of islands. Babi was also prayed to, {{in order to ensure that}} an individual would not suffer from erectile dysfunction after death.|$|R
5|$|As Peter and Lois {{are having}} sex, she yells out George Clooney's name, so Peter realizes {{that she is}} imagining him as Clooney to {{maintain}} her <b>libido.</b> Lois and Peter decide {{to take a second}} honeymoon to enliven their marriage, and leave their anthropomorphic dog Brian {{to take care of their}} children Stewie, Chris, and Meg. Brian is unable to control the children, but Stewie offers to help (in exchange for Brian changing his diaper) and together they manage the home. The pair chaperone a dance at Chris's school, during which a school staff member catches Chris in the boys' restroom with vodka that belongs to his classmate Jake Tucker. Although Brian and Stewie punish Chris by grounding him, they try to clear his name. Jake's father Tom refuses to believe Brian and Stewie, so they resort to planting cocaine in Jake's locker, and Jake is sentenced to community service.|$|E
25|$|Some {{transgender}} women {{report a}} significant reduction in <b>libido,</b> depending on the dosage of antiandrogens. A small number of post-operative transgender women take low doses of testosterone to boost their <b>libido.</b> Many pre-operative transgender women wait until after reassignment surgery to begin an active sex life. Raising the dosage of estrogen or adding a progestogen raises the <b>libido</b> of some transgender women.|$|E
25|$|Hyperprolactinaemia, or excess serum prolactin, is {{associated}} with hypoestrogenism, anovulatory infertility, oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, unexpected lactation and loss of <b>libido</b> in women and erectile dysfunction and loss of <b>libido</b> in men.|$|E
5000|$|Anytime Now was an Irish {{contemporary}} six-part drama series, {{set against}} the backdrop of the newly thriving and cosmopolitan Dublin, about the lives, loves, and <b>libidos</b> of three lifelong friends. Nora Moggin (played by Angelina Ball), Kate O'Dowd (played by Zara Turner) and Stevie McCutcheon (played by Susan Lynch) live in Dublin. They have a combined age of 99. Between them they have slept with 47 men, broken 11 hearts, drunk approximately 5000 pints, bought one house, buried two parents, failed one marriage and produced one baby. They've known each other long enough to believe that their friendship, at least, is invincible ...|$|R
40|$|Rolf de Heer’s films Bad Boy Bubby (1993) and Alexandra’s Project (2003) are {{interpreted}} {{with regard to}} Barbara Creed’s 1993 concept of the monstrous-feminine. Both films feature horrific mothers whose unrestrained <b>libidos</b> over-ride their maternal responsibilities. In Bad Boy Bubby the mother disregards the incest taboo and sleeps with her son, while in Alexandra’s Project the mother fails to acknowledge the paternal order, working as a prostitute and stealing her children away from their father. Evolutionary film theory is shown to explain the repulsion such mothers inspire, and {{the appeal of the}} horror film in general, at least as effectively as psychoanalytic film theory...|$|R
5000|$|Sigmund Freud was {{the first}} to use the term widely, and argued {{that it was one of}} the roots of many {{problems}} in Western society. Freud believed that people's naturally strong instincts toward sexuality were repressed by people in order to meet the constraints imposed on them by civilized life. However, Freud's ideas about sexual repression have not been without their critics. According to sex therapist Bernard Apfelbaum, Freud did not base his belief in universal innate, natural sexuality on the strength of sexual desire he saw in people, but rather on its weakness. In some periods of Indian history anaphrodisiacs were utilised in order to lower <b>libidos.</b>|$|R
25|$|While Jung {{worked on}} his Wandlungen und Symbole der <b>Libido</b> (Psychology of the Unconscious), {{tensions}} became manifest between him and Freud because of their disagreements over the nature of <b>libido</b> and religion. Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development {{and focused on the}} collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he did think that <b>libido</b> was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that <b>libido</b> alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality. Jung believed his personal development was influenced by factors he felt were unrelated to sexuality.|$|E

5000|$|... "All Hooked Up" [...] {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} music critics. Sean O'Brien of The Sunday People gave the song {{a rating of}} eight out of ten, deeming it a [...] "dirty sexy track {{with a lot of}} attitude" [...] and [...] "a great groove". Jon O'Brien from AllMusic likened it to songs by Lucy Pearl. The Sunday Herald praised the track for [...] "maintaining the Saints' trademark tough-girl buffalo stance" [...] and [...] "cowboy-hat-wearing sass". Similarly, Nigel Packer from BBC News commended the song's lyrics which he felt had [...] "bags of attitude". John Walshe of the Hot Press wrote: [...] "Time has not curbed their <b>libidos</b> one iota, thankfully, nor their independence." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2000, {{the band}} {{took a break}} from touring to record their second album titled Hembra. It was {{produced}} by Tweety González and mixed by Doug Trantow, and was recorded in Buenos Aires and Los Angeles. This album {{marked the beginning of}} <b>Líbido's</b> working relationship with Sony Music, which helped reinforce its presence in the Peruvian market; the market had already been struck by a high level of piracy. The album became number 1 in Peru and the single 'En esta habitación'.. With this album they achieved two #1 hits in the rankings of local radio stations with the singles 'Tres' and 'En esta habitación'. The music videos for the singles were directed by Juan Pablo Olivares y Picky Talarico, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Observer, Andrew Sarris called Summer '04 a [...] "marvelous German film" [...] with a [...] "warmly {{stirring}} romantic maelstrom of five multigenerational <b>libidos</b> let loose at a lakeside vacation site." [...] Sarris concluded: The surprise ending amounts {{to one of the}} most heart-rendingly brilliant coups in directing, writing and acting I have ever experienced on the screen. Like only a few endings I can recall, it makes you rethink everything you have seen before, and weep a little inwardly. The performances are all right-on, but Ms. Gedeck reaches new heights even for her, after her previous triumphs in Sandra Nettelbeck’s Mostly Martha (2001) and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s The Lives of Others (2006).|$|R

5000|$|Marcus' {{study is}} {{psychological}} in nature, relies {{much on the}} work of Sigmund Freud, and he invents a word to describe the sexual activities in this novel, [...] "pornotopia", which he describes as being like a place where [...] "all men ... are always and infinitely potent; all women fecundate with lust and flow inexhaustibly with sap or juice or both. Everyone is always ready for everything" [...] (p. 276). Given the <b>libidos</b> of the characters, the comment is apt. Because of the often unrealistic description of sexual activities and positions in The Romance of Lust, Marcus uses the word vector to describe the mechanical sex acts. He also speaks of emotional deprivation in conjunction with the work, because the characters do not interact with one another as real, thinking, and feeling persons would do.|$|R
5000|$|Dave Wyndorf {{describes}} the album as [...] "a {{return to our}} roots in terms of vibe and recording style. It's full-on psychedelic space-rock with a '60s garage feel, recorded almost exclusively with vintage guitars, amps and effects in our hometown of Red Bank, New Jersey. The songs {{are a kind of}} space-noir, tales of cosmic revenge, peaking <b>libidos,</b> alienation and epic strangeness. It's a weird trip through the back alleys of a dark, retro-future, which not by coincidence very much resembles my own life. laughs The lyrics aren't fantasy really, rather a recounting of my musings on, observations of and general emotional reaction to my life and environment during a 1 week writing period in February of 2013. But I tend to use the vernacular and imagery of science fiction and surrealism to express myself and that's where these lyrics get trippy. There's also our cover version of Donovan's 'Three Kingfishers', which I thought fit the mood of the album." ...|$|R
5000|$|S'uthlam's {{population}} problem remains, {{worse than}} ever, as Tuf's innovations from his previous visit were not maximally used. Its society {{is beginning to}} break down and either war or social collapse seems likely. Tuf labors to find a solution, and calls a meeting of all the worlds about to clash. He presents to them his solution: an edible, mildly addictive plant called [...] "manna", which will freely grow everywhere on S'uthlam and eliminate its hunger problems. After some arm-twisting, in which Tuf threatens to use the military might of his seedship against anyone who refuses, the hostile worlds agree to an armistice. Tuf later tells a horrified Mune that the manna will feed her people, but will also inhibit the <b>libidos</b> of the S'uthlamese and cause widespread, but not universal, sterilization. He leaves Mune to make a momentous decision for S'uthlam; it is implied that she accepts the provision of manna to forestall war and famine.|$|R
