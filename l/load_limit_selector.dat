40|$|Three {{independent}} scientific {{lines of}} evidence were {{sought to determine}} the nutrient <b>load</b> <b>limits</b> to safeguard the macrophyte community of an intermittently closed and open lake/lagoon (ICOLL) : (1) a literature review identified nitrogen load thresholds related {{to the collapse of}} macrophytes in similar systems in Australia, Europe and elsewhere, (2) an ICOLL expert carried out an assessment based on current local data and on data from 57 Australian coastal lakes and lagoons, and (3) a deterministic coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model was developed and applied to simulate the ecological outcomes of several nutrient loading scenarios. The three lines of evidence converged on well-defined nitrogen load estimates required to avoid the collapse of the macrophyte community. Uncertainties were slightly greater in relation to required phosphorus <b>load</b> <b>limits,</b> but the evidence still helped set a precautionary phosphorus <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> that accounted for these uncertainties. Thus, despite the challenges in setting <b>load</b> <b>limits</b> for complex ecosystems, multiple lines of evidence helped derive robust nutrient <b>load</b> <b>limits</b> for managing the ICOLL to safeguard values associated with a healthy macrophyte community.

On this poster, different approaches to dynamic rating are presented. Aging of components is mainly related to temperature. Temperature is related to loading and environmental conditions. Now, static rating assumes standard values for the environmental variables. These standard values are assumed rather conservative with rather big safety margins for errors.

40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine offers diesel-like {{efficiency}} {{with very}} low soot and NOx emissions. In a HCCI engine, a premixed charge of air, fuel and burned gas is compressed to achieve autoigntion. Combustion occurs throughout the chamber volume resulting in short overall burn duration. This short burn duration can cause excessively high pressure rise rates {{which lead to}} unacceptable engine noise and potentially reduced engine life. To combat this high pressure rise rate the engine must be operating with significant diluent, either excess air or burned exhaust gas. However this high level of dilution limits the specific output of the HCCI engine to levels far below spark ignition or diesel engines. The high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is a major challenge for the HCCI engine. This study utilized a single cylinder research to examine the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> and possible methods to extend it. The details of the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> were first explored {{across a range of}} intake temperatures, boost pressures, trapped residual fractions, equivalence ratios and external EGR ratios for a gasoline fueled HCCI engine. A significant finding was that the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> always occurs at the misfire limit and that for a given pressure rise rate constraint, the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> occurs at lowest possible intake pressure and trapped residual fraction needed to prevent misfire. A possible means to allow operation at higher boost pressures is to utilize cooled external EGR or to reduce the intake temperature. For a given burn fraction, increasing the EGR rate or reducing the intake temperature provided reduced MPRR. (cont.) However with these changes, the misfire limit also shifted such that the value of the maximum load does not materially change. Thus boosting coupled with EGR or intake temperature reduction {{can not be used to}} significantly extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> A correlation was developed for the burn duration. Multi-zone combustion simulations were used to confirm the form of this correlation. The multi-zone based correlations were then used to quantitatively examine the potential of thermal stratification as a means to extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> It was shown that for a doubling of the width of the in-cylinder temperature distribution, a 30 % increase in the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is possible. by Robert J.

A laboratory study was conducted by the Minnesota Department of Transportation investigating the use of the Moisture Point probe as an instrument for locating the depth to the freezing front. The Moisture Point probe combines Time Domain Reflectometry with remote diode switching to provide a profile of the aggregate base and subgrade dielectric properties. From this the frost depth can be estimated.
