40|$|Elevated schizotypy {{relates to}} similar {{cognitive}} attenuations {{as seen in}} psychosis and cannabis/polydrug use.

Very few studies, however, have examined cigarettes and alcohol as separate variables to assess whether {{there is a difference between}} these licit drugs and their relationships with marijuana use, and none have focused exclusively on these relationships using a nationally representative sample. The present study investigated the relationships between alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana use in adolescence and young adulthood using data from the 2002 and 2003 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. This current study investigated: (1) whether the correlations between alcohol use and marijuana use differ from those between cigarette use and marijuana use, (2) whether each <b>licit</b> <b>drug</b> is a significant, independent predictor of marijuana use after controlling for a comparable measure of the other <b>licit</b> <b>drug,</b> and (3) whether these relationships differ depending on how 2 ̆ 2 use 2 ̆ 2 is operationally defined. This is the first known study that has assessed multiple levels and definitions of use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana to determine if the licit drugs differ in their associations and predictive values of marijuana use using a nationally representative sample. Overall, cigarette use was a stronger predictor of marijuana use than was alcohol use, particularly when assessing more frequent and higher rates of use; however, it was found that the differences in predictive values of alcohol and cigarette use on marijuana use differed as a function of how use was defined. In addition, cigarette use was a stronger predictor of marijuana use than was smokeless tobacco use, providing evidence that the relationship between cigarettes and marijuana use may be due, in part, to similar modes of ingestion.

40|$|Background: Alcohol use and {{illicit drug}} use peak during young {{adulthood}} (around 18 - 29 years of age), but comparatively {{little is known about}} polydrug use in nationally representative samples of young adults. Drawing on a nationally representative cross-sectional survey (Australian National Drug Strategy Household Survey), this study examines polydrug use patterns and associated psychosocial risk factors among young adults (n = 3, 333; age 19 - 29). Method: The use of a broad range of licit and illicit drugs were examined, including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, inhalants, steroids, barbiturates, meth/amphetamines, heroin, methadone/buprenorphine, other opiates, painkillers and tranquillizers/sleeping pills. Latent class analysis was employed to identify patterns of polydrug use. Results: Polydrug use in this sample was best described using a 5 -class solution. The majority of young adults predominantly used alcohol only (52. 3 %), alcohol and tobacco (34. 18 %).

Method: From an epidemiological study of 3824 Australian twins (mean age at time of survey = 31. 2 SD = 3. 0, range 21 - 46), 2248 participants who had reported using cannabis more than once were asked about the speed of transition from first to second use, and about their later use of cannabis and symptoms of cannabis abuse/ dependence. Regression analyses adjusted the association between speed of transition and the outcomes of cannabis daily use, abuse and/or dependence, and treatment-seeking after controlling for socio-demographic, childhood, mental health, peer and <b>licit</b> <b>drug</b> factors. Results: After adjustment for confounders second cannabis use occurring {{within a week of}} first use was positively associated with reporting daily cannabis use (OR 2. 70, 95 % CI 1. 75 – 4. 16), abuse and/or dependence (OR 3. 37, 95 % CI 2. 45 – 4. 65) and treatment-seeking for cannabis problems (OR 2. 00, 95 % CI 1. 10 – 3. 65). Second cannabis use occurring within 3 months of first use was positively associated with abuse and/or dependence (OR 1. 69, 95 % CI 1. 27 – 2. 25).

40|$|Aims: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore how various aspects of {{everyday}} life, measured using self-reported experiences from childhood, adolescence and adulthood were associated with {{alcohol and drug use}} in a population-based sample of Swedish women. Methods: The thesis is based on data from the “Women and Alcohol in Gothenburg” project, a Swedish three-wave longitudinal, population-based, multi-purpose study. Three of the studies included women 20 and 25 years old when interviewed; and the sample sizes were 946 and 760, respectively. The fourth study included 851 women 20 - 55 years old. Studies I and II focused on the associations between the independent variables early risk indicators, socio-demographic factors, alcohol use, smoking, psychiatric illness and the dependent variables illicit and <b>licit</b> <b>drug</b> use. In Studies III and IV cluster analysis was used to identify clusters based on variables measuring patterns of drinking context and patterns of everyday occupations. The patterns of everyday occupations were defined as employment status, household work, leisure activities, time for free disposal and satisfaction with each domain. Drinking context was operationalised with questions on where and with whom the drinking occurred, together with questions on self-reported effects of drinking. Further, the associations between identified clusters and problematic alcohol consumption were analyzed. All four studies were based on cross-sectional analyses. Results: Significant associations regarding early risk indicators and drug use were found; to some extent these were different for occasional use and more frequent use. Early alcohol debut and behavioral factors were related to all three drug use patterns, whereas family factors were associated with occasional use and with more frequent use of illicit and licit drugs. Frequent use of both illicit and licit drugs was also associated with a history of eating problems. Problematic alcohol consumption, smoking and psychiatric illness were significantly associated with illicit and <b>licit</b> <b>drug</b> use; with the strongest associations found for illicit drug use among the 20 -year-old women. Cluster analysis identified distinct groups with respect to the investigated patterns. Concerning drinking context patterns, the cluster characterized with coping effects of drinking, frequent drinking in different settings but also solitary drinking, was significantly associated with alcohol use disorder and high alcohol consumption. High episodic drinking was more common in the cluster reporting frequent drinking together with social effects such as becoming less shy or having more fun. Problematic alcohol consumption was more common in clusters characterized with varied or low engagement in leisure activities in combination with a large amount of spare time. Conclusions: The strong associations between illicit and <b>licit</b> <b>drug</b> use, alcohol consumption, smoking, and psychiatric illness point to a higher risk for developing any or several of these problems once one of these habits has been established. The results also underline the importance of identifying groups of individuals with different drinking patterns and with different patterns of everyday occupations. As a complement to variable analysis, investigating such patterns may provide new options for preventive actions as opposed to focusing on specific risk factors...|$|E

We then summarize the neuronal substrates that underlie CPP induced by these drugs from a genetic perspective. Finally, we draw on findings from pharmacological studies and discuss the neurotransmitters and neurohormones underlying CPP produced by ethanol, nicotine, and caffeine...|$|R
40|$|Researches have {{emphasized}} religiosity as a protective factor against drug use although the mechanism through which it occurs is still unknown. This article aims to explore religious beliefs that could prevent {{drug use among}} youth. Three sources of qualitative data were used: participant observation in 21 religious institutions, semistructured interviews of 37 religious leaders, and 6 focus groups comprised of 55 religious drug-naïve youths. The young people’s discourses and the sermons of religious leaders revealed that conceptions about drugs were based on media content, with little religious or scientific context. Catholics and Spiritists considered the consumption of <b>licit</b> <b>drugs</b> less harmful than that of illicit ones and were especially tolerant {{of the use of}} alcohol. Protestants were more emphatic when describing all drugs as being harmful to one’s health. Findings suggest that young people who practice a religion invoke several religious concepts to justify their choice for not using drugs, and they attribute this position more to the famil...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{immunohistochemical}} {{expression of}} Cyclin D 1 and Ki- 67 were analyzed in tongue squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), relating {{them to the}} clinical and morphological exhibition of these tumors. Material and Methods: Twenty-nine patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria; clinical data included gender, age, eth-nicity and use of <b>licit</b> <b>drugs</b> such as alcohol and tobacco. The TNM staging and histopathological differentiation grading was assessed for each case. In addition, T 1 patients were gathered with T 2 patients; and T 3 patients were gathered with T 4 patients to assemble two distinct groups: (T 1 /T 2) and (T 3 /T 4). Results: The mean follow-up time was 24 months and 30 % of the patients died {{as a consequence of}} the disease, while 23. 3 % lived with the disease and 46. 7 % lived lesion-free. T 1 and T 2 tumors showed statistically lesser Ki- 67 and Cyclin D 1 staining when compared to T 3 and T 4 tumors. Conclusions: Ki- 67 and Cyclin D 1 pose as auxiliary tools when determining the progression of tongue SCC at th...|$|R
