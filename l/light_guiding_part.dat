40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the testing of}} several prototype detectors, designed {{to be used in}} a radiation detector called the UoYTube. This detector can be used to detect charged particles emitted in fusion evaporation reactions. In this work, several UoYTube prototypes were designed, fabricated and characterised/tested. These included prototypes with different scintillator crystals (Caesium Iodide and plastic), prototypes with different geometries (truncated pyramid and cuboid), and prototypes that included different types of <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (Acrylic and 3 D Printed). These prototypes were characterised in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio, the optimum bias value, the energy resolution, the Acrylic versus 3 D-Printed <b>light</b> <b>guides,</b> the number of counts and the optimum amplifier shaping time. Two different methods used to fabricate <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> (one 3 D Printed and the other with the HURCO VMX 60 m Machining Centre), are also described. The <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> were then characterised and compared to each other in terms of their light output, energy resolution, and the optimum shaping time. Using these results, it was inferred that the plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) demonstrated the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The plastic scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry) and Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated a range of the optimum bias values, over which there was little variation in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. The Caesium Iodide scintillator (with a truncated pyramid geometry), demonstrated good energy resolution. The transmittance of light from the spectrometer through the 3 D Printed <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> was significantly poorer than that of the acrylic <b>light</b> <b>guide.</b> The difference in recorded energy resolution between the <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> was not very significant. The recorded number of counts was greater for the Acrylic <b>light</b> <b>guide,</b> when compared to the 3 D Printed <b>light</b> <b>guide.</b> It was also concluded that both the acrylic and 3 D Printed <b>light</b> <b>guided</b> prototypes should be operated with the highest values of shaping time, corresponding to the best resolution.

40|$|Different {{types of}} optical <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> were {{constructed}} and tested to enable convenient multiple {{angle of incidence}} ellipsometry, on solid and liquid interfaces in liquid solutions. Two <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> are needed on an ellipsometer, one to <b>guide</b> the incoming <b>light</b> and one to <b>guide</b> the <b>light</b> that is reflected at the test surface, and therefore one <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> was mounted on the laser arm {{and one on the}} detector arm of the ellipsometer.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the influence of the}} <b>light</b> <b>guide</b> shape on the polymerization efficacy of a light-activated resin-based composite cured with LED units {{as a function of the}} distance between the tip and the restoration. Two different LED units, each with different <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> and shapes, were used. Their ability to cure a single restorative material was investigated. The efficacy of the light-curing system was evaluated by measuring the depth of cure using the Acetone Shake test. Considering the ratio (R) between the entry diameter and the exit diameter of the <b>light</b> <b>guide,</b> the tips with a higher R-value proved to be more efficient if the tip and composite distance (D) was less than 5 mm, while for D > 5 mm, the tips with a lower R-value showed better results.

40|$|Tubular <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> are {{applicable}} for daylighting of windowless areas in buildings.

The physical model of the tested <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> of lengths more than 0. 60 m proves shows that Rayleigh numbers are adequate for a turbulent air flow. The turbulent model was applied despite the small heat flux differences between the turbulent and laminar model. The CFD simulations resulted into conclusions that the growing ratio of length/diameter increases the heat transmission loss/linear transmittance as much as by 50 percent. Tubular <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> of smaller diameters have lower heat transmission losses compared to the wider ones of the same lengths with the same outdoor temperature being taken into account.

The use of two cycles makes it possible to decrease attenuation to 0. 5 dB/m on excitation wavelength. The experiments show that effluence efficiency correlates with thickness of depressed cover – the more is thickness of a cover, the less are losses. The basic technology of perforated fiber <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> creation from quartz glass with four cycles of the openings, based on twophase process was developed. Unlike perforated <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> with a single-element core in the developed systems with equal diameters of a core the step of structures is two and three times less. It gives the possibility to receive big resistance of radiation to indignations of a light-guide path.

Researches were conducted to search technological conditions for minimum attenuation of a certain type radiation in the microstructured <b>light</b> <b>guides.</b> The main way to receive answers about influence of the technological scheme on radiation attenuation is comparison of one - and two-phase methods of microstructured <b>light</b> <b>guides</b> creation.
