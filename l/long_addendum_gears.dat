Power losses were calculated from temperature measurements of lubricating oil, gears, gear box, and oil flow rate.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} a spur gear system was performed through a numerical analysis approach. This study used the gear dynamic program DANST, a computer simulator, to determine the dynamic behavior of a spur gear system. The analytical results have taken the deflection of shafts and bearings into consideration for static analysis, {{and the influence of}} these deflections on gear dynamics was investigated. Damping in the gear system usually is an unknown quantity, but it has an important effect in resonance vibration. Typical values as reported in the literature were used in the present analysis. The dynamic response due to different damping factors was evaluated and compared. The effect of the contact ratio on spur gear dynamic load and dynamic stress was investigated through a parameter study. The contact ratio was varied over the range of 1. 26 to 2. 46 by adjusting the tooth <b>addendum.</b> <b>Gears</b> with contact ratio near 2. 0 were found to have the most favorable dynamic performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Planetary {{gear drive}} with minor teeth {{difference}} (zd≤ 8) {{is one of}} the advanced transmitting styles and could meet the requirement of larger ratio in a smaller size of dimension. Generally the <b>gears</b> with <b>addenda</b> modifications play a principal role in planetary gear drive of minor teeth difference to avoid teeth interference during the mesh, and this transmission implies cumbersome parameters calculations and brings up higher angle of engagement to affect the load capacity because of life weakening on carrier bearings involved. In fact, provided some certain promise, zero addenda modification (viz. X-zero) drive with minor teeth difference could also qualify for gearing conditions so as to reduce the complicacy of calculations and angle of engagement mentioned above. From investigating the relationships amongst the total teeth number of internal gear, difference of tooth number between internal and external <b>gear,</b> <b>addendum</b> coefficient and teeth profile interference criterion, the unique design characteristic about X–zero gear drive with minor teeth difference are outlined...|$|R

40|$|Wind turbine gearbox {{operates}} under a {{wide array}} of highly fluctuating and dynamic load conditions caused by the stochastic nature of wind and operational wind turbine controls. Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates gear micropitting of high-speed stage gears of a wind turbine gearbox operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard of gear micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk of gear micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and lubricant film thickness along the line of action of gear tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and lubricant film thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The lubricant film thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip of the driving gear engages with the root of the driven gear. The lubricant film thickness increases with the increase of rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the <b>addendum</b> of driving <b>gear</b> and the dedendum of driven gear. The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact. At the low-torque condition, the varying rotational speed condition may cause a considerable variation of lubricant film thickness thus interrupting the lubrication which may result in micropitting...|$|R
