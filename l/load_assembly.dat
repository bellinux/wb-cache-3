50|$|The PLGen module {{stands for}} the virtual model {{generator}} or the pre-processor of the PLPAK. It mainly changes any structural drawing to {{what is called the}} “virtual model”. Modeller can import structural drawings from DXF CAD files or can draw then directly using the CAD capabilities of the PLGen. The virtual model looks very similar to the original structural drawing. The PLGen mainly define the structure using series of objects. These objects are classified into one of three categories: the geometrical objects (single slab and openings), the loading objects (column load, wall load, load patch, <b>load</b> <b>assembly)</b> and the supporting objects (column, wall, wall assembly, soil support, beam). Using such objects the modeler can define all elements in the building slab. It has to be noted that the virtual model represents the actual slab shape (not like the centre-line model of the finite element method). Columns and walls are represented by the actual cross section shape. The PLGen can also input the numerical models of each object such as the number of boundary elements for each segments, the discretization of the beam-slab contact areas, etc. Load cases only (i.e. no load combinations) are defined in the PLGen module. Material properties are also defined herein. The below Figure demonstrates the graphical user interface of the PLGen module.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the performance of}} a modified large scale shear box apparatus, which is mainly used to execute full scale laboratory study of segmental retaining walls. A typical apparatus has already been adopted by the current ASTM and NCMA test protocols and by literature studying of those test protocols, it is found that protocols recommend a fixed vertical actuator with roller or airbag configuration as a proposed vertical <b>loading</b> <b>assembly.</b> Previous research study demonstrated that vertical loading arrangement greatly influences the interface shear capacity of block systems and fixed vertical actuator with flexible airbag shows better loading arrangement for the blocks which have dilatant behavior. However, airbag arrangement is strenuous and time-consuming <b>loading</b> <b>assembly</b> compared to fixed vertical actuator which increases normal load with shear displacement due to bending of vertical actuator locked with the top block during shear loading. For the drawbacks of fixed vertical loading arrangement, the apparatus used in this study was fully redesigned and modified in terms of normal loading arrangement specially. A moveable vertical <b>loading</b> <b>assembly</b> is used in the modified apparatus which allows the piston movement with the top blocks during shear testing. The results outlined in this paper report that normal load remains constant over the period of shear testing {{for a wide range of}} surcharge loading. It could easily be concluded that the modified apparatus might be a better alternative to the existing apparatus used in the test protocols. ...|$|R

The development of methods for the active control of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities and correction of error fields is mandatory in view of fusion reactors or experimental test reactors under design. Recently, a very effective control scheme, named clean mode control (CMC), has been proposed in a reversed field pinch experiment (RFX-mod). The CMC is based on the real-time correction (cleaning), under simplifying hypothesis, of the sideband harmonics in the magnetic field produced by the discrete local active coils. In this paper, we focus on the problem of carefully computing the penetration of sidebands through a realistic <b>load</b> <b>assembly,</b> but still with a simplified cylindrical geometry, to allow for a detailed comparison with the crude CMC algorithm without the additional complication of the coupling between the poloidal harmonics due to the toroidal geometry...|$|E

The manufacture; <b>load,</b> <b>assembly</b> and pack (LAP); demilitarization; washout operations; and open burn/open detonation (OB/OD) of ordnance and explosives has resulted in contamination of soils with munitions residues. The primary constituents are nitroaromatic and nitramine organic compounds and heavy metals.

The RCC thicknesses varied from 102 mm (4 in.) to 152 mm (6 in.) and to 203 mm (8 in.), respectively. A bi-directional loading device with a dual-tire <b>load</b> <b>assembly</b> {{was used for}} this experiment. Each test section was instrumented with multiple pressure cells and strain gages. The objective was to evaluate the structural performance and load carrying capacity of thin RCC-surfaced pavements under accelerated loading.

It was observed that a fatigue failure would be the primary pavement distress type for a thin RCC pavement under trafficking.

In particular, {{the operation of the}} machine in the H and I regimes at the 10 MA plasma current levels has been considered and analyzed. The unique properties of the plasmas that can be generated by operating the machine with reduced parameters (lower magnetic fields and plasma currents) relative to those needed to achieve ignition are identified. A key feature of this operation is the relatively fast duty cycle that can be maintained. The Ideal Ignition Conditions, under which the density barrier due to bremsstrahlung emission in high density plasmas is removed, can be attained in this case. The plasma heating cycles are identified for which the contribution of ICRH is used both to enter the H-regime and to optimize the time needed for ignition. The ongoing effort to set up a test ICRH facility is described. The initial results (2 km/sec) of the high speed pellet injection system developed for Ignitor and operated at Oak Ridge are reported.
