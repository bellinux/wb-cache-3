40|$|In much of {{classical}} queueing theory, workloads {{are assumed to}} be <b>light-tailed,</b> with job sizes being described using exponential or phase type distributions. However, over the past two decades, studies have shown that several real-world workloads exhibit heavy-tailed characteristics. As a result, there has been a strong interest in studying queues with heavy-tailed workloads. So at this stage, there is a large body of literature on queues with <b>light-tailed</b> workloads, and a large body of literature on queues with heavy-tailed workloads. However, heavy-tailed workloads and <b>light-tailed</b> workloads differ considerably in their behavior, and these two types of workloads are rarely studied jointly. In this thesis, we design scheduling policies for queueing systems, considering both heavy-tailed as well as <b>light-tailed</b> workloads. The motivation for this line of work is twofold. First, since real world workloads can be heavy-tailed or <b>light-tailed,</b> it is desirable to design schedulers that are robust in their performance to distributional assumptions on the workload. Second, there might be scenarios where a heavy-tailed and a <b>light-tailed</b> workload interact in a queueing system. In such cases, it is desirable to design schedulers that guarantee fairness in resource allocation for both workload types. In this thesis, we study three models involving the design of scheduling disciplines for both heavy-tailed as well as <b>light-tailed</b> workloads. In Chapters 3 and 4, we design schedulers that guarantee robust performance across heavy-tailed and <b>light-tailed</b> workloads. In Chapter 5, we consider a setting in which a heavy-tailed and a <b>light-tailed</b> workload complete for service. In this setting, we design scheduling policies that guarantee good response time tail performance for both workloads, while also maintaining throughput optimality. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a system with}} two heterogeneous traffic classes, one having <b>light-tailed</b> characteristics, the other one exhibiting heavy-tailed properties. When both classes are backlogged, the two corresponding queues are each served at a certain nominal rate. However, when one queue empties, the service rate for the other class increases. This dynamic sharing of surplus service capacity {{is reminiscent of the}} Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) discipline. GPS-based scheduling algorithms, such as Weighted Fair Queueing, provide a candidate implementation mechanism for achieving differentiated Quality-of-Service in a DiffServ architecture. We characterize the asymptotic workload behavior of both traffic classes. The tail of the workload distribution of the heavy-tailed class is asymptotically equivalent to that of the heavy-tailed class in isolation [...] but with its nominal service rate inflated by the slack capacity of the <b>light-tailed</b> class. For the <b>light-tailed</b> class, we show a sharp dichotomy in the qualitative behavior, depending on whether its load exceeds its nominal service rate or not. In underload scenarios, the tail of its workload distribution is equivalent to that of the <b>light-tailed</b> class in isolation, multiplied with a certain pre-factor. The pre-factor represents the probability that the heavy-tailed class is backlogged long enough for the <b>light-tailed</b> class to build up a large workload. This provides a measure for {{the extent to which the}} <b>light-tailed</b> class benefits from sharing surplus capacity with the heavy-tailed class. In contrast, in overload situations, the <b>light-tailed</b> class is adversely affected by the heavy-tailed class, and inherits its traffic characteristics...|$|E

We first show that the policy that gives complete priority to the <b>light-tailed</b> traffic guarantees the best possible tail behavior of both queue backlog distributions, whenever the queues are stable. However, the priority policy is not throughput maximizing, and can cause undesirable instability effects in the heavy queue. Next, we study the class of throughput optimal max-weight- scheduling policies. We discover a threshold phenomenon, and show that the steady-state light queue backlog distribution is heavy-tailed for arrival rates above a threshold value, and <b>light-tailed</b> otherwise.

40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that certain queue-length based {{scheduling}} algorithms, such as max-weight, can lead to poor delays {{in the presence of}} bursty traffic. To overcome this phenomenon, we consider the problem of designing scheduling policies that are robust to bursty traffic, while also amenable to practical implementation. Specifically, we discuss two mechanisms, one based on adaptive CSMA, and the second based on maximum-weight scheduling with capped queue lengths. We consider a simple queueing network consisting of two conflicting links. The traffic served by the first link is bursty, and is modeled as being heavy-tailed, while traffic at the second link is modeled using a <b>light-tailed</b> arrival process. In this setting, previous work {{has shown that}} even the <b>light-tailed</b> traffic would experience heavy-tailed delays under max-weight scheduling. In contrast, we demonstrate a threshold phenomenon in the relationship between the arrival rates and the queue backlog distributions. In particular, we show that with an adaptive CSMA scheme, when the arrival rate of the <b>light-tailed</b> traffic is less than a threshold value, the <b>light-tailed</b> traffic experiences a <b>light-tailed</b> queue backlog at steady state, whereas for arrival rates above the same threshold, the <b>light-tailed</b> traffic experiences a heavy-tailed queue backlog.

40|$|We study {{scheduling}} problems arising in switched queueing networks, a {{class of}} stochastic systems that are often used to model data communication networks, such as uplinks and downlinks of cellular networks, networks of data switches, and ad hoc wireless networks. Motivated by empirical evidence of self-similarity and long-range dependence, the networks that we consider receive a mix of heavy-tailed and <b>light-tailed</b> trac. In this setting we evaluate the delay performance of the widely-studied class of Max-Weight scheduling policies. As performance metric we use the notion of delay stability, i. e., whether the steady-state expected delay in a queue is finite or not. Max-Weight policies {{are known to have}} excellent stability properties, and also to achieve good delay performance under <b>light-tailed</b> trac. Classical results from queueing theory imply that heavy-tailed queues are delay unstable under any policy, so we focus on the potential impact of heavy tails on <b>light-tailed</b> queues. The main insight derived from this thesis is that the Max-Weight policy performs poorly in the presence of heavy tails, whereas a suitably modified version of Max-Weight achieves much better overall performance. More specifically: (i) under the Max-Weight scheduling policy, any <b>light-tailed</b> queue that conflicts (i. e., cannot be served simultaneously) with a heavy-tailed queue is delay unstable; (ii) delay instability may propagate to <b>light-tailed</b> queues that do not conflict with heavy-tailed queues. The latter can happen through a "domino effect," if a <b>light-tailed</b> queue conflicts with a queue that has become delay unstable because it conflicts with a heavy-tailed queue. The extent of this phenomenon depends on the arrival rates; (iii) under the parameterized Max-Weight- scheduling policy, all <b>light-tailed</b> queues are delay stable provided the -parameters are chosen suitably. On the methodological side, we show how fluid approximations can be combined with renewal theory in order to prove delay instability results. Moreover, we show how fluid approximations can be combined with stochastic Lyapunov theory in order to prove delay stability results.

The copula of the max-stable limit distribution does not depend on the margins. So margins seem to play a subsidiary role in multivariate extremes. The theory and examples presented in this paper cast a different light on the significance of margins.
