In this paper, <b>a</b> <b>security</b> {{network is}} {{considered}} as <b>a</b> diagram <b>of</b> <b>security</b> systems deployed {{in different places}} in a guard zone. For <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network, its vulnerability is an important metric to judge whether its protection effectiveness is good or not. How to evaluate the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network? We bring forward <b>a</b> protection model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> system based on Neyman-Pearson criterion. According to the model, we propose methods to determine the most vulnerable path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network. The protection probability of the most vulnerable path is {{used to assess the}} vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network. Ultimately, we can gain insight about the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> network.

40|$|Securities and booked {{securities}} - {{changes in}} legislation The purpose of my thesis is to analyse enactment of securities in the New Civil Code. Current legislation in Act on Securities {{is not considered}} as satisfactory in many ways. Recodification of civil law brings {{a great opportunity to}} clarify current interpretational issues and approximate Czech law of securities to developed countries of Western Europe. In this thesis I shall asses if the new piece of legislation will be successful in achieving such goal. The thesis is composed of nine chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of securities law. Chapter One is introductory and defines concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> and its historical development. Chapter Two deals with issues related to definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> in Czech law. It focuses on the absence of legal definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> in current Czech law and analyses definitions of jurisprudence. Chapter Two analyses the legal definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> in New Civil Code and addresses the issue <b>of</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>security</b> in relation to booked securities. Chapter Three is concerned with <b>a</b> <b>security</b> as <b>a</b> subject <b>of</b> legal relations. The main issue addressed in Chapter Three is <b>security</b> as <b>a</b> tangible thing. Chapter Four concentrates on separation <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> represented by <b>a</b> certificate and [...] ...|$|R
