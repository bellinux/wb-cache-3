25|$|The Model 1895 was {{the first}} Winchester rifle to feature a box {{magazine}} located underneath the action instead of the tubular magazine design, which had remained fundamentally unchanged from the Winchester 1866. This allowed the rifle to safely chamber military and hunting cartridges with spitzer (pointed) bullets. The M1895 was also {{the last of the}} lever-action rifles to be designed by John Browning, and featured a rear <b>locking</b> <b>bolt</b> as in his previous designs dating back to the Winchester 1886. The M1895 is the strongest lever-action rifle Winchester has produced, designed to handle the increased pressures generated by the more powerful smokeless powder cartridges entering common use {{at the time of its}} introduction. By today’s standards however, the design is considered relatively weak, and not suited to high pressure loads.|$|E
500|$|Colt never {{claimed to}} have invented the revolver; his design was a more {{practical}} adaption of Collier's earlier revolving flintlock incorporating a <b>locking</b> <b>bolt</b> to keep the cylinder {{in line with the}} barrel. The invention of the percussion cap made ignition more reliable, faster, and safer than the older flintlock design. Colt's great contribution was to the use of interchangeable parts. Knowing that some gun parts were made by machine, he envisioned that all the parts on every Colt gun to be interchangeable and made by machine, later to be assembled by hand. His goal was the assembly line. This is shown in an 1836 letter that Colt wrote to his father in which he said, ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 1, 1894, a naval test {{board was}} convened at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island, to test {{submitted}} magazine rifles {{in the new}} 6mm Navy caliber developed by naval ordnance authorities. The government notice of bid requirements said no other calibers or cartridges would be considered. Winchester made the ammunition for the government, which in turn provided each competitor with 6mm U.S.N. cartridges and 0.236-inch caliber rifle barrels, the latter supplied unchambered and with receiver threads uncut. The rifle action was required to withstand the firing of five overpressure (proof) cartridges with a chamber pressure of 60,000 psi. [...] Several inventors and rifle manufacturers submitted models for testing, among them James Paris Lee, who offered two designs, a turnbolt and a cam-action or <b>locking</b> <b>bolt</b> type, the Lee straight-pull. The Lee straight-pull won in repeated trials and the U.S. Navy adopted the round in 1895 as the Lee Rifle, Model of 1895, caliber 6-mm.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933, {{the chief}} {{engineer}} of Hispano-Suiza, Marc Birkigt, began work {{on the design of}} an entirely new weapon to replace the Oerlikon contract, based on a locking mechanism patented in 1919 by the American machine-gun designer Carl Swebilius. The result was the Type 404, or HS.404. While the HS.404 resembled the parent Oerlikon FF S in many respects, its repeating mechanism was a gas-operated <b>locking</b> <b>bolt.</b> [...] On firing the 404, when the projectile passes a hole cut into the barrel about half way along its length hot gas behind the projectile is siphoned off and enters a chamber. Inside the chamber is a piston that presses on a rod running {{along the top of the}} barrel back to the bolt, unlocking it and allowing it and the spent cartridge to move backwards. Since the bolt was locked during firing, it could be lighter than that of the Oerlikon, thus facilitating an increase in rate of fire to 700 rounds per minute (rpm), a gain of about 200 rpm. In 1938, Birkigt patented it and started production in their Geneva factory.|$|E
2500|$|The first Stevens 520 {{appeared}} in Stevens' 1909 Catalog #52 {{and was also}} offered {{for sale in the}} Fall 1909 Sears & Roebuck catalog. It is easily recognizable by its [...] "Humpback" [...] double hump receiver. [...] It had a round slide release knob {{on the left side of}} the receiver, a visible breech <b>locking</b> <b>bolt</b> on the top of the receiver, and base models had a rounded pistol grip on the butt stock. The fore grip was ringed and uniform in size. The trigger housing was retained with three screws and the safety was a lever located inside the trigger guard in front of the trigger. The cartridge stop was a rocker design with a set screw on front right side of the receiver. There were other models including a Model 522 trap gun and the 525, 530, and 535 with increasing levels of engraving and stock quality (some straight grip) and fore grips. Internally there was an inertial slide release block that was affixed to the inside of the receiver. [...] This inertial release used the recoil of a discharged round to unlock the breech. [...] The action was designed to only unlock after firing or with use of the slide release and not by dry firing like many modern shotguns. [...] All model 520s were only offered in 12 gauge until 1928.|$|E

For shear force loaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> connections the possible failures will be listed and the accompannying arithmetical verification presented. Due to the variety of fiber plastic composites, whose selection mainly depends on the type and amount of the load, in this project trial-based assessments are determined and the capacities to withstand certain stresses are investigated. The investigation is focused on the determination of the compliances and the ultimate interface pressure, the shear and bearing stress experiments for the experimental determination of the bearing stress coeddicient as well as the use of the statistic test planning and evaluation in respect to the use of slip-restiant preloaded <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> connections.

25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing solenoid valves. Using relays for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the <b>lock</b> <b>bolt</b> could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|R
