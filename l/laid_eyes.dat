5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never <b>laid</b> <b>eyes</b> on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna {{takes the form of}} the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E

2500|$|Cunningham began {{teaching}} at the City College of New York (19621965) and the Brooklyn Museum Art School (19621980). His Sunday high school scholarship class at BMAS {{came to be known}} for its nontraditional methods of figurative painting, observing directly from nature using a plumb-line and finder, and putting down on the flat surface of the canvas abstracted color-value notes. Students included Peter Colquhoun, Israel Hershberg, Richard Leto and Ephraim Rubenstein. [...] "Francis Cunningham taught us all how to see," [...] said Rubenstein.

Together they also co-founded with Stuart Pivar The New York Academy of Art (19831985), which continues to operate in 2013.|$|E
