25|$|In a {{parallel}} evolution, {{the development of}} 9-1-1 as a national emergency number began in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, in 1959. The concept of a single answering point for emergency calls to public safety agencies caught on quickly. In the United States, {{the decision was made}} to utilize the Canadian number, for reasons of ease of memory (4-1-1 and 6-1-1 were already in use), and ease of dialing. In 1967, the number was established as the national emergency number for the United States, although by 2008, coverage of the service was still not complete, and about 4 percent of the United States did not have 9-1-1 service. Calling this single number provided caller access to police, fire and ambulance services, through what would become known as a common Public-safety answering point (PSAP). The technology would also continue to evolve, resulting in Enhanced 9-1-1 including the ability to 'lock' telephone lines on emergency calls, preventing accidental disconnection, and Automatic Number Identification/Automatic <b>Location</b> <b>Identification</b> (ANI/ALI), which permits the dispatcher to verify the number originating the call (screening out potential false alarms), and identifying the location of the call, against the possibility of the caller becoming disconnected or unconscious.|$|E

The aim is a locations identification of the statues with focus on the Sokolov District and the analysis of funding of their conservation and restoration. The teoretical part of the Bachelors Thesis is the definition of terms, characterization of the statues through centuries and specification of their role in the public space, as well as description of conservation and restoration funding. The practical part is focused on <b>locations</b> <b>identification</b> of the statues within the bounds of the Sokolov District and the analysis of their fudning.
