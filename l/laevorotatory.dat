40|$|Chirality in {{molecular}} opto-electronics {{is limited}} sofar {{to the use}} of optically active liquid crystals and a number of optical phenomena are related to the helical macroscopic structure obtained by using one enantiomer, only. In this paper, the use of chirality in nonlinear optics and optical switching is demonstrated. The additional options offered by the combination of circularly polarized light and chiral molecules gives rise to the observation of Second Harmonic Generation from centrosymmetric crystals of a racemic mixture. This phenomenon is due to the existence of optical activity in the hyperpolarizability. Chiroptical switching is observed in inherently dissymmetric molecules, that can undergo a photochemical isomerization of a strongly dextrorotatory isomer into a strongly <b>laevorotatory</b> isomer. Using circular dichroism the switching between these two pseudo-enantiomers can be monitored accurately. ...|$|E
40|$|The term “glycoside” is {{a general}} term applied to {{compounds}} containing a group combined with a sugar residue through an ether linkage involving the reducing hydroxyl.

DC oils against four species of Aspergilli such as A. flavus Link, A. niger van Tieghem, A. ochraceus Wilhelm, A. terreus Thom causing post-harvest deterioration of pigeon pea seeds. During experimentation it was observed that the potency of both oils remained unchanged even against heavy inoculum dose (maximum number of 10 fungal discs and diameter of 25 mm). Furthermore, the toxicity of both the oils did not alter even up to 120 ºC of temperature and 12 months of storage by exhibiting 100 % mycelial inhibition of test fungi. The toxicity of both the oils was decreased at alkaline pH (7, 8). Physicochemical characterization of oils revealed that C. ambrosioides oil was pale yellow in colour, lighter than water, <b>laevorotatory,</b> acidic in nature and showed positive test for phenols.

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} entities {{which have}} been derived from the constituents of opium, the dried exudate of the incised capsule of the opium poppy, have probably spawned more scientific publications than any other drug group. The observations that only the <b>laevorotatory</b> isomer of morphine, the active con-stituent of opium, was active and that most opioid analgesic drugs had similarities in structure, promp-ted Beckett and Casey to propose a tentative structure for an opioid receptor [4]. Since then our understanding of opioid pharmacology has pro-gressed steadily with the notable highs {{of the discovery of}} the endogenous ligands to the opioid receptor [37] and the overwhelming evidence of multiple opioid receptors first noted by Martin and colleagues [56]. The anaesthetist uses morphine and its derivatives most commonly as analgesics for moderate to severe pain. With adjustment of dose and route of administration, opioids may perform this function with the minimum of side effects, which may range from the uncomfortable (itching, nausea and vomiting) to the life-threatening (res-piratory depression). Chronic use of opioids may also lead to tolerance and physical dependence. It is worth re-emphasizing the theme which runs through most recent reviews of any aspect of opioid activity: "It was hoped that the development of opioid agonists selective for a particular opioid receptor subtype might separate the useful actions of opioids from the rest, and result in a therapeutic break-through. This breakthrough has not occurred!" What then, is the relevance of the subdivisions of opioid receptors to the anaesthetist...|$|E
40|$|The partial {{asymmetric}} syntheses {{performed by}} McKenzie involving Grignard reactions on optically active alpha-keto-esters. [diagram] are discussed, and {{a mechanism for}} the course of such syntheses is proposed. The reaction is probably influenced primarily by asymmetry in the electromagnetic field in the neighbourhood of the alpha-carbonyl group, induced by the asymmetric field in the optically active centre, and also by the differing free energies of intermediate diastereoisomeric Grignard complexes formed during the reaction. The resultant asymmetric synthesis is therefore directed {{by a combination of}} these effects, and not by any single force of "asymmetric induction" as originally postulated by McKenzie. This hypothesis is substantiated by reference to the two complementary syntheses of [diagrams] as the sign of rotation of the product and the degree of asymmetric synthesis are shown to depend on both the above factors. The effect of increasing the separation between the asymmetric and reaction centres in such syntheses has been studied by performing Grignard reactions on the homologous series of (-) -menthyl ketoesters, [diagram] Asymmetric synthesis takes place when n = 2 or 3, and the relationship between the hydroxy-acids and their corresponding lactones formed in these reactions has been investigated. <b>Laevorotatory</b> acids, giving dextrorotatory lactones of higher specific rotation than the parent compound were obtained, the degree of asymmetric synthesis being only slightly dependent on the conditions of reaction. No optical activity could be detected in the hydroxy-acids formed when n= 4 or 8, probably because the electromagnetic induction effect is dissipated along the methylene chain, and the difference in free energy between the diastereoisomeric Grignard complexes is too small to effect any observable asymmetric synthesis. <p...|$|E
40|$|The optical rotatory {{power of}} some natural cyclohexene oxides, such as (+) -chaloxone, 1, (+) -epiepoformine, 2, (+) -epoformine, 3, (+) -epoxidone, 5, (-) -sphaeropsidone, 6, (-) -episphaeropsidone, 7, and the {{synthetic}} compound (+) -epitheobroxide, 4, has been calculated {{by means of}} the TDDFT/B 3 LYP method using the 6 - 31 G(d) and aug- cc-pVDZ basis sets, both in the gas phase and in solution {{by means of the}} polarizable continuum model. For compounds 1 and 2, which possess high (about 300 units) optical rotations, gas-phase calculations with the smaller basis set are able to reproduce the experimental values both in sign and order of magnitude. By contrast, a larger basis set is required to satisfactorily simulate the OR values of 3 and 4, which show smaller (about 100 units or less) rotations. The inclusion of the solvent effects is different for different compounds; for 1 and 2, it leads to a better agreement between experiment and prediction, while for 3 and 4, the presence of hydrogen bonding groups makes the application of continuum solvation models less satisfactory. For the flexible system 5, the absolute configuration could not be determined using gas-phase calculations and the smaller basis set, but both inclusion of solvent and larger basis set effects are compulsory. It is noteworthy that calculations both in the gas phase and in the solvent lead to a positive rotatory power for the <b>laevorotatory</b> natural compounds 6 and 7 if the ACs reported in the literature are employed to do the theoretical prediction. This strongly indicates that the ACs previously assigned to these compounds in the literature are not correct and that the TDDFT prediction of OR values has become by now a practicable tool for AC assignments...|$|E
40|$|Some α-adrenoceptor-mediated {{cardiovascular}} {{activities and}} α-adrenoceptor binding affinities for (+) - and (-) -lofexidine (Dexlofexidine and Levlofexidine) {{have been studied}} in comparison with racemic lofexidine. In pithed normotensive rats, i. v. (-) -lofexidine elicited pressor effects at doses (0. 1 - 30 μg/kg), which were approximately 20 times {{lower than those of}} the (+) -isomer. Both yohimbine and prazosin in selective amounts of 1. 0 and 0. 1 mg/kg (i. v., - 15 min), respectively, attenuated the increase in diastolic pressure induced by (±) -, (+) - and (-) -lofexidine, showing the involvement of α 1 - as well as α 2 -adrenoceptors in the vasopressor responses. No differences were observed in the sensitivity of the pressor effects of the (+) - and (-) -enantiomers to blockade by either yohimbine or prazosin. Following i. v. administration to pentobarbitone-anaesthetized normotensive rats, (-) -lofexidine (0. 5 - 5. 0 μg/kg) was found about 20 times more effective than the dextrorotatory isomer in decreasing mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The increase in heart rate evoked by electrical stimulation in pithed rats was dose-dependently reduced by (±) -, (-) - and (+) -lofexidine, the (-) -isomer being about 30 times more potent than the (+) -isomer. Similarly, the electrical stimulation-induced increase in diastolic pressure was also most effectively impaired by the <b>laevorotatory</b> enantiomer of lofexidine. (-) -Lofexidine showed an approximately 9 -fold higher affinity than (+) -lofexidine for the α 2 -adrenoceptor-like binding sites in rat brain membranes identified by [3 H]-clonidine and was 4 times more potent at displacing [3 H]-prazosin from α 1 -adrenoceptors. It is concluded that the α-adrenoceptor activity of lofexidine resides predominantly in the (-) -isomer. The isomeric activity ratio of the enantiomers of lofexidine (about 20 -fold) is higher than normally found for other imidazolines...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} {{work on the}} preparation and resolution of asymmetric-silicon compounds is reviewed. The asymmetric-silicon compound MeEtPhSiC 6 H 4 COOH-P was prepared, and was resolved by fractional crystallisation of its quinine salts from ethanol. The less-soluble salt yielded the pure (+) acid, [?] D 25 = + 2. 75, (benzene). A <b>laevorotatory</b> sample, [?] D 25 = - 1. 65, of the acid {{was obtained from the}} more-soluble fractions. This represents the first well authenticated resolution of a tetracovalent silicon compound, containing only one asymmetric-silicon atom, which may be obtained free from other asymmetric centres. The (+) acid was shown to be optically stable when maintained in the liquid state at 100 0 for six hours, and in solution with 5 % aqueous methanolic potassium hydroxide at room temperature for eighteen hours. A preliminary investigation of the optical consequences of cleavage of the silicon-phenyl group of the (+) acid was made. The diastereoisomorphous organosilicon (-) menthoxides MeEtPhSiOR and MeBunPriSiOR (R = (-) menthyl), which it was hoped to resolve by fractional crystallisation, were prepared, but they could not be obtained as solids. The possibility of employing gas-liquid chromatography to separate the volatile diastereoisomers of an asymmetric- silicon compound was investigated, using the sec-Tjutoxy- derivatives of (j:) MeBu.;r.;SiGl.

A specific D 2 -dopamine receptor agonist, LY- 171555 (a <b>laevorotatory</b> enantiomer of LY- 141865 : N-propyl tricyclic pyrazole) at 10 (- 6) M inhibited electrical stimulation- and high K+-evoked release of [3 H]-acetylcholine ([3 H]-ACh) to 47. 7 +/- 6. 0 % and 54. 1 +/- 5. 0 % of control, respectively. The maximal inhibition by LY- 171555 at 10 (- 5) M was 54. 8 +/- 5. 1 % {{reduction of the}} control. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50) of LY- 171555 for the inhibition of [3 H]-ACh release was 2. 3 X 10 (- 7) M. A specific D 2 -dopamine receptor antagonist, (-) -sulpiride (10 (- 7) M) reversed the inhibition of [3 H]-ACh release induced by LY- 171555. A specific D 1 -dopamine receptor agonist, SK&F 38393 (2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydro- 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 1 -phenyl- 1 H-benzazepine) (10 (- 5) M) {{had no effect on}} the release of [3 H]-ACh. LY- 171555 (10 (- 6) M) also inhibited the high K+-evoked endogenous glutamate release, by 47 % of control. This inhibitory effect was reversed by (-) -sulpiride (10 (- 7) M). We used a fluorescent, highly selective Ca 2 + indicator, 'quin 2 ' to measure intracellular free Ca 2 + concentrations ([Ca 2 +]i). Electrical stimulation of slices preloaded with quin 2 led to an elevation of relative fluorescence intensity and this response was reduced by the removal of Ca 2 + from the bathing medium. These results indicate that the enhanced elevation in fluorescence intensity in the quin 2 -loaded slices reflects the increase of intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration, [Ca 2 +]i. The mixed D 1 - and D 2 -receptor agonist, apomorphine and LY- 171555 inhibited the increase of [Ca 2 +]i induced by electrical stimulation or high K+ medium, in a concentration-dependent manner, while SK&F 38393 did not affect the increase of [Ca 2 +]i. The maximal inhibitory effect of LY- 171555 at 3 X 10 (- 5) M was 35 +/- 3 % reduction in control values. The inhibitory effect of LY- 171555 was antagonized by (-) -sulpiride (10 (- 7) M). There was a high correlation (r = 0. 997, P less than 0. 05) between the D 2 -receptor-mediated inhibition of the stimulated rise of [Ca 2 +]i and [3 H]-ACh release. When the slices were superfused with the Ca 2 +-free medium containing EGTA (10 (- 4) M) for 5 min, the rise in [Ca 2 +]i was markedly suppressed to 18. 0 % of control by LY- 171555 (10 (- 6) M). These data indicate that activation of the D 2 -dopamine receptor suppresses the elevation of [Ca 2 +]i induced by depolarizing stimuli. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
