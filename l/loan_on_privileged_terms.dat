500|$|In this period, {{a diploma}} can be characterised as a formal and {{symbolic}} record, in Latin, of an occasion when the king, {{acting in a}} royal assembly, and {{with the consent of}} the ecclesiastical and secular orders, created an estate of [...] "bookland" [...] at a specified place, and conveyed it <b>on</b> the <b>privileged</b> <b>terms</b> defined by the [...] "book", or diploma, to a named beneficiary. This act of establishing a particular estate as bookland, so that it could be held henceforth <b>on</b> these <b>privileged</b> <b>terms,</b> could be performed only by the king, in a royal assembly; but the diploma itself served hereafter as the title-deed for the land in question. It established that the land was to be held, with its appurtenances, free from the imposition of worldly burdens, with the exception of military service, bridge-work and fortress-work, and with the power to give it to anyone of its owner's choosing.|$|R
6000|$|If you {{cross-examine}} {{the duke}} and the coster, {{you will find}} that they are not concerned for the scholastic attainments of their children. Ask the duke whether he could pass the standard examination of twelve-year-old children in elementary schools, and he will admit, with an entirely placid smile, that he would almost certainly be ignominiously plucked. And he is so little ashamed of or disadvantaged by his condition that he is not prepared to spend an hour in remedying it. The coster may resent the inquiry instead of being amused by it; but his answer, if true, will be the same. What they both want for their children is the communal training, the apprenticeship to society, the lessons in holding one's own among people of all sorts with whom one is not, as in the home, <b>on</b> <b>privileged</b> <b>terms.</b> These can be acquired only by [...] "mixing with the world," [...] no matter how wicked the world is. No parent cares twopence whether his children can write Latin hexameters or repeat the dates of the accession of all the English monarchs since the Conqueror; but all parents are earnestly anxious about the manners of their children. Better Claude Duval than Kaspar Hauser. Laborers who are contemptuously anti-clerical in their opinions will send their daughters to the convent school because the nuns teach them some sort of gentleness of speech and behavior. And peers who tell you that our public schools are rotten through and through, and that our Universities ought to be razed to the foundations, send their sons to Eton and Oxford, Harrow and Cambridge, not only because there is nothing else to be done, but because these places, though they turn out blackguards and ignoramuses and boobies galore, turn them out with the habits and manners of the society they belong to. Bad as those manners are in many respects, they are better than no manners at all. And no individual or family can possibly teach them. They can be acquired only by living in an organized community in which they are traditional.|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: This article {{attempts}} {{a medieval}} Christian rereading of Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s enigmatic and unfinished text, The Visible and the Invisible. Along the way, it complicates current notions of ocularcentrism, {{as well as}} the idea of an embodied gaze. The <b>privileged</b> <b>term</b> in these historical fragments is flesh: in Merleau-Ponty and in medieval Christianity, a carnal presence insinuates itself into the relations between bodies, between things and thoughts, self and world. In the end, the speculative encounter between the two central studies offers a new perspective on debates about the historiography of vision and the peculiar potency of the visual world...|$|R
