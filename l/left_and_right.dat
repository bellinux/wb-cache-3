5|$|Blood {{from here}} drains into the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> {{transverse}} sinuses. These then drain into the sigmoid sinuses, which receive {{blood from the}} cavernous sinus and superior and inferior petrosal sinuses. The sigmoid drains into the large internal jugular veins.|$|E
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> atria; and lower <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E

5|$|Although he had stated an {{interest}} in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa's parents persuaded him {{to take up the}} piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until his <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> hands were equally strong.|$|E

Manchester United organised themselves slightly differently, with Paul Scholes playing ahead of the midfield in a supporting role behind the main striker, Andy Cole. The team lined up in a 4–4–1–1 formation.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011, {{after many}} years of {{proposals}} and delays, construction began on a major upgrade of the Henlys Corner interchange. An underpass was originally proposed but this was heavily criticised by local residents, and would have been very costly, and was subsequently scrapped. The upgrade scheme improved on the current junction by adding extra lanes and allowing easier <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> turns, speeding up queue times. Cycle paths and safer pedestrian crossings were included.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
