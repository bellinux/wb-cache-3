Since a lot of information has been lost during the inference by <b>using</b> the <b>indicator</b> data instead of the original data, so we are concerned whether the indicator CUSUM test is robust to the heavy-tailed sequences; moreover, we may ask: how large is the loss <b>in</b> power <b>in</b> <b>using</b> <b>indicators</b> when the data has a nearly normal distribution? The HAC estimator σ̂^ 2 in the robust CUSUM test is a kernel estimator, so it is important to analyze whether the performance is affected by the choice of the kernel function k(·) and the bandwidth γ_T.|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} few years, the {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>using</b> benthic <b>indicators</b> to assess marine environments has increased dramatically after a rather long period of relative stagnation, mostly due {{to the need to}} assess the status of coastal marine waters required by North American and European regulations. Numerous papers on this topic have been published in the domain of ecology, using a variety of different terms to refer to two categories of information: benthic species and the status of benthic communities. Nowa- days, the abundant literature on these two categories makes it possible to comment on (1) the deﬁnition of the different terms used by benthic researchers, (2) the current increase of papers of rising complexity about benthic indicators, and (3) the subjectivity and objectivity involved <b>in</b> <b>using</b> benthic <b>indicators.</b> Faced with {{the increase in the number}} of methods, we recommend pragmatism and thus the transfer of simple methods to the research consultancies that are responsible for assessing benthic quality in numerous impact studies. Using certain procedures, such as the ''sentinel species", the best professional judgement (BPJ) and taxonomic sufﬁciency (TS), should clearly be encouraged...|$|R

40|$|The Arab spring largely {{transformed}} the entire Arab world. In almost every country a major or minor protests erupted against their respective regimes. However, {{results of these}} protests differ. An element present in every case is the effort of any given regime to suppress the protests violently. The aim of this work is therefore to study {{the extent to which}} the character of the particular armies affected the regime change in the examined states. To this end, the altered ends-ways-means paradigm is employed to identify the <b>indicators</b> <b>used</b> to establish the effectiveness and loyalty of the particular armies. Subsequently, the hybrid regimes typology is used to compare the changes in studied states and then define the degree of regime change. Finally, the Kendall rank correlation is utilized to determine the level of association between two examined phenomena. The results suggest a possibility of strong relation between the effectiveness and loyalty on one hand and regime change on the other. This result points to the need of further inquiry into the relation between army characteristics and democratisation processes and thus, even in spite of possible deficiencies <b>in</b> <b>used</b> <b>indicators,</b> partly contributes to the debate on army role in the authoritarian regimes in the Middle East...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest <b>in</b> <b>using</b> <b>indicators</b> of subjective well-being and ill-being {{to inform policy}} debates, and there are now national and international surveys of subjective well-being and ill-being in the European Union, Australia, and elsewhere. Furthermore, subjective indicators of well-being are already a significant component of monitoring important domains such as health-related quality of life. For an explanation of why the indicators of subjective well-being are needed, and why they add information beyond economic and social indicators, please refer to Diener and Seligman (2004), Diener and Tov (in press), and Kahneman and Krueger (in press). Subjective well-being measures {{may be used as}} input to discussions about national policies, and they can also be helpful to business leaders, as well as to government officials at the local and regional levels. The indicators of subjective well-being and ill-being can be used for the evaluation of policies in many domains, including health care, public health, social services, parks and recreation, work life, transportation, families, and the environment. In democratic societies the indicators provide an important source of information to leaders about the well-being and concerns of the citizens...|$|R
