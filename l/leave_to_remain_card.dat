50|$|Many unaccompanied asylum-seeking {{children}} {{are facing a}} change in status as they approach 18, as most are initially given discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> until age 17 ½. This expiration of leave affects not only their benefits but also their ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> in the UK at all. <b>To</b> extend <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain,</b> the young person has to apply for an extension of discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> prior <b>to</b> the expiration, but even applying on time does not guarantee outcomes. Pathway planning at eighteen, therefore, covers similar options to those that refugees face while undergoing the initial asylum process. If the young person received refugee status upon first application, then he/she will retain that status upon turning eighteen and pathway planning is much simpler.|$|R

50|$|By far {{the most}} common outcome for {{separated}} children is a grant of discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> Discretionary <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> is provided most frequently when there are inadequate return arrangements for these children in their country of origin. This <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> is usually granted for three years or until the young person reaches 17 ½, whichever is sooner. The child may appeal if he thinks {{he should have been}} granted refugee status or humanitarian protection, but only if he was initially granted more than twelve months’ leave. It should be noted that both grants of humanitarian protection and of discretionary leave are still rejection of asylum claims, so the young people granted either of these have the right to appeal this decision.|$|R

50|$|Even if a {{child born}} in the UK on or after 1 January 1983 but does not acquire British {{citizenship}} at birth, the child is considered a lawful resident in the UK and is not required <b>to</b> apply for <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain.</b> The child, however, is subject to immigration control and the child's parent(s) can choose to apply for regularisation of the child's immigration status by the grant of <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> (for the same period as that held by the parent(s)). If the child leaves the UK, he/she must hold <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> enter or <b>remain</b> in order <b>to</b> return to the UK.|$|R
