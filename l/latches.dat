5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust would more than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers. The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames, with both <b>latches</b> controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front <b>latches</b> were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E
5|$|By {{moving the}} pan-tilt {{units of the}} laser range finders, it is also {{possible}} to obtain a point cloud in three dimensions. Technical readjustment between the model of the aircraft and the scene point cloud is already used in navigation to estimate the static placement of the robot. It is planned to make targeted acquisitions, simpler in terms of movement, to verify the absence of chocks in front of the landing gear wheels, or the proper closing of engine cowling <b>latches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mammals are amniotes, {{and most}} are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The {{exception}} to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it <b>latches</b> on to a nipple and completes its development.|$|E

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and <b>latches</b> were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Captain John Hart appears {{through the}} Cardiff space-time Rift using a vortex {{manipulator}} and asks Jack Harkness {{for help in}} locating three radioactive cluster bombs, apparently scattered across Cardiff. Jack Harkness tells his team that John cannot be trusted but agrees to help him. True to Jack's word, Captain John is lying and seizes the containers, trying to kill Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) using a paralyzing lip gloss, shooting Owen Harper (Burn Gorman), punching Toshiko Sato (Naoko Mori) and pushing Jack {{off the top of}} a building, thinking he's dead. However the containers, which are supposed to contain the location of a valuable diamond hidden by the lover he murdered, instead contain an explosive which <b>latches</b> on the DNA signature of her killer. As insurance against Torchwood leaving him to die, John handcuffs himself to Gwen and swallows the key. After superficially altering his DNA using that of the Torchwood staff, Jack and Owen are able to save John's life before banishing him. Spurned by his former lover, John leaves by means of his Vortex Manipulator.|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI <b>latches</b> onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|A load {{regulating}} mechanical <b>latch</b> {{is described}} {{that has a}} pivotally mounted <b>latch</b> element having a hook-shaped end with a strike roller-engaging laterally open hook for engaging a stationary strike roller. The <b>latch</b> element or hook is pivotally mounted in a clevis end of an elongated <b>latch</b> stem that is adapted for axial movement through an opening in a support plate or bracket mounted to a structural member. A coil spring is disposed over and around the extending <b>latch</b> stem and {{the lower end of}} the coil spring engages the support bracket. A thrust washer is removably attached to the other end of the <b>latch</b> stem and engages the other end of the coil spring and compresses the coil spring thereby preloading the spring and the <b>latch</b> element carried by the <b>latch</b> stem. The hook-shaped <b>latch</b> element has a limited degree of axial travel for loading caused by structural distortion which may change the relative positions of the <b>latch</b> element hook and the strike roller. Means are also provided to permit limited tilt of the <b>latch</b> element due to loading of the hook...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{divide the}} SR <b>latch</b> into two types. One is a random <b>latch,</b> {{and the other}} is a {{constant}} <b>latch.</b> We defined a “random latch” as an SR <b>latch</b> whose output sequence includes at least one transition between 0 and 1 and defined a “constant latch” as an SR <b>latch</b> that generates only 0 ’s or only 1 ’s.|$|R
5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door <b>latches</b> across the VE range. The inclusion of a seat belt reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a seat belt reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the seat belt reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E
5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the <b>latches</b> by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had to be lifted {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys {{it with his}} fist. Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn a desire to discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish <b>latches</b> onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>latch</b> hook tool traces {{its origin}} to the {{invention}} of the <b>latch</b> needle. Invented in 1847, the <b>latch</b> needle was part of a knitting machine that wrapped yarn around the <b>latch</b> and pushed through a canvas before pulling it through and knotting the yarn to the canvas. In the 1920s, the tool was created by combining the hand hook with the <b>latch.</b>|$|R

25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another <b>latching</b> region would allow for the <b>latching</b> of two input values at the two {{different}} outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new <b>latching</b> region configured to process data only when both <b>latching</b> regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, <b>latching</b> regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to <b>latching</b> region 7. At this instant, <b>latching</b> region 7 will let the values <b>latched</b> on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the <b>latching</b> regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|R

25|$|<b>Latches</b> and {{flip-flops}} {{are used}} as data storage elements. Such data storage {{can be used for}} storage of state, and such a circuit is described as sequential logic. When used in a finite-state machine, the output and next state depend not only on its current input, but also on its current state (and hence, previous inputs). It can also be used for counting of pulses, and for synchronizing variably-timed input signals to some reference timing signal.|$|E
25|$|A latch or a {{flip-flop}} is {{a circuit}} that has two stable states {{and can be}} used to store state information. They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit, to provide the circuit with a state. The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs. It is the basic storage element in sequential logic. <b>Latches</b> and flip-flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers, communications, and many other types of systems.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for {{and method}} of eliminating single event upsets (or SEU) in combinational logic {{are used to}} prevent error propagation {{as a result of}} cosmic particle strikes to the combinational logic. The apparatus preferably includes a combinational logic block electrically coupled to a delay element, a <b>latch</b> and an output buffer. In operation, a signal from the combinational logic is electrically coupled to a first input of the <b>latch.</b> In addition, the signal is routed through the delay element to produce a delayed signal. The delayed signal is routed to a second input of the <b>latch.</b> The <b>latch</b> used in the apparatus for preventing SEU preferably includes <b>latch</b> outputs and a feature that the <b>latch</b> outputs will not change state unless both <b>latch</b> inputs are correct. For example, the <b>latch</b> outputs may not change state unless both <b>latch</b> inputs have the same logical state. When a cosmic particle strikes the combinational logic, a transient disturbance with a predetermined length may appear in the signal. However, a function of the delay element is to preferably provide a time delay greater than the length of the transient disturbance. Therefore, the transient disturbance will not reach both <b>latch</b> inputs simultaneously. As a result, the <b>latch</b> outputs will not permanently change state in error due to the transient disturbance. In addition, the output buffer preferably combines the <b>latch</b> outputs {{in such a way that}} the correct state is preserved at all times.
