5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
25|$|Maud's {{two sisters}} and brother {{were in the}} Dakota Territory. Maud, Frank, and her two sons moved to Aberdeen, South Dakota, on September 20, 1888, because Frank {{believed}} there would be better business opportunities in the West. In 1882, when Maud had traveled with Frank while he had been performing in The Maid of Arran, she had not felt at ease in the western cities they visited. But scholar Katharine M. Rogers noted that Maud would have <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> close to her siblings and being afforded a chance at economic security. Frank started a dry goods store, Baum's Bazaar, on October 1, 1888, to make a stable living for his family. However, because he granted too much credit to his destitute customers, his store went out of business.|$|E

Her cover highlights include Vogue Paris (May 1993), Elle (October 1993), and Glamour (six times). In an interview given in July 2004, Moynahan, discussing her early work, said: [...] "It was a crazy world that {{paid a lot}} of money. I <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> a model, but I knew it would never last, so I looked into acting." ...|$|E

500|$|Geisel {{variously}} {{stated that}} the book took between nine and 18 months to create. Donald Pease notes that he worked on it primarily alone, unlike with previous books, which had been more collaborative efforts between Geisel and his wife, Helen. This marked a general trend in his work and life. As Robert L. Bernstein later said of that period, [...] "The more I saw of him, the more he <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> in that room and creating all by himself." [...] Pease points to Helen's recovery from Guillain–Barré syndrome, which {{she was diagnosed with}} in 1954, as the marker for this change.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Hurd had {{appeared}} on the television series Law & Order, making a guest appearance on the seventh season episode [...] "Entrapment" [...] in 1997. Hurd also previously appeared in the television shows New York Undercover and Players, {{both of which were}} produced by Law & Order creator Dick Wolf. When Wolf approached Hurd to play the part of Monique Jeffries, he warned her that the part was small at first but had the potential to develop, telling her, [...] "Think of her as a flower, she'll bloom later, but for the pilot she's just got a scene." [...] The character also had less screen-time than others in the series, in part so that Hurd could accept theater roles. However, Hurd felt the Jeffries character never received the development promised, claiming she [...] "just read instructions" [...] while playing the part. While she <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> part of the cast, Hurd said she was frustrated with the lack of material for her character, particularly when guest stars had more developed roles than Jeffries herself.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg {{attended}} Savanna High School in Anaheim, describing {{himself as}} a [...] "band geek" [...] who played the trumpet. At age 15, he snorkeled for the first time; Hillenburg {{took part in a}} [...] "dive program" [...] at Woods Coves in Laguna Beach, California, as part of the Regional Occupational Program at Savanna. This experience, as well as subsequent dives, reinforced his interest in, and led to his decision to study, marine biology in college: [...] "The switch clicked and I decided I wanted to be a marine biologist, but I also <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> an artist." [...] Some of his high-school teachers, who knew of his interest in art and fascination with the ocean, advised him otherwise, saying: [...] "You should just draw fish." [...] However, the idea of drawing fish seemed boring to him and he was more riveted by [...] "making weird, little paintings". During a few summers after finishing high school, he worked as a fry cook and lobster boiler at a fast-food seafood restaurant in Maine. (This later inspired SpongeBob SquarePants' occupation in the television series, which he would begin developing in 1994.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Rev. Moon has a {{very good}} sense of humor. It's hard for me to think of a person as being mean or {{brainwashing}} people with the sense of humor he has. He truly loves people. I mean, he <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> with them. He <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> kidded-he <b>likes</b> <b>being</b> teased. I never saw a mean act on his part. He never asked for special treatment. He mopped floors and cleaned tables, and he helped other people when he was finished with his job.https://web.archive.org/web/20021128070101/http://www.tparents.org/Moon-Talks/sunmyungmoon84/OneOfUs.htm ...|$|R

2500|$|Although Hedrick once {{confided to}} Garcia that [...] "he {{and his friends}} were the real Beat Generation", the seminal visual artists in the 1950s in San Francisco, {{including}} Hedrick, shunned the ‘beatnik’ label. None of them <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> called “Beats” and they especially abhorred the label “Beatniks”, a sobriquet of disparagement coined by San Francisco’s famed columnist Herb Caen. As Bruce Conner stated: “I don’t know any artist that would call himself a beat artist…If somebody did, you’d consider him a fake, a fraud running a scam.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the art of}} {{building}} a bike, Larry preferred old school methods and didn't use CNC machines. He favored Paughco rigid frames and panhead motors. [...] Larry <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> able {{to see all of}} the nuts and bolts and mechanics of a bike, rather than concealing those elements in a bike's construction. The way that Larry approached building a bike was evident early on. The man who taught Larry the craft of using a welding torch said that he remembered Larry not wanting to grind down welds if they were good because Larry [...] "felt it showed your craftmanship." ...|$|E

His brother Mahmoud, even though opposed to this union, helped him by inviting his family live {{with him in his}} house in Le Kram. Bourguiba settled with his wife and son into his brother's home while this one abandoned his wedding plans. That very year, their sister Nejia Bouzgarou lost her husband who died and joined her brothers temporarily with her four children. Even though he <b>liked</b> <b>being</b> surrounded by his family, Mathilde was not pleased with their situation and urged her husband to move out. So they did, settling in Tunis downtown once again, where they lived till 1933. For that moment, Bourguiba was not interested in politics but rather work, lodging and family. One of his closest friends stated that his main ambition at the time was to [...] "settle down" [...] and that he acquired a certain maturity and autonomy since he was no more dependent on his brothers.|$|E
