He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

Upon completion of the closing arguments, Gillen asked Jones, [...] "By my reckoning, this is the 40th day since the trial began and tonight will be the 40th night, and I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> you did that on purpose." [...] (40 days and nights was {{the length of the}} Biblical Great Flood.) Jones responded, [...] "Mr. Gillen, that is an interesting coincidence, but it was not by design." [...] This humorous exchange provided the title for Matthew Chapman's book about the trial, 40 Days and 40 Nights.|$|E
2500|$|Because of Chamberlain's anti-Catholicism, Catholic {{newspapers}} all published very hostile {{reviews of}} The Foundations, though Catholic reviewers rarely faulted Die Grundlagen [...] for its anti-Semitism. Protestant völkisch newspapers [...] gave The Foundations very good reviews while more orthodox Protestant newspapers were disturbed by Chamberlain's {{call for a}} racialized Christianity. One Protestant reviewer, Professor Baentsch of Jena wrote that Chamberlain had systematically distorted the Book of Job, the Psalms, the Prophets, and other books of the Old Testament, leading him to conclude {{that it was no}} surprise that Chamberlain found so little common ground between Christianity and Judaism given the way he had misrepresented the entire Old Testament. One German Jewish reviewer, the Berlin banker Heinrich Meyer-Cohn wrote that The Foundations was [...] "bad, unclear, and illogical in its train of thought and unpleasing in style, full of false modesty and genuine superciliousness, full of real ignorance and false affectation of learning." [...] German Jewish groups like the Centralverein deutscher Staatsburge jüdischen Glaubens and the Verein zur Abwehr Antisemitismus repeatedly issued statements in the early 20th century that the popularity of The Foundations was a major source of concern for them, noting that Die Grundlagen [...] had caused a major increase in anti-Semitism with many German Jews now finding themselves the objects of harassment and sometimes violence. The German Jewish journalist Moritz Goldstein wrote in 1912 that he had become a Zionist because he believed there was no future for Jews in Germany, {{and one of the reasons}} for that belief was: [...] "Chamberlain believes what he says and for that very reason his distortions shock me. And thousands more believe as he does for the book goes one edition after another and I would still <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> many Germanic types, whose self-image is pleasantly indulged by this theory, are able to remain critical enough to question its countless injustices and errors?". Goldstein added that the case of Chamberlain showed his views as typical of those of [...] "the best spirits, clever, truth-loving men who, however, as soon they speak of Jews, fall into a blind, almost rabid hatred".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Spatial {{statistics}} {{is concerned}} with statistical methods that explicitly analyses spatial arrangement of the data. When analyzing these kinds of data, we might be interested investigating the temporal data process that generated the data. Typically spatial point patterns are data that {{made up of the}} location of point events. We are interested in whether or not their relative locations represent a significant pattern. For example, seismologists have been showing the distribution of earthquakes in a region. They would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>known</b> <b>if</b> there is any pattern that might help them make predictions about future earthquakes. In this work, an investigation of earthquakes spatial data is analyzed, using specific statistical modeling techniques...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{some interesting}} effects observed during {{the evolution of}} nonequilibrium systems, using domain growth and glassy systems as examples. We breafly discuss the analytical tools that have been recently used to study the dynamics of these systems. We mainly concentrate {{on one of the}} results obtained from this study, the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and we discuss, in particular, its relation to the definition and measurement of effective temperatures out of equilibrium. One of the major challenges in physics is to understand the behaviour of systems that are far from equilibrium. These systems are ubiquitous in nature. Some examples are phase separation, systems undergoing domain growth, all types of glasses, turbulent flows, systems driven by non-potential forces, etc. All these systems are “large ” {{in the sense that they}} are composed of many, N → ∞, dynamic degrees of freedom. Apart from succeeding in predicting the time evolution of their macroscopic properties, one would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> which, <b>if</b> any, of the thermodynamic notions apply to these nonequilibrium cases...|$|R
