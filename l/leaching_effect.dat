50|$|An American Dietetic Association {{study found}} that {{cast-iron}} cookware can leach significant amounts of dietary iron into food. The amounts of iron absorbed varied greatly depending on the food, its acidity, its water content, how long it was cooked, and how old the cookware is. The iron in spaghetti sauce increased 2,109 percent (from 0.35 mg/100g to 7.38 mg/100g), while other foods increased less dramatically; for example, the iron in cornbread increased 28 percent, from 0.67 to 0.86 mg/100g. Anemics, and those with iron deficiencies, may benefit from this effect, which {{was the basis for}} the development of the lucky iron fish, an iron ingot used during cooking to provide dietary iron to those with iron deficiency. People with hemochromatosis (iron overload, bronze disease) should avoid using cast-iron cookware because of the iron <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> into the food.|$|E
40|$|Copper {{toxicity}} in 17 Chinese soils was screened using a substrate-induced nitrification assay {{to generate}} {{information for the}} development of a terrestrial biotic ligand model (tBLM). The <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> on the Cu toxicity thresholds was investigated. Both the total Cu-based median effective concentration (EC 50) values (46. 9 - 2726 mg/kg) and the solution Cu-based EC 50 values (0. 04 - 2. 91 mg/L) in unleached soils varied substantially among the soils in the present study. For unleached soils, linear stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that total Ca and soil pH were the best predictors for total Cu-based EC 50, while electrical conductivity (EC) and soil pH were the best predictors for solution Cu-based EC 50. The variation in solution Cu-based EC 50 was largely (R(2) = 0. 75) explained by Mg but not Ca and H(+) concentration in soil solution at EC 50, suggesting a protective effect of Mg(2 +) against Cu toxicity in the test soils. Leaching impacted Cu toxicity differently among the soils and apparently reduced the variations of both the total Cu-based and the solution Cu-based EC 50. The predictability of the Cu EC 50 by empirical models was decreased after leaching. The <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> on Cu toxicity, indicated by a leaching factor, was not predicted by any soil properties.

30|$|Similarly, {{the trace}} {{elements}} are also responsible {{for the formation of}} ash in the coal. The trace elements are in the coal ash formed due to its natural formation process of the parent coal. Most of {{the trace elements}} in the parent coal are retained in the residual coal ash after combustion and are concentrated in a small volume of the ash compared to raw coal. Therefore, the trace elements in the coal ash are higher compared to the parent coal (Carlson and Adriano 1993; Jankowski et al. 2006; Miej 1994). Major mineral constituents of coal ash typically consist of silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe), with lesser amounts of oxides of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sulfur (S), and phosphorus (P) whose proportions changes with the <b>leaching</b> <b>effect.</b> Coal ash also contains minor amounts of trace elements, including titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), vanadium (V), copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn), Cobalt (Co), Yttrium (Y), Zirconium (Zr) etc. The degree of ash content depends on the concentration of trace elements as well as major mineral constituents in the coal. The leaching studies indicated trace elements were removed by the influence of <b>leaching</b> <b>effect.</b> It has been observed from Table  5, the trace elements titanium (Ti) was increased by the <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> as compared to the raw coal while most of the trace elements were removed by the chemical treatment.

30|$|The current {{research}} was investigated {{the mechanism of}} coal demineralization {{and the effect of}} leaching parameters on high ash coal and study the characterization of pre and post-treated coal. The two high ash Indian coal selected from Mahanadi Coalfield Limited, Odisha, pulverized to 375, 230 and 180  µm particle size were undergone simultaneous acid and alkali treatment at a different concentration, temperature and time. The percent demineralization was increased with decrease the size of the particle and rises with leaching parameters. The investigation suggested 180  µm particle size offers efficient demineralization for both coals at 30 % NaOH and 30 % H 2 SO 4 concentration. The alkali leaching leads to obtaining the demineralization 46 % and 42 % whereas acid treatment resulted in 34 % and 32 % of the original coal samples. The extent of demineralization was improved the calorific value of coal. Besides, the degree of demineralization was proved from the FTIR, XRF and FESEM–EDX analysis results. FTIR analysis result showed that the peak intensity of mineral band decreased by the <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> and the degree of demineralization was significantly obtained to large extent by the X-ray Fluorescence spectrometer; which elucidates major minerals removed from coal by the <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> of acid and alkali solution.|$|E

Discharge-weighted nutrient concentrations were increased only for OP, K and Ca. The treatment effect was brief, lasting only one year. The first harvest of a selection system regime had no measurable effect on gross losses or concentrations of nutrients. Precipitation chemistry measurements from the region indicated that annual imports of all nutrients considered in this study generally exceed the gross losses measured.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} nature of permeation properties and pore structure of concrete surface layers containing fly ash. Concretes containing different dosages of fly ash as a replacement for cement (15 % and 30 % by weight of total cement materials, respectively) were investigated. Concrete without any fly ash added was also employed as the reference specimen. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the surface layer properties of concrete including chloride transport, apparent water permeability and pore structure. The results demonstrate that incorporation of fly ash, for the early test period, promotes the chloride ingress at the surface layer of concrete but substituting proportions of fly ash may have little impact on it. With the process of chloride immersion, the chloride concentration at the surface layer of concrete with or without fly ash was found to be nearly the same. In addition, it is suggested that the water permeability at the concrete surface area is closely related to the fly ash contents as well as the chloride exposure time. Pore structure was characterized by means of mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) test and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The modification of pore structure of concrete submersed in distilled water is determined by the pozzolanic reaction of fly ash and the calcium <b>leaching</b> <b>effect.</b> The pozzolanic reaction was more dominant at the immersion time of 180 days while the calcium <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> became more evident after 270 days...|$|E

One of the most referred and used nano-materials is amorphous silica with particles size in the nano-range, even though its application and effect in concrete has not been fully understood yet. It {{has been reported that}} nano-silica (nS) addition increases the compressive strength and reduces the overall permeability of hardened concrete due to the pozzolanic properties which are resulting in finer hydrated phases (C-S-H gel) and densified microstructure (nano-filler and anti <b>leaching</b> <b>effects).</b> These effects enhance the durability of concrete structures such as bridges, quays or off-shore oil facilities in marine environments. In this study two different types of nano-silica were applied in self-compacting concrete (SCC), both having similar particle size distributions (PSD) but produced in two different processes (filmed powder silica and precipitated silica in colloidal suspension). The influence of nanosilica on SCC was investigated with respect to the properties of concrete in the fresh state (workability) and hardened state (mechanical properties and durability). Additionally, the densification of microstructure of the hardened concrete was verified by SEM and EDS analyses. The obtained results demonstrate that an efficient use of nano-silica in SCC can improve its mechanical propelties and durability.

Very low and widely polydisperse diffusion coefficients were observed for this system. The molecular weights of the leached lignins were found to increase with wash time. A comparison of the molecular dimensions with pore size indicated that a flat disk-like conformation, rather than a spherical conformation was appropriate for the lignin macromolecule.

40|$|Field outcrop observation, {{drilling}} core description, thin-section analysis, SEM analysis, and geochemistry, indicate that Dixi area of Carboniferous volcanic rock gas reservoir {{belongs to the}} volcanic rock oil reservoir of the authigenic gas reservoir. The source rocks make contact with volcanic rock reservoir directly or by fault, and having the characteristics of near source accumulation. The volcanic rock reservoir rocks mainly consist of acidic rhyolite and dacite, intermediate andesite, basic basalt and volcanic breccia: (1) Acidic rhyolite and dacite reservoirs are developed in the middle-lower part of the structure, have suffered strong denudation effect, and the secondary pores have formed in the weathering and tectonic burial stages, but primary pores are not developed within the early diagenesis stage. Average porosity is only at 8 %, and the maximum porosity is at 13. 5 %, with oil and gas accumulation showing poor performance. (2) Intermediate andesite and basic basalt reservoirs are mainly distributed near the crater, which resembles the size of and suggests a volcanic eruption. Primary pores are formed in the early diagenetic stage, secondary pores developed in weathering and erosion transformation stage, and secondary fractures formed in the tectonic burial stage. The average porosity is at 9. 2 %, and the maximum porosity is at 21. 9 %: it is of the high-quality reservoir types in Dixi area. (3) The volcanic breccia reservoir has the same diagenetic features with sedimentary rocks, but also has the same mineral composition with volcanic rock; rigid components can keep the primary porosity without being affected by compaction during the burial process. At the same time, the brittleness of volcanic breccia reservoir makes it easily fracture under the stress; internal fracture was developmental. Volcanic breccia developed in the structural high part and suffered a long-term <b>leaching</b> <b>effect.</b> The original pore-fracture combination also made volcanic breccia reservoir more easily leached by fresh water or groundwater, leading to secondary erosion pores. Volcanic rock weathering obviously has control on reservoir properties, and while {{the thickness of the}} weathering crust is 200 – 300  m, the properties of volcanic rock reservoir are the best. This is attributed mainly to the period during and after the volcano eruption, in which tectonism made the brittle volcanic rock develop a large number of fractures and micro cracks. This has led to the increased permeability of volcanic rock reservoir, the weathering and <b>leaching</b> <b>effect</b> of volcanic rock diagenetic late phase (which also formed lots of secondary pores), and greatly improved reservoir conditions. The overlying Permian Wutonggou formation mudstone provided high-quality cap rock for oil and gas accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} process typically produces {{two types of}} outputs which are economic desirable as well as environmentally undesirable outputs (such as greenhouse gas emission, nitrate <b>leaching,</b> <b>effects</b> to human and organisms and water pollution). In efficiency analysis, this undesirable outputs cannot be ignored {{and need to be}} included in order to obtain the actual estimation of firms efficiency. Additionally, climatic factors as well as data uncertainty can significantly affect the efficiency analysis. There are a number of approaches that has been proposed in DEA literature to account for undesirable outputs. Many researchers has pointed that directional distance function (DDF) approach is the best as it allows for simultaneous increase in desirable outputs and reduction of undesirable outputs. Additionally, it has been found that interval data approach is the most suitable to account for data uncertainty as it is much simpler to model and need less information regarding its distribution and membership function. In this paper, an enhanced DEA model based on DDF approach that considers undesirable outputs as well as climatic factors and interval data is proposed. This model will be used to determine the efficiency of rice farmers who produces undesirable outputs and operates under uncertainty. It is hoped that the proposed model will provide a better estimate of rice farmers’ efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Submerged Gravel Wetlands (SGWs) are subsurface-flow wetlands, and are {{effective}} stormwater control measures (SCM). Compost addition has many properties beneficial to SGWs {{but may also}} lead to leaching of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). To investigate nutrient <b>leaching</b> <b>effects</b> of leaf-and-grass compost addition in SGWs, mesocosm studies were conducted using bioretention soil media (BSM) mixed with 30 % and 15 % compost, by volume. Synthetic stormwater was applied to mesocosms and effluent analyzed for N and P. Compost-added mesocosms were found to leach N and P. Maximum N concentrations of 16 and 6. 4 mg-N/L were reached after 1. 7 and 3. 0 cm of rainfall for 15 % and 30 %, respectively. Maximum P concentrations of 2. 9 and 0. 52 mg-P/L were both reached after 2. 5 cm for 30 % and 15 %, respectively. Particulate P was the dominant P species found in effluent samples, while N species were mixed. Although compost addition led to leaching of N and P, treatment of both nutrients was achieved, with the 15 %, reaching a net-zero export of P after the equivalent of 20 cm of rainfall. Nitrogen treatment was attributed to denitrification and plant and microbial uptake. Phosphorus treatment was attributed primarily to adsorption...|$|R

Balsa blocks (24 xl 8 x 12 mm) were exposed to two brown-rot fungi and one white-rot fungus in ASTM soil block tests for 10 weeks. CCA (6. 4 km/m) was compared with the calcium binding agent N,N-napthaloylhydroxylamine (NHA; 1. 6, 3. 2 & 6. 4 km/m 3) in leached and unleached blocks.
