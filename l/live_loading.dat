Unlike a bridge's near-constant dead load, its live load can be highly variable both in time and position, resulting in fluctuations in the stress level experienced by the bridge's structural elements as the <b>live</b> <b>loading</b> varies. The lower proportion of live load carried by the extradosed cables results in a reduced magnitude of stress fluctuations within the cables, down from typically [...] or above for cable-stay bridges to around [...] for extradosed designs. This has a direct benefit in reducing the detrimental effects of fatigue experienced by the stay cables and their end anchorages, and bridge design codes allow extradosed stay cables to operate at a significantly higher design stress level and therefore material efficiency level as a result.|$|E

It has been highly recommended by some, and claimed to have no value by others. The truth is both statements can be correct. It all depends on the individual application. The problem is determining if a valve is a candidate for "Live Loading". In most cases this can be decided by answering a few questions! Is it a packed valve?! Does the valve cycle frequently?! Is it motor operated?! Is the valve difficult to get at?! Is the valve subject to high temperatures & pressures?! Is the valve in a critical application?!

The usual practice of assuming the system to be non-composite during construction requires substantial top flange bracing to form a quasi-closed box section.

Formwork failure is among the major causes {{of concrete}} construction failures. One of the causes of slab formwork failures is overloading. The major slab formwork <b>loads</b> include dead, <b>live,</b> equipment impact and wind loads. In this study slab formwork <b>live</b> <b>loads</b> are investigated. In recent years, a trend has been developing toward placing design codes on a probabilistic bases. Developing probability-based design criteria for construction requires an extensive data bank of actual construction loads. In this study to collect sufficient data for developing probability-based <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models for multistory concrete building construction, thirty-two concrete building projects in twelve cities were visited and surveyed. In this survey, weight of objects considered as <b>live</b> <b>loads</b> were determined by the inventory method or direct weighing. In order to build a representative construction <b>live</b> <b>load</b> data-base, the survey included buildings {{with a wide range of}} characteristics. These characteristics included size, construction cycle time, number of floors, availability of storage space around the construction site, formwork system used, future intended use and slab design.

Load rating made in these traditional methods does {{not correspond to}} any standard and quantifiable measure of safety and the resulting ratings are often quite conservative.

The <b>live</b> <b>load</b> models available were developed for short and medium span bridges. Those models were not appropriate for long span bridges due to different types of structure and critical traffic patterns. <b>Live</b> <b>load</b> on long spans depends on traffic mix. One heavily overloaded truck does not have significant influence. Moreover, the continuous {{increase in the number of}} the trucks, their weights, and high percentage of overweight trucks led to a search for the newest traffic data. The database includes variety of sites within many different states. A numerical procedure was developed to process the database and simulate traffic jam situations. From the simulation the values of uniformly distributed load were derived. Trucks were kept in actual order, as recorded in the WIM surveys. Results of the simulations were plotted as a cumulative distribution function of uniformly distributed load for considered span lengths. For longer spans, uniformly distributed load decreases and is closer to the mean value. The bias factors were calculated for the heaviest 75 -year combination of vehicles. The 75 -year uniformly distributed loads were derived from extrapolated distributions. It was stated that for most of the bridges current <b>live</b> <b>load</b> HL- 93 is appropriate.

The formulation considers a split of the in-plane and out-of-plane membrane contributions, which allows the construction of a stable formulation for liquid membranes with constant surface tension. The proposed membrane formulation is general, and accounts for dead and <b>live</b> <b>loading,</b> as well as enclosed volume, area, and contact constraints.
