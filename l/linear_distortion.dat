[...] Corman decided to film the flashbacks in monochrome, since he had read that some psychiatrists believe most people dream in [...] "black-and white" [...] imagery.

Distortions of affine mappings between planes are discussed in this paper using the methodology taken from the theory of map projections. Formulae for the linear scale are derived, and it is shown that distances are generally not preserved. The length distortion depends on the direction. The distribution of the <b>linear</b> <b>distortions</b> around a point can be visualized by using the curve of local <b>linear</b> <b>distortions</b> or the distortion ellipse.

50|$|The {{transfer}} function {{of an ideal}} amplifier, with perfect gain and delay, is only an approximation. The true behavior {{of the system is}} usually different. Nonlinearities in the {{transfer function}} of an active device (such as vacuum tubes, transistors, and operational amplifiers) are a common source of non-linear distortion; in passive components (such as a coaxial cable or optical fiber), <b>linear</b> <b>distortion</b> can be caused by inhomogeneities, reflections, and so on in the propagation path.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} of a digital room correction system begins with measuring the impulse {{response of the}} room at the listening location for each of the loudspeakers. Then, computer software is used to compute a FIR filter, which reverses the effects of the room and <b>linear</b> <b>distortion</b> in the loudspeakers. Finally, the calculated filter is loaded into a computer or other room correction device which applies the filter in real time. Because most room correction filters are acausal, there is some delay. Most DRC systems allow the operator to control the added delay through configurable parameters.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{distortion}} {{refers to}} any modification of wave {{form of a}} signal, but in music {{it is used to}} refer to nonlinear distortion (excluding filters) and particularly to the introduction of new frequencies by memoryless nonlinearities. In music the different forms of <b>linear</b> <b>distortion</b> have specific names describing them. The simplest of these is a distortion process known as [...] "volume adjustment", which involves distorting the amplitude of a sound wave in a proportional (or ‘linear’) way in order to increase or decrease the volume of the sound without affecting the tone quality. In the context of music, the most common source of (nonlinear) distortion is clipping in amplifier circuits and is most commonly known as overdrive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a new {{goodness}} measure for behavioral complex envelope power amplifier models {{is defined in}} the frequency domain. The measure can be calculated for any input signal using the same formulas, which makes it general and easy to use. The results will however be dependent on the input signal. The total model error, or normalized mean-square error, for power amplifier models are normally dominated by the in-band error, often mainly caused by the <b>linear</b> <b>distortion.</b> The new measure is aimed at capturing the nonlinear modeling performance of the amplifier model. This is of interest since it is most often the nonlinear, rather than the <b>linear,</b> <b>distortion</b> that causes most harm in real-life power amplifier applications...|$|E

We investigate a technique of global affine transformation (GAT) correlation to absorb <b>linear</b> <b>distortion</b> between gray-scale images.

Experiments using the handwritten numeral database IPTP CDROM 1 B show that the entropy of GAT-superimposed images decreases by around 15 %. Furthermore, gray-level-based GAT correlation improves the recognition rate from 85. 78 % to 91. 01 %, while gradient-based GAT correlation improves the recognition rate from 91. 80 % to 94. 02 %. These results show that GAT correlation has a marked effect of improving both shape matching and discrimination abilities by extracting <b>linear</b> <b>distortion</b> from nonlinear one. 1...|$|E

5000|$|An optical {{communication}} system transmitter {{consists of a}} digital-to-analog converter (DAC), a driver amplifier and a Mach-Zehnder-Modulator.

These effects can be categorised in <b>linear</b> <b>distortions</b> due to DAC bandwidth limitation and transmitter I/Q skew as well as non-linear effects caused by gain saturation in the driver amplifier and the Mach-Zehnder modulator.
