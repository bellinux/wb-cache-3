40|$|High-performance rocket engines, {{that are}} being {{developed}} {{for the next generation}} reusable launch vehicles, require active cooling of the thrust surfaces. An effective and rapid method is needed to inspect the critical bond between the <b>liner</b> <b>assembly</b> and the jacket of the thrust cell chamber, to determine its integrity prior to the expense of hot fire testing. Currently, a series of conventional ultrasonic techniques are used to inspect the thrust cell chamber. However, the complexly contoured surfaces prevent 100 % inspection. The use of laser-based ultrasound (LBU) techniques have previously been shown to be an effective method for rapid inspection of contoured polymer-matrix composite structures[l– 3]. The transition to inspection of metallic components requires increased spatial resolution to resolve defects of ∼ 1. 2 mm diameter, in addition to modification for limited access inspection from inside the thrust cell. This paper reports progress on inspection of a heat exchanger NDE standard which demonstrates the resolution capability of the LBU system.

40|$|The {{anti-wear}} and anti-seizure {{performance and}} action mechanisms of zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP) {{have been investigated}} under reciprocating pure sliding conditions to simulate piston ring and cylinder <b>liner</b> <b>assembly,</b> using new techniques. The Mini Traction Machine???Space Layer Imaging is a useful method for monitoring tribofilm formation by ZDDPs. However, tests are generally carried out in mixed sliding???rolling conditions and ZDDP film formation in reciprocating pure sliding conditions is rarely investigated. In this paper, the authors describe an investigation of ZDDP film formation in stationary ball on reciprocating disc pure sliding conditions and compare the results to those obtained in unidirectional pure sliding conditions. In unidirectional pure sliding conditions, the worn area on the ball expands with test time. By contrast, in reciprocating pure sliding conditions, tribofilm forms on the stationary ball and no significant damage occurs. In the initial tribofilm formation under reciprocating pure sliding conditions, solid particulate tribofilm with {{a high concentration of}} S forms initially in the contact area and subsequently breaks up. During further rubbing, a Zn- and P-rich tribofilm forms on the comminuted sulphur-rich tribofilm and also the area where the initial tribofilm was removed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{friction}} at {{the piston}} ring cylinder <b>liner</b> <b>assembly</b> (PRLA) {{is a major}} contributor in the total friction losses in the I. C. engine. New materials, coatings and high-tech machining processes that previously {{were considered to be}} too expensive and therefore only used in complex applications are today becoming more affordable. A significant amount of the total power loss in a modern automotive engine is due to the Friction interaction between the top compression ring and the cylinder liner, especially at the TDC and BDC where boundary lubrication exists. The change in piston speed is accompanied with change the lubrication regime in the cylinder, which results change in friction between the ring and the liner during the entire stroke of the piston. Theoretical modelling of friction force from the various sources of friction will be compared to experimental results for analysing the tribological characteristics. The appropriate sample of piston ring and cylinder liner pair is developed for studying the different tribological parameters on Reciprocating Tribometer. The variable parameters are engine speed, oil viscosity, and load. The experimental results and observations are studied under different operating conditions in speed ranges from 300 rpm to 1500 rpm with constant load of 60 N. It can be seen that as speed increases, the friction force and friction coefficient also decreases...|$|E
40|$|During the {{so-called}} “Miljonprogrammet”, {{over a million}} homes were built in Stockholm. As the buildings mature, parts of the buildings reach their technical life times {{and it is time}} to renovate them. At a time when the environmental impact of humans is a hot topic, it is appropriate to take the environment into account when deciding upon which restoration method to use. The sewage pipes are one of the important building parts in need of repair. This can be achieved by for example traditional pipe replacement or Cure-In-Place-Pipes (CIPP-lining). The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate and compare the environmental impact of traditional pipe replacement versus the use of the relining method CIPP lining by conducting a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA). The methods differ in the way that traditional pipe replacement demolishes the outer layers of the bathrooms and remove the old pipes to replace with new and restore the surface layers while CIPP-lining renovates the pipes from the inside with the use of a flexible liner. The purpose of the study has been to clarify the differences in environmental impacts of the different methods in a clear and easily understood way and thereby also simplify the decision-making process of property owners in need of renovation. With aid of the guidelines in ISO standards 14040 and 14044 a correct methodology has been used to ensure that the level of this work will be as high as possible. In combination with the software SimaPro specifically developed to handle the creation of various forms of life cycle assessments and the ISO standards a complex system been analyzed in detail. The results of the study show that CIPP-lining generally cause less environmental impacts than the traditional pipe replacement method. The analysis of 14 selected impact categories show that CIPP lining is preferable in 13 categories and that the traditional pipe replacement is preferable in 1 category. The sensitivity analysis show that the results change drastically depending on how much of the materials and energy used to demolish and reconstruct the outer layers of the bathroom one chooses to allocate to the new sewer pipes. The results show that the CIPP-lining results are dependent on the consumables and the <b>liner</b> <b>assembly</b> processes while the energy usage of the production process does not have a large impact on the results. For the traditional pipe replacement the results show that the consumable process is clearly the biggest impact while the piping production inflicts the least impact on the result...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The paper proposes {{introducing}} a new operation to reduce rejections in a recognised automotive industry. This industry manufactures cylinder liners {{by using the}} updated technologies & principles in the market. The problem lies in the operation process i. e., when machining due to compressive and shear forces by the tool on the liner, residual stresses are developed in the beneath the collar of the liner. The liners are passing the quality inspection but when the <b>liner</b> goes to <b>assembly</b> section at the customer end it fails by developing a crack beneath the collar. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to reduce the rejections for that particular reason in the cylinder liner manufacturing industry. This can be done by application of {{introducing a}} new operation in the process named deep rolling. By performing this operation the inner grains of the liner at that particular area will be aligned by the concept of cold strengthening & burnishing.

40|$|Steel liner plates, {{which are}} bolted {{together}} to form a shell, are commonly used to provide temporary protective linings in the tunneling industry to ensure the stability of the tunnel and safety of the workers until more permanent ground reinforcement can be installed. As the ground deforms to try and close the opening, the liner plate is radially stressed, and by deforming redistributes these loads back to the surrounding insitu earth. Grouting behind the plates is done to fill any voids and ensure uniform contact to the strata {{around the back of the}} plates. Another function of the liner plate in some applications is to act as a platform or structure for the mining machine to react against in order to develop the necessary forward thrust to be able to excavate the face. In this case, the liner plates are loaded axially as a horizontal column of bolted liner plate rings, creating a jacking force against the <b>liner</b> plate <b>assembly.</b> In general, the buckling strength of the plate sections determines the jacking force capacity. Historically, the jacking force capacity of tunnel liner plates has been theoretically determined by some simplistic equations developed from tests of single liner plates. Recently, full-scale tests on a complete circular section of bolted liner plate ring segments have been conducted in the NIOSH Safety Structures Testing Laboratory using the unique Mine Roof Simulator to apply controlled loading in a manner that simulates the real world environment. Due to the unique size and capacity of the Mine Roof Simulator, these are believed to be the first full-scale tests conducted on the jacking force capability of tunnel liner plate rings. These tests indicate that the previously used theoretical equations tend to over predict the jacking force capacity of these tunnel liner plates. Unanticipated deformations in the field have been observed at loads below these theoretical design loads, therefore, a more accurate determination of the jacking force capability was needed. This report summarizes the full-scale test results, examines design parameters that impact the jacking force capability, and develops new mathematical models to improve the prediction of design loads...|$|R
