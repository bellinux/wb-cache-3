Scully defends Skinner to the Office of Professional Responsibility, but it does no good and he is fired. Mulder {{believes}} this was done to weaken the X-Files. Mulder, {{with the help of}} Agent Pendrell finds a face imprint in the airbag which is not Skinner's. He goes to see the prostitute's boss again but discovers that she has been murdered. The agents hope to use Judy, an employee who saw the man who actually hired the prostitute and use her to set up another meeting with him. They agree to meet at the Ambassador Hotel in an hour. Skinner goes to see his wife, telling her why he could not sign the divorce papers. An alarm on Sharon's vital sign monitor starts sounding, but as Skinner is about to run for help, the old woman once again takes the place of Sharon, beckoning him to come closer. As Skinner <b>leans</b> <b>in,</b> he sees his wife again, now awakened from the coma; she says something inaudible to him.|$|E

40|$|After the {{economic}} {{reforms of the}} 1980 s and 1990 s, Chinese women have dealt with new forms of gender-based restrictions in their career advancements. <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN,</b> a community inspired by Sheryl Sandberg’s book «Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead» published in 2013, offers professional development, support and assistance to help women deal with these challenges. It has been claimed that the American- inspired women’s groups has brought {{a new kind of}} feminism to the country. However, there has not been conducted any research to prove this statement. In this thesis, I have looked at Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups in comparison with both Sandberg’s <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> concept and feminist theory. Based on participant observations and interviews conducted with <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> participants, core members and guest speakers from September 2015 to January 2016, I found that Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups have made some changes to their work away from the original <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> concept in order to adapt to national conditions. Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups’ perspectives on feminism were different from the original <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> concept based on Sheryl Sandberg’s book, but had similarities with the American <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> organisation’s views. With {{a review of the literature}} on feminism in China, I discovered that the American <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> organisation’s concept is corresponding with the governmental organisation All-China Women’s Federation discourse on women’s development. The <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> activities also resemble women’s group meetings which occurred in the early years of the reform era. <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> in China cooperates with All- China Women’s Federation, who could decide to prohibit <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> in China if they step out of their discourse. I argue that this puts Chinese <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> groups in a dependent relation to the All-China Women’s Federation. This research shows how a certain group of people working on women’s issues in China define feminism. It is important to understand the organisations working on women’s issues in order to learn more about the Chinese feminist situation. Studying <b>LEAN</b> <b>IN</b> as an important part of a potential Chinese feminist movement could give an indicator to where the movement is heading...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} lean from nine {{wholesale}} cuts {{in relation to}} the total <b>lean</b> weight <b>in</b> carcass side were evaluated with three allometric equations for 18 Najdi male camels slaughtered at 8, 16 and 26 months of age. The allometric growth coefficients indicated that as camels grew, weights of lean from brisket and flank cuts increased relatively more rapidly than the total <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> carcass side (β > 1. 1) and that weights of lean from wholesale shoulder and rump cuts increased relatively less rapidly (β > 0. 9) than the total lean weight from carcass side. The growth coefficients for the <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> the thoracic limb and pelvic limb showed a dorsoventral rise in the growth impetus, with coefficients for the thoracic limb correspondingly higher than those of pelvic limb. The growth coefficients for the lean from shoulder, rib, flank and leg cuts increased (P< 0. 01) with increased weight of total <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> carcass side, whereas it decreased with increased total <b>lean</b> weight <b>in</b> carcass side for the <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> neck, brisket, plate, loin and rump cuts. At constant weight of total <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> carcass side, older camels had larger coefficients for <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> neck, brisket, rump, flank and leg cuts, but had smaller coefficients for <b>lean</b> <b>in</b> shoulder, rib, plate and loin cuts...|$|R

Tosh and Jack rush to the couple's room, where Jack identifies Brenda as an alien and calls her an [...] "ugly bitch". After Brenda protests her innocence and Rhys punches Jack, Gwen states that Rhys' mother is not the shapeshifter as Brenda wears a distinctive perfume. Torchwood reach the garden to find the Nostrovite, in Brenda's image, with Mary. The alien holds Mary hostage, demanding that Gwen give her her child. Gwen walks towards them and as the Nostrovite releases Mary, Gwen reveals a hidden gun in her wedding bouquet and fires at the creature. Owen suggests using a piece of alien equipment called the singularity scalpel to destroy the alien fetus. He sends Gwen {{to her room and}} teaches Rhys how to use the scalpel; Owen cannot use it himself due to injuries sustained in his undead state. Gwen is approached by Jack and reveals to him that she would have married Rhys a long time ago if she had not met him. She <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> as he appears to be ready to kiss her but he reveals himself to be the Nostrovite. Owen enters, shooting the creature whilst Gwen exits with Rhys.

60|$|But {{there is}} none so peculiar, none that bears more {{the image of the}} heavenly, than the beauty of Christian old age. It is like the loveliness of those calm autumn days, when the heats of summer are past, when the harvest is {{gathered}} into the garner, and the sun shines over the placid fields and fading woods, which stand waiting for their last change. It is a beauty more strictly moral, more belonging to the soul, than that of any other period of life. Poetic fiction always paints the old man as a Christian; nor is there any period where the virtues of Christianity seem to find a more harmonious development. The aged man, who has outlived the hurry of passion--who has withstood the urgency of temptation--who has concentrated the religious impulses of youth into habits of obedience and love--who, having served his generation by the will of God, now <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> helplessness on Him whom once he served, is, perhaps, one of the most faultless representations of the beauty of holiness that this world affords.|$|E

Cicely, an orphan niece who lived with the old ladies, was to have the care of Rosy; and a summer in the quiet country town would do her good, while change of scene would console her for this first separation from her mother. How she fared remains to be seen; and we need only add that the child had been well trained, made the companion of a sweet and tender woman, and was very anxious to please the parents whom she passionately loved, by keeping the promises she had made them, and being [...] "as brave as Papa, as patient and kind as dear Mamma." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then we stick him on {{the film}} on {{a corner of the}} room, leaning up against the {{cardboard}} clock and looking at the children. This attitude in the movies always indicates a secondary character of no importance. His business {{is to look at the}} others and to indicate forgetfulness of self, incompetence, unimportance, vacuity, simplicity. Note how this differs from the attitudes of important characters. If a movie character--one of importance--is plotting or scheming, he seats himself at a little round table, drums on it with his fingers, and half closes one eye. If he is being talked to, or having a letter or document or telegram read to him, he stands [...] "facing full" [...] and working his features up and down to indicate emotion sweeping over them. If he is being [...] "exposed" [...] (which is done by pointing fingers at him), he hunches up like a snake in an angle of the room with both eyes half shut and his mouth set as if he had just eaten a lemon. But if he has none of these things to express and is only in the scene as a background for the others, then he goes over and <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> an easy attitude against the tall cardboard clock.|$|E
6000|$|Pacing the {{sidewalk}} in front of this grog-shop of Parker's (or sometimes, on cold and rainy days, taking his station inside), there is generally to be observed an elderly ragamuffin, in a dingy and battered hat, an old surtout, and a more than shabby general aspect; a thin face and red nose, a patch over one eye, and the other half drowned in moisture. He <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> a slightly stooping posture on a stick, forlorn and silent, addressing nobody, but fixing his one moist eye on you with a certain intentness. he is a man who has been in decent circumstances at some former period of his life, but, falling into decay (perhaps by dint of too frequent visits at Parker's bar), he now haunts about the place, as a ghost haunts the spot where he was murdered, [...] "to collect his rents," [...] as Parker says,--that is, to catch an occasional ninepence from some charitable acquaintances, or a glass of liquor at the bar. The word [...] "ragamuffin," [...] which I have used above, does not accurately express the man, because there is a sort of shadow or delusion of respectability about him, and a sobriety too, and a kind of decency in his groggy and red-nosed destitution.|$|E
60|$|The {{colors of}} this fresco of the Judgment of Paris are still so fresh and bright, that it {{photographs}} very well, {{but there are}} other frescos wherein there is more visible perfection of line, but in which the colors are so dim that they can only be reproduced by drawings. One of these is the Wounded Adonis cared for by Venus and the Loves; in which the story is treated with a playful pathos wonderfully charming. The fair boy <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> the languor of his hurt toward Venus, who sits utterly disconsolate beside him, while the Cupids busy themselves with such slight surgical offices as Cupids may render: one prepares a linen bandage for the wound, another wraps it round the leg of Adonis, another supports one of his heavy arms, another finds his own emotions too much for him and pauses to weep. It is a pity that the colors of this beautiful fresco are grown so dim, and a greater pity that most of the other frescos in Pompeii must share its fate, and fade away. The hues are vivid when the walls are first uncovered, and the ashes washed from the pictures, but then the malice of the elements begins anew, and rain and sun draw the life out of tints which the volcano failed to obliterate. In nearly all cases they could be preserved by throwing a roof above the walls, and it is a wonder that the Government does not take this slight trouble to save them.|$|E

60|$|Originally only a {{convenient}} {{spot in the}} valley where the fairs of the neighboring Etruscan city of Fiesole were held, it gradually grew from a huddle of booths to a town, {{and then to a}} city, which absorbed its ancestral neighbor and became a cradle for the arts, the letters, the science, and the commerce[2] of modern Europe. For her Cimabue wrought, who infused Byzantine formalism with a suggestion of nature and feeling; for her the Pisani, who divined at least, if they could not conjure with it, the secret of Greek supremacy in sculpture; for her the marvellous boy Ghiberti proved that unity of composition and grace of figure and drapery were never beyond the reach of genius;[3] for her Brunelleschi curved the dome which Michel Angelo hung in air on St. Peter's; for her Giotto reared the bell-tower graceful as an Horatian ode in marble; and the great triumvirate of Italian poetry, good sense, and culture called her mother. There is no modern city about which cluster so many elevating associations, none in which the past is so contemporary with us in unchanged buildings and undisturbed monuments. The house of Dante is still shown; children still receive baptism at the font (il mio bel San Giovanni) where he was christened before the acorn dropped that was to grow into a keel for Columbus; and an inscribed stone marks the spot where he used to sit and watch the slow blocks swing up to complete the master-thought of Arnolfo. In the convent of St. Mark hard by lived and labored Beato Angelico, the saint of Christian art, and Fra Bartolommeo, who taught Raphael dignity. From the same walls Savonarola went forth to his triumphs, short-lived almost as the crackle of his martyrdom. The plain little chamber of Michel Angelo seems still to expect his return; his last sketches lie upon the table, his staff <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> the corner, and his slippers wait before the empty chair. On one of the vine-clad hills, just without the city walls, one's feet may press the same stairs that Milton climbed to visit Galileo. To an American there is something supremely impressive in this cumulative influence of the past full of inspiration and rebuke, something saddening in this repeated proof that moral supremacy {{is the only one that}} leaves monuments and not ruins behind it. Time, who with us obliterates the labor and often the names of yesterday, seems here to have spared almost the prints of the care piante that shunned the sordid paths of worldly honor.|$|E
6000|$|Old myself, I take to oldness in things; {{for that}} cause mainly loving old Montague, and old cheese, and old wine; and eschewing young people, hot rolls, new books, and early {{potatoes}} and {{very fond of}} my old claw-footed chair, and old club-footed Deacon White, my neighbor, and that still nigher old neighbor, my betwisted old grape-vine, that of a summer evening <b>leans</b> <b>in</b> his elbow for cosy company at my window-sill, while I, within doors, lean over mine to meet his; and above all, high above all, am fond of my high-mantled old chimney.
