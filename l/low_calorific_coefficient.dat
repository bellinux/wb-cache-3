Apart from being used mainly for heating dryers, production of steam, electricity, or flared, {{they can also be}} used as a substitute for fuel in the reactor for the production of oil-furnace carbon blacks, thus increasing the efficiency of the hydrocarbon raw feedstock. This technical paper represents the technical-technological solution for applying the waste heat of the <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> tail gases in the reactor for the production of "hard" grade oil-furnace carbon blacks with savings of the hydrocarbon raw feedstock. The introduction of the preheated <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> tail gases in the reactor for the production of "hard" grade oil-furnace carbon blacks is achieved by serial cascading of four fans. The system consists of fans designed to pneumatically transport the mixture of process tail gases and oil-furnace carbon black dust particles.

The current gasifier that has a maximum heat capacity of combustion system of 15. 02 kW, used to burn biomass (oil palm shell) produces gases of <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> gas through a <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> swirl gas burner. Some problem appears using <b>low</b> <b>calorific,</b> it causes no circulation and weak swirling flame, and this will be an increase of residence time at high temperature.

40|$|Gases with a <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> value (LCV) are {{produced}} by many different processes, both natural and industrial. They are released from landfill sites, coal mines or sewage treatment plants, {{or they may be}} by-products of industrial processes, for example in the steel or chemical industry. In recent years, these fuel gases have received increasing interest as alternative fuel sources. They are especially suited to small-scale decentralized heat and power generation. The lower calorific values of these gases range from 1 to 3 kWh/m 3 (natural gas, for comparison's sake has about 10 - 12 kWh/m 3). This is due to the large amounts of inert components such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide which can be found in these gases, the combustible species usually being methane, hydrogen and carbon monoxide. While the use of these gases is desirable from both economic and ecological points of view, the utilization of such fuels in technical systems poses some challenges. The composition and hen ce heating values of these gases may change quite drastically over time; also they may contain hazardous substances such as siloxanes or H 2 S, raising corrosion issues. These issues have {{to be taken into account}} when designing a burner system for such fuels. Today, <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> gases are often utilized in combined heat and power gas engines.

The investigated engine was a C 9 G Stirling engine from Cleanergy. The primary incentive to {{this study was to}} determine if steady and reliable operation of the C 9 G Stirling engine could be maintained while using <b>low</b> <b>calorific</b> gaseous fuels. Another incentive to this project was to achieve further understanding of the combustion device, which purpose is to supply the Stirling engine with heat. Thus, an understanding of the changed characteristics caused by varying the air to fuel ratio was targeted. Engine operation by use of landfill gas, made up by 20 percent methane in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, was successful at the lowest load setting allowed by the C 9 G engine, generating 1 : 5 kW of shaft power. For liquid propane gas and G 25 natural gas, up to 10 : 9 kW of shaft power was generated. Combustion of synthesis gas was not attempted due to the hazard of carbon monoxide poisoning, caused by insufficient ventilation in the test cell. Apparent changes in energy ows and temperatures within the combustion device at varied air to fuel ratios suggest that incomplete combustion prior to the heat sink of the Stirling engine was an issue, especially at low to moderate air to fuel ratios. Further, a reversed ow direction through the ue gas recirculation cavities was observed when high ow rates of fuel, which primarily occurs for high load settings and low air to fuel ratios, was supplied to the engine. Consequently, a higher air to fuel ratio resulted in a higher system efficiency for all tested fuels and load settings.

Although interest in alternative fuels for fuel cells has spread in the recent years, most research activity related to fuel treatment has been performed on methane. The biggest drawback deriving from this situation is a general lack of information. When present, moreover, the information is often contradictory.
