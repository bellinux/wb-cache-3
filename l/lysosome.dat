5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a <b>lysosome</b> are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a <b>lysosome</b> were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|An unusual triad {{is found}} in seldolisin proteases. The low pKa of the {{glutamate}} carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH. The triad is hypothesised to be an adaptation to specific environments like acidic hot springs (e.g. kumamolysin) or cell <b>lysosome</b> (e.g. tripeptidyl peptidase).|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The <b>lysosome</b> engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a <b>lysosome</b> is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E

40|$|Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS) {{is characterized}} at the cellular level by a {{defect in the}} ability of cells to secrete <b>lysosomes.</b> However, the precise step affected in the secretion process is unclear. We characterized Dictyostelium discoideum cells containing a mutation in lvsB, the homolog of the human gene (LYST) involved in CHS. As observed in mammalian cells, secretion of lysosome-derived compartments was affected in lvsB mutant cells. This defect was mirrored by a {{decrease in the number of}} fusion-competent post-lysosomal compartments, which in Dictyostelium can be clearly distinguished from <b>lysosomes.</b> In addition, the transfer of endocytosed particles from <b>lysosomes</b> to post <b>lysosomes</b> was strongly diminished in lvsB mutant cells compared with the wild type. These results suggest that LvsB is primarily involved in transport from <b>lysosomes</b> to post <b>lysosomes,</b> and thus plays a critical role in the maturation of <b>lysosomes</b> into fusion-competent post-lysosomal compartments...|$|R

5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the <b>lysosome,</b> cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|When a serpin {{inhibits}} {{a target}} protease, {{it forms a}} permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the Drosophila serpin, necrotic, is degraded in the <b>lysosome</b> after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).|$|E
40|$|An earlier report {{suggested}} that actin and myosin I alpha (MMI�), a myosin associated with endosomes and <b>lysosomes,</b> {{were involved in}} the delivery of internalized molecules to <b>lysosomes.</b> To determine whether actin and MMI � {{were involved in the}} movement of <b>lysosomes,</b> we analyzed by time-lapse video microscopy the dynamic of <b>lysosomes</b> in living mouse hepatoma cells (BWTG 3 cells), producing green fluorescent protein actin or a nonfunctional domain of MMI�. In GFP-actin cells, <b>lysosomes</b> displayed a combination of rapid long-range directional movements dependent on microtubules, short random movements, and pauses, sometimes on actin filaments. We showed that the inhibition of the dynamics of actin filaments by cytochalasin D increased pauses of <b>lysosomes</b> on actin structures, while depolymerization of actin filaments using latrunculin A increased the mobility of <b>lysosomes</b> but impaired the directionality of their long-range movements. The production of a nonfunctional domain of MMI � impaired the intracellular distribution of <b>lysosomes</b> and the directionality of their long-range movements. Altogether, our observations indicate {{for the first time that}} both actin filaments and MMI� contribute to the movement of <b>lysosomes</b> in cooperation with microtubules and their associated molecular motors...|$|R

The {{effect of}} food {{restriction}} (FR) on the kidney cortex <b>lysosomes</b> prepared by rate and isopycnic zonal centrifugation was studied in rats with passive Heymann glomerulonephritis (PHN). FR reduced ttie renal mass by 41 %, but {{the capacity for}} handling of labelled endocytosed proteins by the <b>lysosomes</b> was not different from fed PHN rats. While PHN with heavy proteinuria increased the recovery of lysosomal enzymes in the large <b>lysosomes</b> located in the proximal tubule, no changes were observed in FR-PHN rats in spite of significant proteinuria. The density of the small <b>lysosomes</b> was significantly shifted/reduced (from 1, 200 and 1, 235 g/ml to 1, 185 and 1, 225 g/ml, respectively) in both fed and FR-PHN rats, suggesting that the handling of extra loads of protein may enhance the absorbtive function of small <b>lysosomes</b> found in {{the lower part of}} the nephron. FR reduced the mechanical fragility of <b>lysosomes</b> in the kidney cortex of PHN-rats. The highly increased urinary excretion of lysosomal enzymes in fed PHN rats was not observed in FR-PHN rats. As a conclusion, FR reduces both the fragility of <b>lysosomes</b> and the proportion of digestive enzymes in fragile <b>lysosomes.</b> These lysosomal enzymes may be of pathogenic importance in PHN causing cell damage when liberated from disrupted <b>lysosomes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a <b>lysosome</b> to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E

25|$|Receptor {{desensitization}} {{is mediated}} {{through a combination}} phosphorylation, β-arr binding, and endocytosis as described above. Downregulation occurs when endocytosed receptor is embedded in an endosome that is trafficked to merge with an organelle called a <b>lysosome.</b> Because lysosomal membranes are rich in proton pumps, their interiors have low pH (≈4.8 vs. the pH≈7.2 cytosol), which acts to denature the GPCRs. In addition, lysosomes contain many degradative enzymes, including proteases, which can function only at such low pH, and so the peptide bonds joining the residues of the GPCR together may be cleaved. Whether or not a given receptor is trafficked to a <b>lysosome,</b> detained in endosomes, or trafficked back to the plasma membrane depends {{on a variety of}} factors, including receptor type and magnitude of the signal.|$|E

We demonstrated a high-affinity Ca 2 +-dependent exocytosis of secretory <b>lysosomes,</b> which is sensitized further after target-cell stimulation. Our data also suggest an unusual rapid and dramatic de novo formation of secretory <b>lysosomes</b> after target-cell recognition.

The addition of basic polypeptides, polylysine or protamine, to the suspension of <b>lysosomes</b> brought about a profound alteration of lysosomal membrane, causing extensive leakage of lysosomal matrix enzymes. Electron microscopic observation revealed a remarkable aggregation of <b>lysosomes</b> by the basic polypeptides. Polyglutamic acid, an acidic polypeptide, did not produce such effect.

40|$|AbstractIn {{mammalian}} cells, macromolecules internalized by endocytosis are transported via endosomes for digestion by lysosomal acid hydrolases [1 – 3]. The {{mechanism by}} which endosomes and <b>lysosomes</b> exchange content remains equivocal [2 – 9]. However, <b>lysosomes</b> are reusable organelles because they remain accessible to endocytic enzyme replacement therapies [10] and undergo content mixing with late endosomes [5, 6]. The maturation model, which proposes that endosomes mature into <b>lysosomes</b> [9], cannot explain these observations. Three mechanisms for content mixing have been proposed. The first is vesicular transport, best supported by a yeast cell-free assay [11]. The second suggests that endosomes and <b>lysosomes</b> engage in repeated transient fusions termed “kiss-and-run” [4]. The third is that endosomes and <b>lysosomes</b> fuse completely, yielding hybrid compartments from which <b>lysosomes</b> reform [3, 5, 6, 7, 8], termed “fusion-fission” [2]. We utilized time-lapse confocal microscopy to test these hypotheses in living cells. <b>Lysosomes</b> were loaded with rhodamine dextran by pulse-chase, and subsequently late endosomes were loaded with Oregon green 488 dextran. Direct fusions were observed between endosomes and <b>lysosomes,</b> and one such event was captured by correlative electron microscopy. Fluorescence intensity analyses of endosomes that encountered <b>lysosomes</b> revealed a gradual accumulation of lysosomal content. Our data are compatible with a requirement for direct contact between organelles before content is exchanged...|$|R

It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E
25|$|LDL {{particles}} {{are the major}} blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, recognized by LDL receptors in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors concentrate in clathrin-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via endocytosis. These vesicles then fuse with a <b>lysosome,</b> where the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to {{not interfere with the}} cell membranes.|$|E
40|$|The DBA/ 2 Cr mouse strain is {{characterized}} by giant <b>lysosomes</b> that {{are located in the}} proximal convoluted tubules of males and in the proximal straight tubules of females. In the present study, we used light microscopy and electron microscopy to investigate the effects of sex hormones on the development of these giant <b>lysosomes.</b> In the proximal convoluted tubules of males, giant <b>lysosomes</b> (large vacuolar structures observed under light microscopy) disappeared after orchiectomy but reappeared after testosterone treatment. No changes were observed after ovariectomy or estradiol treatment. In the proximal straight tubules of females, giant <b>lysosomes</b> (periodic acid Schiff-positive giant granules observed under light microscopy) disappeared after ovariectomy but reappeared after estradiol treatment. After orchiectomy and testosterone treatment, the giant <b>lysosomes</b> did not appear. However, a number of small <b>lysosomes</b> (smaller than a nucleus), which were periodic acid Schiff-positive, increased after orchiectomy and decreased after testosterone treatment.

40|$|<b>Lysosomes</b> of the renal cortex: {{heterogeneity}} {{and role}} in protein handling. Rate sedimentation of the kidney cortical mitochondrial/lysosomal (ML) fraction yields two distinct classes of lysosomes: the large <b>lysosomes</b> or protein droplets and a heterogenous broad band of smaller <b>lysosomes.</b> The protein droplets which are recovered as a well defined zone of high purity also sediment as a homogeneous band after equilibrium banding at a density of 1. 235 g/ml in sucrose. The small <b>lysosomes</b> co-sediment with other subcellular organelles as a broad band, {{indicated by the}} distribution of various acid hydrolases, which exhibit subtle heterogeneity among these small <b>lysosomes.</b> The distribution of renin containing granules indicates that in size they represent a distinct subpopulation of small <b>lysosomes.</b> Further fractionation of small <b>lysosomes</b> by equilibrium banding separates two distinct populations at densities 1. 20 (small light) and 1. 235 g/ml (small dense). Comparison of lysosomal populations fractionated in these studies with the distribution of lysosomal acid hydrolases along the different segments of the nephron suggests that large and small dense <b>lysosomes</b> probably originate from the proximal tubule while the small light <b>lysosomes</b> may contain <b>lysosomes</b> from the distal tubule. Very small, lysosome-like organelles subfractionated from the ‘microsomes’ may constitute a mixture of small light <b>lysosomes,</b> lysosomal fragments and endocytic vesicles {{from a variety of}} cell types. Time course studies with 3 H labelled Cd-thionein, following intravenous administration, suggests that uptake in the kidney cortex is very rapid and that catabolism takes place in two distinct phases: rapid breakdown starting in the endosome compartment and slower breakdown in <b>lysosomes.</b> From the association of labelled lysozyme (125 I) and Cd-thionein (109 Cd) it appears that all the different lysosomal populations identified are at some stage involved with uptake and catabolism of these two proteins...|$|R

25|$|Once the IF/B12 {{complex is}} {{recognized}} by specialized ileal receptors, it is transported into the portal circulation.

Hereditary defects in production of the transcobalamins and their receptors may produce functional deficiencies in B12 and infantile megaloblastic anemia, and abnormal B12 related biochemistry, even in some cases with normal blood B12 levels. For the vitamin to serve inside cells, the TC-II/B12 complex must bind to a cell receptor, and be endocytosed. The transcobalamin-II is degraded within a <b>lysosome,</b> and free B12 is finally released into the cytoplasm, where it may be transformed into the proper coenzyme, by certain cellular enzymes (see above).|$|E
25|$|Regulation of {{receptor}} proteins {{occurs when}} the PDZ domain on the EBP50 protein binds to the C-terminus of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ß2-AR). EBP50 also associates with a complex that connects to actin, thus serving as {{a link between the}} cytoskeleton and ß2-AR. The ß2-AR receptor is eventually endocytosed, where it will either be consigned to a <b>lysosome</b> for degradation or recycled back to the cell membrane. Scientists have demonstrated that when the Ser-411 residue of the ß2-AR PDZ binding domain, which interacts directly with EBP50, is phosphorylated, the receptor is degraded. If Ser-411 is left unmodified, the receptor is recycled. The role played by PDZ domains and their binding sites indicate a regulative relevance beyond simply receptor protein localization.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} calpain {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} “calcium-activated neutral protease” (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the <b>lysosome</b> and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the cathepsin family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain’s role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name “calpain”, to recognize it as a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, papain. Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed μ("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. calpain I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names reflect {{the fact that they are}} activated by micro- and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E

With little advancement in this area, {{it is no surprise that}} analysis of lysosomal function has been somewhat stymied, largely in part by the change in buoyant densities that occur under conditions where <b>lysosomes</b> accumulate macromolecules. Such phenotypes are often associated with the lysosomal storage diseases but are increasingly being observed under conditions where lysosomal proteins or, in some cases, cellular functions associated with lysosomal proteins are being manipulated. These altered <b>lysosomes</b> poise a problem to the classical methods to purify <b>lysosomes</b> that are reliant largely on their correct sedimentation by density gradient centrifugation.

40|$|Invasion of {{mammalian}} cells by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi occurs by an actin-independent mechanism {{distinct from}} phagocytosis. Clusters of host <b>lysosomes</b> are observed {{at the site}} of parasite attachment, and lysosomal markers are detected in the vacuolar membrane at early stages of the entry process. These observations led to the hypothesis that the trypanosomes recruit host <b>lysosomes</b> to their attachment site, and that lysosomal fusion serves as a source of membrane to form the parasitophorous vacuole. Here we directly demonstrate directional migration of <b>lysosomes</b> to the parasite entry site, using time-lapse video-enhanced microscopy of L 6 E 9 myoblasts exposed to T. cruzi trypomastigotes. BSA-gold-loaded <b>lysosomes</b> moved towards the cell periphery, {{in the direction of the}} parasite attachment site, but only when their original position was less than 11 - 12 microns from the invasion site. <b>Lysosomes</b> more distant from the invasion area exhibited only the short multi-directional saltatory movements previously described for <b>lysosomes,</b> regardless of their proximity to the cell margins. Specific depletion of peripheral <b>lysosomes</b> was obtained by microinjection of NRK cells with antibodies against the cytoplasmic domain of lgp 120, a treatment that aggregated <b>lysosomes</b> in the perinuclear area and inhibited T. cruzi entry. The microtubule- binding drugs nocodazole, colchicine, vinblastine, and taxol also inhibited invasion, in both NRK and L 6 E 9 cells. Furthermore, microinjection of antibodies to the heavy chain of kinesin blocked the acidification-induced, microtubule-dependent redistribution of <b>lysosomes</b> to the host cell periphery, and reduced trypomastigote entry. Our results therefore demonstrate that during T. cruzi invasion of host cells <b>lysosomes</b> are mobilized from the immediately surrounding area, and that availability of <b>lysosomes</b> at the cell periphery and microtubule/kinesin-mediated transport are requirements for parasite entry...|$|R
