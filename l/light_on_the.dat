5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|Systematic archeological {{excavation}} {{of the area}} has not been conducted, yet numerous construction projects during the intensive urban development of the later {{half of the twentieth}} century led to important circumstantial discoveries, which shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> historic timeline of the settlement.|$|E
5|$|The <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small rock of Oxcars was {{automated}} {{as early}} as 1894. At {{that time it was}} controlled by a clockwork timer and was powered using gas delivered weekly from Granton gasworks. A lighthouse was constructed on the Bass Rock in 1902.|$|E

5|$|A Middle Devonian {{precursor}} to seed plants {{has been identified}} from Belgium, predating the earliest seed plants by about 20 million years. Runcaria, small and radially symmetrical, is an integumented megasporangium surrounded by a cupule. The megasporangium bears an unopened distal extension protruding above the multilobed integument. It is suspected that the extension was involved in anemophilous pollination. Runcaria sheds new <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sequence of character acquisition leading to the seed, having all the qualities of seed plants except for a solid seed coat and a system to guide the pollen to the seed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as {{the leading cause of death}} in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by U.S. officials as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E
5|$|Currently, no {{reliable}} pre-human fossil occurrences of Amphidromus have been recorded. Tera van Benthem Jutting (1932) reported finding several specimens of A. filozonatus {{which had been}} eaten in prehistoric times by natives, in Sampoeng Cave, central Java; {{and a few years}} later (van Benthem Jutting, 1937, pp.92–94) the same author reported a single specimen of A. palaceus from the Trinil Beds of Java. Neither record predates human occupancy, and therefore these shed no <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pre-human history of Amphidromus.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{the body}} of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, {{concerning}} their gods and heroes, {{the nature of the}} world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> religious and political institutions of ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.|$|E

5|$|In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide {{with the}} Royal Gibraltar Regiment, met {{possibly}} {{the only member}} of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England. Cooper, 92 at the time, provided an opportunity to shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). He recalled stories about his colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} of <b>the</b> <b>lighting</b> placed <b>on</b> a painting {{also seems to}} have an effect <b>on</b> aesthetic preference. <b>The</b> left-light bias is the tendency for viewers to prefer artwork that is lit with lighting coming from the left hand side of the painting. Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper left side of a piece of artwork. Participants found paintings with <b>lighting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left to be more aesthetically pleasing than when it was <b>lighter</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side and when given the opportunity to create <b>light</b> <b>on</b> an already existing painting.|$|R

It once contained a large quantity of Paleolithic material which has been looted and was deemed unfit for excavation by Sami Karkaby, Director of the Caverns in 1965. Study of the lithic remains at this shelter were hoped to shed further <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Paleolithic or Mesolithic communities that inhabited the different sites at different times.|$|E
5|$|Mansukhani {{conceived}} {{the film as}} a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which he thought was unexplored by Bollywood) to shed <b>light</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes {{for the rest of}} the cast.

5|$|One of the {{important}} developments following Witten's announcement was Witten's work in 1996 with string theorist Petr Hořava.

5|$|The Virgin and Child at the {{forefront}} might represent the background statues coming to life; at the time such an apparition was considered the highest form of pilgrimage experience.
