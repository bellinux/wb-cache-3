500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B. Weiss {{commented that}} the {{explicit}} style of the execution scene was selected in part {{to make it clear}} to the viewers that Eddard Stark, despite being the arguable protagonist of season one, actually was dead: [...] "It’s that rule: 'If you don't see the body then they’re not really dead.' [...] <b>Like</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> cut Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but we needed to see the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck. [...] we needed Ned's death to be totally unambiguous." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoppus and Barker {{decided to}} {{continue}} on without DeLonge, and enlisted Alkaline Trio vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba to [...] "fill in" [...] for three shows in March 2015. Hoppus and Skiba had been wanting to work together musically for several years, so {{he was the first}} and only person considered for the role. After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out, Skiba joined Blink-182 as an official member and began preparations for new music. The resulting album, California, was produced by John Feldmann. He was the group's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn. California was recorded between January and March 2016. The band, as well as Feldmann, would regularly spend [...] "18 hours" [...] in the studio a day, aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe. [...] "We all wanted to write the best record that we could [...] It does feel like a new beginning. It feels <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> used to tour and sleep in the van because that's all we wanted to do is play rock music," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their victory}} and {{awarding}} of the Governor's Victory Bell, Minnesota players, purportedly [...] "a little excited after ... the team’s first {{win over the}} Nittany Lions in nearly a decade", broke the trophy. For Penn State, though coming off a 200-rushing yard performance, Belton took a back seat in the rushing attack to Zwinak after fumbling in the first quarter. In total, The Morning Call graded Penn State's offense by awarding them a C-, noting the lack of scoring despite opportunities in Minnesota territory, though noting Zwinak's resurgence as a mitigating factor. They awarded the defense the same grade, noting that though they improved in the second half, they were [...] "torched" [...] on consecutive drives early in the game. They summarized Penn State's coaching with a comment from O'Brien: [...] "It seemed <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> made a call, they had the right call for it." [...] In total, the article asserted that overall, Minnesota was the superior team. StateCollege.com's Ben Jones predominantly concurred, giving the offense a C-, but giving the defense a C+, noting that the defense did keep Penn State competitive in the game.|$|E
5000|$|Isaac Isaacs was the Attorney-General in Deakin's government. The {{secretary}} of the Attorney-General's Department, Sir Robert Garran, later recalled that Isaacs [...] "had a remarkably keen brain but it was apt to be sometimes too subtle for my <b>liking.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> were drafting a bill whose constitutionality was not beyond doubt, his devices to conceal any possible want of power were sometimes so ingenious as to raise, rather than evade, suspicion".|$|R

500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself. [...] "I heard the track and I was like man this is incredible. It kind of gave me the 'Forever' feeling so I wanted to do more of a song for my pop {{audience}}. I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E
500|$|McMahan {{reflected}} on the album's success: [...] "We worked really hard on Spiderland. I mean, I definitely felt much more personal about it. I thought it represented us as people, musically, {{a lot more than}} Tweez did. That's about it. It seemed <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were around, and actively playing and stuff, that people's responses to us were fairly ambivalent. I thought it was funny when the press picked up on it. For an independent release, it had a strange sort of audience and kept selling three or four years after we recorded it; it still sells more copies than when it first came out." [...] Touch and Go founder Corey Rusk said that Spiderland is [...] "like an icon now. But when it came out, nobody cared! The band had broken up by the time the album came out, and it really didn't sell particularly well or get written about all that much in the year it was released. But it was a revolutionary, groundbreaking record, and it's one of the few instances where people catch up to it later on."

2500|$|When {{commenting on}} their {{influences}} singer Carter {{has said that}} [...] "The Dillinger Escape Plan are such a massive influence on Architects.

2500|$|All of {{the tracks}} feature a number of field {{recordings}} and sampled sounds, once referred to by David Keenan of The Wire as [...] "eschatological tape loops." [...] Therefore, the overall theme of the album is often pinned as apocalyptic. Indeed, English director Danny Boyle was heavily inspired by the album during the making of 28 Days Later. During an interview with The Guardian, he explained, [...] "I always {{try to have a}} soundtrack in my mind [...] <b>Like</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did Trainspotting, it was Underworld. For me, the soundtrack to 28 Days Later was Godspeed. The whole film was cut to Godspeed in my head." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} this trend, Raekwon later {{clarified}} [...] "We {{was the first to}} be talking that Cristal shit. I know that for a fact. Back then we would go do dinners and sit with Loud Records president Steve Rifkind and them up at the label. And our mission would be <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> sit at the table, we want the best fuckin' wine they got in the building. We might have asked for some Mo or something and they didn't have it. So we was like [...] "What the fuck is the next best thing, Steve?" [...] And Steve's like 'Give 'em the next best thing.' They came out with Cristal. Me and Ghost liked the bottle, and the name on the bottle was Louie Roederer. I was like, I'm Lou Diamond, Louie Roederer. Me and Ghost is loving how the bottle looked. It cost more than the muthafuckin' other, so we was like, Cristal, nigga! That's our new shit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|During 2001, after a low key tour {{supporting}} Texas, {{they took}} a long summer break, in North Devon, to write new material for their fifth album. The self-financed sessions were deliberately performed at arms length from their record label and the music industry in general, and Reef enjoyed the opportunity {{to return to their}} earlier, more basic approach to making music. In an interview to the BBC Jack said [...] "It's a harder sound, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first came out - a deep sound, heavy, I really like that." [...] Whilst {{they had a lot of}} new material, Sony forced Reef to only use around a third of this material as part of a greatest hits offering entitled Together - The Best of Reef released in January 2003. Jack Bessant denounced the complete lack of support from Sony and Kenwyn House called the release [...] "a kiss of death." [...] Many fans felt the new material had been some of their best work for some time.|$|E

60|$|I may add parenthetically {{that the}} Mediterranean {{is a mere}} bit of a sea, {{when you look at}} it on the map--a pocket sea, to be {{regarded}} with mingled contempt and affection; but you learn to respect it when you find that it takes four clear days and nights of abject misery merely to run across its eastern basin from Brindisi to Alexandria. I respected the Mediterranean immensely while we lay off the Peloponnesus in the trough of the waves with a north wind blowing; I only began to temper my respect with a distant <b>liking</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> passed under the welcome shelter of Crete on a calm, star-lit evening.|$|R
