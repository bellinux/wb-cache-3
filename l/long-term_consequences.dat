5|$|If a chest tube {{is already}} in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences</b> in younger people.|$|E
5|$|The unified budget deficit, a cash-basis measurement, is the {{equivalent}} of a checkbook balance. This indicator does not consider <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences,</b> but has historically been the focus of budget reporting by the media. Except for the unified budget deficit, the federal government's financial statements rely on accrual basis accounting.|$|E
50|$|To {{simulate}} social traps {{a short-term}} positive reward is superimposed upon a <b>long-term</b> negative <b>consequence.</b> In the specific experiment, the short-term positive reinforcer was earning points that applied to class credits. The <b>long-term</b> negative <b>consequence</b> was that each point earned by a player also drained {{the pool of}} available points. Responding too rapidly for short-term gains led to the long-term loss of draining the resource pool. What makes the traps social is that any individual can respond {{in a way that}} the <b>long-term</b> <b>consequence</b> also comes to bear on the other individuals in the environment.|$|R

40|$|A case of {{discrete}} gingival enlargement as a <b>long-term</b> <b>consequence</b> of artificially created midline diastema by a dental quack {{in an otherwise}} healthy 33 -year-old female was reported. The patient {{and her husband were}} bothered by the gingival enlargement and requested treatment. The patient was unconcerned about the associated discolored tooth. The lesion was diagnosed as fibrous epulis and was treated by surgical excision after which the patient was referred to the restorative dentist for endodontic treatment. To conclude, discrete gingival enlargement occurring as a <b>long-term</b> <b>consequence</b> of artificially created midline diastema by a dental quack should be considered as fibrous epulis until proven otherwise...|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the changes}} Henry {{introduced}} during his rule had <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences.</b> His legal innovations form part of the basis for English law, with the Exchequer of Pleas a forerunner of the Common Bench at Westminster. Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant bailli, for example, drew on Henry's model. Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland had a significant long-term impact {{on the development of}} their societies and governments.|$|E
5|$|Season 4, set 18 months later, {{begins at}} 7:00a.m. Jack must {{save the lives}} of his new boss, Secretary of Defense James Heller, and Heller's {{daughter}} Audrey Raines (with whom Jack is romantically involved) when they are kidnapped by terrorists. However, Habib Marwan uses this as a disguise to launch further attacks against America, and Jack is forced to use unorthodox methods to stop him, which results in <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences</b> for both Jack and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Various {{protocols}} {{have been}} drawn up detailing {{a course of action}} for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences</b> of the message received. No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law, and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} <b>long-term</b> <b>consequence</b> {{of the battle}} was {{the death of the}} tourmarches Diogenes: by virtue of his unusual {{prominence}} in Theophanes's account, Henri Grégoire identified this Diogenes with the original archetype for the later epic hero Digenes Akritas.|$|R
5000|$|As The Cambridge History of Iran adds, [...] "perhaps {{the only}} <b>long-term</b> <b>consequence</b> was the {{consciousness}} {{on the part}} of Russia's rulers that their armies had once marched beyond the Caucasus, that the Russian flag had flown over the southern shore of the Caspian Sea." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{storm had}} several <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences.</b> Complaints against the USDA Weather Bureau of alleged unpreparedness {{resulted}} in increased efforts to achieve more accurate weather forecasting and faster realization and communication of proper storm warnings. Criticism of the shipping companies and shipbuilders {{led to a}} series of conferences with insurers and mariners to seek safer designs for vessels. This resulted in the construction of ships with greater stability and more longitudinal strength. Immediately following the blizzard of Cleveland, Ohio, the city began a campaign to move all utility cables underground, in tubes beneath major streets. The project took half a decade.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, the exact opposite occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences</b> in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E
5|$|Henry's empire quickly {{collapsed}} {{during the}} reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences.</b> Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a driving force {{in the creation of a}} genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign.|$|E

5|$|In the East the {{situation}} was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences</b> for Jerusalem. In 1149, the atabeg Anur died, {{at which point the}} amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ra'is of Damascus and commander of the ahdath milita Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ahdath had {{played a major role in}} defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq. The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years. Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.|$|E
5|$|The British {{capture of}} Acadia had <b>long-term</b> <b>consequences</b> for the Acadians and Mi'kmaq living there. Britain's hold on Nova Scotia was {{initially}} quite tenuous, a situation on which French and Mi'kmaq resistance leaders capitalized. British {{relations with the}} Mi'kmaq after the war developed {{in the context of}} British expansion in Nova Scotia and also along the Maine coast, where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands, often in violation of previous treaties. Neither the Abenakis nor the Mi'kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht, and the 1713 Portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by the New England signatories, so the Mi'kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands. This conflict was increased by French intriguers such as Sébastien Rale, and eventually they developed into Father Rale's War (1722–1727).|$|E
