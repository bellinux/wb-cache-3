5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers.
