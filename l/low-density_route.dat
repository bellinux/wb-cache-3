5000|$|Looking for {{a site in}} Ontario {{to serve}} as a test bed for the ICTS, the {{government}} focused on an extension of the eastern end of TTC's Bloor-Danforth line. The TTC had already started building a streetcar line that would extend {{from the end of the}} subway at Kennedy station to the Scarborough City Centre, a <b>low-density</b> <b>route</b> passing through industrial land. The TTC was not interested in changing to the ICTS for this route, until the Ontario government, which provided about 80% of the capital costs, stepped in and demanded the ICTS be used. A smaller system in Hamilton was also considered, and there was a brief study for a similar system in Ottawa. Vancouver was interested in the system as part of the Expo 86 buildout in keeping with the theme, [...] "Transportation and Communication". Although the UMTA program in the U.S. was [...] "de-funded" [...] that year, Detroit pressed ahead with its plans and signed up in August. Hamilton, Ottawa, Miami, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. were also in talks with UTDC. With three customers lined up, a manufacturing plant was added to the Millhaven site, VentureTrans Manufacturing, which opened in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Guilford's {{first few}} years were defined by abandonments, labor unrest and strikes, and a {{draconian}} management style that damaged the company's reputation for some time. The railroad struggled financially {{to turn a profit}} and implemented cost-cutting measures. Guilford then began to shrink its system by eliminating marginal <b>low-density</b> <b>routes.</b>|$|R
50|$|On February 4, 2009, Mexicana won a {{concession}} to operate a new feeder airline to complement the routes currently covered by Mexicana and Mexicana Click. The new airline was to be called MexicanaLink and operate in <b>low-density</b> <b>routes</b> to feed mainline operations from Guadalajara's airport. The airline flew Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|SEL's {{control system}} allowed the Transurban cars to be {{operated}} singly or in five-car trains. This gave the Transurban system added flexibility; the very same system could be used on high or <b>low-density</b> <b>routes,</b> the only difference being the doors at the stations. The trains could automatically couple or uncouple in the stations, allowing the capacity to be adjusted [...] "on the fly", or to allow individual cars to be pulled out of operation on demand, as opposed to removing the entire train from operation. Each car held 12 seated and 6 standing.|$|R
5000|$|The other {{vehicles}} in {{use with the}} TTC, buses and streetcars, {{would not be able}} to provide rapid transit unless they were given a separate right-of-way. This expense is easy to justify in the case of a subway with its large passenger capacity, but for a system like a bus the capital costs overwhelm the passenger numbers these systems could carry. What was needed was a new system that reduced the capital costs to be able to efficiently serve <b>low-density</b> <b>routes</b> in the suburbs, a system with flexible sizing somewhere between a small subway and large streetcar, an [...] "intermediate" [...] sized system.|$|R
40|$|The ‘Third Package’ of European Union air {{transport}} liberalisation measures came into effect on 1 January 1993 and has substantially reduced {{the restrictions on}} interstate flight operations. The package of measures also includes provision for the member states to impose ‘public service obligations’ on <b>low-density</b> <b>routes</b> which were deemed {{necessary for the purposes}} of regional development. In this paper, it is this legislation which is the main focus of attention. In the second section, the background to and contents of the ‘Third Package’ are reviewed. The competitive implications of these measures are briefly outlined. In Section III, the legislation relating to public service obligation routes is critically examined. The Irish government was first to invoke this legislation and several difficulties have come to light as a result. In the final section, recommendations on improvements to the legislation are proposed, based largely on the equivalent US ‘Essential Air Services’ (EAS) programme. ...|$|R
25|$|On 24 April 1994, South African Express (SA Express), {{a feeder}} airline service of South African, began {{operating}} after a 3-year preparation process begun in 1991, when the regional airline was granted its operating license. SAA initially held a 20% stake in SA Express (Alliance Airline Holdings held 51%, SA Enterprises, 24.9% and Abyss Investments, 4.1%). SA Express took {{over some of}} South African's <b>low-density</b> domestic <b>routes.</b>|$|R
