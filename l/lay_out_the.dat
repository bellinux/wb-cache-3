5|$|At {{the same}} time, House is annoyed {{because he is}} not able to spend enough time with his friend, James Wilson. He {{attempts}} to negotiate with Amber, Wilson's girlfriend, about conditions under which they can both have Wilson's company. They are at a standstill, thus House seeks Lisa Cuddy's (Lisa Edelstein) resolution. However, she will only <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> conditions if House does his team's performance reviews (knowing that he hates doing paperwork). House relents and Cuddy sets the rules, although House has Foreman do the team reviews instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant to <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{current state of the}} Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household {{and a member of the}} Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|From {{a handful}} of company designs, Saville {{selected}} Hughes Aircraft to make the FCS. Saville worked closely with Dr. Ruben F. Mettler of Hughes, to <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> desired strategy of the weapons system and to describe the expected fighter tactics. This weapon would eventually be developed as the AIM-4 Falcon after much urging by Saville. The Falcon was used successfully {{for more than a}} decade, beginning in 1956. Designing an aircraft around a weapons system was something Saville had witnessed in the development of Bell's P-39 Airacobra around a large autocannon, but he further refined the concept and made it a requirement for government contractors, a practice that is continued to this day. Saville put an end to specific design goals in aircraft requests for proposal (RFPs); instead, he briefed potential designers on general requirements and discussed with them the defense problems the aircraft was to solve.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began to <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored {{off the coast of}} New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E

25|$|In 1729, {{he became}} Vice Admiral of Scotland, but lost the {{position}} on 5 May 1733, {{mainly because of}} {{his opposition to the}} Excise Bill of 1733 promoted by Prime Minister Robert Walpole.

25|$|In 1780, the Virginia General Assembly and then-Governor Thomas Jefferson {{approved}} the town charter of Louisville on May 1. Clark recruited early Kentucky pioneer James John Floyd, who {{was placed on}} the town's board of trustees and given the authority to plan and <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> town. Jefferson County, named after Thomas Jefferson, was formed at this time as one of three original Kentucky counties from the old Kentucky County, Virginia. Louisville was the county seat.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} built {{and laid out}} as a rural cemetery, with a parklike setting {{on the banks of}} Oatka Creek. In the early 20th century its design philosophy changed, when a large mausoleum to local businessman Orator Francis Woodward, who in his last years made a fortune developing Jell-O into a bestselling dessert, was built in the southern section of the cemetery near his factory. The architect hired by the family to <b>lay</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> section was influenced by the City Beautiful movement, giving that area a more orderly cast.|$|E
