50|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{published}} investigating the effect of <b>L-menthol</b> application {{as a model for}} TRPM8-sensitization. The primary consensus finding is that TRPM8 sensitization increases the sensation of cold pain, also known as cold hyperalgesia. An experiment was done in a double-blind two-way crossover study by applying 40% <b>L-menthol</b> to the forearm, using ethanol as a control. Activation of the TRPM8-receptor channel (the primary menthol receptor channel) resulted in increased sensitization to the menthol stimulus. To investigate the mechanisms of this sensitization, Wasner et al., 2004, performed A fiber conduction blockade of the superficial radial nerve in another group of subjects. This ended up reducing the menthol-induced sensation of cold and hyperalgesia because blocking A fiber conduction resulted in inhibition of a class of group C nerve fiber nociceptors needed to transduce the sensation of pain. They concluded menthol sensitizes cold-sensitive peripheral C nociceptors and activates cold-specific A delta fibers.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (−)-menthol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-hydroxylating). This enzyme is also called <b>l-menthol</b> monooxygenase.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} the {{commercial}} importance of single-enantiomer fine chemicals has increased steadily. They constitute {{about half of}} both existing and developmental drug APIs. In this context, the ability to synthesize chiral molecules has become an important competency. Two types of processes are used, namely the physical separation of the enantiomers and the stereo specific synthesis, using chiral catalysts. Among the latter, enzymes and synthetic BINAP (2,2´-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1´-binaphthyl) types are used most frequently. Large volume (> 103 mtpa) processes using chiral catalysts include the manufacture of the perfume ingredient <b>l-Menthol</b> and Syngenta’s Dual (metolachlor) as well as BASF’s Outlook (dimethenamid-P) herbicides. Examples of originator drugs, which apply asymmetric technology, are AstraZeneca’s Nexium (esomeprazole) and Merck & Co’s Januvia (sitagliptin). The physical separation of chiral mixtures and purification of the desired enantiomer can be achieved either by classical fractional crystallization (having a “low-tech” image but still widely used), carried-out in standard multipurpose equipment or by various types of chromatographical separation, such as standard column, simulated moving-bed (SMB) or supercritical fluid (SCF) techniques. For peptides three main types of methods are used, namely chemical synthesis, extraction from natural substances, and biosynthesis. Chemical synthesis is used for smaller peptides made of up to 30-40 amino acids. One distinguishes between “liquid phase” and “solid phase” synthesis. In the latter, reagents are incorporated in a resin that is contained in a reactor or column. The synthesis sequence starts by attaching the first amino acid to the reactive group of the resin and then adding the remaining amino acids one after the other. In order to ascertain a full selectivity, the amino groups have to be protected in advance. Most developmental peptides are synthesized by this method, which lends itself to automation. As the intermediate products resulting from individual synthetic steps cannot be purified, a virtually 100% selectivity {{is essential for the}} synthesis of larger-peptide molecules. Even at a selectivity of 99% per reaction step, the purity will drop to less than 75% for a dekapeptide (30 steps). Therefore, for industrial quantities of peptides not more than 10-15 amino acid peptides can be made using the solid-phase method. For laboratory quantities, up to 40 are possible. In order to prepare larger peptides, individual fragments are first produced, purified, and then combined to the final molecule by liquid phase synthesis. Thus, for the production of Roche’s anti-AIDS drug Fuzeon (enfuvirtide), three fragments of 10-12 amino acids are first made by solid-phase synthesis and then linked together by liquid-phase synthesis. The preparation of the whole 35 amino acid peptide requires more than 130 individual steps.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Peppermint oil, which {{suppresses}} gastric peristalsis during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), {{is effective}} {{for determining the}} margin of a gastric tumor. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the utility of an <b>L-menthol</b> preparation for suppressing gastric peristalsis and for diagnosing gastric tumors. Methods: The study examined 124 patients who underwent EGD between January and April 2012. After 20 mL of 0. 8 % <b>L-menthol</b> was sprayed directly onto the mucosal surface of the gastric antrum, the degree of peristalsis suppression in the antrum was evaluated. The effectiveness of <b>L-menthol</b> for identifying new gastric tumors and determining tumor margins was also evaluated. Results: Gastric peristalsis was suppressed in 88. 5 % (69 / 78) of patients, with complete suppression of peristalsis achieved in 78. 2 %. <b>L-menthol</b> exerted a higher peristalsis-suppressive effect in patients with endoscopic gastric mucosal atrophy (93. 3 %, 56 / 60) than in patients without atrophy (72. 2 %, 13 / 18) (p =. 014). <b>L-menthol</b> application caused the detection of new gastric tumors in 1. 6 % (2 / 124) of patients and clarification of the margin of three lesions (in 3 patients) identified as having an unclear margin before <b>L-menthol</b> application. Conclusion: These results suggest that <b>L-menthol</b> is effective for suppressing gastric peristalsis during EGD and suggest that it is useful for identifying gastric tumors and for determining tumor margins...|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of <b>l-menthol</b> in rats was {{investigated}} both in vivo and in vitro. Metabolites isolated and characterized from the urine of rats after oral administration (800 mg/kg of body weight/day) of <b>l-menthol</b> were the following: p-menthane- 3, 8 -diol (II), p-menthane- 3, 9 -diol (III), 3, 8 -oxy-p-menthane- 7 -carboxylic acid (IV), and 3, 8 -dihyroxy-p-menthane- 7 -carboxylic acid (V). In vivo, the major urinary metabolites were compounds II and V. Repeated oral administration (800 mg/kg of body weight/day) of <b>l-menthol</b> to rats for 3 days {{resulted in the}} increase of both liver microsomal cytochrome P- 450 content and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity by nearly 80 %. Further treatment (for 7 days total) reduced their levels considerably, although the levels were still higher than the control values. Both cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome c reductase levels were not changed during the 7 days of treatment. Rat liver microsomes readily converted <b>l-menthol</b> to p-menthane- 3, 8 -diol (II) {{in the presence of}} NADPH and O 2. This activity was significantly higher in microsomes obtained from phenobarbital (PB) -induced rats than from control microsomal preparations, whereas 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 -MC) -induced microsomes failed to convert <b>l-menthol</b> to compound II in the presence of NADPH and O 2. <b>l-Menthol</b> elicited a type I spectrum with control (Ks = 60. 6 microM) and PB-induced (Ks = 32. 3 microM) microsomes whereas with 3 MC-induced microsomes it produced a reverse type I spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Addition of menthol to {{cigarettes}} may {{be associated}} with increased initiation of smoking. The potential mechanisms underlying this association are not known. Menthol, likely due to its effects on cold-sensing peripheral sensory neurons, is known to inhibit the sensation of irritation elicited by respiratory irritants. However, it remains unclear whether menthol modulates cigarette smoke irritancy and nicotine absorption during initial exposures to cigarettes, thereby facilitating smoking initiation. Using plethysmography in a C 57 Bl/ 6 J mouse model, we examined the effects of <b>L-menthol,</b> the menthol isomer added to cigarettes, on the respiratory sensory irritation response to primary smoke irritants (acrolein and cyclohexanone) and smoke of Kentucky reference 2 R 4 cigarettes. We also studied L-menthol's effect on blood levels of the nicotine metabolite, cotinine, immediately after exposure to cigarette smoke. <b>L-menthol</b> suppressed the irritation response to acrolein with an apparent IC₅₀ of 4 ppm. Suppression was observed even at acrolein levels well above those necessary to produce a maximal response. Cigarette smoke, at exposure levels of 10 mg/m³ or higher, caused an immediate and marked sensory irritation response in mice. This response was significantly suppressed by <b>L-menthol</b> even at smoke concentrations as high as 300 mg/m³. Counterirritation by <b>L-menthol</b> was abolished by treatment with a selective inhibitor of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 (TRPM 8), the neuronal cold/menthol receptor. Inclusion of menthol in the cigarette smoke resulted in roughly a 1. 5 -fold increase in plasma cotinine levels over those observed in mice exposed to smoke without added menthol. These findings document that, <b>L-menthol,</b> through TRPM 8, is a strong suppressor of respiratory irritation responses, even during highly noxious exposures to cigarette smoke or smoke irritants, and increases blood cotinine. Therefore, <b>L-menthol,</b> as a cigarette additive, may promote smoking initiation and nicotine addiction...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} non-thermal cooling agent, <b>L-menthol,</b> on exercise at a fixed subjective rating of perceived exertion (RPE) in a hot environment. Eight male participants completed two trials at an exercise intensity between 'hard' and 'very hard', equating to 16 on the RPE scale at ~ 35  °C. Participants were instructed to continually adjust their power output to maintain an RPE of 16 throughout the exercise trial, stopping once power output had fallen by 30 %. In a randomized crossover design, either <b>L-menthol</b> or placebo mouthwash was administered prior to exercise and at 10  min intervals. Power output, [Formula: see text]O 2, heart rate, core and skin temperature was monitored, alongside thermal sensation and thermal comfort. Isokinetic peak power sprints were conducted prior to and immediately after the fixed RPE trial. Exercise time was greater (23 : 23  ±  3 : 36 vs. 21 : 44  ±  2 : 32  min; P =  0. 049) and average power output increased (173  ±  24 vs. 167  ±  24  W; P =  0. 044) in the <b>L-menthol</b> condition.

40|$|Background : In Japan, anti-peristaltic {{drugs are}} {{routinely}} injected as a countermeasure {{to control the}} occurrence of spasms during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). However, few reports have so far shown these drugs {{to improve the quality}} of diagnostic EGD. We evaluated the requirement of anti-peristaltic premedication and the efficacy of the selective use of <b>L-menthol.</b> Methods : 173 patients who underwent EGD screening were enrolled prospectively. Endoscopy was performed without the administration of any anti-peristaltic drugs. The degree of gastric peristalsis was assessed when the endoscope reached the antrum. Gastric peristalsis was classified into three grades : none, mild or severe. When gastric peristalsis was severe, 20 mL of 0. 8 % <b>L-menthol</b> was sprayed endoscopically on the gastric mucosa. Thereafter, we again assessed the grade of peristalsis and measured the time interval until peristalsis was suppressed. Results : The peristaltic grade observed without the use of any anti-peristaltic drugs was none or mild in 88. 5 % of the patients. After spraying <b>L-menthol,</b> the proportion of subjects with severe peristalsis was 0. 0 % and EGD screening was performed satisfactorily. Conclusions : The routine use of premedication with anti-peristaltic drugs during EGD screening may not be necessary.

Therefore, <b>L-Menthol</b> application {{could lead to a}} conflict in behavioural and thermoregulatory drivers improving comfort but leading to a higher rate of deep body temperature rise; the present study examined this possibility. METHOD Six untrained male participants (age 21 [1] years; height 1. 80 [0. 07]m; mass 78. 9 [6. 9]kg; surface area 1. 98 [0. 13]m 2) took part. They completed three trials in hot conditions (34 °C) where their clothing was sprayed (CONTROL-SPRAY or MENTHOL-SPRAY) or not sprayed (CONTROL) after a fixed intensity exercise period (15 -minutes), which induced thermal discomfort, before completing a 5 km treadmill time trial (TT). Thermal perception (thermal sensation and comfort; TS, TC), thermal responses (aural temperature [Tau], skin temperature [Tskin]), perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate, pacing (1 km split time) and performance (TT completion time) were measured. RESULTS:MENTHOL-SPRAY induced improvements in TS (up to 3 km of TT) and TC (up to 1 km) with Tau showing a tendency to be higher than CONTROL-SPRAY (+ 0. 20 [0. 29]°C) and CONTROL condition (0. 30 [0. 34]°C) ; this was not statistically significant and the rate of rise in Tau was linear.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{monoterpene}} ketone l-[G- 3 H]-menthone is reduced to the epimeric alcohols <b>l-menthol</b> and d-neomenthol in leaf discs of flowering peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), and that a portion of the menthol is converted to menthyl acetate while the bulk of the neomenthol is transformed to neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside (Croteau, Martinkus 1979 Plant Physiol 64 : 169 - 175). The metabolic disposition of the epimeric reduction products of the ketone, which is a major constituent of peppermint oil, is highly specific, in that little neomenthyl acetate and little menthyl glucoside are formed. However, when l-[3 - 3 H]menthol and d-[3 - 3 H]neomenthol are separately administered to leaf discs, both menthyl and neomenthyl acetates and menthyl and neomenthyl glucosides are formed with nearly equal facility, suggesting that the metabolic specificity observed with the ketone precursor was not a function of the specificity of the transglucosylase or transacetylase but rather a result of compartmentation of each stereospecific dehydrogenase with the appropriate transferase. A UDP-glucose:monoterpenol glucosyltransferse, which utilized d-neomenthol or <b>l-menthol</b> as glucose acceptor, was demonstrated in the 105, 000 g supernatant of a peppermint leaf homogenate, and the enzyme was partially purified and characterized. Co-purification of the acceptor-mediated activities, and differential activation and inhibition studies, provided strong evidence that the same UDP-glucose-dependent enzyme could transfer glucose to either <b>l-menthol</b> or d-neomenthol. Determination of Km and V for the epimeric monoterpenols provided nearly identical values. The acetylcoenzyme A:monoterpenol acetyltransferase previously isolated from peppermint extracts (Croteau, Hooper 1978 Plant Physiol 61 : 737 - 742) was re-examined using l-[3 - 3 H]menthol and d-[3 - 3 H]neomenthol as acetyl acceptors, and the Km and V for both epimers were, again, very similar. These results demonstrate that the specific in vivo conversion of l-menthone to l-menthyl acetate and d-neomenthyl-β-d-glucoside cannot be attributed to the selectivity of the transferases, and they clearly indicate that the metabolic specificity observed is a result of compartmentation effects...|$|E
40|$|A general {{method for}} {{enantioselective}} syntheses of aldohexoses using macrocyclic stereocontrol is described. The strategy employs simultaneous bis-dihydroxylation of chiral macrocyclic dienes {{to install the}} four contiguous stereogenic centers of aldohexoses. Conformational searches have been performed on two different macrocyclic precursors to the desired aldohexose using molecular mechanics calculations. Qualitative analysis of the low energy conformers obtained from these searches predicts L-gulose and D-idose, respectively, to be formed as major products in high enantiomeric ratios. ^ The synthesis of the macrocyclic precursor to L-gulose {{was carried out in}} 5 steps from <b>l-menthol.</b> Key steps in this synthesis include a one-pot oxidation-Baeyer Villiger rearrangement of <b>l-menthol</b> and an intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth olefination to form a 14 -membered ring in high yield. A broad survey of dihydroxylation conditions for osmylation of the diene was conducted. Although the majority of conditions resulted in complex mixtures of diastereomeric tetraols, catalytic OsO 4 and Me 3 NO afforded two diastereomeric tetraols cleanly. Enantiomeric purity of the dihydroxylation products was determined through conversion of the macrocyclic tetraol to the corresponding hexitol hexaacetate and correlation with authentic material. The generality of this method was demonstrated by the synthesis of D-galactose from a related macrocycle using identical osmylation conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{taste and}} flavor of spray-dried {{powdered}} products {{are the most}} important quality factors. In the present study, molecular encapsulation in cyclodextrin was applied to prevent the loss of a hydrophobic flavor compound (<b>l-menthol)</b> during the drying of a droplet. ß-Cyclodextrin appeared to be a better encapsulant for menthol than a- and ¿-cyclodextrin. The retention of menthol increased with increasing concentration of both cyclodextrin and maltodextrin. A simple mathematical model is proposed for estimating the flavor retention. The theoretical results by this model estimated well the final retention of menthol encapsulated in a blend of ß-cyclodextrin and maltodextrin...|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} capsule {{containing}} 25  mg of caraway oil and 20.75  mg of <b>l-menthol</b> versus placebo for functional dyspepsia symptoms was evaluated after 24  h. In this study, 100 subjects suffering from functional dyspepsia (Rome III criteria) took two capsules of intervention or placebo {{in the morning}} and at dinner time. The patients were categorized into PDS or EPS predominant based on their symptoms and took their routine treatments. The self-reported Global Overall Symptoms (GOS) were used in patients at 24  h. At 24  h, a significant (p=[*] 0.04) reduction in PDS symptoms and significant improvement in EPS symptoms (p = [*] 0.076) in the overall population were observed [83].|$|E
40|$|Vehicles and enhancers {{effect on}} in vitro {{probenecid}} permeation through dermatomed abdominal pig skin was investigated. The permeability of different probenecid percentages dispersed in vehicles as vaseline, carbopol/ethanol/water and carbopol/propylene glycol was tested. The 1. 3 % <b>L-menthol</b> addition, as permeation enhancer, over probenecid/vaseline formulations {{showed the highest values}} for both, flux and permeation coefficient. Permeation experiments of the probenecid formulations in carbopol/ propylene glycol {{showed that the}} carbopol/probenecid concentration relation is the most important issue to be considered. Comparatively to lipophilic vehicle (vaseline), carbopol dispersions seen to be more convenient as vehicle for topical administration of probenecid. The results obtained from this study may be helpful {{in the development of a}} probenecid transdermal drug delivery system...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolism}} of l-menthone, {{which is}} synthesized in the epidermal oil glands of peppermint (Mentha piperita L. cv. Black Mitcham) leaves, is compartmented; on leaf maturity, this ketone {{is converted to}} <b>l-menthol</b> and l-menthyl acetate in one compartment, and to d-neomenthol and d-neomenthyl glucoside in a separate compartment. All of the enzymes involved in these reactions are soluble when prepared from whole-leaf homogenates. Mechanical separation of epidermal fragments from the mesophyll, followed by preparation of the soluble enzyme fraction from each tissue, revealed that the neomenthol dehydrogenase and the glucosyl transferase resided specifically in the mesophyll layer, whereas the menthol dehydrogenase and substantial amounts of the acetyl transferase were located in the epidermis, presumably within the epidermal oil glands. These {{results suggest that the}} compartmentation of menthone metabolism in peppermint leaves is intercellular, not intracellular...|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a chitosan (CHI) gel containing alcohols and <b>l-menthol</b> (MEN) as skin permeation enhancers,and succinic acid (SUC) as a cross-linking agent {{and examined the}} permeation of morphine hydrochloride (MPH) from the CHI gel into human skin. The solubility of CHI and MEN was measured beforehand {{in order to create}} a system saturated with these 2 substances. Solubility varied with the content of ethanol and 1, 3 -butylene glycol. The saturated CHI gel displayed sufficient elasticity to be applied to a fixed area of skin. The permeation of MPH into the skin from the CHI gel was compared with its permeation into the skin for a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel having a similar composition. Permeation was greater for the CHI gel in the later stages of the experiment. Our CHI gel should thus be useful for the transdermal delivery of MPH...|$|E
40|$|Herein an {{alternative}} approach to the conventional batch synthesis of L-menthyl glyoxylate hydrate (MGH), an important intermediate in the synthesis of drugs of importance is reported, through flow chemistry technology. MGH was initially synthesized in batch and various reaction parameters optimized. It was found to proceed to completion after 6 hours of esterifying glyoxylic acid with excess alcohol (<b>L-menthol)</b> {{in the presence of}} a catalyst, ideally amberlyst- 15 (an ion exchange resin) at 105 °C giving a yield of 72 %. The batch reaction conditions were adopted in a continuous flow synthesis setup, using the Labtrix Start system, in which reaction conditions were optimized. The optimization of glyoxylic acid conversion (92 %) in the Labtrix Start system gave reaction conditions that resulted in low MGH selectivity (25 %) whereas the optimization for MGH selectivity (100 %) gave a conversion a poor glyoxylic acid conversion (15 %). The FlowSyn system fitted with a column reactor gave the best results, in which the optimum conditions were an excess of <b>L-menthol</b> (1. 5 M, 6. 0 equiv.), temperature (80 °C) and a residence time of 2. 5 minutes with a high selectivity (77 %) and average conversion (50 %). The optimized reaction conditions for conversion and selectivity on the different flow systems did not vary significantly and similar trends were observed for the systems. It was shown that an increase in temperature, mole equivalents and residence time led to an increase in MGH conversion in all flow systems. The scale up of the esterification reaction from the Labtrix Start system (19 μL microreactor) to the FlowSyn system fitted with a 2 mL reactor chip, showed that the reaction proceeds with a slight drop in selectivity from 100 % to 92 % while conversion dropped from 15 to 12 %. On the contrary, a significant drop in conversion and selectivity were observed when the FlowSyn column reactor was up-scaled to the Elite-tubular furnace, owing to the poor mixing in the larger channel size reactor...|$|E
30|$|Some {{fractionation}} processes {{have been}} developed using the lipase-catalyzed selective esterification (Haas et al. 1999; Kobayashi et al. 2006; Nagao et al. 2003 b). In these processes, lipases, such as from Candida rugosa, {{one of the most}} effective lipases for the esterification of CLA, were used, and some alcohols were used for the hydroxyl donors. <b>l-Menthol</b> is one these alcohols and very effective for the large-scale fractionation by selective esterification with CLA (Kobayashi et al. 2006). In this process, the alkali hydrolysis of CLA menthyl ester was needed to recover CLA as a free fatty acid. However, the hydrolysis requires heating under a strong alkaline condition, which may cause decomposition or isomerization of CLA. The lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of CLA menthyl ester is considered to avoid these drawbacks. However, a degree of hydrolysis (yield) for CLA menthyl ester would be low in an oil/water two-phase system because the degree of the reverse reaction (esterification) is very high (ca. 80 %) at equilibrium (Kobayashi et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|The {{release and}} {{permeation}} studies {{were carried out}} for developing transdermal therapeutic systems with chlorpheniramine maleate (CPM). The patches were prepared with eudragit RS- 100 and RL- 100 with/without polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in different compositions. Thickness, tensile strength, drug content, moisture content and water absorption studies of the patches were measured. In vitro release/permeation of CPM was studied in modified Keshary-Chien diffusion cell. Chemical enhancers like <b>l-menthol,</b> oleic acid and phospholipon 80 were added to compare the release pattern of the drug. The percent release of the drug from matrix patch increased with increase of PVP & DBP but the tensile strength decreased with the increase of DBP & PVP. Experimental release/permeation data of different formulations of the matrix systems are reported. Also the drug-polymer interaction was investigated by ATR-FTIR studies. The discussion was correlated the efficient matrix dispersion patch from suitable eudragit polymers for transdermal antihistamine applications in film device industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate feasibility of transdermal delivery of loratadine. Effect of pH, vehicles and chemical enhancers on the skin permeation of loratadine was studied in vitro, using rat abdominal skin as a barrier. In the permeation studies, horizontal 2 -chamber diffusion cells were used. The amount of loratadine transferred through the skin into the receptor solution, 30 % ethanolsaline solution (v/v), was determined at a predetermined time intervals for 8 h using a high performance chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that transdermal transport of loratadine was not significantly affected by pH. 30 % ethanol-saline solution in donor chamber was more effective than 40 % PGsaline solution in deliverying loratadine in vitro. Among the permeation enhancers (azone, oleic acid, menthol, and borneol) examined, <b>l-menthol</b> and borneol showed the greatest enhancing effect using ethanol as a solvent. Overall, these findings allow a rational approach for designing an effective loratadine transdermal delivery system, it is worth carrying out further investigations...|$|E
