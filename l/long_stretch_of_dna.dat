Two are reported positive for the enzyme activity, and designated as Bth DI, SarI, from Bacillus thuringiensis D 4 (CAMB 2657) and Streptomyces aureomonopodiales (ATCC 19825). These enzymes have been purified by a combination of gel filtration, ion exchange and affinity chromatography. The DNA sequences recognized by these enzymes have been determined by analysis of the fragment patterns generated on different substrate DNAs, Lambda, T 7, pUC 19, pBR 322, PhiX 174 RFI, and Adenovirus- 2 (Ad- 2).

The results further indicated that the most conserved residues in the two active TEs, as well as adjacent regions, are also most critical to function. Furthermore, some mutations in these elements or in immediately flanking sequences affect not only the efficiency of termination, but also alter the position of termination by as much as 35 nt.

40|$|Gene {{genealogy}} in two partially isolated populations which diverged at a {{given time}} t in the past and have since been exchanging individuals at a constant rate m is studied based upon an analytic method for large t and a simulation method for any t. Particular attention is paid to the conditions under which neutral genes sampled from populations are mono-, para-, and polyphyletic in terms of coalescence (divergence) times of genes. It is shown that the probability of monophyly is high if M = 2 Nm 1, where N is the size of ancestral and descendant haploid populations, in which case most gene genealogies are likely to be concordant with the population relatedness. This probability decreases as the sample size of genes increases. On the other hand, the case where the probability of monophyly is low will be either that of M > 1 and any T or that of M < 1 and T < 1, but the clear distinction between these conditions appears very difficult to make. These results are also examined if the gene genealogy is reconstructed from nucleotide differences. It is then shown that the results based upon coalescence times remain valid if the number of nucleotide differences between any pair of genes is not much smaller than 10. To observe such large nucleotide differences in small populations and therefore infer a reliable gene genealogy, we must examine a fairly <b>long</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences...|$|E

The crystal structure of LvPCNA was refined to a resolution of 3 Å, and allowed us to determine the trimeric protein assembly and details of the interactions between PCNA and the DNA. To address the possible interaction between LvPCNA and the viral DNA polymerase, we docked a theoretical model of a PIP-box peptide from the WSSV DNA polymerase within LvPCNA crystal structure.

50|$|P1 phage {{had been}} {{discovered}} in 1951, but was little understood when Sternberg began to research the virus. He discovered the Cre-lox site-specific recombination system, in which the Cre recombinase enzyme acts at the lox recombination site to allow P1's double-stranded DNA genome to circularise after infection. Sternberg, Brian Sauer and others in his group subsequently showed that Cre-lox is a flexible recombination system which also functions in eukaryotic cells, {{and it is now}} widely used in genetic engineering. Sternberg elucidated multiple other features of the phage and its life cycle, including lytic and lysogenic replication cyles, DNA methylation and viral packaging, as well as immunity to the phage.

40|$|In metazoans, {{the nuclear}} lamina {{is thought to}} play an {{important}} role in the spatial organization of interphase chromosomes, by providing anchoring sites for large genomic segments named lamina-associated domains (LADs). Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>of</b> high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this “A/T rule” in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level. Taken together, these results reveal that the spatial organization of mammalian genomes is highly conserved and tightly linked to local nucleotide composition...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a semi-synthetic approach for preparing <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> (> 100 bp) containing internal chemical modifications and/or non-Watson–Crick structural motifs which relies on splint-free, cell-free DNA ligations and recycling of side-products by non-PCR thermal cycling. A double-stranded DNA PCR fragment containing a polylinker in its middle is digested with two restriction enzymes and a small insert (∼ 20 bp) containing the modification or non-Watson–Crick motif of interest is introduced into the middle. Incorrect products are recycled to starting materials by digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes, while the correct product is resistant to digestion since it does not contain these restriction sites. This semi-synthetic approach offers several advantages over DNA splint-mediated ligations, including fewer steps, substantially higher yields (∼ 60 % overall yield) and ease of use. This method has numerous potential applications, including the introduction of modifications such as fluorophores and cross-linking agents into DNA, controlling the shape <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> {{on a large scale}} and the study of non-sequence-specific nucleic acid–protein interactions...|$|R

50|$|Origins in {{budding yeast}} {{are defined by}} the {{autonomously}} replicating sequence (ARS), a short <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> (100-200 bp) that can initiate replication when transferred to any sequence <b>of</b> <b>DNA.</b> The ARS contains several specific sequence elements.

Single base-pair mutations in the ACS can abolish initiation activity. The ORC, a component of the initiation complex, binds the ACS in vivo throughout the cell cycle, and in vitro in an ATP dependent manner. When a few of these sequences are deleted, DNA is still copied from other intact origins, but when many are deleted, chromosome replication slows down dramatically. Still, presence of an ACS sequence is not sufficient to identify an origin of replication. Only about 30% of ACS sequences present in the genome are the sites of initiation activity.

The functional importance of the interaction was confirmed by the finding that a pol mutant defective for UL 42 binding retained polymerase activity, but did not synthesize longer DNA products in the presence of UL 42. Moreover, several association-incompetent mutants failed to complement the replication of a pol null mutant in a transient transfection assay, confirming that the Pol-UL 42 interaction is necessary for virus replication in vivo and therefore a valid target for directed drug design...|$|R

To further elucidate {{the nature of these}} forces, we report here on the spectrum of human SNPs and base pair substitutions between human and chimpanzee. The results show that the mutation rate changes exactly at the GC-content transition zone from low values in the GC-poor sequences to high values in GC-rich ones. The GC content of the GC-poor sequences can be explained by a bias in favor of GC > AT mutations, whereas the GC content of the GC-rich segment may result from a fixation bias in favor of AT > GC substitutions.

The most diverse is the DinB family that is found in all three kingdoms of life. Searches of the complete genome of the crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus P 2 reveal that it possesses a DinB homolog that has been termed DNA polymerase IV (Dpo 4). We have overproduced and purified native Dpo 4 protein and report here its enzymatic characterization. Dpo 4 is thermostable, but can also synthesize DNA at 37 °C. Under these conditions, the enzyme exhibits misinsertion fidelities in the range of 8 × 10 – 3 to 3 × 10 – 4. Dpo 4 is distributive but at high enzyme to template ratios can synthesize <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> and can substitute for Taq polymerase in PCR. On damaged DNA templates, Dpo 4 can facilitate translesion replication of an abasic site, a cis-syn thymine–thymine dimer, as well as acetyl aminofluorene adducted- and cisplatinated-guanine residues.

To gain insight into the mechanism by which Arabidopsis ROS 1 recognizes and excises 5 -meC, we have identified those protein regions that are required for efficient DNA binding and catalysis. We have found that a short N-terminal lysine-rich domain conserved in members of the ROS 1 /DME family mediates strong methylation-independent binding of ROS 1 to DNA and is required for efficient activity on 5 -meC·G, but not for T·G processing. Removal of this domain does not significantly affect 5 -meC excision from short molecules, but strongly decreases ROS 1 activity on long DNA substrates. This region is not required for product binding and {{is not involved in}} the distributive behavior of the enzyme on substrates containing multiple 5 -meC residues. Altogether, our results suggest that methylation-independent DNA binding allows ROS 1 to perform a highly redundant search for efficient excision of a nondamaged, correctly paired base such as 5 -meC in <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>DNA.</b> These findings may have implications for understanding the evolution of structure and target specificity in DNA glycosylases...|$|R

We have systematically compared their activities in order to gain insights into the roles of the p 12 and p 68 subunits, as well as their responses to PCNA. The relative specific activities (apparent k(cat)) of the Pol δ holoenzyme, core+p 68, core+p 12 and p 125 /p 50 core were 100, 109, 40, and 29.

The sums of their lengths indicated that the chromosome consists of about 8 Mb <b>of</b> <b>DNA,</b> some 75 % more than that of Escherichia coli K- 12. A physical map of the chromosome was constructed for AseI and DraI, using single and double digests, linking clones, cross-hybridization of restriction fragments, and locations of genetically mapped genes, insertion sequences, prophages, and the integrated SCP 1 and SLP 1 plasmids on the physical map. The physical map was aligned with the previously established genetic map, revealing that the two long opposite quadrants of the genetic map that are almost devoid of markers (the silent regions at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock) are indeed physically long rather than being hot spots for genetic exchange.

The present results support the existence of a wide (but not total) communality in LD patterns in human populations from different continental regions, despite differences in their demographic histories, as population factors seem to be less relevant compared with genomic forces in shaping the patterns of LD.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{thermodynamic}} and dynamic behaviors of twist-induced denaturation bubbles in a <b>long,</b> <b>stretched</b> random sequence <b>of</b> <b>DNA.</b> The small bubbles associated with weak twist are delocalized. Above a threshold torque, the bubbles of several tens of bases or larger become preferentially localized to AT-rich segments. In the localized regime, the bubbles exhibit “aging” and move around subdiffusively with continuously varying dynamic exponents. These properties are derived by using results of large-deviation theory together with scaling arguments and are verified by Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
40|$|Many recent {{advances}} in biology and medicine have resulted from DNA sequence alignment algorithms and technology. Traditional approaches for the matching <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences are based either on global alignment schemes or heuristic schemes that seek to approximate global alignment algorithms while providing higher computational efficiency. This report describes an approach using the mathematical operation of cross-correlation to compare sequences. It can be implemented using the fast fourier transform for computational efficiency. The algorithm is summarized and sample applications are given. These include gene sequence alignment in <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> genomic <b>DNA,</b> finding sequence similarity in distantly related organisms, demonstrating sequence similarity {{in the presence of}} massive (approximately 90 %) random point mutations, comparing sequences related by internal rearrangements (tandem repeats) within a gene, and investigating fusion proteins. Application to RNA and protein sequence alignment is also discussed. The method is efficient, sensitive, and robust, being able to find sequence similarities where other alignment algorithms may perform poorly...|$|R
40|$|Metazoan gene {{expression}} is controlled through the action <b>of</b> <b>long</b> <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> noncoding <b>DNA</b> that contain enhancers-shorter sequences responsible for controlling a single {{aspect of a}} gene's expression pattern. Models built on thermodynamics have shown how enhancers interpret protein concentration {{in order to determine}} specific levels of {{gene expression}}, but the emergent regulatory logic of a complete regulatory locus shows qualitative and quantitative differences from isolated enhancers. Such differences may arise from steric competition limiting the quantity <b>of</b> <b>DNA</b> that can simultaneously influence the transcription machinery. We incorporated this competition into a mechanistic model of gene regulation, generated efficient algorithms for this computation, and applied it to the regulation of Drosophila even-skipped (eve). This model finds the location of enhancers and identifies which factors control the boundaries of eve expression. This model predicts a new enhancer that, when assayed in vivo, drives expression in a non-eve pattern. Incorporation of chromatin accessibility eliminates this inconsistency...|$|R
