In order {{to study the}} effect of the filling caves in the edge of loess tableland on loess slope stability, the slope stability of sliding from the caves was calculated in irrigation when caves were filled with compacted soil, <b>lime</b> <b>soil,</b> lime-ash soil and non-filled. The results show when caves are filled with <b>lime</b> <b>soil</b> the slope stability is the highest. The effects of variability of the physical and mechanical property indexes of caver filler on loess slope stability were researched further. The results show that (1) the variation coefficients of unit weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler ‚Äúlime soil ‚Äù have small effect on the average value of safety reserve, but have big effect on the standard deviation of safety reserve, which explains that the design risks increase while the variation coefficient increasing. (2) with the increase of variation coefficients of unit weigh and the shear strength indexes of cave filler the failure probability increases. Especially when variation coefficient is bigger than 0. 3, the failure probability of loess slope is very sensitive to variation coefficient. (3) the effect of correlation coefficient among unit weight and the shear strength indexes of cave filler on failure probability increases with the variation coefficient increasing. It is very important to guarantee filling project. Good quality of filling construction will decrease the variability of cave filler, heighten the stability of loess slope, and decrease the occurrence of loess disasters...|$|E

The results indicated that wheat straw treated with SH agent is suitable for use as a reinforced material owing to its higher corrosion resistance, tensile force and elongation. Additionally, reinforcement with wheat straw and lime was found to {{have a positive effect on}} the mechanical properties of soil.

Portland cement and lime represent {{the most commonly used}} stabilisers for stabilised soil products. The mechanism of strength development in cement and <b>lime</b> stabilised <b>soils</b> is distinctly different. The paper presents results of scientific investigations pertaining to the status of clay minerals in the 28 day cured cement and <b>lime</b> stabilised <b>soil</b> compacts. XRD, SEM imaging, grain size distribution and Atterberg's limits of the ground stabilised soil products and the natural soil were determined. Results reveal that clay minerals can be retrieved from cement stabilised soil products, whereas in <b>lime</b> stabilised <b>soil</b> products clay minerals get consumed in the lime-clay reactions and negligible percentage of clay minerals are left in the stabilised soil compacts. The results of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that cement stabilisation is superior to lime stabilisation in retrieving the clay minerals from the stabilised soil compacts.
