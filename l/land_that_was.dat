5|$|South of Moose on the Moose–Wilson Road, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve Center {{is located}} on <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> privately owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller and is {{situated}} on Phelps Lake. Donated to Grand Teton National Park and {{opened to the public}} in 2008, the property was once part of the JY Ranch, the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole. At Jenny Lake, the Jenny Lake Visitor Center is open from mid-May to mid-September. This visitor center is within the Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District and is the same structure photographer Harrison Crandall had constructed as an art studio in the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site {{would have resulted in}} a plot of state <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E

5|$|As {{the houses}} in the Ghetto age, and {{as the number of}} {{students}} wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{design on}} {{the first stage of}} the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the {{northern}} edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey Bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Molonglo River {{flowed through}} the flood basin, {{with only a}} small {{fraction}} of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|The Basilica of Saint Mary was {{constructed}} between 1907 and 1915 on <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> formerly a farm, then a zoological garden. Archbishop John Ireland supervised {{the planning of}} the church, originally named the Pro-Cathedral of Minneapolis, along with the Cathedral of St. Paul in Saint Paul. He chose architect Emmanuel Masqueray, who was trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The first Mass was held on May 31, 1914. Church leaders desired to build the finest altar in America, handcrafted of the finest marble they could afford. It was elevated {{to the rank of}} basilica and became the first basilica in the United States in 1926. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as one of the area's finest examples of Beaux-Arts architecture.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Plains of Abraham, {{also known}} as the Battle of Quebec (Bataille des Plaines d'Abraham, or Première bataille de Québec in French), was a pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (referred to as the French and Indian War in the United States). The battle, which began on 13 September 1759, was fought by the British Army and Navy against the French Army on a plateau just outside the walls of Quebec City, on <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} owned by a farmer named Abraham Martin, hence the name of the battle. The battle involved fewer than 10,000 troops between both sides, but proved to be a deciding moment in the conflict between France and Britain over the fate of New France, influencing the later creation of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} near Woolwich was under {{construction}} by 1921, as it ran on open <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> easy to purchase, but {{plans for the}} remainder of the route had not yet been decided and there were delays due to compulsory purchasing of properties. In 1925, The Times announced a replacement bridge for the Woolwich Ferry was planned as part of the South Circular project to tie in with the East Ham and Barking Bypass (now the A13). A significant amount of new housing had been built along the route of the South Circular since the original 1903 plans, and building costs had risen because of labour and because of further demolition required. In 1927, the Governors of Dulwich College formally objected to the road as it would put the Memorial Library right next to a main road and remove part of the college green.|$|E

5|$|The terrain {{over which}} the two brigades were to advance was {{generally}} steep with the track having been cut along a high spur line that dropped on either side into deep ravines that were covered by kunai grass interspersed with areas of thick jungle. North of Bonga, the ground was markedly different, with the track having been pushed through flat swamp <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> punctuated by many deep creeks; vegetation in the area was mainly thick secondary growth, although to the west, in the steep hills, kunai grass was predominate. As {{a result of the}} harsh conditions and terrain, as the Australian advance continued it was increasingly hampered by vehicle break downs and fatigue amongst their crews. Resupply was also a problem for the Australians and consequently a lack of spare parts developed. This meant that a number of jeeps became unserviceable and some of the Matilda tanks were unable to advance for some time while their crews waited for parts to be brought up.|$|E
5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural sector that was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{occurred}} on Lady Day 1644, when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels, and {{broke through the}} walls of the New Salt Channel. The Commissioners authorised {{the construction of a new}} sea sluice at Kent Wall, and work began in May 1646, but in September, they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead. The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted, in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel, and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage. The Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore deteriorated, and failed in 1650. A new sluice with three channels was built in 1669. The financial burden on the Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge, as they had to pay rent on all <b>land</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not available to its original owners, and so in 1671, an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels. Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley, and was largely completed by 1684. The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother, which was built along the southern edge of the valley. It was called the Craven Channel, and ended at Craven Sluices.|$|E
