25|$|In Japan {{much of the}} Chinese type is apparent. The native carver is fond of massing foliage {{without the}} stalk to lead him. He appears to put in his foliage, fruit and flowers first and then to {{indicate}} a stalk here and there, thus reversing {{the order of the}} Western method. Such a treatment, especially when birds and beasts are introduced, has the highest decorative effect. But, as such close treatment is bound to do, it depends for success to some extent upon its scheme of color. A <b>long</b> <b>panel</b> in the Victoria and Albert Museum, depicting merchants with their packhorse, strongly resembles in its grouping and treatment Gothic work of the 15th century, as for example the panel of St Hubert in the museum at Chftlons. The strength and character of Japanese figure work is quite equal to the best Gothic sculpture of the 15th century.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} I often {{lie in bed}} and watch the sunrise. The lake lies dim and milky, the {{mountains}} are dark blue at the back, while over them the sky gushes and glistens with light. At a certain place on the mountain ridge the light burns gold, seems to fuse a little groove on the hill's rim. It fuses and fuses at this point, till {{of a sudden it}} comes, the intense, molten, living light. The mountains melt suddenly, the light steps down, there is a glitter, a spangle, a clutch of spangles, a great unbearable sun-track flashing across the milky lake, and the light falls on my face. Then, looking aside, I hear the little slotting noise which tells me they are opening the lemon gardens, a <b>long</b> <b>panel</b> here and there, a long slot of darkness at irregular intervals between the brown wood and the glass stripes.|$|E

Comprised of six 11 metre <b>long</b> <b>panels</b> of hand woven fabric, to which will be added a further seven panels, each 1.5 metres. The six <b>long</b> <b>panels</b> depict scenes from the first six series. As season 7 is aired weekly (in 2017) the tapestry will grow an extra 1.5m to reflect that weeks episode.|$|R
2500|$|On small gable roofs, thermal {{movement}} is relatively minor and usually {{is not an}} issue. On wide-span buildings over 60meters and when <b>long</b> <b>panels</b> are used, an allowance for thermal expansion may be necessary. This enables the roof to [...] "float" [...] over supporting substructures while remaining secure.|$|R
60|$|This is {{only the}} <b>long</b> <b>panel.</b> Now the jury has to be formed. To twenty names the {{prisoner}} is entitled to object from caprice, and Mr. O'Laugher is not the man to give {{up one of the}} twenty. Then he can object to as many more as he chooses, on showing cause, and you may be sure Mr. O'Laugher has a great many causes to show. One man has lived near young Macdermot all his life, has been a friend of his, must have formed an opinion on the case, and is therefore not fit: another man has been his enemy, and is therefore not fit; a third man used to drive with Captain Ussher twice a week; a fourth lived in Mohill; a fifth at Drumsna; a sixth did not live in the county at all; a seventh had not a house of his own, and so on. Why, it appeared there was not a proper juror in the county! On all these objections Mr. O'Laugher was beaten; and as he was beaten on each, he indefatigably prepared for the next.|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} {{that has to be}} done is to call over the <b>long</b> <b>panel,</b> and the names of all {{competent}} persons in the county, from whom the jury is to be selected. But even preparatory to this, the counsel for the defence commence their fight. Mr. O'Laugher, who, as the phrase goes, is with Mr. O'Malley, begins by declaring that the list from which the names are read is an illegal list--a foolish, useless, unauthoritative list--nothing but balderdash, moonshine, and waste paper--all empty sounds, and consisting of a string of names as little to the purpose in the present case as a regimental roll-call. The sub-sheriff, who with infinite clerkly care, and much sub-shrieval experience, has made out the list, opens wide his disturbed ears, and begins to feel somewhat uncomfortable. Mr. O'Laugher goes on to declare that the present list, instead of being one properly, legally, and expressly drawn out for March 183--, is only a copy of the one in use during the summer assizes in the last year, and assures the judge with much indignant emphasis, that he cannot allow his client to submit to the injustice of receiving a verdict from a jury composed under such atrocious circumstances.|$|E

40|$|This article reviews recent {{advances}} in fixed effect estimation of panel data models for <b>long</b> <b>panels,</b> where the number of time periods is relatively large. We focus on semiparametric models with unobserved individual and time effects, where {{the distribution of the}} outcome variable conditional on covariates and unobserved effects is specified parametrically, while the distribution of the unobserved effects is left unrestricted. Compared to existing reviews on <b>long</b> <b>panels</b> (Arellano and Hahn 2007; a section in Arellano and Bonhomme 2011) we discuss models with both individual and time effects, split-panel Jackknife bias corrections, unbalanced panels, distribution and quantile effects, and other extensions. Understanding and correcting the incidental parameter bias caused by the estimation of many fixed effects is our main focus, and the unifying theme is that the order of this bias is given by the simple formula p/n for all models discussed, with p the number of estimated parameters and n the total sample size.

Four angels caught the blood which poured from the wounds. The head of the Saviour is still preserved, as are the busts of the saints, and several angels with golden chalices. The background is also golden. Four scenes chosen from sacred history were reproduced on the sides.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{estimate}} panel data models with endogenous regressors and nonadditive unobserved individual heterogeneity including, for example, linear and nonlinear models where all the parameters can vary across individuals. The quantities of interest are means, variances, and other moments of the individual parameters. Since estimates of these quantities based on individual by individual GMM estimation can be severely biased due to the incidental parameter problem, we develop bias corrections that give more accurate estimates in moderately <b>long</b> <b>panels.</b> These corrections, derived from large-T expansions of the finite-sample bias of fixed effects GMM estimators, reduce the order of the bias from O(T âˆ’ 1) to O(T âˆ’ 2) and center the asymptotic distributions at the true values in moderately <b>long</b> <b>panels</b> under asymptotic sequences where n = o(T 3). An empirical example on cigarette demand based on Becker, Grossman and Murphy (1994) shows significant heterogeneity in the price effect across U. S. states.

5000|$|The {{character}} was originally created for a syndicated daily comic strip by writer Stan Lee and artist Dan DeCarlo.

I liked that idea very much, so when Harold Anderson, the head of Publishers Syndicate, {{asked me to do}} a strip, I came up with Barney's Beat, which was about a New York City cop and all the characters on his patrol who he'd meet every day and there would be a gag. I did some samples with Dan DeCarlo, and I thought it was wonderful. Harold said it was too [...] "big city-ish" [...] and they're not going to care for it in the small towns because they don't have cops on a beat out there. He wanted something that would appeal to the hinterland, something bucolic. He said, [...] "You know what I want, Stan? I want a mailman! A friendly little mailman in a small town." [...] I don't remember if I came up with the name Lumpkin or he did, but I hated it. I think I came up with the name as a joke and he said, [...] "Yeah, that's it! Good idea!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Her {{first piece}} at the Royal Academy of Arts was a {{terracotta}} panel:"David playing before Saul" [...] (1885). From that date she had works at R.A. Exhibitions in most years up until 1918. By 1893 she was sufficiently {{well known to}} be commissioned to provide four plaster relief figures for spandrels in the Women's Building of the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Each polychrome panel was nearly six feet tall, and represented Faith, Hope, Charity and Heavenly Wisdom. As well as exhibition pieces, she had a more commercial strand to her art, becoming a leading designer for the Della Robbia Pottery from 1896 until its closure in 1906. This led to more popular domestic works featuring children, flowers and the sea. These small panels [...] "were primarily designed to be executed at low cost and repeated if desired, {{so that they could}} be used by others than the very rich" [...] However, major architectural commissions continued, including large figures of Faith, Hope and Charity for Morley Town Hall, Leeds (since lost), a 20' <b>long</b> <b>panel</b> for Rotherhithe Town Hall (destroyed by wartime bombing), and a memorial executed in cement at St Mary's, Bolton-on-Swale. Her association with the Garrett circle, dating back to childhood, led to her spandrels from Chicago being installed in the dining room of Chenies Stree Ladies' Residential Chambers and later to the marble memorial to the mother of Elizabeth Garrett Anderson in Aldeburgh parish church. Earlier, in 1894, another Garrett associate, Octavia Hill, had commissioned bas-reliefs by Rope for the drawing room of the Women's University Settlement in Nelson Square, Blackfriars.|$|E

The <b>long</b> <b>panel</b> fosters two improvements over previous research. First, as state hospital cost levels may affect states' incentive to regulate, fixed effect estimators alleviate omitted variable bias derived from the states' regulatory discretion. Second, the <b>long</b> <b>panel</b> permits the estimation of many different regulatory program effects, but also facilitates the analysis of potential regulatory program interaction. The empirical results suggest that previous studies have exaggerated regulatory cost savings: although some interaction effects are indicated, hospital costs appear unresponsive to most regulatory programs.

The platform was easier to locate when it was placed near the middle of a long rather than a short panel. This effect was found when the <b>long</b> <b>panels</b> were twice (Experiments 2 â€“ 4) or four times the length of the short panels (Experiment 4). Experiment 5 demonstrated that rats can solve a discrimination between panels of length 15 and 45 cm more readily than when they are 70 and 100 cm. The results are consistent with the claim that generalization gradients based on stimulus magnitude are steeper for stimuli that are weaker rather than stronger than the stimulus used for the original training...|$|R
