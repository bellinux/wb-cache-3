5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> of the person he was looking at, and yet somehow could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 1492, {{after five}} years of war, the Moorish emirate in Spain came to an end with the Catholic Monarchs' capture of Granada. The Jews of Gibraltar were, like those {{elsewhere}} in the kingdom, expelled from Spain by order of the monarchs in March that year. Gibraltar was used by Medina Sidonia as a base for the Spanish capture of Melilla in North Africa in 1497. Two years later the Muslims of Granada were ordered to convert to Christianity or <b>leave.</b> <b>Those</b> that did not convert left for North Africa, some of them travelling via Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{casualties}} of the Army of the North were not substantial, {{it was left}} demoralized and disbanded. Goyeneche pursued the fleeing patriots, and captured Huaqui after his victory. The inhabitants of Upper Peru welcomed the royalists back, so the army had to quickly <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> provinces. However, the resistance of Cochabamba prevented the royalists from proceeding to Buenos Aires. Castelli moved to the post of Quirbe, and received orders to return to Buenos Aires for trial. However, {{by the time he}} was notified, new orders had been issued: Castelli should be confined at Catamarca, while Saavedra himself took charge of the Army of the North. Saavedra was deposed as soon as he left Buenos Aires, and was confined to San Juan. The First Triumvirate, which had commenced governing by then, required Castelli to return.|$|E

25|$|A {{mental health}} care {{navigator}} is an individual who assists patients and families to find appropriate {{mental health care}}givers, facilities and services. Individuals who are care navigators are often also trained therapists and doctors. The need for mental health care navigators arises from the fragmentation of the mental health industry, which can often <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> in need with more questions than answers. Care navigators work closely with patients through discussion and collaboration to provide information on options and referrals to healthcare professionals, facilities, and organizations specializing in the patients’ needs. The difference between other mental health professionals and a care navigator is that a care navigator provides information and directs a patient to the best help rather than offering diagnosis, prescription of medications or treatment.|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Guardian, Brian Moylan {{described}} Going Clear as [...] "entertaining and dismaying viewing" [...] {{in which}} [...] "the story of Scientology, {{with all its}} strange players, emerges as comedy, rather than horror," [...] but criticised its reliance on {{a small group of}} defectors and the lack of any involvement by the church. He felt that this made the film [...] "a bit one-sided" [...] and that it was [...] "easy to be skeptical about some of the more outlandish claims made by former members." [...] Sasha Bronner of the Huffington Post called the film a [...] "shocking and eye-opening" [...] work that would <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> who did not know much about Scientology [...] "spellbound." [...] The BBC's Owen Gleiberman praised it as [...] "the most exciting – and disturbing – work of cinematic non-fiction in a long time" [...] and awarded Going Clear five stars, describing it as having [...] "the scary intensity of a thriller." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2015, Feige {{confirmed}} that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen, though the film would not address Pym and van Dyne's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics, saying, [...] "We hint at a temper {{in a way that}} people who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [...] character,' but not {{in a way that would}} ever indicate [...]" [...] Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit sequence [...] "that may tie into the other films." [...] Feige revealed the post-credit sequence was footage shot by Anthony and Joe Russo for , saying the clip would be seen in that film, though it may be [...] "different takes...different angles." [...] On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of Ant-Man was officially complete. In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that Anthony Mackie would appear in the film as Sam Wilson / Falcon. Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, respectively. Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War. Also in the month, Reed revealed that the quantum realm in the film was the MCU's version of the microverse, which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the California Institute of Technology, to [...] "inject elements of modern physics into the script". Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, [...] "...But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> particles out there." [...] For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, with the credits [...] "intricately connected to the film's overall narrative." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since Doyle {{had made}} the {{suggestion}} {{in response to the}} board's late resurrection of its claim to non-personhood, Rehnquist dealt with that. Had the board properly preserved the issue, he noted, the Court would have been obliged to decide it. But it had not, and since Doyle's claim to federal-question jurisdiction seemed like a legitimate constitutional issue and not one claimed {{for the sole purpose of}} obtaining federal jurisdiction, [...] "we <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> questions for another day, and assume, without deciding, that the respondent could sue under § 1331 without regard to the limitations imposed by 42 U.S.C. § 1983." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the Balkan Wars, the Kingdom of Serbia {{achieved}} the expansion towards the south, but there was a mixed reaction to the events, for the reason that the promises of lands gaining access to the Adriatic Sea were not fulfilled. Instead, Serbia received the territories of Vardar Macedonia that was intended {{to become part of the}} Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Serbian Army had to <b>leave</b> <b>those</b> coastal territories that would become part of the newly formed Principality of Albania. [...] This event, together with the Austro-Hungarian Annexation of Bosnia, frustrated the majority of Serbian politicians, since there was still a large number of Serbs remaining out of the Kingdom.|$|E
