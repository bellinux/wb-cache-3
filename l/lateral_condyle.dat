25|$|Three of the {{anterior}} muscles are extensors. From its origin on the lateral {{surface of the}} tibia and the interosseus membrane, the three-sided belly of the tibialis anterior extends down below the superior and inferior extensor retinacula to its insertion on the plantar side of the medial cuneiform bone and the first metatarsal bone. In the non-weight-bearing leg, {{the anterior}} tibialis dorsal flexes the foot and lifts the medial edge of the foot. In the weight-bearing leg, it pulls the leg towards the foot. The extensor digitorum longus has a wide origin stretching from the <b>lateral</b> <b>condyle</b> of the tibia down along the anterior side of the fibula, and the interosseus membrane. At the ankle, the tendon divides into four that stretch across the foot to the dorsal aponeuroses of the last phalanges of the four lateral toes. In the non-weight-bearing leg, the muscle extends the digits and dorsiflexes the foot, and in the weight-bearing leg acts similar to the tibialis anterior. The extensor hallucis longus has its origin on the fibula and the interosseus membrane between the two other extensors and is, similarly to the extensor digitorum, is inserted on the last phalanx of big toe ("hallux"). The muscle dorsiflexes the hallux, and acts similar to the tibialis anterior in the weight-bearing leg.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Osteochondritis dissecans of the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> is {{relatively}} rare, {{and it is}} reported to often be combined with a discoid lateral meniscus. Given the potential for healing, conservative management is indicated for stable osteochondritis dissecans in patients who are skeletally immature. However, patients with osteochondritis dissecans of the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> combined with a discoid lateral meniscus often have persistent symptoms despite conservative management. Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} seven-year-old Korean girl who had osteochondritis dissecans of the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> combined with a discoid lateral meniscus, which healed after meniscoplasty for the symptomatic lateral discoid meniscus without surgical intervention for the osteochondritis dissecans. In addition, healing of the osteochondritis dissecans lesion was confirmed by an MRI scan five months after the operation. Conclusions Meniscoplasty can be recommended for symptomatic stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans of the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> combined with a discoid lateral meniscus when conservative treatment fails. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the biomechanical significance of bone bruises {{in patients with}} patella dislocation. Thirty-four patients with acute dislocation of the patella were studied. Redislocations were excluded. There were 11 men and 20 women {{with a mean age}} of 18 years at the time of injury. Bone bruises were noted at the periphery of the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> in 22 patients (65 %) and in 10 cases (29 %) at the medial patellar facet. The sulcus angle in patients with bone bruises at the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> was significantly greater and tibiofemoral rotation at the knee was significantly smaller than in patients without bone bruises. In knees with small tibiofemoral rotation, a large lateral displacement force applied into the knee joint is needed to displace the patella. The flat femoral trochlea groove, however, can not reduce the force, resulting in hard impaction between the medial patella facet and the <b>lateral</b> femoral <b>condyle</b> producing bone bruises...|$|R
