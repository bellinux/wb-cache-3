500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he did not know why certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t {{seemed to me to be}} the kind of thing a woman <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E

If he was stranded here for years, some part of this place would rub off on him. No large part, I knew. [...] The place, the time would either kill him outright or mark him somehow. I didn’t like either possibility." [...] (Kindred, p.77) ...|$|E
2500|$|Both of the Fitzgeralds {{had their}} own radio {{programs}} on WOR when Pegeen {{had the idea that}} it might be interesting to broadcast a family's talk at the breakfast table. [...] WOR officials initially believed a show <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> fail. The program was originally broadcast from the WOR studios, but Pegeen's illness brought about the temporary need to broadcast the show from the Fitzgerald's apartment. After the couple became the owners of their program, they elected to continue broadcasting from their home.|$|E

The character text {{is no different}} in GC and standard Chinese, apart from 裏 lǐ, which in any case has now been substituted with Chao's choice of 里 on the Mainland. Note that simplified characters <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> affect all of Chao's proposal, so that 對 below would become 对, etc. The only other difference is 他 tā for 'her', which may differ from contemporary written Chinese 她, but which follows Classical usage.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Conservative {{government}} faced a possible defeat {{by the opposition}} over the Conservatives economic update, a [...] "Conservatives for Prentice" [...] website emerged, gaining {{a place on the}} Blogging Tories blogroll. A posting from a person claiming to be David Higginbottom, Prentice's campaign manager in the last election, said, [...] "It is unfortunate that at a time when Conservatives need to be working together to prevent what is a desperate power play by the opposition to seize control of our democratically elected government, that a site <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be created." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “For educators, The Open Source Movement allowed {{access to}} {{software}} {{that could be}} used in teaching students how to apply the theories they were learning”. With open networks and software, teachers are able to share lessons, lectures, and other course materials within a community. OpenTechComm is a program that is dedicated to “open access, open use, and open edits- text book or pedagogical resource that teachers of technical and professional communication courses at every level can rely on to craft free offerings to their students.” As stated earlier, access to programs <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be much more cost efficient for educational departments.|$|E

2500|$|Pangolins {{have also}} been {{reported}} to roll away from danger by self-powered methods. Witnessed by a lion researcher [...] in the Serengeti in Africa, a group of lions surrounded a pangolin, but could not get purchase on it when it rolled into a ball, and so the lions sat around it waiting and dozing. Surrounded by lions, it would unroll itself slightly and give itself a push to roll some distance, until by doing this multiple times it could get {{far enough away from}} the lions to be safe. Moving <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> allow a pangolin to cover distance while still remaining in a protective armoured ball.|$|E
2500|$|Ethel Skinner was {{the second}} out of the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith (the first to be created was Lou Beale). Ethel {{was based on an}} elderly woman that Smith had encountered in a pub in Hackney. She had bright ginger hair, a face plied with make-up, she laughed a lot and was obviously [...] "the life and soul of the party". She also had a little dog, Willie, who she dressed in a red ribbon, tied in a neat bow on its head. Smith felt that a character <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be an excellent inclusion to the show. [...] Ethel's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, [...]|$|E
2500|$|Hudlin knew {{immediately}} {{that he wanted}} Halle Berry {{for the role of}} Angela after she came in and did the reading, and was nervous that Murphy wouldn't like her. Berry had appeared in a couple of films prior to being cast in Boomerang. However, after Berry performed her screen test, Murphy told Hudlin [...] "well, that's it. There's no need to see the other two actresses because she's the part." [...] Executives at Paramount Pictures were nervous about Robin Givens being cast in such {{a major role in the}} film, as she was disliked by many in the general public at the time because of her past relationship with Mike Tyson. Hudlin however, [...] "thought that actually made her perfect for the role, that she was this formidable person, and a match for Eddie Murphy, who also had an increpid reputation as a ladies' man. So, I wanted the audience to feel <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be a fair fight." ...|$|E

2500|$|To the {{backdrop}} of the June 1975 Italian elections, Fo wrote Il Fanfani rapito (Fanfani Kidnapped)—a reference to Amintore Fanfani. Also in June 1975, Fo, Rame {{and other members of the}} company went to China—Fo later used his recollections of the trip in the monologue La storia della tigre (The Tale of a Tiger), with which he toured around Italy in 1978. The same year (1975) Fo was nominated for the Nobel Prize for the first time. He thought the idea absurd: [...] "I have become famous for my aversion to figures of reverence and genuflections of any kind. This Nobel business is a real comedy. I can imagine the look on the faces of certain state officials, magistrates and politicians I know. They take great pains to shut me up and clap me in handcuffs, and the Swedes go and play a trick <b>like</b> <b>this</b> ... <b>would</b> be like acting in one of my plays." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{opposition}} was also {{supported by a}} perception by local Welsh people that a pipeline <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> not be permitted in England, raising echoes of the infamous drowning of Capel Celyn for a reservoir. Local councils such as Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council were pressured to speed up planning permission. Planning decisions were pushed through, {{as in the case}} of the Cilfrew Pressure Reduction Installation which was approved only by excluding certain protesting councillors from the vote, a process deemed illegal by a high court judge saying [...] "it is a wonder that anybody votes on anything". The result of this decision led the National Grid to declare a force majeure notice in April 2007 to avoid any responsibility for any delays in gas delivery. In June 2007 a High Court ruling meant the Brecon protest camp featuring tree houses and tunnels open since January was closed down with a number of protestors arrested and substantial local disruption to roads. In Peterstow Herefordshire, protestors forced the National Grid to choose another site that was more expensive but more environmentally friendly for their installation.|$|E
2500|$|The Mortlockese Language is an Austronesian {{language}} spoken {{primarily on the}} Mortlock islands in Micronesia. In Mortlock culture, there is a hierarchy with chiefs called samwool. When speaking to these chiefs or to anyone of higher status, one must use honorifics (in Mortlockese called kapas pwéteete or kapas amáfel) in order to convey respect. In the Mortlockese Language, {{there are only two}} levels of speaking - common language and respectful language(honorifics). While respectful language is used when speaking to people of higher status, common language is used when speaking to anyone of the same or lesser status. One example showing the difference between respectful and common language {{can be seen in the}} word sleep. The word for sleep using common language is maúr while the word for sleep using respectful language is saipash. Along with the respectful language, there are formal greetings called tiirou or fairo that are used in meetings and gatherings. In English, some examples of formal greetings would be [...] "good evening" [...] or [...] "it's a pleasure to meet you" [...] or [...] "how are you." [...] These formal greetings not only use words, but also gestures. It is the combination of the words and gestures that create the tiirou or fairo(formal greeting). In English a formal greeting <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be like saying [...] "nice to meet you" [...] while offering a handshake.|$|E
