500|$|Titan, at 5,150km diameter, is {{the second}} largest moon in the Solar System and Saturn's largest. Out of all the large moons, Titan {{is the only one}} with a dense (surface {{pressure}} of 1.5atm), cold atmosphere, primarily made of nitrogen with a small fraction of methane. The dense atmosphere frequently produces bright white convective clouds, especially over the south pole region. On June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. The surface of Titan, which is difficult to observe due to persistent atmospheric haze, shows only a few impact craters and is probably very young. It contains a pattern of light and dark regions, flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos. Some dark regions are covered by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> fields shaped by tidal winds, where sand is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. The largest lake, Kraken Mare, is larger than the Caspian Sea. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt {{to the surface of the}} moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be [...] "as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea".|$|E

With the exploitation {{and development of}} the oil-gas resources and the implementation of the desert highway and great engineering projects in the Gurbantunggut Desert the impact of human activities on the eco-environment has been increasingly significant. We compared the physical-chemical properties and vegetation community characteristics of Sandic Entisols from two artificial longitudinal dunes with a natural <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> in an area of engineering construction. Our results show that the depth of rainfall infiltration and soil moisture after rainfall for the artificial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune,</b> which lost vegetation (especially microbiological crust), is remarkably higher than the natural <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> and soil moisture on the artificial dune was subject to greater rates of evaporation. Salt concentration in the soil profile of the artificial dune is relatively uniform and reflects the homogenous environment that has resulted from mixing the soil. In comparison, Sandic Entisols usually show marked variation in salt content with depth, this was observed in the natural <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune.</b> The nutrient levels of the natural <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> are higher than that of the artificial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune,</b> which is related to the distribution, density and health of the vegetation cover. After installing checkerboards to fix the artificial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune,</b> we found that ephemeral plants rapidly colonised the checkerboard environment. However, the re-establishment of shrub and semi-shrub plants required some rehabilitation measures, such as sowing seeds. Although the pioneering vegetation lacks the diversity of the natural vegetation, it creates beneficial conditions to establish additional plant species. Thus, {{it can be seen that}} the desert vegetation and the physical and chemical properties of Sandic Entisols are greatly affected by the disturbance caused by engineering construction. However, our results show that if rehabilitation measures, such as fixing mobile sands and re-sowing seeds, are adopted during or soon after the construction period then the disturbed ecosystem still has some capacity for natural rehabilitation...|$|E

40|$|This {{electronic}} document is a “live” template. There was little research {{available on the}} relationship between soil moisture and plant root distribution in the Taklimakan Desert under drip-irrigation. The plant root distribution characteristics and soil moisture rules of Tarim Desert Highway Shelterbelt under drip-irrigation were studied by root system earth-pillar layering excavation method and neutron probe method in this paper. The results indicated that: ① The site types of different soils, root distribution was quite different. The root system mainly concentrated in the 0 - 40 cm soil layer in the hardened sand; the plant root distribution was deep in the flat sandy land and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> land, followed by clayed land, in the unit volume of earth-pillar, the root system in the flat sandy land was most, followed by flat sandy land and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> land, ② In the site type of different soils, the differences of soil moisture content was mainly caused by the differences in the level of the soil profile; ③ With the increase of plantation age, plant root system continued to grow, the soil moisture content gradually declined.

40|$|Longitudinal dunes are {{the most}} {{widespread}} dune types in the world sand seas but comprehensive study on the sand surface stability is scarce. The southern part of Gurbantu&die;nggu&die;t Desert is mainly covered by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> in which fixed and semi-fixed dunes occupy over 80 % of the total area. Systematic analysis on the climatic conditions, the soil moisture and vegetation distributions, and the sand surface activities showed that the fixed and semi-fixed dunes are in a comprehensive low-energy wind environment. Snow cover and frozen soil provide a good protection to the ground surface in winter. The temporal distribution of precipitation and corresponding variation of temperature create a favorable condition for the desert plants growth, especially for the ephemeral plants. The occurrence of effective winds for sand moving in April to June coincides with the stage of relatively wet sand surface and good vegetation cover, which effectively keep the sand surface stable at the interdune and the plinth of the dunes.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{variation}} of soil moisture {{as well as}} its regularity over the irrigation cycle at shelterbelts along the Tarim Desert Highway at different site types and different planting years. The results show that: (1) There is an obvious temporal variation of soil moisture within a typical irrigation period in shelterbelts along the Tarim Desert Highway, and the soil water storage varied linearly with the number of days after irrigation. Along the direction perpendicular to the soil top, the soil profile can be divided into four layers and each shows different dynamics of soil moisture variation, including the quickly changing layer (0 - 20 cm), the active layer (20 - 60 cm), the weakly layer (60 - 100 cm), and the regulated layer (under 100 cm). (2) Both the soil moisture and soil water content decreased gradually with the number of planting year, while the soil water deficit increased. It indicates that shelterbelts along the Tarim Desert Highway can retain the water accumulated from previous years. (3) The soil water storage of harden sand is the maximum among all types of sites.

Due to the huge <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> belt and the arid climate conditions, a big amount of sand dunes in the region moved towards the watercourses resulted in filling the watercourses and consequently decreasing the canals efficiency and enhancing the growth of aquatic weeds. Hence, the objective of this research paper is to investigate the quantity of blown sand that precipitated inside the watercourses by conducting an extensive field data measurement in a period of one year around (June 2007 – June 2008). About 20 actual cross-sections located in El-Sheikh Zayed canal, Branch 1 canal, and branch 2 canal are conducted. In addition, about 74 sand collectors and 48 sticks were fixed around the studied canals and the readings were monthly recorded. The results have shown that some reaches of the studied canals are exposed to the risks of sand dunes movements and consequently the growth of aquatic weeds and alga. The expected amounts of sand that fill in the watercourses are ranged between 150 and 4450 m 3 /year with sand depths up to 20 cm. The sticks revealed that the last reach of main canal (km 35 - km 45) and Branch 3 are the most regions exposed to active sand dunes.

40|$|Cooper Creek at Innamincka in South Australia {{is one of}} {{very few}} places where {{evidence}} of palaeoclimatic history from the Quaternary Period is preserved {{in at least three}} stratigraphic settings; fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine. The significance of this study location is enhanced firstly because here this semi-arid to arid partly tropical catchment has a drainage area of nearly 237 000 km 2 and therefore constitutes a very significant portion of the 1. 3 million km 2 Lake Eyre basin, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s largest dryland drainage system. Secondly, and very unusually for such a large river system, the flow of the Cooper at Innamincka bifurcates; north to Coongie Lakes, west towards Lake Eyre, and south down Strzelecki Creek and into the Lake Frome basin. This study attempts to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental Quaternary history of a complex system of dividing drainage. Sixty nine thermoluminescence dates and numerous stratigraphic and sedimentological analyses, including particle size, mineral content, and petrographic and scanning electron microscopy, reveal interacting depositional conditions in alluvial (channel and overbank), aeolian (source-bordering and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune)</b> and lacustrine (lunette) environments, information that provides an improved understanding of Australian Quaternary climatic and flow-regime changes in central Australia. These results point to a progressive but probably oscillating drying trend on Cooper Creek during the Mid to Late Quaternary. The oldest dated alluvium near Innamincka suggests extensive fluvial activity at about 250 ka to 230 ka (OI Stages 7 / 8), some of it well away from the existing channel. In agreement with work done by others further upstream on Cooper Creek, there appears after this to have been a period of reduced fluvial activity until extensive channels operated again along both Cooper and Strzelecki Creeks during the middle of OI Stage 6. This was followed by another probable hiatus until OI Stage 5 when significant fluvial activity was this time associated with the development of source-bordering dunes adjacent to palaeochannels on Cooper Creek, and with the formation lunettes in the Coongie Lakes region. Pronounced fluvial activity appears to have continued through to OI Stage 4, ceasing at locations other than near the existing channel of Cooper Creek by about 60 ka to 52 ka. While Cooper Creek had sufficient power to continue to slowly migrate in the vicinity of its present channel from about 55 ka until the LGM, the region was clearly significantly drier and less fluvially active from early OI Stage 3 to the present. Source-bordering dunes dating at 40 ka to 25 ka do not correspond to older adjacent palaeochannels on Cooper Creek (the youngest dating at 52 ka) and therefore suggest substantial aeolian reworking in OI Stages 3 and 2. Cooper Creek beyond the Innamincka D o m e ceased to transport any significant sand at around the L G M. Only within the flow-confining and thereby stream-power amplifying effect of the D o m e is there evidence on Cooper Creek of a final period of enhanced fluvial activity in the Early to Mid Holocene. However, it appears that Strzelecki Creek remained fluvially active even after the LGM, transporting clean channel sands at 15 ka to 10 ka. The accumulated dune ages from this study indicate a pronounced period of aeolian activity from the L G M to the present, initially with the reworking of existing source-bordering dunes but then, particularly during the Holocene, with the extension northwards of derivative longitudinal dunes. There appears to have been two stages of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> formation in the Strzelecki dunefield: 16 ka to 9 ka and 5 ka to 1 ka, probably signifying two periods of local dryness and windiness. Lacustrine lunettes were reworked from older lunettes in the Coongie Lakes region during the Holocene providing further evidence for the region as a whole becoming drier. Cooper Creek and Strzelecki Creek near Innamincka became a low-energy largely mud-transporting system from the Mid Holocene, vastly different to their Mid to Late Pleistocene precursors...|$|E
40|$|Stabilized dunes of {{the central}} Great Plains, {{especially}} the megabarchans and large barchanoid ridges of the Nebraska Sand Hills, provide dramatic evidence of late Quaternary environmental change. Episodic Holocene dune activity in this region is now well-documented, but Late Pleistocene dune mobility has remained poorly documented, despite early interpretations of the Sand Hills dunes as Pleistocene relicts. New optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from drill cores and outcrops provide evidence of Late Pleistocene dune activity at sites distributed across the central Great Plains. In addition, Late Pleistocene eolian sands deposited at 20 – 25 ka are interbedded with loess south of the Sand Hills. Several of the large dunes sampled in the Sand Hills clearly contain a substantial core of Late Pleistocene sand; thus, they had developed by the Late Pleistocene and were fully mobile at that time, although substantial sand deposition and extensive <b>longitudinal</b> <b>dune</b> construction occurred during the Holocene. Many of the Late Pleistocene OSL ages fall between 17 and 14 ka, but {{it is likely that}} these ages represent only the later part of a longer period of dune construction and migration. At several sites, significant Late Pleistocene or Holocene large-dune migration also probably occurred after the time represented by the Pleistocene OSL ages. Sedimentary structures in Late Pleistocene eolian sand and the forms of large dunes potentially constructed in the Late Pleistocene both indicate sand transport dominated by northerly to westerly winds, consistent with Late Pleistocene loess transport directions. Numerical modeling of the climate of the Last Glacial Maximum has often yielded mean monthly surface winds southwest of the Laurentide Ice Sheet that are consistent with this geologic evidence, despite strengthened anticyclonic circulation over the ice sheet. Mobility of large dunes during the Late Pleistocene on the central Great Plains may have been the result of cold, short growing seasons with relatively low precipitation and low atmospheric CO 2 that increased plant moisture stress, limiting the ability of vegetation to stabilize active dune sand. The apparent coexistence of large mobile dunes with boreal forest taxa suggests a Late Pleistocene environment with few modern analogs...|$|E
