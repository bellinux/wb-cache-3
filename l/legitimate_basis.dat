40|$|In recent years, {{the fate}} of federal {{statutes}} has increasingly turned on the contents of their formal legislative records. The Supreme Court has shown a new willingness to find statutes unconstitutional because their legislative records {{do not support the}} factual judgments that justify congressional action. In this Article, Professors Bryant and Simeone trace the development of the trend toward increased judicial scrutiny of legislative records in recent Supreme Court rulings on the constitutionality of federal statutes. They then critique the Court 2 ̆ 7 s new approach, arguing that it is not only inconsistent with precedent, but also fundamentally ill advised, most importantly because it constitutes a constitutionally suspect intrusion on congressional investigative and legislative procedures. Finally the authors consider whether heightened judicial review of the legislative records of federal statutes is a defensible means of preventing Congress from overstepping the constitutional bounds of its authority. Concluding that this is an inappropriate way to restrain Congress, the authors briefly discuss alternative methods of ensuring that congressional action has a <b>legitimate</b> constitutional <b>basis...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{constitutes a}} critical examination of Swedish spatial planning for safety. Spatial planning for safety {{rests on a}} number of assumptions about the desired order of the world. These assumptions appear as given and unproblematic, making the formulation of alternatives appear unnecessary. This dissertation provides an account of how, and on what basis a spatial planning problem such as ‘fear and insecurity’ is formulated and acted upon. It is an account of how and what conceptions of knowledge operate to legitimise ideological representations of spatial planning problems. And furthermore, what these ideological representations of spatial planning problems substantially entail, so as to allow for a political spatial planning practice that formulates and deliberates alternatives. This is carried out by analysing assumptions of public life and knowledge within Swedish spatial planning for safety.   This dissertation finds that Swedish spatial planning for safety constitutes ‘certainty’ as a hegemonic criterion for participating in public life, which operates to limit the articulation of alternative discourses in spatial planning for safety. The desired for safe public life is organised based on visual certainty, where the urban fabric should be configured in such ways as to allow for stereotypical visual identifications of one another. Such a public life reflects an individualised practice, where perceptions of fear should be governed by individuals themselves, by independently assessing situations and environments in terms of risks. This individualised conduct is coupled with the fostering of active subjects, which encompasses being engaged in the local residential areas as well as in one another. Such substantial content of ‘planning for safety’ brings about tensions in terms of its ideological <b>legitimating</b> <b>basis,</b> by moving from principles of ‘rights’, where the individual constitutes the first ethical planning subject, to unitary principles of ‘collective values’, in which the ‘community’ constitutes the first ethical planning subject. These presuppositions are further enabled through the ways in which knowledge is conceptualised in spatial planning. This dissertation argues that a hegemonic instrumental emphasis on knowledge in spatial planning prevails. Having such a hegemonic emphasis on knowledge has the implication that even though spatial planning adopts different assumptions, or moves between alternative assumptions of knowledge, the knowledge becomes meaningful only in its instrumental implementation. The instrumental emphasis on knowledge should be regarded in light of the rational and goal-oriented nature of project-based planning, which constitutes a logic that constrains the emphasis on knowledge in spatial planning. This dissertation argues further that if spatial planning should be considered a political practice that debates its goals and values, a politicisation of the emphasis on knowledge in spatial planning is imperative...|$|R

While this formalisation in the Lisbon Treaty of the Council as a democratic actor is to be welcomed as {{an important step in}} a longer-standing process, it remains unclear which normative requirements result from it.

It discerns the role of transparency in two competing conceptions at the Council level, representing a narrow, and a broad perspective on democracy. It is argued that below a minimal threshold of transparency, Council democracy cannot function. Above this threshold, in turn, transparency is likely to make Council democracy function better...|$|R

40|$|The swedish {{law against}} female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) prohibits procedures that removes {{parts of the}} female genitalia and thereby makes permanent changes in the body. The problem with {{the wording of the}} law is that it may also apply to the western phenomenon cosmetic genital surgery. This paper therefore examines if cosmetic genital surgery should be covered by the swedish law against FGM, by making a critical comparing analysis. The paper begins with comparing FGM with cosmetic genital surgery to prove that there are more similarities than differences between the procedures. By using the theoretical perspectives universalism and postcolonialism, the paper then examines why, particularly in the West, there is a different approach to FGM than to cosmetic genital surgery, regardless of the similarities of the procedures. Further the paper also examines consent and why consent to FGM is seen as illegitimate while consent to cosmetic genital surgery is seen as <b>legitimate.</b> On <b>basis</b> of the critical comparing analysis the paper then argues: that the procedures cosmetic genital surgery and FGM are very much alike; that cosmetic genital surgery is accepted over FGM because it is more familiar in the West and; that consent should be as illegitimate when given to cosmetic genital surgery as when given to FGM. Thus the conclusion of the paper is that cosmetic genital surgery should be covered by the swedish law against FGM. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth in}} the use of {{collective}} and unilateral economic sanctions in the post-Cold-War epoch calls for a re-examination of the legal basis and constraints on the implementation of sanctions. This thesis is an attempt to explore, from a legal point of view, the problems and restrictions associated with sanctions, and suggest ways in which economic sanctions can be rendered more legitimate in terms of international legal requirements. Unilateral and collective economic sanctions are based on different legal premises: the traditional theory of retaliation and treaty principles respectively. It will be argued that a breach of an erga omnes obligation is also a <b>legitimate</b> legal <b>basis</b> for economic sanctions. Key cases in which sanctions have been used will be reviewed and it will be contended that, in addition to traditional economic considerations, sanctions should be subject to other limitations such as respect for principles of international humanitarian law. Issues regarding the legitimacy of the Security Council's actions and authority will also be addressed and possible ways of controlling the actions of the Security Council will be put forth. After determining the restrictions on implementation of sanctions, proposals for refining current practices of imposing economic sanctions are submitted. In conclusion, it is submitted that unilateral sanctions are subject to serious legal constraints and that collective sanctions have the potential of being used in a more humane and institutionally coherent way...|$|R
