25|$|A {{week before}} his 69th birthday, he was {{bedridden}} and infirm. His wasted and frail, aching body could take no more. I paid a short and emotional visit. Still, the ashtray was by his bedside {{next to a}} radio tuned to ABC Radio National. I <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> kiss him on the forehead and he whispered, 'Don't get too close, it hurts'.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{recording}} of Calculating Infinity, bassist Adam Doll {{was involved in a}} car accident that left him paralyzed from the chest down. The accident was a minor fender bender, but because Doll had <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> pick up a CD beneath the stereo, the accident caused a small fracture in his spine, inducing paralysis. Guitarist Weinman played both guitar and bass on the album, though liner notes credited Doll as providing a great deal of help. Calculating Infinity was released on September 28, 1999, through Relapse and was met with critical acclaim.|$|E

And as soon as I opened my hand to let it go, it just {{exploded}} instantly. And I came back, and the hand was completely severed off."The detonation amputated his right hand, and sprayed his body with shrapnel. Petry likely saved the two other soldiers from serious injury or death.|$|E

500|$|Placed under {{surveillance}} {{due to his}} involvement in revolutionary politics by 1894, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was eventually expelled from France, despite Huysmans' intervention in his favor. Reputedly, the deportation document identified him as a [...] "threat to public order". One urban legend recounts that Bogdan-Pitești was present at Vaillant's public execution and <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> kiss Vaillant's mangled body, which both disgusted and alarmed the judicial establishment. Zambaccian suggests {{that the decision to}} deport the Romanian provocateur was not politically motivated. He writes that Bogdan-Pitești had exhausted the patience of French authorities by trafficking in stolen bicycles.|$|E
500|$|When Greenfield {{was asked}} a {{difficult}} question in the legislature, he often <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Brownlee, his seatmate, who supplied him with an answer {{in full view of}} the legislature. Many UFA members found this practice humiliating. [...] Brownlee's importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922. Brownlee was on vacation in Victoria during a special sitting of the legislature. While his presence was usually considered crucial, the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial, and passed by a large margin. However, once this item was dispensed with, some members complained that the C$100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low. Greenfield brought a motion to double it; the amount was increased to $250 in committee. At a time when many farmers earned less than $250 per year, the move cost the UFA dearly in the eyes of its supporters. [...] Many UFA MLAs privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had Brownlee been present. [...] On another occasion, in 1924, Brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness. Boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy, since the Liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence. While Brownlee appreciated the gesture, all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman.|$|E
2500|$|The 140th charged {{into the}} fray of the battle, driving the Texans back and {{securing}} victory for the Union forces on the hill. Col. Patrick [...] "Paddy" [...] O'Rorke, who personally led his regiment in the charge, was killed. Reinforced further by Stephen Weed's brigade of the V Corps, Union forces held the hill {{throughout the rest of}} the battle, enduring persistent fire from Confederate sharpshooters stationed around Devil's Den. General Weed was among the victims, and as his old friend Charles Hazlett <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> comfort Weed, the artilleryman was also shot dead.|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] "the swine, {{because it}} parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, {{but does not}} chew the cud, is unclean to you," [...] a Midrash {{compared}} the pig to the Roman Empire. Just as the swine when reclining puts out its hooves as if to say, [...] "See that I am clean," [...] so too the Roman Empire boasted (of its virtues) as it committed violence and robbery {{under the guise of}} establishing justice. The Midrash compared the Roman Empire to a governor who put to death the thieves, adulterers, and sorcerers, and then <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a counselor and said: [...] "I myself did these three things in one night." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Fundamentalist-Modernist {{controversy}} of the 1920s, Christian evangelist Bob Jones, Sr. {{grew increasingly}} {{concerned about the}} secularization of higher education {{and the influence of}} religious liberalism in denominational colleges. Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend William Jennings Bryan had <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him at a Bible conference service in Winona Lake, Indiana, and said, [...] "If schools and colleges do not quit teaching evolution as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists." [...] While he himself was not a college graduate, Jones grew determined to found a college, and on September 12, 1927, he opened Bob Jones College in Panama City, with 88 students. Jones said that although he had been averse to naming the school after himself, his friends overcame his reluctance [...] "with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Yale gained {{supremacy}} in athletics, Murphy's fame spread, and in {{the fall}} of 1889, the Detroit Athletic Club hired him as the physical director and athletic coach for its members. Murphy remained in Detroit for three years, and while there, he developed a reputation for having a [...] "sixth sense" [...] in being able to spot athletic talent. His first discovery in Detroit was John Owen who {{went on to become the}} fastest sprinter in America. One newspaper account described Murphy's discovery of Owen as follows:"John Owen, a member of the club, was playing tennis one afternoon when Murphy, in his methodical way, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> watch the movements of the players. The action of Owen looked promising to Murphy. 'Mr. Owen, why don't you be a sprinter?' he asked while the players were wiping off perspiration between acts. 'I?' returned Owen. 'Why, I couldn't run a lick.' But Murphy insisted, and from that seeming guess work selection of a future great was developed John Owen, the first amateur sprinter to cover one hundred yards under ten seconds. Owen's time was 9-4/5 seconds." ...|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} homeowners to attach wall-mounted mailboxes {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of mail slots. Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> deposit the mail.

50|$|To {{pass through}} the Maasgeul the ship can not be loaded to {{capacity}} as her draught would then be 23 meters while the minimal depth of the Maasgeul is 24 meters, since if the ship <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> one side at an angle of only 3° then she lies 1.65 meters deeper in the water. For this reason the Berge Stahl can only be loaded with 354,000 tonnes (while she can carry 364,768 tonnes).|$|R

50|$|When a ship or boat <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> one side, {{from the}} action of waves or from the {{centrifugal}} force of a turn or under wind pressure or from the amount of exposed topsides, {{it is said to}} 'heel'. A sailing boat that is over-canvassed and therefore heeling excessively, may sail less efficiently. This is caused by factors such as wind gusts, crew ability, the point of sail, or hull size & design.|$|R

60|$|But just at {{the foot}} there was a sharpish turn in the road, and Welland looked at it earnestly. At an {{ordinary}} pace such a turn could have been easily taken, but at such a rate as he had by that time attained, he felt it would require a tremendous <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> accomplish it. Still he lost no confidence, for he was an athlete by practice if not by profession, and he gathered up his energies for the moment of action.|$|R
