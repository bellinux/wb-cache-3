25|$|The <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> of High Court Justices was {{ended in}} 1977. A {{national}} referendum in May 1977 approved the Constitution Alteration (Retirement of Judges) Act (Cth), which upon its commencement on 29 July 1977 amended section 72 of the Constitution so as require that all Justices appointed {{from then on}} must retire on attaining the age of 70 years.|$|E
25|$|Five {{forms of}} {{elective}} monarchies exist today. The pope of the Roman Catholic Church (who rules as Sovereign of the Vatican City State) is elected {{to a life}} term by the College of Cardinals. In the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, the Prince and Grand Master is elected for <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> by the Council Complete of State from within its members. In Malaysia, the federal king, called the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or Paramount Ruler is elected for a five-year term from among and by the hereditary rulers (mostly sultans) of nine of the federation's constitutive states, all on the Malay peninsula. The United Arab Emirates also has a procedure for electing its monarch. Furthermore, Andorra has a unique constitutional arrangement {{as one of its}} heads of state is the President of the French Republic {{in the form of a}} Co-Prince. This is the only instance in the world where the monarch of a state is elected by the citizens of a different country.|$|E

500|$|When the Supreme Court was created, {{the justices}} of the Court had <b>life</b> <b>tenure,</b> meaning they could {{sit on the}} Court until they either retired or died. [...] In 1927, a {{mandatory}} retirement age of 75 was introduced. [...] The retirement age applied to any judge who was already over age 75, which meant that Justice John Idington, aged 86, was forced to retire {{on the day the}} amendment came into force, March 31, 1927.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} 113 Justices have {{served on the}} Supreme Court of the United States, the highest {{judicial}} body in the United States. Justices have <b>life</b> <b>tenure,</b> and so they serve until they die in office, resign or retire, or are impeached and removed from office (which has never happened; the one impeached Justice was acquitted). The longest-serving member of the current court is Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, with a term to date of [...] days ( [...] years). For the 104 non-incumbent justices, the mean length of service was 6,112 days (16.7 years) {{with a standard deviation}} of 3,620 days (9.9 years). The median length of service was 5,740 days (15.7 years). Their period of service ranges from William O. Douglas's 13,358 days (36 years) on the Court to the 163-day tenure of Thomas Johnson.|$|E
2500|$|In principle, Polish–Lithuanian {{officials}} enjoyed <b>life</b> <b>tenure.</b> Of several {{notable exceptions}} to that rule, {{the most important}} involved the Senat Marshal, who chaired Senat meetings and could suggest, but not determine, {{the subject of a}} meeting. Traditionally, the post of Senat Marshal rotated among Senators from the three prowincyje ("provinces" [...] – major divisions) of the Republic, or Commonwealth: Wielkopolska ("Greater Poland") and Małopolska ("Lesser Poland"), in the [...] "Polish Crown"; and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.|$|E

40|$|Between {{the fourteenth}} and sixteenth centuries the terms on which {{customary}} land {{was held in}} England were transformed from hereditary villein tenure into copyholds and leaseholds. Historians have been uncertain about the precise nature, pace and geography of this transformation, and, indeed, the variety and fluidity of tenurial forms has caused some bewilderment. This article argues that the original villein tenure was displaced by one of four broad categories of customary tenure, a process which began immediately after the Black Death of 1348 – 49, i. e. much earlier than previously assumed. These rapidly emerging tenures were more dignified and attractive than villein tenure, due to the removal of servile language from their conveyances, the growing practice of issuing of a ‘copy’ of the land transfer as proof of title, {{and the development of}} monetarized rent packages. The preference for <b>life</b> <b>tenures</b> in western and central England, and for heritable tenures in the south east and east, is already clearly identifiable by c. 1400, and the reasons for these emerging regional patterns are analysed...|$|R
50|$|In 1890, Dom Wilfred Hipwood became abbot. Described as {{a gentle}} and {{scholarly}} man, he had formerly been {{a professor at}} St Mary's College, Oscott. His twenty years as abbot were marred by almost constant ill-health, and he was confined to his room during {{the last ten years}} of his <b>life.</b> His <b>tenure</b> also saw a decline in numbers; by {{the time of his death}} in 1910, the community numbered fewer than thirty monks.|$|R
2500|$|He opposes <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> for Federal Court judges, {{including}} Supreme Court justices. He {{also writes}} that [...] "If the 26 least populated states voted as a bloc, they would control the U.S. Senate {{with a total}} of just under 17% of the country's population." [...] Sabato further contends that the Constitution is in need of an overhaul, and argues that only a national constitutional convention can bring the document up to date and settle many of the issues that have arisen over the past two centuries.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] is Latin. It {{comprises}} the adverb bene, meaning either [...] "well" [...] or [...] "properly" [...] and the verb gero, gerere meaning either [...] "to govern" [...] or [...] "to bear or carry". The verb {{is in the}} third-person singular of the future perfect active indicative tense, and translates as [...] "(She) will have conducted (herself) well". Cf. the phrase Quam diu se bene gesserint (literally: [...] "As long as they will have conducted themselves properly") in the Act of Settlement 1701. It is usually translated as [...] "for the duration of good behaviour", referring to the <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> of judges.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, under Kimball's direction, the First Quorum of the Seventy was reconstituted. The First Quorum was {{composed}} of the {{former members of the}} First Council of the Seventy as well as new individuals selected by Kimball. The reason for the change was that the growth of the church necessitated the call of more general authorities. In 1976, the First Council of the Seventy, the First Quorum of the Seventy, and the Assistants to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles were all merged into a new First Quorum of the Seventy under a seven-member Presidency of the Seventy. In 1978, some of the older members of the seventy were [...] "retired" [...] as the first general authorities to be given emeritus status. However, members appointed through 1981 were still granted <b>life</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E

50|$|When Caepio Hispo {{was adopted}} is unclear: {{although}} {{the evidence suggests}} this may have occurred later in <b>life</b> between his <b>tenure</b> as consul and governor of Asia (thus being a testamentary adoption), on other grounds Salomies believes the adoption was performed earlier in his life, before {{the birth of his}} son.|$|R
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{incumbent}} {{members of}} Congress {{running for reelection}} have strong advantages over challengers. They raise more money because donors expect incumbents to win, they give their funds to them rather than challengers, and donations are vital for winning elections. One critic compared being elected to Congress to receiving <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> at a university. Another advantage for representatives is the practice of gerrymandering. After each ten-year census, states are allocated representatives based on population, and officials in power can choose how to draw the congressional district boundaries to support candidates from their party. [...] As a result, reelection rates of members of Congress hover around 90 percent, causing some critics to accuse them of being a privileged class. Academics such as Princeton's Stephen Macedo have proposed solutions to fix gerrymandering. Both senators and representatives enjoy free mailing privileges called franking privileges.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Herbert Samuel, {{recently}} appointed British High Commissioner, [...] {{declared a}} general amnesty for those convicted of {{complicity in the}} riots of 1920, excluding only Amin and Al Aref. [...] During a visit later that year to the Bedouin tribes of Transjordan who harboured the two political refugees, Samuel offered a pardon to both and al- Al Aref accepted with alacrity. Husseini initially rebuffed the offer, {{on the grounds that}} he was not a criminal. He accepted the pardon only {{in the wake of the}} death of his half-brother, the mufti Kamil al-Husayni, in March 1921. [...] Elections were then held, and of the four candidates running for the office of Mufti, al-Husseini received the least number of votes, the first three being Nashashibi candidates. Nevertheless, Samuel was anxious to keep a balance between the al-Husseinis and their rival clan the Nashashibis. A year earlier the British had replaced Musa al-Husayni as Mayor of Jerusalem with Ragheb al-Nashashibi. They then moved to secure for the Husseini clan a compensatory function of prestige by appointing one of them to the position of mufti, and, with the support of Ragheb al-Nashashibi, prevailing upon the Nashashibi front-runner, Sheikh Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, to withdraw. This automatically promoted Amin al-Husseini to third position, which, under Ottoman law, allowed him to qualify, and Samuel then chose him as Mufti. His initial appointment was as Mufti, but when the Supreme Muslim Council was created in the following year, Husseini demanded and received the title Grand Mufti that had earlier been created, perhaps on the lines of Egyptian usage, by the British for his half-brother Kamil. The position came with a <b>life</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Ethel Thompson had, however, another {{claim to}} distinction. She had been [...] "eddicated," [...] as her neighbors {{acknowledged}} in awed tones, and [...] "took a diploma from a college school at Troy." [...] Young as she was, Ethel had taught school for two years, {{and might have}} a <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> if she cared to retain the position.

5000|$|Judges {{and members}} of some upper {{chambers}} (e.g., senators for life) have <b>life</b> <b>tenure.</b> The primary goal of <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> is to insulate the officeholder from external pressures. Certain heads of state, such as monarchs and Presidents for Life, are also given <b>life</b> <b>tenure.</b> United States federal judges have <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> once appointed {{by the president and}} confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, <b>life</b> <b>tenure</b> lasts {{only until}} a {{mandatory}} retirement age. For example, Canadian senators are appointed for life, but {{are forced to}} retire at 75.

5000|$|When {{talking about}} {{subscribers}} or customers, sometimes the expression [...] "survival rate" [...] {{is used to}} mean 1 minus the churn rate. For example, {{for a group of}} subscribers, an annual churn rate of 25 percent is the same as an annual survival rate of 75 percent. Both imply a customer lifetime of four years. I.e., a customer lifetime can be calculated as the inverse of that customer's predicted churn rate. For a group or segment of customers, their customer <b>life</b> (or <b>tenure)</b> is the inverse of their aggregate churn rate. Gompertz distribution models of distribution of customer life times can therefore also predict a distribution of churn rates.|$|R

40|$|A {{major reason}} for advocating for quality of work life has been the promise that it creates a win-win situation: {{improved}} employee satisfaction and welfare, hence increased productivity, longer employee tenure and consequently increased company profitability. Nevertheless, {{in the context of}} small to medium enterprises (SMEs), scant attention has been given to the empirical investigation into the influence of the quality of work <b>life</b> on employee <b>tenure</b> intention in Southern Africa. The {{purpose of this study is}} to fill this gap by examining the influence of SME employees’ perceptions of the quality of work <b>life</b> on their <b>tenure</b> intention and the mediating role of job satisfaction and job commitment in this relationship as far as Zimbabwe is concerned. Five hypotheses were posited and sample data of 282 were collected from Harare, Zimbabwe’s biggest city, to empirically test these hypotheses. The results of this study showed that, in the SME context, quality of work life positively and significantly influences employee job satisfaction, job commitment and consequently tenure intention. The managerial implications of the findings are discussed and limitations and future research directions are indicated...|$|R
