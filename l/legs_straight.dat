25|$|The pittas are {{strongly}} territorial, with territories varying {{in size from}} 3000 m² in the African pitta to 10,000m² in the rainbow pitta. Pittas will perform territory defence displays {{on the edges of}} their territories, although fights between rivals have only been recorded once. One such territorial display is given by the rainbow pitta, which holds its <b>legs</b> <b>straight</b> and bows to a rival on the edge of territory, while making a purring call. Displays like this are paired with calls made out of sight of potential rivals; these territorial calls are frequent and can account for up to 12% of a bird's daylight activity. Migratory species will defend non-breeding feeding territories in addition to their breeding ones.|$|E

25|$|A brown recluse's {{stance on}} a flat surface is usually with all legs {{radially}} extended. When alarmed it may lower its body, withdraw the forward two <b>legs</b> <b>straight</b> rearward into a defensive position, withdraw the rearmost pair of legs into a position for lunging forward, and stand motionless with pedipalps raised. The pedipalps in mature specimens are dark and quite prominent and are normally held horizontally forward. When threatened it usually flees, seemingly to avoid a conflict, and if detained may further avoid contact with quick horizontal rotating movements or even resort to assuming a lifeless pose (playing dead). The spider does not usually jump unless touched brusquely, and even then its avoidance movement is more of a horizontal lunge rather than a vaulting of itself entirely off the surface. When running, the brown recluse does not leave a silk line behind, which would make it more easily tracked when it is being pursued. Movement at virtually any speed is an evenly paced gait with legs extended. When missing a leg or two it appears to favor this same gait, although (presumably when a leg has been injured) it may move and stand at rest with one leg slightly withdrawn. During travel it stops naturally and periodically when renewing its internal hydraulic blood pressure that, like most spiders, it requires to renew strength in its legs.|$|E
500|$|Standards for {{the breed}} are stipulated by the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. The maximum height allowed is [...] Although {{there is no}} minimum height standard, in {{practice}} New Forest ponies are seldom less than [...] In shows, they normally are classed in two sections: competition height A, [...] and under; and competition height B, over [...] New Forest ponies should be of riding type, workmanlike, and strong in conformation, with a sloping shoulder and powerful hindquarters; the body should be deep, and the <b>legs</b> <b>straight</b> with strong, flat bone, and hard, rounded hooves. Larger ponies, although narrow enough in the barrel for small children to ride comfortably, are also capable of carrying adults. Smaller ponies may not be suitable for heavier riders, but they often have more show quality. The New Forest pony has free, even gaits, active and straight, but not exaggerated, and is noted for sure-footedness, agility, and speed.|$|E
500|$|A young four-armed Shiva and a {{beautiful}} two-armed Parvati should be the central figures, performing the panigrahana ("accepting the hand") ritual of a Hindu wedding, where the groom accepts the bride by taking her right hand in his. Shiva stands in tribhanga posture, {{with one of his}} <b>legs</b> <b>straight</b> and firmly on the ground and the other one slightly [...] bent. Shiva wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, adorned with a crescent moon. He wears serpents as earrings, as a waist band and as a necklace. Various gold ornaments adorn his body. His back hands carry a parashu (axe) and a mriga (deer). His front left hand makes the varada mudra ("blessing-giving gesture") and his front right hand is stretched ahead to receive the hand of the bride. A dark-complexioned Parvati, adorned in silk and gold finery, stands to the left of Shiva, blushing with her head bent slightly as she extends her right arm to hold Shiva's right hand. She holds a nilotpala (blue lotus) in her left arm.|$|E

The rower has <b>legs</b> <b>straight,</b> body leaning back, and arms pulled in so that the oar handle is a few inches from the solar plexus. This is the beginning of what is called the recovery or the slide.|$|E
2500|$|A {{standing}} back handspring {{begins with}} a three phase sequence known as [...] "up, sit, jump". In the up phase, the gymnast stands up straight on flat feet, with arms in front at an angle slightly above horizontal. In the sit phase, the gymnast swings the arms down by {{the sides of the}} torso, bends knees, and sits back as if sitting in a chair; while in this position, the gymnast is unbalanced. Together, the sit and jump phases impart angular momentum to the body, causing it to rotate. In the jump phase, the gymnast swings both arms up by the ears and jumps into the air while transitioning to an arch position, with the head in a neutral position, arms and <b>legs</b> <b>straight,</b> and feet together; this body shape is maintained until the hands contact the floor. With hands on the floor, the body's angular momentum is used to transform the gymnast's body shape from an arch, through a linear shape, to a [...] "hollow" [...] shape. The hands are then pushed against the floor, causing the body to lift off from the floor while the body continues its feet-first rotation. Finally, the feet land on the floor, behind the body's center of gravity, and the remaining angular momentum is depleted as it carries the gymnast to a stationary standing position.|$|E
2500|$|Pedestrianism is a {{sport that}} {{developed}} during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and was a popular spectator sport in the British Isles. By {{the end of the}} 18th century, and especially with the growth of the popular press, feats of foot travel over great distances (similar to a modern ultramarathon) gained attention, and were labeled [...] "pedestrianism". Interest in the sport, and the wagering which accompanied it, spread to the United States, Canada, and Australia in the 19th century. By the end of the 19th century, Pedestrianism was largely displaced by the rise in modern spectator sports and by controversy involving rules, which limited its appeal as a source of wagering and led to its inclusion in the amateur athletics movement. Pedestrianism was first codified in {{the last half of the}} 19th century, evolving into what would become racewalking, By the mid 19th century, competitors were often expected to extend their <b>legs</b> <b>straight</b> at least once in their stride, and obey what was called the [...] "fair heel and toe" [...] rule. This rule, the source of modern racewalking, was a vague commandment that the toe of one foot could not leave the ground before the heel of the next foot touched down. This said, rules were customary and changed with competition. Racers were usually allowed to jog in order to fend off cramps, and it was distance, not code, which determined gait for longer races. Newspaper reports suggest that [...] "trotting" [...] was common in events.|$|E

40|$|We {{undertook}} {{this study}} to determine the relative contributions of pelvic and lower limb motion to increases in the angle of passive <b>straight</b> <b>leg</b> raising in the sagittal plane. Seventeen healthy subjects underwent passive <b>straight</b> <b>leg</b> raising of their relaxed left lower limb while their right lower limb was held firmly against the table. Each subject's pelvis and left lower limb were marked so that cinema-tography could document motion of the pelvis and left lower limb during passive <b>straight</b> <b>leg</b> raising. Film analysis revealed that pelvic rotation began within 9 degrees {{of the beginning of}} passive <b>straight</b> <b>leg</b> raising and that the relative contribution of pelvic rotation to the angle of passive <b>straight</b> <b>leg</b> raising in relation to the horizontal plane increased in conjunction with the angle of <b>straight</b> <b>leg</b> raising.

His next start was determined, and Paula, poised for her dive, could not send him scuttling back.
