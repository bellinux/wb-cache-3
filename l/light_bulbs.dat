5|$|William Joseph Hammer {{started to}} collect {{incandescent}} <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> from 1879 {{while they were}} being developed in the Edison laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of Thomas Edison and in his engineering career {{he was able to}} collect early filament electric <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> from Edison and others because of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.|$|E

50|$|An LED {{filament}} <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> is {{an electric}} <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> which produces <b>light</b> with a LED {{that is designed}} to resemble the filament of an incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb,</b> sometimes an Edison <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> The bulb also feature the exact same design as a conventional incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, Eugene Alessio {{patented}} a <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> {{socket adapter}} for adjusting a light level {{on a single}} <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> using a triac. [...] To house this device, he decided on a 2-inch round device with one end capable of being screwed into a <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> socket and the other end able to receive a <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|R
5000|$|McLuhan {{pointed to}} the <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> as an example. A <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> does not have content {{in the way that}} a {{newspaper}} has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that [...] "a <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> creates an environment by its mere presence." ...|$|R
5|$|Case No. 1 {{contained}} {{a selection of}} lamps that represented the basics of the technology involved {{in the early stages}} of the electric light bulb development. The case displayed actual physical <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> made by Thomas Edison and others from 1878 to 1883. Edison's earliest steps in the bamboo filament and graphite filament lamps are displayed in this case. The first lamp made in a pear shape was in this display, which was the universal shape for electric <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> for decades. These in this display case contained numbers that ranged from 1 – 109.|$|E
5|$|Also during 2008, Reubens did a PSA for Unscrew America, {{a website}} {{that aims to}} get people to change regular <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> for more {{energy-efficient}} ones in the form of CFLs and LED.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design and {{implementation}} of the Portable DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> system for Cal Poly San Luis Obispo’s DC House Project. The DC Portable <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> highlights the NiMH battery charging circuit, buck converter, and boost converter. The system is intended as a flashlight adaptor placed in between the dimmable DC <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> and its screw base. The adaptor adds a portability feature to the DC <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> to provide <b>lighting</b> wherever the user pleases. The Portable DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> system is designed to operate with an input range of 24 V- 60 V and regulate an output voltage of 34 V for the DC <b>light</b> <b>bulb.</b> Computer simulations, calculations, and hardware results verifies the proposed Portable DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> system’s design, function, and purpose...|$|R

Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} was lit by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they were blown out by the wind. The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> were attached to the bridge instead of flares.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislation}} {{contained a}} ban on using federal funds to enforce the phase-out of incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> that had been mandated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, but requires recipients of more than $1 million in Department of Energy grants {{to comply with the}} energy efficiency standards.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases are exactly the members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design and {{implementation}} of an economical and energy efficient DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> for the DC House Project. For the DC lighting system, {{emphasis is on the}} DC-DC LED driver, dimmer circuit, LED lighting array, and physical packing design. In this paper, a DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> is designed, simulated, and tested to operate at a wide input voltage ranging from 24 VDC to 72 VDC, to be fully dimmable using pulse-width modulation technique, and to produce lumination intensities equivalent to a standard 100 W A 19 incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> at one-tenth the total power consumption. The DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb’s</b> physical design also takes advantage of the same physical dimensions of a standard A 19 incandescent <b>light</b> <b>bulb</b> using an E 26 Edison screw base. Results from computer simulations and hardware tests demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed DC <b>Light</b> <b>Bulb</b> in terms of overall efficiency, line regulation, load regulation, power consumption, total lumens, luminous efficacy, and thermal profile...|$|R

Elgato said the product won't be available until the HomeKit software, {{which is expected}} to come with Apple iOS 8, is released. It also introduced smart <b>light</b> <b>bulbs,</b> which communicate with iOS devices through Bluetooth and allow users to adjust home lighting from their mobile device.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E

Cerium-doped lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) is currently the preferred compound for detectors in positron emission tomography (PET). Lutetium aluminium garnet (LuAG) is used as a phosphor in LED <b>light</b> <b>bulbs.</b>|$|E

The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The display information for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these <b>light</b> <b>bulbs</b> for 34 years. In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.|$|E
