50|$|Freemasonry in Spain {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1728, in an English lodge. As various papal bulls condemned Freemasonry the Spanish Inquisition {{did their best}} to close <b>lodges</b> <b>and</b> demonise Freemasons, therefore the success of Freemasonry from year to year depended on the sympathy or antipathy of the ruling regime. Nevertheless, <b>lodges</b> <b>and</b> even Grand <b>Lodges</b> were formed, <b>and</b> even thrived during more liberal periods. When Francisco Franco consolidated power in 1939, all Freemasonry was banned. In 1979, four years after Franco's death, bans on Freemasonry were declared unconstitutional, <b>and</b> several Grand <b>Lodges</b> <b>and</b> Orients now flourish in Spain.|$|R
