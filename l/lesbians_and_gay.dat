40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this thesis, I explore the construction of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting in psychology (Part 1), in the media (Part 2), <b>and</b> in <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents' talk (Part 3). My research brings together a diverse range of influences <b>and</b> ideas from <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> psychology, feminist psychology, and constructionist and discursive research. I draw on varied data sources: the psychological <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> feminist literature on <b>lesbian</b> (<b>and</b> <b>gay)</b> parenting, television talk shows, documentaries and newspaper articles, and research interviews with <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents. These data are analysed within a feminist constructionist framework, using discourse analysis. The thesis {{is divided into three}} parts. In Part 1. 1 present my analysis of the psychological <b>and</b> <b>lesbian</b> feminist literature on <b>lesbian</b> (<b>and</b> <b>gay)</b> parenting. In this part of the thesis, I treat the literature as data and explore what it reveals about the social construction of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting. First, I provide a historical overview of the literature on <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> parenting over the last one hundred years. Then, I focus in detail on how discourses of sameness and difference and discourses of science inform the construction of <b>lesbian</b> (<b>and</b> <b>gay)</b> parenting in the literature. In Part 2, I analyse media constructions of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting. First, I identify arguments against <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting in talk shows and in newspaper articles. Second, I focus specifically on talk show debates and analyse how these debates are constructed and identify the key themes informing pro-lesbian/gay parenting discourse on talk shows. In Part 3, I focus in detail on <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents' talk about two issues that significantly inform psychological and media debates about their fitness to parent: homophobic bullying and male role models. I explore how <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents engage with anti-lesbian/gay claims about homophobic bullying and male role models, {{and the ways in which}} they construct bullying and role models in the process of discursively managing their identity as 'bad' parents. In the final chapter, I discuss the contributions and implications of my research, and indicate some future developments for research on <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parenting <b>and</b> for <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> psychology...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2007 Reconstruction'Positive' {{representations}} of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents within the media continue to draw {{parallels between the}} experiences of heterosexual parents <b>and</b> those of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents. Such comparisons are typically aimed at 'proving' that <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents are acceptable parents. There is, however, most often a failure to examine how race mediates {{representations of}} the category 'parent', the result being that references to 'parents' typically refer to white parents. The category parent is thus built upon a series of exclusions, ones with which white <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents may unwittingly be complicit. Through an examination of both a radio interview with the Australian Prime Minister John Howard and newspaper reports focusing on <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents, I explore how white heterosexual parenting becomes the norm from which white <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents are at times excluded, but to which {{those of us who}} identify as such parents may at times aspire. Examining the race privilege of white <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents, <b>and</b> developing an ethical framework through which to claim rights, may be one way of engaging with the problematic representation of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents more broadly.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with sociological conceptualisations of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> sexualities as reflexive forms of existence, and identifies core problems with these. Our sociological narratives about <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> reflexivity tend to be partial in two senses. First, they talk about and envision only very particular - and relatively exclusive – experience, and fail to adequately account for the significance of difference and power in shaping diverse <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> experiences. Second, {{they tend to be}} underpinned by overly affirmative and normative projects, and are often narratives about how <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> life should be. Our narratives about <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> reflexivity sometimes confuse analysis with prescription, and actualities with potentialities. Their partiality limits the analytical purchase they afford, and is an inadequate basis on which to analyse contemporary <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> identities <b>and</b> ways of living. The article proposes an approach to studying <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> living that is orientated more towards reflexive sociology than the sociology of reflexive sexualities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gays</b> are on {{the verge}} of winning full {{citizenship}} in Canada and a number of Western European coun-tries. This represents a remarkable change in the 35 years since the contemporary <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> liberation movement was launched out of the Stonewall riots. These gains are the product of a social movement with a strong history of militant mobilization. At the same time, the process of capitalist restructuring has opened some of the space for <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> existence. The penetration of the market deeper into everyday life has created spaces for commodified forms of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> existence, oriented around bars, restaurants, commercial publications, fashions and hairstyles. Capitalism has accommodated elements of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> exis-tence in the face of ongoing mobilizations, opening certain spaces for <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> life while at the same time shutting down others. The era of lesbian/gay citizenship and commodification opens ne...|$|R

500|$|A {{belief in}} [...] "lesbian & gay separatism" [...] (not to be {{confused}} with the related [...] "lesbian separatism"), holds that <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men form (or should form) a community distinct and separate from other groups normally included in the LGBTQ sphere. While not always appearing of sufficient number or organization to be called a movement, separatists are a significant, vocal, and active element within many parts of the LGBT community. In some cases separatists will deny the existence or right to equality of nonmonosexual orientations and of transsexuality. This can extend to public biphobia and transphobia. In contrasts to separatists, Peter Tatchell of the LGBT human rights group OutRage! argues that to separate the transgender movement from the LGB would be [...] "political madness", stating that [...] "Queers are, like transgender people, gender deviant.

40|$|Aim: To examine <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> people’s {{expectations}} of support, socialising and cohabitation in older age. Methods: The study involved secondary data {{analysis of a}} subsample of 371 <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> people taken from a {{survey conducted by the}} Queensland Association for Healthy Communities. Results: <b>Lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> people expected to receive support from diverse sources, including same-sex partners, <b>lesbian,</b> <b>gay,</b> bisexual <b>and</b> transgender friends and heterosexual friends. Women were more likely to expect to receive support from others than men, and men were more likely to expect to live alone in later life. Conclusions: Aged care providers need to be responsive to the different sources of support that may be provided to older <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> people. Services that are lesbian- and gay-friendly may facilitate service uptake and reduce pressures on <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> people’s informal networks of support...|$|R

In Italy, the sociological research on the recognition of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> families with children is not comparable to the international one. Nevertheless, the development of a political discourse on the rights of <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> people – with or without families, with or without children – by European institutions is broadening the interest of Italian sociologists. The article analyses the experiences of 12 <b>gay</b> Italian <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents in order to understand how they negotiate and achieve social legitimation in front of their families of origin, local institutions and neighbours. Results show that <b>lesbian</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> families with children give an important contribution for the pluralization of practices and meanings related to the family. At the same time, they reproduce some crucial features supporting the hegemonic interpretation of the family: the centrality of the couple and the importance of blood ties for the definition of kinship...|$|R
500|$|Brockett next {{introduces}} Stephen to Valérie Seymour, who– {{like her}} prototype, Natalie Clifford Barney– is the hostess {{of a literary}} salon, many of whose guests are <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men. Immediately after this meeting Stephen announces she has decided to settle in Paris at 35 Rue Jacob (purchased at Seymour's recommendation), with its temple {{in a corner of}} an overgrown garden. Barney lived and held her salon at 20 Rue Jacob. Stephen is wary of Valérie, and does not visit her salon until after the war, when Brockett persuades her that Mary is becoming too isolated. She finds Valérie to be an [...] "indestructible creature" [...] capable of bestowing a sense of self-respect on others, at least temporarily: [...] "everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's". With Stephen's misgivings [...] "drugged", she and Mary are drawn further into the [...] "desolate country" [...] of Paris gay life. At Alec's Bar– the worst in a series of depressing nightspots– they encounter [...] "the battered remnants of men who...despised of the world, must despise themselves beyond all hope, it seemed, of salvation".|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began {{to reflect the}} changes {{prompted}} by {{the civil rights movement}} and the emergence of a counterculture. [...] Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called [...] "the New Wave," [...] a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation. New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in [...] "inner space" [...] instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential New Worlds), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace. The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s. In the 1970s, <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch and Samuel R.

Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that <b>lesbians</b> <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison.
