Participants included twenty grade twelve students who were interviewed on why they believed students with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> were excluded. Responses were analyzed (a) qualitatively to identify response themes, and (b) quantitatively to examine gender differences. Five response categories were identified including (a) thoughts and behaviours of students without <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties,</b> (b) classroom-related activities, (c) differences between {{students with and without}} <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties,</b> (d) thoughts and behaviours of students with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties,</b> and (e) exclusion is not a problem.

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of narcolepsy is about 1 per 2,000 persons. It {{is a reason}} for patient visits to sleep disorder centers, and with its onset in adolescence, {{it is also a}} major cause of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulty</b> and absenteeism from school. Normal teenagers often already experience excessive daytime sleepiness because of a maturational increase in physiological sleep tendency accentuated by multiple educational and social pressures; this may be disabling with the addition of narcolepsy symptoms in susceptible teenagers. In clinical practice, the differentiation between narcolepsy and other conditions characterized by excessive somnolence may be difficult. Treatment options are currently limited. There is a paucity in the literature of controlled double-blind studies of possible effective drugs or other forms of therapy. Mechanisms of action of some few available therapeutic agents have been explored but detailed studies of mechanisms of action are needed before new classes of therapeutic agents can be developed. Narcolepsy is an underdiagnosed condition in the general population. This is partly because its severity varies, so it can be mistaken for other illnesses very easily. Some people with narcolepsy do not suffer from loss of muscle control.|$|E

The empirical study is a qualitative phenomenological interview study, inspired by narrative traditions, and describes how fathers with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> experience these support systems. The main data are two life stories of fathers with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and one observation in a family. The findings suggest that although Sweden has a highly regarded disability policy and social support system, and even though fathers with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are assured equal rights as members of the society and as parents by the Act of Human Rights, they are not treated equal but still faces structural inequalities. Their strengths and needs are not recognized, gender based support is not used and last but not least there is a lack of adequate competence in the support system.

40|$|To {{examine whether}} <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> {{play a role}} in {{depressive}} symptoms, 658 Finnish adolescents were asked to complete scales for depression three times during the transition to post-comprehensive education. They also reported on their <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and feelings of inadequacy as a student. The results showed that <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> prospectively predicted depressive symptoms. Moreover, the impact of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> was mediated via inadequacy as a student: <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> predicted feelings of inadequacy as a student which, in turn, contributed to greater increases in depressive symptoms. Finally, gender moderated the association between <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and depressive symptoms: both being a girl and having a high level of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> predicted a higher initial level of depressive symptoms. Keywords adolescence, cross-lagged analysis, depressive symptoms, feelings of inadequacy as a student, gender, <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties,</b> mediators, moderator Although the majority of individuals manage adolescence well, some have difficulties in adapting to many of the transitions and changes that characterize this life period (Graber & Brooks-Gunn, 1996). This is also evidenced in the fact that, in comparison to childhood, depression levels rise during the adolescent years (for a review, see Hankin & Abramson, 2001). At the same time aca-demic demands at school increase and adolescents become more aware of individual differences in abilities and achievement (Renick & Harter, 1989). Consequently, <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> can be expected to play a particularly important role in depressive symptoms during adolescence (Huntington & Bender, 2001).

40|$|This study {{considered}} {{employment opportunities}} and realities {{of work for}} adults with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> in England (post the 2001, White Paper Valuing People) with the view to developing opportunities for people in Iran. An eclectic approach, using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted. Thus I studied the lives of six workers with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and considered the case files of a further 200 similar employees in the English city of Northtown {{in order to develop}} an understanding of their employment experiences and to gain insight into the perceptions of their employers in mainstream workplaces. Twenty one employers completed a survey questionnaire and 12 were interviewed. I also investigated how supported employment providers (SEPs) promote `meaningful work' opportunities for people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> The research findings helped me to formulate policy recommendations and applications for Iran. The social model of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> was the main stance of this research. The research showed that people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> were excluded from many aspects of life particularly employment, due to the social, cultural, political and structural barriers within society. All the SEPs and most employers perceived employees with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> as capable, punctual, reliable, willing, hard-working very helpful and trustworthy workers. This study highlighted that the current supported employment programme, despite supporting employees with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> at work and increasing the employers' awareness of their ability was not successful in enabling people in gaining meaningful work. The Workstep programme, however, did appear to help people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> to get paid jobs.

The project from which data are drawn, entitled 'The Meaning of the Learning Society for Adults with Learning Difficulties', focused on lifelong learning opportunities available to people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> and experiences of these services. The article begins by examining theories of late modernity, their use by feminist and disability studies theorists and their relationship to ideas of a learning society. Subsequently, using case study material, it is argued that the identities of people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are not chosen freely from a range of options but are socially ascribed. The status of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> is used as a dominant category to justify deprivation of basic political and economic rights. In addition, the lives of people with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are structured by gender and class, and these intersect with the category of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> For both women and men, the advantages of middle-class social and economic capital are overridden by the negative category of <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties.</b> In relation to gender, men with <b>learning</b> <b>difficulties</b> are more likely to receive post-school training, but in inappropriate areas of the labour market. Their domestic needs are also likely to be attended to by others, but in the absence of employment, they find themselves without any valued social role.
