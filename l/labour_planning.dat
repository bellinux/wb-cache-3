40|$|The post-communist {{assessment}} of communist youth transitions {{to work is}} at risk of exaggerating the assumption of previously existing predefined and predictable channels into work. In order to allow a somewhat refined picture of the Soviet case the paper reviews the main ways, in which the Soviet system tried to take hold of young people as a human resource. They were subject to <b>labour</b> <b>planning</b> and job placement as well as education for labour. The meeting point of these two mechanisms, i. e. the intersection of <b>labour</b> <b>planning</b> and educational transitions, left considerable space for informal job matching. After introducing and discussing early roots and main institutions of Soviet <b>labour</b> <b>planning,</b> the Soviet version of educating for labour including its institutional backbone, the three-track system of education and its main destinations, is reviewed. Finally, the mechanisms and shortcomings of posteducational youth placement in the USSR are discussed. The evidence indicates that, on the one hand, educational determinism is untenable - first, due to the relative status of education within the whole complex of transition arrangements, and second {{due to the fact}} that outcome assumptions and expectations attached to the idealised internal and external 'role' of certain tracks were thwarted by its incompatibility with the economy's actual manpower needs. On the other hand, institutional determinism is untenable because the reality of matching processes obviously involved a considerable degree of agency on the part of individuals.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The mining {{industry}} {{is the largest}} source of foreign income for South Africa. It is also {{the main source of}} employment in the country, for example Anglo Platinum employs approximately 40 000 employees and contractors. As a result labour cost in South African mines makes up nearly 50 % of total mine costs. The focus {{of this study was to}} investigate the current underground <b>labour</b> <b>planning</b> models used in the platinum {{mining industry}} and to design a mine <b>labour</b> <b>planning</b> model to optimize the labour - Anglo Platinum specific. This would minimise all of the mining-related risks in a direct or indirect manner. Financial modelling showed an annual improvement of R 38 million for Rustenburg Platinum Mines. If this new approach could be extended to the rest of Anglo Platinum, a saving of R 151 million could be realised by increasing revenue and a decreasing labour cost. The optimum labour output level of underground mines was determined from a mining, services and engineering perspective and the GAP (or production output potential compared to the current output levels) was established. One of the main objectives was the determination of the existing labour supply GAP, and thus the requirements to fill this GAP. For this purpose, specific checklists were designed to capture all the relevant information. Site personnel were involved throughout the entire process to ensure ownership of the new model. This buy-in was achieved through planning workshops, interactive presentations and discussions. Between the different operations the GAP ranged between an oversupply of labour by 5 %, and a 5 % undersupply below the optimum potential. The improved frequency of daily bJasts validated the correct amount and mix of the labour force. Reef deposits are not replaceable and it is in the interest of all stakeholders to extract every portion in the most efficient manner. Mines require vast amounts of capital and with risks, like fluctuating metal prices, exchange rates, rising costs, labour unrest and geological uncertainties, it is important to have optimum <b>labour</b> <b>planning</b> model and labour management systems in place. The new model has been successfully implemented in RPM with the benefits described above. Master...|$|E

40|$|Sweet pepper {{production}} {{is characterized by}} large fluctuations in fruit yield per week. Synchronization of yield patterns between nurseries in response to weather conditions leads to variations in market supply and affects price formation. In order to improve supply chain efficiency, auctions and wholesalers require nurseries to supply production forecasts several weeks in advance. At the nursery level, yield prediction is helpful for efficient <b>labour</b> <b>planning.</b> Because the dynamics of sweet pepper production are complex, growers {{find it difficult to}} understand and effectively control the production process. A model can be useful to assist growers in making efficient decisions with regard to crop and climate management. It is hypothesized that a phase-shift in the feedback-regulation of fruit set by growing fruits could be the cause of the periodic yield pattern observed in practice. This paper describes a dynamic model of sweet pepper production based on this principle. Model output was compared with measurements of sweet pepper production obtained from a commercial nursery. The calibrated model was able to simulate the measured data fairly well, in particular the yield fluctuations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis and serve as a promising starting point for further research aiming at {{a better understanding of the}} underlying processes and, consequently, model improvement...|$|E

The present study investigated the potential health advantages of 10 selected farrow-to-finish pig herds before and after transition from a one week batch management system to a four or five week batch management system. Five different animal categories (gilts, sows, piglets, growers and finishers) were sampled at three time points (T 0, T 1 and T 2) before and after transition to a four or five week batch management system. Different matrices of the animals were collected: blood, nasal swabs and faeces. Several economically important diseases were monitored through serology: Lawsonia intracellularis, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSv), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneurnoniae; and PCR-testing: Pasteurella multocida dermonecrotic toxin (DNT) and Brachyspira species, especially the major pathogenic Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Following serological analysis, the percentage of positive animals per category and sampling occasion were calculated. Health improvement based on serology {{was defined as the}} reduction in the percentage of positive animals for a specific disease in a specified animal category. All samples were negative for P. multocida DNT and B. hyodysenteriae. Little to no improvement could be observed for PRRSv. For L. intracellularis an improvement could be observed in piglets (71 %) and growers (56 %; P < 0. 05). For both of the respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae, significant improvement was observed in finishers (34 and 24 %, respectively). In growers, only M. hyopneumoniae showed a significant improvement (34 %). In conclusion, the transition from a one week batch management system to a four or five week batch management system in the present herds resulted in a reduction of the percentage of seropositive animals for three of the monitored economically important diseases: L. intracellularis, M. hyopneumoniae and A. pleuropneumoniae...|$|E
40|$|The {{collapse}} of state Socialism in Europe turned {{the lives of}} more than 300 {{million people in the}} New West (approximately the population of the USA) upside down, shattering long-established expectations associated with the system of state planning. The prescribed ‘shock therapy’ (Gligorov 1995) for rapidly transforming into capitalist market democracies also created novel contingencies within the institutional, political and biographical makeup of individual lives, ones which were unknown in the life course model of the ‘authoritarian welfare state’ (Leisering and Leibfried 1999). For instance, universal social security, though at low levels during Socialism, gave way to deregulated, residual welfare (Barr 2005), and the logic of linking education and employment shifted from controlled placement to market matching. The abolishment of the constitutional obligation (and right) to labour ended the ideological claims to comprehensive <b>labour</b> <b>planning.</b> With mass unemployment, the post-education job guarantee once characterising Socialism was now burdened with uncertainty, ‘a situation in which actors cannot predict outcomes and cannot assign probability distributions to possible outcomes’ (Beckert 1996). This essay complements the above institutional shift with findings from a study exploring its consequences for everyday life. Using the example of a young Lithuanian in his transition to the world of work, the essay explores related biographical uncertainties. The post-communist situation multiplies uncertainties inherent in life course transitions, particularly youth transitions. The reconstruction of the experiences and choices of this single case demonstrates how the external uncertainty represented in the transformation translates, on the inside of action, into ‘biographical uncertainty’ (Wohlrab-Sahr 1992). The case illustrates an analytic distinction of three dimensions of biographical uncertainty: uncertainty of outcome concerns anticipated events and results; uncertainty of knowledge refers to biographical planning and the mobilisation of experience knowledge; and uncertainty of recognition characterises the re-evaluation of the social environment. The configuration of these dimensions constitutes, in this case, the prototypical profile of the Pattern of liberation. Using these theoretical lenses, the example provides an illustration of the challenge of unexpected social change for both individuals and nations...|$|E

The objective of supply chain management is to optimize the performance of the whole supply chain instead of independent optimization of individual parties. Lot-delivery is a common mode of transferring the concerned product from the supplier(s) to the buyer(s). Since Ghare and Schrader (1963) 's pioneering work, many researchers have presented inventory models on deteriorating items. However, there have been much fewer integrated lot-delivery models than EOQ and EPQ models of deteriorating items in literature. This research investigates integrated lot-delivery models for optimizing the supply chain of exponentially deteriorating items. In predetermined production rate models, significant proportions of stock are built well before shipments because production rates are usually much higher than demand rates. Therefore, high inventory holding costs and deterioration costs are incurred. In addition, utilization of the production facilities is low. In this research, a demand-driven production rate continuous production model is proposed. In this model, the production rate is related to the delivery interval and is found by optimizing the total cost of the system. By having a lower production rate and a shorter delivery interval, the model can achieve a significant reduction in the total system cost per unit time, under conditions that are found by studying the effect of varying production rate on the total cost. Part of the cost saving can be allocated to finance additional resources for maintenance of the equipment. This model also addresses the operational issues by minimizing idleness of production facilities and facilitating <b>labour</b> <b>planning.</b> There are two extensions of the proposed model. In some of the literature, researchers have presented EOQ models for deteriorating items with a non-deteriorating period. The proposed model has been extended to include a non-deteriorating period for the item and the effect of a finite production rate and a non-deteriorating period on the system is investigated. In the literature of inventory models, cost parameters have been assumed to be independent of production rate. As the proposed demand-driven production rate model uses a much lower production rate than usual predetermined production rates, the proposed model is extended to investigate a scenario in which some cost parameters increase when production rate decreases. Chan and Kingman (2005, 2007) presented a synchronized model for a single-vendor multiple-buyer supply chain. The synchronized model performs better than the common order cycle model developed by Banerjee and Banerjee (1994). In this research, the synchronized model is extended for supply chains of exponentially deteriorating items. It has been found that the model has a better performance than the best costs from genetic algorithm and the optimal solutions of the common cycle approach. In view of increasing environmental concerns, a maximum deterioration constraint has been incorporated in the extended model in which the least cost solution that meets the constraint is found. Utilization of production facilities is low in predetermined production rate models due to high production rates. In this research, a model of producing two products on the same production line for single buyer (or two buyers, one for each product) is presented. Two heuristics have been proposed: one considers time as a continuous variable, and the other is modified from the synchronized model. Department of Applied MathematicsM.
