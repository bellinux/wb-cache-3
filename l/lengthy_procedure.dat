500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{best bet for}} all {{involved}} would be to take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E

Tariff adjustments need to {{be approved}} by the State Executive Council through a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b> Being unable to cover their operating costs, and unable to secure regular revisions of the tariff, the State Water Agencies receive financial assistance from the state governments.|$|E
50|$|The Russian {{government}} was interested gaining {{the expertise of}} foreign specialists and to come to agreement with the monarchs {{of the country where}} such foreigners resided. In some cases, foreigners were accepted who arrived at the border on their own initiative, but acceptance of their services was preceded by a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> to establish their identities and qualifications.|$|E
50|$|Governments usually {{give out}} non-repayable grants to {{encourage}} start-ups. There are also investment tax credits {{that can be}} claimed. One thing {{to be careful about}} government aid is the <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> that may be required before obtaining the funds.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Associated Press, in June 2007 Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a Department of Defense {{spokesman}} defended {{some of the}} men's continued detention: “Multiple {{reviews and}} designations have been conducted since each unlawful enemy combatant was captured, to include during initial detention overseas to <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> at Guantanamo,” ...|$|R

50|$|In 1626, Tilly and his Catholic League troops {{occupied}} Verden, {{causing the}} Lutheran clergy to flee. He {{demanded that the}} Chapter of Bremen allow him to enter the Prince-Archbishopric and while the Chapter declared its loyalty to the Emperor, it delayed {{an answer to the}} request, arguing that it had to consult in a diet with the Estates, which would be a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1626 Tilly and {{his troops}} {{occupied}} the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, which caused {{a flight of}} Lutheran clergy from that territory. He demanded the Bremian Chapter {{to allow him to}} enter the Prince-Archbishopric. The Chapter, now holding the baby, declared again its loyalty to the Emperor and delayed an answer to the request, arguing that it had to consult with the Estates in a Diet first, which would be a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> to {{transfer}} the trail to another US submarine, just developed by the staff, {{was placed on the}} radio broadcast. While Guardfish was at periscope depth copying this urgent message, the Echo came unexpectedly to periscope depth and visually detected Guardfish. The maneuvers that followed by both Guardfish and the Echo were violent and at high speed. Holding on to an alerted contact proved to be impossible and contact with the Echo was lost.|$|E
40|$|The {{set test}} {{is a simple}} rapid test of mental {{function}} which requires the subject to recall items in four different common categories. The test was given to 64 apparently healthy elderly volunteers living in the community. The results of the test correlated closely with those obtained on standard <b>lengthier</b> <b>procedures.</b> The test is recommended as worthy of further trial in riiniral and epidemio-logical settings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method for the quantification of total non-structural carbohydrates in coniferous tissues. The method {{is based on}} a water extraction procedure and the quantification procedure utilizes p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide, (p-HBAH). Results are compared with those from samples of known carbohydrate content and with an alternative established but <b>lengthier</b> <b>procedure.</b> There was good agreement in all comparative tests and the method is now routinely used for carbohy-drate analysis within the UK Forestry Commission...|$|R
40|$|Current REDD {{focus on}} {{countries}} with high forest cover and/or high deforestation rates overlooks important carbon pools like dryland forests, rangelands and agro-forestry systems, likely leading to leakage. - Current UNFCCC forest definition excludes vast areas of open forest, generally {{in the dry}} tropics, likely leading to leakage. - Complicated and <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> exemplified by the current afforestation/reforestation rules of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM A/R) make poor communities or countries unable to participate in land based carbon emission reduction initiatives...|$|R
50|$|One KC-97 {{airframe}} (AF Ser.

50|$|Before {{the bill}} was debated, Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg raised a Point of Order, asking the Speaker to rule on whether the bill should be {{classified}} as a hybrid bill because it affected the private interests of the Bishops of the Church of England. Had the Speaker ruled that {{the bill was}} hybrid, {{it would have been}} subject to a different, more <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b> However, the Speaker ruled that it was not. The BBC claims this was an early attempt to derail the bill's passage through Parliament.|$|E
50|$|The coil, once on, {{is seldom}} removed, as the coiling and {{uncoiling}} is a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b> It is usually only removed {{to be replaced}} by a new or longer coil. The muscles covered by the coil become weakened. Many women have removed the rings for medical examinations. Most women prefer to wear the rings once their clavicle has been lowered, as the area of the neck and collarbone often becomes bruised and discolored. Additionally, the collar feels like an integral part of the body after ten or more years of continuous wear.|$|E
40|$|Oncologic mandibular {{reconstruction}} {{has changed}} significantly {{over the years}} and continues to evolve with the introduction of newer technologies and techniques. Patient demographic, reconstructive, and complication data were obtained from a prospectively maintained clinical database of patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction at our institution. The free fibular flap is now considered the gold standard for mandibular reconstruction. However, in patients with multiple comorbidities, <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> may be less optimal and pedicled flaps, with specific modifications, can yield reasonable outcomes. Technical aspects and comorbidity profiles are examined in the oncological mandibular reconstruction cohort...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{usage and}} {{subsequent}} leakage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{into the environment}} present an urgent need to create materials for selective binding of NSAID drugs, which are highly similar {{to one another in}} structure and functionality. Surface–core double-cross-linking of cationic micelles containing Naproxen or Indomethacin as the template yielded molecularly imprinted nanoparticles (MINPs) for these drugs. The nanoparticle receptors resembled water-soluble proteins in their hydrophilic exterior and hydrophobic core with guest-tailored binding pockets. Their binding selectivity for their templates over other NSAID analogues rivaled that of antibodies prepared through much <b>lengthier</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

50|$|Homology {{search is}} a very <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> that {{requires}} a lot of time. Challenges still remain in handling DNA-DNA searches as well as translated DNA-protein searches because of the vast sizes of databases and the tiny query that is used. PatternHunter has been improved to an upgraded PatternHunter II version, which hastens DNA-protein searches a hundredfold without altering the sensitivity. However, there are plans to improve PatternHunter to attain the high sensitivity of the Smith - Waterman tool while obtaining BLAST pace. A novel translated PatternHunter that intends to hasten tBLASTx. is also in the developmental stages.|$|E
50|$|Constructing nanopillars is {{a simple}} but <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> that can take hours. The process to create nanopillars starts with {{anodizing}} a 2.5 mm thick aluminum foil mold. Anodizing the foil creates pores in the foil a micrometer deep and 60 nanometers wide. The {{next step is to}} treat the foil with phosphoric acid which expands the pores to 130 nanometers. The foil is anodized once more making its pores a micrometer deeper. Lastly, a small amount of gold is added to the pores to catalyze the reaction for the growth of the semiconductor material. When the aluminum is scraped away there is a forest of nanopillars left inside a casing of aluminum oxide.|$|E
50|$|Drawbacks of {{automated}} {{solutions are}} the costs for robots, maintenance and consumables {{as well as}} the complicated setup of the process. Since the automated picking needs digitised information of the spot location, the analysis of the gel image for relevant spots has to be done by software requiring standardised imaging methods and special scanners. This <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> prevents the researcher from spontaneous identifications of a few interesting spots from a single gel {{as well as the}} need to operate the systems at full capacity. The resulting amount of data from the subsequent automated MS analysis is another problem of high throughput systems as their quality is often questionable and the evaluation of these data takes significantly longer than the collection.|$|E
30|$|Minimally {{invasive}} surgical staging, {{more specifically}} cytoreductive surgery, are time-consuming procedures {{that are associated}} with surgeon fatigue that ensues with the course of the procedure. This method offers the benefit of conventional laparoscopy {{at the beginning of the}} case followed by the robotic-assisted portion of the procedure, which can help in the reduction of surgeon fatigue during the course of these <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures.</b> This is an added benefit when the skill of an expert laparoscopist is needed for challenging initial portions of the procedure in the upper abdomen and then for more difficult portions with pelvic disease site affection in the latter portion of the procedure.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel chromatography for the rapid isolation of active ribosomes from bacteria {{without the use of}} harsh conditions or <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> that damage ribosomes. Ribosomes interact with an alkyl linker attached to the resin, apparently through their RNA component. Examples are given with ribosomes from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans, and with clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The ribosomes obtained by this method are unusually intact, so that highly active ribosomes can now be isolated from the clinical isolates, enabling significantly improved in vitro functional assays that will greatly assist the discovery and development of new ribosomally targeted antibiotics...|$|R
25|$|Normally removal is not complicated; removal {{difficulties}} {{have been}} reported with a frequency of 6.2%, based on 849 removals. Removal difficulties include: multiple incisions, capsule fragments remaining, pain, multiple visits, deep placement, <b>lengthy</b> removal <b>procedure,</b> or other.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this was}} the typical mode of operation, in cases where fast {{launching}} and recovery was essential for escape (see below), the floatplanes could be launched without their floats, and ditched upon landing, saving the time spent recovering and re-hangaring the aircraft, which was a complex and <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b> This had {{the added benefit of}} eliminating the weight and considerable drag of the large and bulky floats, which in turn increased the speed and range of the aircraft, but made any recovery of the aircraft after completing the mission impossible (for a similar defensive measure involving catapult-launched, disposable aircraft used by Allied convoy groups in the Battle of the Atlantic, see CAM ship). In extreme circumstances, theoretically the aircraft could be launched and abandoned altogether while the submarine beat a hasty retreat, leaving the crews to fly their missions with no hope of return, perhaps as a kamikaze mission.|$|E
50|$|Decalcification is a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure,</b> as bone pieces {{have to be}} left in the decalcifying {{agent for}} several days or even weeks, {{depending}} on the size of the bone. Traditional methods of handling hard tissues, i.e. bone and teeth, usually present a problem to both the pathologist and histotechnologist. Many of the grossing and cutting-in techniques in current usage for these tissues dictate the use of gross sectioning procedures with a high-speed saw and/or long periods in a decalcifying solution, prior to reducing the specimen to a size that can be easily processed, embedded and sectioned. Frequently the poor quality thin sections obtained when these methods are employed contribute to the already difficult task of evaluating the pathology and making a correct diagnosis. With the introduction of Low Speed Saws, it is now possible to routinely and rapidly reduce undecalcified surgical specimens of hard tissue, to a thickness of 2-3 mm, without compromising the integrity of the tissue.|$|E
50|$|Another {{major change}} in the {{gameplay}} of Second Edition was the new method of handling dilemmas. Instead of using First Edition's <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> of a 'seed phase', which could last upwards of 15 minutes, Second Edition employs an 'on-the-fly' method for constructing dilemma combinations. Whereas a First Edition player was constrained to using the same dilemmas in each game of a tournament, the Second Edition player has a side deck, or 'dilemma pile' from which to draw a random selection of dilemmas {{based on the number}} of personnel the opponent uses in a given mission attempt. This concept is similar to First Edition's Q-Flash side deck, and also to a rules variant of First Edition introduced by a group of players from the San Francisco area called 'Trek 1.5'. This more dynamic method of selecting dilemmas is dependent on a player's ability to remember which personnel his/her opponent has played and their ability to satisfy a dilemma's requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Ethnic Georgians {{who have}} {{returned}} to the Gali district and want to obtain Abkhaz passports, according to Abkhazian law, should undergo <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> which also include a requirement to submit documented proof that they renounced their Georgian citizenship. President Bagapsh was inclined to regard Georgians in Gali as [...] "Georgianised Abkhazians." [...] According to Bagapsh, these were actually ethnic Abkhaz people who were [...] "Georgianised" [...] during the long process of the Georgianisation of Abkhazia that culminated during the rule of Joseph Stalin and Lavrenti Beria. So in his official speeches, Bagapsh often added the Gali Georgians to population estimates of the Abkhaz, disregarding the fact that they still thought of themselves as ethnic Georgians rather than Abkhaz.|$|R
30|$|The {{regulatory}} environment for innovation is {{in a bad}} shape as well, most probably also explaining why private investors stay away from Greece. Greece has an overregulated legal framework that puts substantial burdens and <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedures</b> on its entrepreneurs and business owners regarding entry regulations, property registration and obtaining or extending licenses or permits, as well as reporting duties, {{as measured by the}} World Bank (2012) indicator. In 2010, Greece ranked 109 th out of 183 countries, far below any other Euro-zone economy (with Italy the second lowest at 78 th). As the European Commissio (2010, 43) puts it, “the business environment also suffers from obstacles to starting a business, the little protection given to investors and the difficulty to access finance”.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{the region}} has {{invested}} insufficiently in critical infrastructure, and cross-border trading systems suffer {{from a lack of}} uniformity and compatibility.

50|$|One-day-visas for East Berlin {{were now}} issued in a speeded up procedure; visas for longer stays and visas for East Germany proper needed a prior {{application}}, {{which could be}} a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure.</b> To ease the application for West Berliners seeking such Eastern visas, the GDR Foreign Ministry was later allowed to open Offices for the Affairs of Visits and Travelling (link=no) in West Berlin, but {{were not allowed to}} show any official symbols of East Germany. The Eastern officials working commuted every morning and evening between East and West Berlin. Their uniforms showed no official symbols except the name Büro für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten. They accepted visa applications and handed out confirmed visas issued in the East to the West Berlin applicants. A shed formerly housing one such Büro für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten can be found on Waterlooufer 5-7 in Berlin-Kreuzberg, close to Hallesches Tor underground station.

5000|$|After {{the arrest}} of Nicolas Fouquet in 1661, Aubert de Fontenay found himself in {{financial}} difficulties. In 1663, his properties in Paris and Fontenay en Brie were confiscated. At his death in 1668, his creditors and his family embarked on a <b>lengthy</b> <b>procedure</b> for {{the distribution of the}} assets of the estate. In January 1669, Marie Chastelain, Pierre Aubert's widow, gave to Roger de Pardaillan de Gondrin and his wife Marie Chastelain part of all her movable and immovable property, including the castle of Fontenay. In 1674, Roger de Pardaillan de Gondrin and his wife Marie Chastelain were formally recognized, by [...] "arrest", as the proprietors for the time being of the lordship of Fontenay en Brie.In February 1679, Roger de Pardaillan de Gondrin, who was suspected making counterfeit money in the castle of Fontenay, was denounced in a letter to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, which claimed that he was using armed guards to transport foundries, tools, metals, and chemicals, from Paris to Fontenay en Brie, for contefeiting purposes.
