40|$|Compound {{materials}} made of an {{epoxy resin}} reinforced with different amounts of carbon fibers, were prepared by two different lamination techniques. The first one consists {{in the application}} of 1 Kg/cm 2 of pressure on the <b>laminated</b> <b>materials,</b> whereas, in the other <b>laminated</b> <b>materials</b> were put under a vacuum action of 1 atm. Results show that the flexion and tension strengths of composites are improved considerably with the increments in the carbon fiber content. Resulting composite materials show better mechanical behavior when they work under tension stresses rather than when they are exposed to flexion stress, because of under flexion testing, fibers eventually break leading the material to inevitable failure, at low stress level. When the compound materials are tested under tension, the carbon fibers transmit the efforts among them and the material fails until the necessary energy is accumulated to break all the fibers of a single time...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{expansion}} {{has proven}} to be an effective technique for extending the fatigue life of monolithic materials. Although fiber metal <b>laminate</b> <b>materials</b> show improved fatigue performance compared to their monolithic counterparts, the nucleation and growth of small cracks tends to occur early on in the fatigue life of the material, making acceptance of fiber metal laminates in aerospace more difficult. This work examined whether cold expansion could delay this process in fiber metal laminates and increase the fatigue life of these materials at the same time. The results showed that significant differences existed in the residual strain field between the mandrel exit and entry faces resulting in slower fatigue crack growth on the exit face, which also had higher residual strains in the region surrounding the cold expanded hole. Overall, cold expansion is effective at increasing the fatigue life of fiber metal <b>laminate</b> <b>materials,</b> but is less effective at delaying nucleation and growth of small cracks on the entry face.

The calculated shear moduli increased markedly with increasing shear modulus in a cross section of perpendicular-direction lamina of a cross-laminated wood beam. The calculated apparent modulus of elasticity (MOE) of cross-laminated wood beams agreed fairly well with the measured apparent MOE values.
