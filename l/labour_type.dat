40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{continuing}} {{significance of the}} internal labour market construct for shaping human resource management practices in an international investment banking organisation. By adopting a historical perspective this study departs from existing literature and presents new explanations for understanding internal labour market theory in the investment banking industry. It also adds to existing scholarship on labour markets by considering more human resources indicators than have been previously used to differentiate <b>labour</b> market <b>types.</b> A range of approaches have been adopted. The BZW/ ABN AMRO case study has been investigated using both qualitative and quantitative methods and longitudinal and cross-sectional data. The theoretical framework elaborated has two dimensions. The first involves a model which {{highlights the importance of}} the organisational historical context for analysing the origins and functions of internal labour markets. It draws attention to certain recurring interrelated features that ultimately result in the adoption of internalised market arrangements. This aspect of the model also highlights the importance of emerging patterns in internal labour market structures that become evident over time. The second part of the framework involves a typology that establishes the existence of three different <b>labour</b> market <b>types.</b> The study revealed that a historical perspective is extremely valuable for understanding the origins and functions of internal labour markets, and for identifying two internal <b>labour</b> market <b>types,</b> the firm and occupational internal <b>labour</b> market <b>types</b> and also the occupational <b>labour</b> market <b>type</b> or external <b>labour</b> market.

Of 278 women who were unmarried during pregnancy, 61 per cent were cohabiting, 26 per cent were living with adults other than the father and 13 per cent were living alone. Compared with the married women, unmarried women overall were, on average, younger, less educated, of lower social class, in poorer economic circumstances, more dependent on state support and less satisfied with their living arrangements.

Our objective was to systematically unravel variations and gaps in yields due to the combined effects of farm resources and major production variables in a region of premium quality highland coffee. We surveyed 40 coffee producing farms varying in size from small to large in Llano Bonito, Costa Rica to examine their diversity based on their resources. We further conducted an agronomic diagnosis and yield estimates in 97 individual measuring plots in 63 coffee fields over two cropping years (2013 – 2014 and 2014 – 2015). We categorized farm diversity through a resource endowment typology built by combining direct observation with the use of multivariate analysis and clustering techniques. This resulted in four farm types: large farms depending on external <b>labour</b> (<b>Type</b> 1, 25 %), large farms with livestock (Type 2, 20 %), small farms dedicated to coffee (Type 3, 38 %), and small farms with an off-farm income (Type 4, 17 %). We then analysed coffee yield variability and yield gaps through a boundary line approach. The mean yields for two cropping years fluctuated between 2. 5 ± 0. 18 and 1. 6 ± 0. 12 t ha − 1 on farm types 1 and 2 respectively. Though the yields did not differ strongly across farm types, there was a weak tendency (p = 0. 10) towards yield variability between study years. The combined use of farm typology and yield gap analysis revealed multiple farm‐specific production variables that were significantly related to gaps in attainable yields.

For each farm type, we calculated land and labour productivities of maize, sunflower and sesame and assessed maize self-sufficiency. Access to labour during weeding was the main constraint. The hiring out of labour by small farms caused severe reductions in both land and labour productivity. Yield reductions on these farms were due to delayed weeding in own fields. In one Post, Farm type 3 b was not maize self-sufficient. Labour quality was probably impaired by excess alcohol consumption among the poorer farmers (both men and women).

40|$|Background: It is {{more common}} for women in both high- and low-income {{countries}} giving birth in health facilities, to labour in bed. There {{is no evidence that}} this is associated with any advantage for women or babies, although it may be more convenient for staff. Observational studies have suggested that if women lie on their backs during labour this may have adverse effects on uterine contractions and impede progress in labour, and in some women reduce placental blood flow. Objectives: To assess the effects of encouraging women to assume different upright positions (including walking, sitting, standing and kneeling) versus recumbent positions (supine, semi-recumbent and lateral) for women in the first stage of labour on duration of <b>labour,</b> <b>type</b> of birth and other important outcomes for mothers and babies. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2013. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing women randomised to upright versus recumbent positions in the first stage of labour. Data collection and analysis: We used methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for carrying out data collection, assessing study quality and analysing results. Two review authors independently evaluated methodological quality and extracted data for each study. We sought additional information from trial authors as required. We used random-effects analysis for comparisons in which high heterogeneity was present. We reported results using the average risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data.

40|$|In European {{mountain}} areas, shrub encroachment {{resulting from}} farmland abandonment {{is most often}} managed by mechanical operations such as roller chopping or controlled burning, which {{have proved to be}} ineffective and unsustainable. Recent agroecological findings highlight the potential impact of grazing on long-term shrub dynamics. We thus explored the potential contribution of livestock farms to the management of shrub encroachment. We studied the diversity of livestock practices and strategies on the scale of a small mountain valley in France where a land-use management plan was initiated. We interviewed 33 livestock farmers with a comprehensive approach and analysed the data in partnership with local land-use managers. To categorise farming practices, we used an innovative constructivist method based on knowledge engineering techniques and tools such as repertory grids. Our results show that the diversity of land-use practices can be summed up by ten practices related to three management domains: (i) livestock management, that is, splitting herds into batches, leading animals to pasture and breeding choices; (ii) the feeding system, including indoor feeding during the year, the hierarchy between haymaking and grazing in spring and the system’s forage autonomy; and (iii) farmland utilisation and maintenance, which comprises hillside use, spatial configuration of grazed areas, maintenance practices and technical choices to cut meadows. We also show that farmers combine these practices within six types of strategies: ensuring feeding security and simplifying <b>labour</b> (<b>type</b> A), maintaining farmland heritage (type B), taking advantage of hillsides (type C), focusing on animal care (type D), combining areas, periods and batches (type E), or selling on local markets (type F). This makes it possible to identify: (1) farmers’ strategies that have the greatest impact on shrub encroachment; and (2) practices that may develop into more sustainable management of shrub encroachment. Our work is thus a first step in developing sustainable land-use management plans in rural areas threatened by shrub encroachment. In return, this deep understanding of farmers’ strategies allowed us to address socially pertinent scientific issues related to the dynamics of grazed plant communities...|$|E

As such, they offer limited support for handling complex, intellectually and organizationally challenging <b>labour</b> <b>types,</b> such as software development. In {{order to support}} crowdsourcing of the software development processes, the system needs to enact coordination mechanisms which integrate human creativity with machine support. While workflows {{can be used to}} handle highly-structured and predictable labour processes, they are less suitable for software development methodologies where unpredictability is an unavoidable part the process. This is especially true in phases of requirement elicitation and feature development, when both the client and development communities change with time. In this paper we present models and techniques for coordination of human workers in crowdsourced software development envi-ronments. The techniques augment the existing Social Compute Unit (SCU) concept—a general framework for management of ad-hoc human worker teams—with versatile coordination protocols expressed in the Lightweight Social Calculus (LSC). This approach allows us to combine coordination and quality constraints with dynamic assessments of software-user’s desires, while dynamically choosing appropriate software development coordination models.

We find that hired labour and contract labour are substitutes as expected, but that hired labour and family labour are complements. This may reveal complementarities between management tasks (which are specifically for the farm head and family labour) and technical operations (the only operations performed by hired labour). In addition, we find that, in general, crop area payments and Single Farm Payments (SFP) have reduced farm labour, while agri-environmental payments, Less Favoured Area (LFA) payments and investment subsidies have increased it. Our results agree with most of the literature that coupled and decoupled area payments reduce labour use on farms...|$|R

40|$|This aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the demand for labour from trade with a {{selection}} of South Africa’s trading partners. It is expected that labour demand will be greater in trade with developed blocs. Trade between developing blocs, however, {{is thought to be}} more skilled labour intensive and such trade should have greater linkages. This ought to feed through into greater labour demand so that South-South trade may be more ‘labour creating’ than expected. As it is more skill intensive, it may also be more dynamic, which has implications for future growth and development. Factor content methodology is used to assess labour demand. Calculations consider linkages to other sectors (which will increase labour demand) and the use of scarce resources (which has an opportunity cost to labour). The findings support the claim that trade with developing blocs is more professional labour intensive. Evidence that it may be more dynamic and have greater linkages to labour is borne out in exports to SADC. Greater labour demand through linkages, however, is not evident in net trade to SADC. Neither are they of significance in trade with any of the other developing blocs so labour effects due to linkages appear to be negligible. The advantages of South-South trade may rather lie in the dynamic benefits that trade in higher technology goods provides. When scarce resources such as capital and professional labour are taken into account, it is found that labour demand is negative in net trade to all blocs. However, even without the problem of scarce resources, most blocs have a negative demand for labour in net trade. The indication is that with the present trade patterns, South Africa cannot expect trade to increase labour demand. Policy which could improve this situation would be to increase labour force skills, improve the flexibility of the labour market and develop sectors which are both more advanced as well as labour intensive. Despite the negative impact of trade on labour in general, it is found that trade does differ by direction and that for each <b>labour</b> <b>type</b> there are certain blocs where labour demand is positive. This is also the case in net trade for particular sectors. Such information could be used as part of a targeted trade policy to assist in the marketing of particular sectors in trade and also for increasing labour demand for certain labour groups. ...|$|E
40|$|Objetivos: Estudiar la incidencia de fallos y complicaciones neurológicas de la {{analgesia}} epidural en obstetricia, así como hacer un seguimiento y análisis de las mismas. Pacientes y método: Estudio observacional prospectivo de gestantes que recibieron analgesia epidural para el trabajo de parto en un hospital terciario durante 2009 y 2010. Se registraron los datos demográficos maternoinfantiles, del trabajo de parto y el tipo de parto así como las complicaciones que se produjeron tanto durante la realización de la técnica como durante el peri- y postparto. Se siguieron a todas las pacientes hasta su alta hospitalaria identificándose y tratándose las posibles complicaciones hasta su resolución. Resultados: Se incluyeron 438 gestantes. Se dividieron las complicaciones en 2 etapas: peripartum y postpartum. En el periparto se identificaron, de mayor a menor frecuencia, las siguientes complicaciones: analgesia lateralizada (16, 4 %), punción hemática (8, 7 %), parestesias (8, 2 %), técnica dificultosa (5, 2 %), analgesia ineficaz (2, 7 %), hipotensión arterial (2, 5 %) y bloqueo subdural (0, 2 %). En el postparto: lumbalgia (18, 5 %), retención urinaria (3, 4 %), cefalea post-punción dural (1, 4 %), neuropatías periféricas (0, 9 %) e hipoestesia prolongada (0, 2 %). Todas las complicaciones se resolvieron ad integrum con tratamiento conservador salvo un caso de cefalea que precisó la realización de un parche hemático. Conclusiones: La alta tasa de fallos de la analgesia epidural en obstetricia así como la posibilidad de complicaciones neurológicas pueden resolverse siguiendo unas normas de buena práctica que incluyen la aspiración previa a la inyección, la dosis test y la revisión periódica del catéter. Resulta imprescindible conocer dichas complicaciones para su evaluación y tratamiento precoz. Objectives: To {{determine the}} incidence of failures and neurological complications related to the epidural analgesia for labour and to analyze their evolution and pathogenesis. Patients and methods: Prospective and descriptive study in pregnant women who received an epidural analgesia for labour in a third level hospital over a 11 -month period. The following data were registered: demographic mother and child information, <b>labour,</b> <b>type</b> of childbirth and complications during the procedure and during the peripartum and postpartum periods. All women were followed up to their hospitable discharge with an identification and treatment of the observed complications up to their resolution. Results: We enrolled 438 patients. Complications were separated in 2 phases: peripartum and postpartum. In the peripartum period were identified, from bigger than minor frequency, the following complications: unilateral analgesia (16, 4 %), hematic punction (8. 7 %), paresthesias (8. 2 %), difficult technique (5. 2 %), ineffective analgesia (2. 7 %), hypotension (2. 5 %) and subdural block (0. 2 %). In the postpartum period: lumbar pain (18. 5 %), urinary retention (3. 4 %), post-dural puncture headache (1. 4 %), peripheral neurophaty (0. 9 %) and prolonged hypoesthesia (0. 2 %). All complications were resolved ad integrum by a conservative treatment except one patient who needed an epidural blood patching because of a refractory headache. Conclusions: The high frequency of failure of the epidural analgesia in obstetrics {{as well as the}} possibility of neurological complications can be solved following several norms of a good practice that include the previous aspiration to the injection, the test-dose and the continuous inspection of the catheter.

40|$|Gains {{and losses}} from trade {{liberalization}} are often unevenly distributed inside a country. For example, if budget shares {{vary according to}} household income, changes in commodity prices will redistribute an overall welfare change between household types. Household incomes will also be differentially affected. Sectoral differences in factor-intensity mean that changes in industrial structure cause redistribution of income between primary factors. Particular primary factors (such as capital, or less skilled labour) may contribute disproportionately to the incomes of certain household types. The fortunes of such households indirectly depend on the prospects of particular sectors. We emphasize these distributive issues, especially those arising from the income side. At {{the same time we}} distinguish households by regions (within the country). The regional distinction sharpens the contrast between groups of households. Particular regions have their own patterns of economic activity and so are differently affected by changes in the industrial protection structure. Since regional household incomes depend closely on value-added from local industries, economic change will tend to redistribute income between regional households. If the regional concentration of poverty is more than we could predict by regional primary factor endowments and industry structure, the addition of a regional dimension will add power to our analysis of income distribution beyond the mere addition of interesting regional detail. The paper deals with these issues more fully. We extend previous regional modeling of Brazil to include the intra-household dimension, addressing poverty and income distribution issues that may be caused by trade integration. An applied general equilibrium (AGE) inter-regional model of Brazil underlies our analysis, with a detailed specification of households. The model is static and solved with GEMPACK. The Representative Household (RH) hypothesis is abandoned; instead a micro-simulation (MS) model is used to track changes in household income and expenditure patterns. This micro-simulation model is built upon two Brazilian household studies: (1) the Household Budget Survey (POF, IBGE, 1999) covers detailed expenditure patterns for 16, 013 households and 11 regions in Brazil in 1996; (2) the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD, IBGE, 1997) is a yearly survey that includes detailed information about household employment and income sources, with 331, 263 observations. We integrate the two data sources to produce a detailed mapping of expenditure and income sources for 112, 055 Brazilian households and 263, 938 adults, distinguishing 42 activities, 52 commodities, and 27 regions. We link the AGE and MS models together, solving them iteratively to get consistency between results. After a shock the AGE model communicates changes in wages and employment by industry and <b>labour</b> <b>type</b> to the MS model that individually simulates the changes in employment, income and expenditure patterns for each household. The new expenditure pattern is then communicated to the AGE model, and the process is repeated until the two models converge. The final results from the MS model enable us to estimate changes in poverty and income distribution measures, both nationally and for regions within Brazil. We use the model to analyze poverty and income distribution impacts of the Free Trade Area of Americas formation upon the Brazilian economy. In the particular simulation we examine, freer trade leads to increased employment, especially for lower-paid workers. Poor households, which contain more unemployed adults, benefit most.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the potential {{effects of the}} Doha round of trade negotiations upon poverty and income distribution in Brazil, using an applied general equilibrium (AGE) and micro-simulation model of Brazil tailored for income distribution and poverty analysis. Of particular importance {{is the fact that}} the Representative Household hypothesis is replaced by a very detailed representation of households. The model distinguishes 10 different <b>labour</b> <b>types,</b> and has 270 different household expenditure patterns. Income can originate from 41 different production activities (which produce 52 commodities), located in 27 different regions inside the country. The AGE model communicates to a micro-simulation model that has 112, 055 Brazilian households and 263, 938 adults. Economic activity in Brazil, a large country, is spread unevenly across the territory. Manufacturing industries are concentrated in the South-East region, while agriculture, although more evenly distributed geographically, is the main source of income of the Center-West states. Poverty, on the other hand, is a pervasive phenomenon in the country, which has one of the worse income distributions in the world. The poorest states in Brazil (defined based on the share of population below the poverty line) are concentrated in the North-Eastern states...|$|R
40|$|Background. Childbirth medicalization {{has reduced}} the parturient’s {{opportunity}} to labour and deliver in a spontaneous position, constricting her to assume the recumbent one. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare recumbent and alternative positions in terms of <b>labour</b> process, <b>type</b> of delivery, neonatal wellbeing, and intrapartum fetal head rotation. Methods. We conducted an observational cohort study on women at pregnancy term. Primiparous women with physiological pregnancies and single cephalic fetuses were eligible for the study. We considered data about maternal-general characteristics, <b>labour</b> process, <b>type</b> of delivery, and neonatal wellbeing at birth. Patients were divided into two groups: Group-A if they spent more than 50 % of labour in a recumbent position and Group-B when in alternative ones. Results. 225 women were recruited (69 in Group-A and 156 in Group-B). We found significant differences between the groups in terms of labour length, Numeric Rating Scale score and analgesia request rate, type of delivery, need of episiotomy, and fetal occiput rotation. No differences were found in terms of neonatal outcomes. Conclusion. Alternative maternal positioning may positively influence labour process reducing maternal pain, operative vaginal delivery, caesarean section, and episiotomy rate. Women should be encouraged to move and deliver in the most comfortable position...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} newborns who were submitted to mechanical ventilation at the Neonatal Intermediate Care Unit was made between July 1991 and June 1994. Mechanical ventilation in such a unit should be transitory and not exceed 24 hours. Information concerning pregnancy, <b>labour,</b> neonates, <b>type</b> of ventilation and its problems was gathered. Forty seven neonates were ventilated. The average ventilation time was six hours (1 - 20 hours). The main cause of ventilation was hyaline membrane disease which occurred in 24 % of all cases. Mortality observed was 16. 6 % and some sequellae were registered which were related not only to ventilation {{but also to the}} basic pathology in 26 % of cases.

40|$|Skilled {{labourer}} {{is a key}} {{resource that}} has {{a direct impact on}} the success of any construction project. This study analyses the present situation of the construction industry in Sri Lanka with respect to skilled labourer by assessing the need {{to increase the number of}} skilled labourers and their skill level by identifying the causes and effects of the shortage of skilled labour. This paper summarises the results of a survey conducted in Sri Lanka and propose mitigation measures to rectify the problem. This is a timely and needful study in the present context of Sri Lanka with the expected rapid growth of the construction industry especially after the end of the civil war. The objectives of this study are to identify the causes for the shortage of skilled labour in the Sri Lankan construction industry, the resulting effects due to the shortage and to come up with effective mitigation measures. The research was conducted via two types of questionnaire surveys, namely; the individual surveys and the institutional surveys among contractors, consultants and clients represented by Architects, Engineers, Quantity Surveyors, Technical Officers and other similar grades. A project wise analysis was carried out through the institutional questionnaire survey. To support the findings of this research, present salary scales of selected skilled <b>labour</b> <b>types</b> were compared with salary scales of similar overseas opportunities.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a wider study that seeks to {{ascertain}} the types of internal and external labour market practices {{and the extent to which}} labour market arrangements vary between three divisions of the Australian and New Zealand affiliate of an international investment banking institution, BZW/ABN AMRO. Building on earlier work of Althauser and Kalleberg (1981, 1989), this research explores the workings of the internal and external labour market by adopting an integrative internal labour market framework that goes beyond the three-featured model espoused by Althauser and Kalleberg (1981, 1989) and that emphasises recruitment rather than selection criteria. However, this paper will elaborate on the organisation’s recruitment and selection policy and practices. More specifically, by adopting an internal labour market construct the paper will seek to analyse the recruitment and selection practices in the three divisions of the international investment banking affiliate and it will ascertain the importance of selection criteria for differentiating internal <b>labour</b> market <b>types.</b> It will also highlight how these practices vary from the perceptions held by both management and employees and from the ideal types outlined in the typology. The paper concludes by emphasising the significance of expanding the internal labour market typology to include selection criteria for the purpose of differentiating <b>labour</b> market <b>types</b> in an international investment banking institution. 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results from a CGE model of interactions {{between public and private}} health care, outputs of non-health goods and national welfare in a small open economy applied to the UK. The effects on welfare of higher provision come through direct gains, affecting the well-being of households, and indirectly, through increases in the effective (i. e. ‘able to work’) endowments of skilled and unskilled labour for use in non-health activities. The paper is innovative in that there have been few applied studies on the multi-sectoral general equilibrium effects of health provision on the non-health economy, in particular the working time effect, and few studies where the endogeneity of labour supplies is not modelled on a wage response function. Evidence, however, suggests that, although the health sector is small, there are strong linkages between health care, other product and labour markets, and policy making. We find that an increase in public health provision leads to higher overall welfare levels through increased worker incomes and direct increases in the well-being of the population, which are reduced if health care- specific skilled labour and capital is accounted for. Also, a rise in the price of pharmaceuticals has adverse overall welfare effects, which are mitigated if the health budget grows so as to maintain previous treatment levels in the public sector. Distributional effects are shown to differ across sectors, <b>labour</b> <b>types</b> and households...|$|R
40|$|The cause(s) of {{increased}} wage inequality in developed nations {{in recent decades}} is a contentious issue in international economics. In the UK, the ratio of non-manual to manual wages increased by 24. 4 percent between 1979 and 1999. Over the same interval, {{there has been an}} increase in the relative supply of skilled workers. This suggests that the increase in the relative wage of skilled labour has been driven by a large increase in relative demand for this <b>type</b> of <b>labour.</b> Two candidates commonly cited as the catalyst behind the demand shift are increased trade between developed countries and unskilled-labour-abundant developing nations, and technical change favouring skilled labour. This thesis contributes to the debate by evaluating the effects of trade and technology on UK wages using a computable general equilibrium framework. Modelling is aided by identifying a larger number of <b>labour</b> <b>types</b> than is the norm and estimating changes in the stocks of four different capital assets over the period of interest. The results, although sensitive to key parameter values, single out technical change as the cause {{of increased}} wage dispersion in the UK, but also raise the possibility that trade has had a significant adverse effect on the relative wage of a narrowly defined group of workers at the bottom end of the skill distribution...|$|R
