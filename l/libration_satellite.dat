40|$|Water {{monomers}} and dimers {{have been}} studied at low temperatures in matrices of solid p-H(2), o-D(2), n-H(2), and n-D(2) using infrared spectroscopy. Our data demonstrate interaction mechanisms between host matrix and guest molecules that {{are different from the}} ones observed in atomic noble gas matrices. Notably both guest/host rotational-rotational interaction and matrix induced modifications of the guest libration modes are observed. We also show that different types of interaction influence the relaxation times of some of guest modes. Water rotates freely in p-H(2) and o-D(2) but librates in n-H(2) and n-D(2). Rotational relaxation is faster in o-D(2) than in p-H(2) and faster in p-H(2) than in Ne. This is attributed to interactions between water rotation and matrix molecule rotation in p-H(2) and o-D(2). In n-H(2) and n-D(2), a strong water libration band is observed in the far-infrared, and strong water monomer vibration bands have <b>libration</b> <b>satellites.</b> Water dimer bands, close to matrix rotation bands, are perturbed by the matrix motions. The H-bonded isomer H(2) O-HOD rapidly converts to the D-bonded form H(2) O-DOH in p-H(2) and in o-D(2) but slowly in n-H(2) and n-D(2) ...|$|R
40|$|Furi, Martelli and Landsberg gave a {{theoretical}} {{explanation of the}} chaotic longitudinal librations of Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn. The analysis was made under the simplifying assumption that the spin axis remains perpendicular to the orbit plane. Here, under the same assumption, we investigate {{the behavior of the}} longitudinal <b>librations</b> of any <b>satellite.</b> Also we show that they are possibly chaotic depending on two parameters: a constant $k$ related to the principal moments of inertia of the satellite, and the eccentricity $e$ of its orbit. We prove that the plane $k$-$e$ contains an open region $Omega$ with the property that the longitudinal <b>librations</b> of any <b>satellite</b> are possibly chaotic if the point $(k,e) $ belongs to this region. Since Hyperion's point is inside $Omega$, the results of this paper are more general than those obtained previously...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the benefits of}} navigating a crewed vehicle between the Earth and the Moon using both ground tracking and satellite-to-satellite tracking. Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) is a new technique that {{has been shown to}} dramatically improve the navigation of lunar <b>satellites,</b> <b>libration</b> orbiters, and Earth orbiting satellites using scalar intersatellite observations. In this paper, LiAISON is applied to the problem of navigating a crewed vehicle to the Moon. It has been found that LiAISON observations improve the navigation accuracy enough {{to reduce the number of}} active ground tracking stations from six to three...|$|R
40|$|Three comets are {{now known}} to be {{at or near the}} 1 / 1 {{resonance}} with Jupiter: P/Slaughter-Burnham, P/Boethin and the newly discovered P/Ge-Wang. Although details of the individual orbits differ, the three comets have very similar dynamical behavior: their orbits show many transitions between the different types of resonant motion (<b>satellite</b> <b>libration,</b> anti-satellite libration, and circulating motion). The stochastic character of such cometary orbits, mainly due to encounters with Jupiter is investigated using Lyapunov Characteristic Indicators. For each comet of the group, we study the influences on the stochasticity of initial eccentricity, inclination, longitude of node, and l-l(sub J) (mean longitude of comet minus mean longitude of Jupiter). We present here our first results for P/Slaughter-Burnham...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the strong {{mathematical}} and physical parallels between orbit-orbit and spin-orbit resonances, the dynamics of mutual orbit perturbations between two satellites about a massive planet are examined, exploiting an approach previously adopted in the study of spin-orbit coupling. Resonances are found to exist when the mean orbital periods are commensurable with respect to some rotating axis, which condition also involves the apsidal and nodal motions of both satellites. In any resonant state the satellites are effectively trapped in separate potential wells, and a single variable is found to describe the simultaneous <b>librations</b> of both <b>satellites.</b> The <b>librations</b> in longitude are 180 deg out-of-phase, with fixed amplitude ratio that depends only on their relative masses and semimajor axes. The theory is applicable to Saturn's resonant pairs Titan-Hyperion and Mimas-Tethys, and in these cases the calculated libration periods are in reasonably good agreement with the observed periods...|$|R
40|$|Given the non-spherical {{shape of}} Enceladus (Thomas et al., 2007), the {{satellite}} will experience gravitational torques {{that will cause}} it to physically librate as it orbits Saturn. Physical libration would produce a diurnal oscillation in the longitude of Enceladus tidal bulge which, could {{have a profound effect}} on the diurnal stresses experienced by the surface of the satellite. Although Cassini ISS has placed an observational upper limit on Enceladus libration amplitude of F < 1. 5 deg (Porco et al., 2006), smaller amplitudes can still have geologically significant consequences. Here we present the first detailed description of how physical libration affects tidal stresses and how those stresses then might affect geological processes including crack formation and propagation, south polar eruption activity, and tidal heating. Our goal is to provide a framework for testing the hypothesis that geologic features on Enceladus are produced by tidal stresses from diurnal physical and optical <b>librations</b> of the <b>satellite...</b>|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{study on}} delayed {{feedback}} control for <b>libration</b> of tethered <b>satellite</b> system was conducted. To investigate {{the effect of}} gravity on {{the motion of the}} tethered satellite system, the elasticity of the tether and the aerodynamic drag force affecting the system were assumed to be negligible. It is necessary to assign practical values to the nondimensional force affecting the tethered subsatellite to emulate its in-plane motion in elliptic orbits. These variations in tether length occur once per seven orbits in the numerical simulations, but once per three orbits in the experiments. The results obtained reveal that DFC using tether length rate control can stabilize chaotic librational motion of a tethered satellite system in an elliptic orbit to a periodic motion. A tethered <b>satellite</b> system whose <b>libration</b> is stabilized to a periodic motion can serve as a sky hook, or space-born transportation system, to periodically pick up launched payloads or capture and release space debris...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{explores the}} dynamic {{properties}} of the planar system of an ellipsoidal satellite in an equatorial orbit about an oblate primary. In particular, we investigate the conditions for which the satellite is bound in librational motion or when the satellite will circulate {{with respect to the}} primary. We find the existence of stable equilibrium points about which the satellite can librate, and explore both the linearized and non-linear dynamics around these points. Absolute bounds are placed on the phase space of the libration-orbit coupling through the use of zero-velocity curves that exist in the system. These zero-velocity curves are used to derive a sufficient condition for when the <b>satellite’s</b> <b>libration</b> is bound to less than 90 ◦. When this condition is not satisfied so that circulation of the satellite is possible, the initial conditions at zero libration angle are determined which lead to circulation of the satellite. Exact analytical conditions for circulation and the maximum libration angle are derived for the case of a small satellite in orbits of any eccentricity...|$|R

5000|$|A {{satellite}} {{system is a}} set of gravitationally bound objects in orbit around a planetary mass object or minor planet. Generally speaking, it {{is a set of}} natural satellites (moons), although such systems may also consist of bodies such as circumplanetary disks, ring systems, moonlets, minor-planet moons and artificial satellites any of which may themselves have {{satellite system}}s of their own. Some bodies also possess quasi-satellites that have orbits gravitationally influenced by their primary, but are generally not considered {{to be part of a}} satellite system. Satellite systems can have complex interactions including magnetic, tidal, atmospheric and orbital interactions such as orbital resonances and <b>libration.</b> Individually major <b>satellite</b> objects are designated in Roman numerals. Satellite systems are referred to either by the possessive adjectives of their primary (e.g. [...] "Jovian system"), or less commonly by the name of their primary (e.g. [...] "Jupiter system"). Where only one satellite is known, or it is a binary orbiting a common centre of gravity, it may be referred to using the hyphenated names of the primary and major satellite (e.g. the [...] "Earth-Moon system").|$|R
40|$|The {{gravitational}} force exerted by a central planet deforms its orbiting moons (tides) and periodically changes their rotation (librations). Tides and librations of large icy satellites rotating synchronously with their orbital motion are usually studied separately but we here show that tides strongly reduce the libration amplitude of large icy satellites with a subsurface ocean. Moreover, libration also slightly changes the tides. Periodic tides affect libration in three ways: first the periodic tidal bulges modify the gravitational torque exerted {{by the central}} planet on the satellite, secondly torques between the periodic tidal bulges of a solid layer and the static shape of another solid layer couple the libration of the ice shell and solid interior, and thirdly, the zonal tides periodically change the polar moment of the satellite, which acts as the inertia for rotational motion. We develop a formalism to include these elastic effects {{in the study of}} librations and calculate the amplitudes of the longitudinal librations at orbital period for the largest icy satellites in the Solar System: Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan. Without a subsurface ocean, elastic effects on libration are of the order of a few percent. However, if a subsurface ocean exists as indicated by several observations for the satellites considered, elastic tides have a crucial effect. If the solid layers of the satellites are considered rigid, the libration amplitude is at least one order of magnitude larger than for an entirely solid satellite. Periodic elastic tidal deformations of the layers, in particular of the ice shell, counterbalance this large increase and keep the libration amplitude {{at the level of the}} <b>libration</b> of the <b>satellite</b> without subsurface ocean. Besides gravitationally forced librations, seasonal variations in the atmosphere of Titan also cause the rotation of Titan to change on a seasonal timescale. We show that tidal elastic effects can strongly increase the amplitude of these long-term variations in the rotation rate by a factor of about four with respect to a rigid shell. We predict that these variations can have an amplitude above the detection limit of the Cassini radar. status: publishe...|$|R
