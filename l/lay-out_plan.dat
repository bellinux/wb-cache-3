The {{structure of a}} city including density and height of buildings, number and size of places covered by natural plants has a considerable effect {{on the development of}} heat island as well as smog situations. Nevertheless climate information is insufficiently used by city-planners. The features of heat island characterized by hot and even by cold weather give useful information about the structure of the town. Usually the crowded inner town is the warmest place opposed to the suburb. Our purpose was to find out local places which are strongly different from the expectation. We were looking for special artificial solutions which can be used to influence our local environment. First, clear summer and winter days were selected and analyzed. Then, synchronous observation of the studied Hungarian city (Budapest) measured at the urban and the suburban area was compared. The spatial distribution of UHI was analyzed on critical days together with composite of surface meteorological observations, satellite images and the <b>lay-out</b> <b>plan</b> of Budapest. Selected places was visited and analyzed in the context of urban fabric. Key words: satellite image, temperature, urban planning 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract— In {{a crisis}} of city {{identity}}, an effort to build city identity is required by involving local people to participate in building their cities. The roles of city development planners and managers are not only to formulate the future plan of a city physically and the spacing that is deterministic, rational, and functional but also to direct the involvement aspects of the space agents. It is realized that identity city development based on local wealth will involve more {{the roles of the}} people, and it is related to the social and culture of the people. Consequently, it is required a plan requiring patience and a long period. The things related to culture are not visible shortly for people out of the concerning community because the cultural things are focused on mind. Therefore, the solutions for problems occurred in a community require a qualitative understanding. Through the qualitative approach, {{it will be able to}} reveal the cultural meanings so that the solutions and the development efforts on the basis of understanding cultural meanings of a community will be more meaningful positively for their life than providing them ready-made goods made by planners or program providers. A planner should free their minds of an idea that physical planning will result understanding to people or sense of community. The explanation emphasizes that in planning and development do not start from merely physical arrangement but it emphasizes more in the existence of the local community. Keywords : city identity, sense of community, local community A. THE DESTRUCTION OF CITY WITHOUT IDENTITY: LEARNING FROM EXPERIENCE In the efforts of arranging space and Indonesian territory management, it has been composed the Territory <b>Lay-Out</b> <b>Plan</b> beginning from National level to City, Regency, and even Sub District. However, in fact, most of the plans made steeply are just plans without proper realization. There are some problems faced in the plan implementation, but the protruding ones are the law enforcement and the lack of community involvement. The reality shows that between the plan composed and the reality in real life has wide difference. Moreover, people aspirations are not accommodated well. However, city space engineering wanted has human dimension that should have started from the perspective of “space engineering in the context of human life” in order that the effects are able to encourage the emergence of Edi Purwanto, Lecturer at Department of Architecture, Faculty of Engineering, Diponegoro University, email : edipurw 4 nto@yahoo. com, phone : + 62247470690. human social design and has dignity. The approaches of city space planning and designing in Indonesia, so far, frequently apply the pattern of top-down and lack of involvement the elements of community as the agents of city space (bottom up). Even, sometimes it was conducted by pitching upon theories from western cultural or literature treasures, and then applied. As the results, the theory adoption is sometimes inappropriate with local situation because the theories applied emerge from sosio-spatial situations that are significantly different with the handed local problems. City space planning and designing are not merely based on the approaches of objective-positivist without considering the subjective-phenomenological reality felt by space agents as the users. The objective reality of city space is actually only a little part of the whole reality that is rich of subjective responses from the human occupying it in a series of human-space dialectic process lasting continuously in a long term. Thus, the approaches of city space development that is getting sharper and more meaningful need to be applied through subjectivephenomenological approaches in order to dive and to earth until the bottom and the root of the problems through continuous dialogical process and based on the attitudes of cautious, wise, and smart. So far, Jane Jacobs have actually cried out the paradigm of planning, which is too technocratic and deterministic, through her books, particularly the books published in more than thirty years ago, The Death and Life of American Cities (1962). In this book, Jacobs shows the process of city planning and designing is based too much on technical-mathematical considerations and tends to result a less human environment with no identity. She offers the approaches of city planning and designing that is more humanistic giving attention to the available social capital aspect. Next, according to Jacobs (1962), a city should “have something offered to everyone because a city is created by everyone”. With nothing to offer to everyone, a city is just like a labyrinth that makes anyone gets lost and feels alienated. On the other hand, the life destruction of American cities was, one of them, caused by the city planning system based on efficiency. The streets were made in grid pattern, the buildings were built in uniform shapes, and all in square, causing the people live separately. When the industrial revolution occurred in America in 1760 - 1863 caused the increase of urbanization level that it increased the population in cities and added problems in the cities like communication. The problems of communication caused high mobility so that it required the availability of facilities to support the activities, such as railway stations, offices, hotels, markets, shopping centers, and so forth that changed the city structure. The rapid changes with the nonexistence of balance in city facilities created slum area, which is no...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{aversion to}} technological {{risks of the}} society requires the development of inherently safer and environmentally friendlier processes, besides assuring the economic competitiveness of the industrial activities. The different forms of impact (e. g. environmental, economic and societal) are frequently characterized by conflicting reduction strategies and must be holistically {{taken into account in}} order to identify the optimal solutions in process design. Though the literature reports an extensive discussion of strategies and specific principles, quantitative assessment tools are required to identify the marginal improvements in alternative design options, to allow the trade-off among contradictory aspects and to prevent the “risk shift”. In the present work a set of integrated quantitative tools for design assessment (i. e. design support system) was developed. The tools were specifically dedicated to the implementation of sustainability and inherent safety in process and plant design activities, with respect to chemical and industrial processes in which substances dangerous for humans and environment are used or stored. The tools were mainly devoted to the application in the stages of “conceptual” and “basic design”, when the project is still open to changes (due to the large number of degrees of freedom) which may comprise of strategies to improve sustainability and inherent safety. The set of developed tools includes different phases of the design activities, all through the lifecycle of a project (inventories, process flow diagrams, preliminary plant <b>lay-out</b> <b>plans).</b> The development of such tools gives a substantial contribution to fill the present gap in the availability of sound supports for implementing safety and sustainability in early phases of process design. The proposed decision support system was based on the development of a set of leading key performance indicators (KPIs), which ensure the assessment of economic, societal and environmental impacts of a process (i. e. sustainability profile). The KPIs were based on impact models (also complex), but are easy and swift in the practical application. Their full evaluation is possible also starting from the limited data available during early process design. Innovative reference criteria were developed to compare and aggregate the KPIs {{on the basis of the}} actual sitespecific impact burden and the sustainability policy. Particular attention was devoted to the development of reliable criteria and tools for the assessment of inherent safety in different stages of the project lifecycle. The assessment follows an innovative approach in the analysis of inherent safety, based on both the calculation of the expected consequences of potential accidents and the evaluation of the hazards related to equipment. The methodology overrides several problems present in the previous methods proposed for quantitative inherent safety assessment (use of arbitrary indexes, subjective judgement, build-in assumptions, etc.). A specific procedure was defined for the assessment of the hazards related to the formations of undesired substances in chemical systems undergoing “out of control” conditions. In the assessment of layout plans, “ad hoc” tools were developed to account for the hazard of domino escalations and the safety economics. The effectiveness and value of the tools were demonstrated by the application to a large number of case studies concerning different kinds of design activities (choice of materials, design of the process, of the plant, of the layout) and different types of processes/plants (chemical industry, storage facilities, waste disposal). An experimental survey (analysis of the thermal stability of isomers of nitrobenzaldehyde) provided the input data necessary to demonstrate the method for inherent safety assessment of materials...|$|R

The open fields of England describes the system of agriculture that operated in medieval England before the establishment of present-day hedged farms surrounded by hedges or walls. The volume encompasses a wide range of primary data not previously assembled, to which are added the results of new research based upon a fifty-year study of open-field remains and their related documents. The whole of England is examined, describing eight different kinds of field-systems that have been identified and relating them to their associated land-use and settlement. Details of field structure are explained such as the demesne, the lord’s land, and the tenants’ holdings, as well as tenurial arrangements and farming methods. Previous explanations of open-field origins and possible antecedents to medieval fields are discussed. Various types of archaeological and historical evidence relevant to Saxon-period settlements and fields are presented, followed by {{the development of a new}} theory to explain the <b>lay-out</b> and <b>planned</b> nature of many field systems found in the central belt of England. A summary and suggestions for future research conclude the text. The numerous maps and photographs illustrate the contrasting complexities of different field systems. Of particular interest is the Gazetteer, which is organized by historic counties. Each county has a summary of its fields, including tabulated data and sources for future research, touching on the demesne, yardland size, work-service, assarts, and the physical remains of ridge and furrow. The Gazetteer acts as a national hand-list of field systems, opening the subject up to further research, and will prove essential to scholars of medieval agriculture...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess one of the {{possible}} technological options of CO 2 capture through the technology of oxy-combustion in order to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions,that is the main greenhouse gas that contributes to increase the global warming. Particularly, we focused this issue in the case of Spain, where is being developed a project which consists in the construction of a test facility for advanced technologies for CO 2 capture in coal power generation. The general design criteria of El Bierzo Test Facility has the following main characteristics: modularity: layout as independent but interconnected modules (combustion, oxy-combustion, flue gas treatment…) allowing simultaneous or separate operation for independent study of processes; flexibility: possibility of operation under a wide range of operating conditions, including different coals and combustions from air mode to oxymode; integration: designed to study full process integration of the different units and systems; efficiency: conceived giving great importance to heat integration and performance optimisation without putting into compromise requirements for flexible testing. Extension: layout allowing for extensions at a later stage in line with any technological progress and/or strategic development; safety: risk analysis assessment (hazop methodology) to be performed to improve safety and operability of the process and safety instrumented systems (sis) will fulfil requirements of functional safety standards; monitoring: comprehensive and advanced in-furnace monitoring of the combustion and CO 2 capture processes. Concerning to the design criteria the conclusion is that, in particular, the modularity, flexibility, monitoring and control capabilities and the <b>planned</b> <b>lay-out,</b> allowing for extensions at a later stage in line with any technological progress and/or strategic developments is well taken care of. As regards to the plant configuration, we can conclude that the installation offers the possibility of operating under a wide range of selected operating conditions, particularly in different degrees of oxicombustion (from air to pure oxygen), allowing for the simulation of different scenarios of the operation of pulverized coal power stations. This would offer the possibility to obtain useful results and conclusions towards the potential application on utility scale...|$|R
40|$|Office {{building}} vacancy {{is becoming}} an increasingly visible part of the cityscape. Billboards shout “for rent” and office locations look abandoned even {{in the middle of}} the day. Still, new office buildings and locations are being developed, adding up to the built environment. As hardly any office buildings are demolished, adapted or transformed, the vacancy increases. Office buildings are developed though there is no demand for new office buildings. Or 8 ̆ 5 is there? New office buildings seem to be preferred by office users, who leave existing buildings behind, buildings that do not attract new users but remain vacant and become redundant and obsolete. “Throwawayism” is threatening the built environment, representing the unsustainable attitude of all actors involved in the design, construction and use of commercial real estate. This book starts with an inquiry into the cause of long term vacancy, followed by a study of how to cope with vacancy by means of residential transformation. The book is concluded by recommendations for how to prevent or limit long term vacancy in future office developments. This research focuses on Amsterdam, the largest city of the Netherlands, with the largest office market and the highest vacancy rates. The problem of long term vacancy is international though, and cities like London, Chicago, New York, Toronto and Tokyo struggle with it. Causes of structural vacancy Structural vacancy is defined as vacancy of the same space for three years or longer. Of course; the cause of structural vacancy is that there are too much office space within a certain market, city or location. Within a geographically limited market, office users move from one building to another, leaving certain buildings vacant. If these buildings are not rented out again they become structurally vacant. Structural vacancy is a problem for the owners of the buildings as it causes value loss, and is also a societal problem as it causes income loss for the government, depreciation of properties and a downwards spiralling development of whole areas. Studying the preferences of office users, a panel of experts on office user preferences was asked to define a set of building and location characteristics important to office users looking for new office space. Subsequently, the relationship between physical characteristics and structural vacancy of 200 office buildings in Amsterdam was studied. 106 buildings had some level of structural vacancy, showing which characteristics increase the risk of structural vacancy. While former studies found hard factors like accessibility, parking possibilities and flexibility of the building to be the most important success factors for office buildings, this study revealed the importance of soft factors like image and status, visual quality and spatiality. Interestingly, even new buildings were found to be obsolete if the visual and functional qualities are low! Transformation Building transformation is a well known phenomenon; inner city buildings now loose their function and adapt to new use. However, the scale on which office buildings loose their function is unprecedented. Transformation is a sustainable way of coping with structural vacancy, as the buildings lifespan is extended. Case studies of transformed buildings ex post were conducted, pointing out important opportunities and obstacles for transformations, concerning market, location and building factors. With this knowledge, the transformation potential of structurally vacant office buildings in Amsterdam was studied. The possibilities for transformation, focusing on building and location characteristics, were discussed with 30 public and private developing companies. The financial value of office buildings was found to be one of the biggest obstacles for transformations. This value is based on potential tenancy income; thus the valuation method should not be used for structurally vacant buildings. The location of office buildings was a second obstacle. A substantial part of structurally vacant office buildings are located on monofunctional office locations, unsuited for residential transformations unless the location is transformed into a mixed-use location. Office buildings’ characteristics were found to have less effect on the transformation potential, though having a large effect on the transformation building costs. Preventing future vacancy The cause of structural vacancy, quantitatively and qualitatively, and the physical characteristics that increase the odds of structural vacancy were revealed. Based hereupon, recommendations are given for how to develop future office buildings and locations with less risk of structural vacancy. Several studies have shown successful examples of residential office transformations. But why then is transformation not taking place on a larger scale? Based on the study of residential transformation as a means of coping with structural vacancy, recommendations are given for how to develop office buildings in order to increase the residential transformation potential and hence reduce vacancy risk. Target audience Though the office market is quantitatively saturated, high quality office buildings are still demanded. To reduce vacancy risk and increase residential transformation potential, office buildings should be developed in mixed-use locations. Architectural quality – meaning <b>lay-out</b> of floor <b>plans,</b> spatiality of the entrance and quality of the facade – should be focused on! For a sustainable development, governments and private parties need to focus on redevelopment of central urban areas. To increase the buildings transformation potential as well as its functional life span for office use, building components should be removable or transformable. The buildings installations should not be integrated in the buildings structure. As recommendations are given for how to create office buildings with a longer functional, technical and economic lifespan, the book is applicable to the practice of real estate developers and investors, public and private planners, municipalities and architects. As the research topic can be generalised, the book is also of interest to scholars and researchers internationally. The Research establishes a connection between the two worlds of architectural discourse and statistic research. Furthermore, this research is extensive in its description of building and location characteristics, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods and giving new insights in the importance of architecture for the preferences of office users.
