40|$|The neutron spin-echo instrument, J-NSE, {{that has}} been moved from the ELLA guide hall at the FRJ- 2 in Julich to the guide hall of the new FRM II reactor, needs an intense beam of {{polarized}} neutrons. Polarization of the short wavelengths is achieved in a bent section of about 8 m and radius 160 m, with a m = 3 FeSi multilayer coating. Due to the total reflection of Fesi, longer wavelengths (lambda similar or equal to 10 - 20 (A) over circle) pass unpolarized and need an additional short polarizer {{at the entrance of}} the instrument. After the bent section within a 10 m straight guide section a turn of vertical polarization to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guide</b> field is performed and a selector is inserted. Then about 10 m of tapered Ni- 58 covered guide follows, which end with a cross-section of 60 x 60 mm(2).

40|$|AbstractInspection of {{cylindrical}} structures {{using the}} first <b>longitudinal</b> Ultrasonic <b>Guided</b> Wave (UGW) mode {{has so far}} been predominantly neglected. This is due to its attenuative and dispersive behaviour, at common UGW operating frequencies (20 - 100 kHz). However, with the current knowledge on the level of attenuation in the first longitudinal wave mode and dispersion compensation techniques, the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave mode no longer need to be neglected. Furthermore, the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave mode has higher number of non-axisymmetric modes compared to other axisymmetric modes in the operating frequency. This will enhance the flaw sizing capability which makes the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave mode a viable prospect for UGW inspection of cylindrical structures. This study has been performed to investigate the potential of exciting the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave mode in isolation. Numerical investigations have been conducted to investigate the pure excitation of the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave mode. It has been shown that the first <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave mode can be used in UGW inspection effectively in isolation by adopting transducers with out of plane vibration for excitation. This can reduces the cost and weight of UGW inspection tooling. Numerical results are empirically validated...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of identifying damages in beams using <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave is presented in this paper. In this study a probabilistic approach is employed to determine the location, length and depth of the damages by solving an inverse problem. The probabilistic approach is developed based on the Bayesian statistical framework. The damage identification is achieved by maximising the corresponding probability density function (PDF) of the damage location, length and depth {{for a set of}} measured <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave data. An advantage of the proposed approach is that it also quantifies the associated uncel 1 ainties of the predicted damage identification results, thus providing essential information for making decisions on necessary remedial work. The {{experimental study}} considers beams with a single damage. Damages having different locations, lengths and depths are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in damage identification.

40|$|We {{establish}} {{the influence of}} nonlinear electron dynamics in the magnetostatic field of a hybrid planar free-electron maser on its gain and interaction efficiency. Even for the `ideal' undulator magnetic field the presence of uniform <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>guide)</b> magnetic field potentially leads {{to the existence of}} chaotic zone around certain (magnetoresonant) value of the guide magnetic field. The width of the chaotic zone is given by the Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion applied to the normal undulator and cyclotron frequencies with respect to the coupling induced by the undulator magnetic field. Using analytical asymptotically exact solutions for trajectories of individual test electrons, we show that the magnetoresonant multiplier in electron trajectories is also present in the expression for the gain. The same Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion allows us to estimate analytically the maximal magnetoresonant gain of a hybrid planar free-electron maser showing that, in spite of the well-known drop in the gain for the exact magnetoresonance, the operation regime in the zone of regular dynamics slightly above the magnetoresonant value of the guide magnetic field is the preferable one.

40|$|We {{propose the}} design of a Resonance SPin-echo spECtrometer for exTreme studies, RESPECT, that is ideally suited for the {{exploration}} of non-dispersive processes such as diffusion, crystallization, slow dynamics, tunneling processes, crystal electric field excitations, and spin fluctuations. It is a variant of the conventional neutron spin-echo technique (NSE) by i) replacing the long precession coils by pairs of longitudinal neutron spin-echo coils combined with RF-spin flippers and ii) by stabilizing the neutron polarization with small <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guide</b> fields that can in addition be used as field subtraction coils thus allowing to adjust the field integrals over a range of 8 orders of magnitude. Therefore, the dynamic range of RESPECT can in principle be varied over 8 orders of magnitude in time, if neutrons with the required energy are made available. Similarly as for existing NSE-spectrometers, spin echo times of up to approximately 1 microsecond can be reached if the divergence and the correction elements are properly adjusted. Thanks to the optional use of neutron guides {{and the fact that the}} currents for the correction coils are much smaller than in standard NSE, intensity gains of at least one order of magnitude are expected, making the concept of RESPECT also competitive for operation at medium flux neutron sources. RESPECT can also be operated in a MIEZE configuration allowing the investigation of relaxation processes in depolarizing environments as they occur when magnetic fields are applied at the sample position, i. e. for the investigation of the dynamics of flux lines in superconductors, magnetic fluctuations in ferromagnetic materials, and samples containing hydrogen.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{operation}} regime of a hybrid planar free-electron maser (FEM) amplifier near the magnetoresonant {{value of the}} uniform <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>guide)</b> magnetic field. Using analytical expressions for individual test electron trajectories and normal frequencies of their three-dimensional oscillations in the magnetostatic field of the hybrid planar FEM, an analytical condition of chaotization of motion is established and shown to be given by the Chirikov resonance-overlap criterion applied to the normal undulator and cyclotron frequencies {{with respect to the}} coupling induced by the undulator magnetic field. It is also shown analytically that, in spite of the well-known drop for the exact magnetoresonance, the gain attains its maximal value in the zone of regular dynamics slightly above the magnetoresonant value of the guide magnetic field. Under the condition of undulator resonance, it is practically independent of the amplitude of the undulator magnetic field and the wavelength of amplified signal. To account for space-charge effects, we propose a theoretical model of a weakly relativistic FEM, which accommodates not only potential but also rotational parts of the nonradiated electromagnetic field of a moving charged particle. It turns out that the rotational part of nonradiated field diminishes the defocusing influence of the potential part on the beam bunching. Numeric simulation of the nonlinear stage of amplification is fulfilled, taking into consideration adiabatic entrance of the electron beam to the interaction region and initial electron velocity spread. We find that nonradiated field and initial electron velocity spread do not influence essentially the efficiency of hybrid planar FEM amplification if parameters of the beam-microwave interaction correspond to the operational regime in the zone of regular dynamics near the magnetoresonance...|$|E

40|$|<b>Longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> wave {{propagation}} in thin plates and rods {{is of great}} practical importance. Such guided modes are commonly {{used to evaluate the}} material properties of thin foils and plates, metal wires, optical fibers, and reinforcement filaments used in epoxy, metal, and ceramic matrix composites. The feasibility of using such <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> waves to evaluate the interface properties between the fiber and the surrounding solid matrix was investigated by both theoretical and experimental means [1, 2]. Another interesting application is when an imbedded fiber is used to monitor the properties of the surrounding material during polymerization [3]. In this case, the fiber properties are known and the interface conditions are assumed to be perfect. Any change in the velocity or the attenuation of the guided mode in the fiber {{can be attributed to the}} surrounding material that changes from a viscous fluid to an elastic solid during the curing process. Guided modes producing mainly tangential displacement can be readily used to measure fluid viscosity. From this point of view, torsional modes are the best [4, 5], but they are more difficult to generate and detect than extentional modes [6].

40|$|The {{department}} of Flight Performance and Propulsion at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering has developed the Design and Engineering Engine (DEE) concept to supportMultidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) of complex products. The {{goal of the}} DEE is to accelerate design, analysis and optimization by automating repetitive and non-creative design activities. A {{central part of the}} DEE is theMulti-Model Generator (MMG), a Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) application that provides a generative modeling capability. Over the years several aircraftMMGs have been developed to support aircraftMDO. The previous aircraft MMG was built using the KBE system GDL. Over the years, several limitations of the fuselage model included in the GDL MMG, called DARfuse, have become apparent. Therefore, this thesis describes research done into {{the development of a new}} parametric fuselage model to be included in the next generation Multi-Model Generator, currently under development within the {{department of}} Flight Performance and Propulsion. The new fuselage model is called ParaFuse and has been developed using the KBE system ParaPy. The scope of ParaFuse is limited to conventional, low-wing, passenger aircraft certified under CS 25 airworthiness requirements. The first goal of the thesis was to develop a new parametric fuselage model. The implemented modeling approach uses <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guide</b> curves and fuselage cross sections to generate the final fuselage geometry. A separate parameterization approach is taken to provide a smooth nose end cap. Furthermore, a parameterized wing-body fairing has been implemented in ParaFuse. As a second goal, an inside-out fuselage sizing and cabin configuration method has been developed and implemented to automate the fuselage layout and sizing process. The inside-out design method can be used to automatically generate the outer fuselage geometry and interior components based on payload requirements posed by the user, such as passenger capacity and cargo type. The inside-out sizing method has been validated by reconstructing several reference aircraft using ParaFuse. On average, the error of the external dimensions of the resulting fuselages is 2 % with respect to the dimensions of the fuselage of the actual aircraft. Thus, it can be concluded that the implemented inside-out sizing method can be used to accurately size the fuselage of conventional, low-wing, passenger aircraft. In addition, an outside-in cabin configuration method has been implemented in ParaFuse. This method can be used to perform cabin (re) configuration studies of fuselages with fixed external dimensions. ParaFuse is able to generate the fuselage models, including cabin interiors, within 20 seconds. This allows the user to rapidly evaluate a large number of different fuselage models. To demonstrate the functionalities of the application, two case studies are presented in this thesis. First of all, ParaFuse has been used to generate several cabin designs for the AAR cruiser, which has been developed by the faculty as part of the RECREATE project. A second case study has been performed to evaluate the fuselage design of a regional turboprop aircraft. The development of ParaFuse, together with the implemented fuselage sizing and cabin configurationmethods, described in this thesis is a step towards a next generation aircraftMulti-Model Generator.

40|$|The {{magnetostrictive}} {{guided wave}} technology as a non-contact measurement can generate and receive guided waves {{with a large}} lift-off distance up to tens of millimeters. However, the lift-off distance of the receiving coil would affect the coupling efficiency from the elastic energy to the electromagnetic energy. In the existing magnetomechanical models, the change of the magnetic field in the air gap was ignored since the permeability of the rod {{is much greater than}} that of air. The lift-off distance of the receiving coil will not affect the receiving signals based on these models. However, the experimental phenomenon is in contradiction with these models. To solve the contradiction, the lift-off effect of receiving the <b>longitudinal</b> mode <b>guided</b> waves in pipes is investigated based on the Villari effect. A finite element model of receiving <b>longitudinal</b> <b>guided</b> waves in pipes is obtained based on the Villari effect, which takes into account the magnetic field in the pipe wall and the air zone at the same time. The relation between the amplitude of the induced signals and the radius (lift-off distance) of the receiving coil is obtained, which is verified by experiment. The coupling efficiency of the receiver is a monotonic decline with the lift-off distance increasing. The decay rate of the low frequency wave is slower than the high frequency wave. Additionally, the results show that the rate of change of the magnetic flux in the air zone and in the pipe wall is the same order of magnitude, but opposite. However, the experimental results show that the error of the model in the large lift-off distance is obvious due to the diffusion of the magnetic field in the air, especially for the high frequency guided waves...|$|R

The sensor is composed of several coils that are arranged evenly on the outside of pipes. The coils induce a change in magnetic flux in the air to detect the flexural-mode waves. The waves can be determined by adding a phase delay to the induced signals. The symmetric and asymmetric features of a pipe can be distinguished using the sensor.

40|$|The {{availability}} of antiprotons with high beam {{quality in the}} energy range 0. 8 - 14. 5 GeV in the storage ring HESR {{will be one of}} the features of the new FAIR accelerator fa-cility. For the achievement of an excellent quality of the antiproton beam it is proposed to apply electron cooling. The electron cooling system will be based on an electro-static acceleration system. The intense electron beam must be recovered with high efficiency. For the achievement of highest cooling rates the electrons will interact with the cir-culating antiproton beam in a 30 m long cooling section with a superimposed <b>longitudinal</b> magnetic <b>guiding</b> field of up to 0. 5 T. Various novel techniques will be applied to achieve the required cooling performance in the high en-ergy regime...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{demonstrate}} a method for exciting and receiving torsional and <b>longitudinal</b> mode <b>guided</b> waves with an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) ring array. First of all, a three-dimensional guided wave simulator is developed in order to numerically analyze the propagation of the guided wave. The finite difference time domain method {{is used for the}} simulator. Second, two guided wave testing systems using an EMAT ring array are provided: one is for torsional mode (T-mode) guided wave and the other is for longitudinal mode (L-mode). The EMATs used in the both systems are the same in design. A method to generate and receive the T- and L-mode guided waves with the same EMAT is proposed. Finally, experimental and numerical results are compared and discussed. The results of experiments and simulation agree well, showing the potential of the EMAT ring array as a mode controllable guided wave transmitter and receiver...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{multimode}} waveguides {{in which}} multiple image	of the input excitation are formed at different distances along the guide {{can be used}} for splitting and switching applications. The e devices are often analyzed with a paraxial approximation. In the analysis presented here, an effective index dielectric slab waveguide model is implemented to account for the actual shapes and propagation constants of the modes. The analysis was performed on lxN splitters with a centered input, NxM couplers with off-center inputs, and NxMxl cascaded combinations of couplers and combiner. The sensitivity of the output intensity of the devices to changes in <b>longitudinal</b> output <b>guide</b> position, lateral input guide position, multimode width, input wavelength, and input phase were all investigated. The sensitivity curves demonstrate that higher output efficiencies are possible than with the typical paraxial approximation. Optimization was performed on the parameters of various cascaded devices, and the results demonstrated that output intensities could be increased by 34 % over typical paraxial approximation design...|$|R
