While transfer of earth material caused by natural processes (erosion, sedimentation) is about 4 millions of cubic meters per year, anthropogenic transfer is close to 330 millions (Kukal' 2006) and material transfer due to mining represents the greatest proportion' lt is estimated that the surface minera| extraďion already covers 1 % of the |and surface (Wa|ker & del Moral 2003). |n the czech Republic the extent of mining sites reached 0, 8 % in 2006 (Statistical Environmental Yearbook of the Czech Republic 2008).

40|$|With climatic {{warming is}} the {{expectation}} of coincident changes in distributions and range limits driven by population changes. An outstanding question is whether such coincident changes (positive or negative) occur, especially in smaller regions in which management for change tends to be conducted. Using atlas and survey monitoring data (BMS) we studied population and distribution changes in 31 butterfly species in North West England over three recording periods (1940 – 1994, 1995 – 2001, 2001 – 2007). We found that since the first recording period many more species have shifted their centres of gravity significantly northwards and uphill than have increased in population abundance (density) and distribution cover. At the same time, far fewer species have effectively shifted southwards and downhill than have decreased in density and distribution cover. A significant association between change in distribution cover and density is divorced from the weaker association between shifts in altitude and northing; whereas many species are gaining northwards and at higher altitude, they are doing so from a failing base at lower altitude and {{at the core of}} their distributions. Usually losses at lower altitudes are ascribed to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>biotopes.</b> But, declines in some species, such as Lasiommata megera, are occurring at a much faster rate than physical changes to the landscape and in land uses. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} changes in populations, distributions and ranges are a great deal more complex than hitherto considered. Currently, the basis for such rapid changes is not being supported by detailed autecology on species...|$|R
40|$|Šumava {{forests are}} {{recently}} undergoing changes. These changes in forest ecosystems are partially {{caused by a}} spruce bark beetle (what is recently regarded as a bark beetle outbreak). Also the growing migration of the human population has increased the changes in forest ecosystems. Due {{to the influence of}} the human population some natural biotopes are slowly changing to more anthropic biotopes. The main objective of my thesis was to create the map <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> and to carry out their individual assessment and evaluation [...] This map was created using the more detailed combined mapping Natura 2000 -BVM (ratio scale 1 : 10 000) and compared with less detailed mapping Corine Land Cover (ratio scale approximately 1 : 10 000). Finally, the forest conditions were evaluated in terms of its naturalness and quality of the forest canopy. Data processing and analysis of results were carried out in ArcGIS. Maps <b>of</b> <b>biotopes,</b> created by the combined method Natura 2000 -BVM, with and without application of the individual assessment are the main output of this study. The higher value (of 1, 7 points/m 2) was found in the map without the usage of the individual assessment. Accordingly, financial value was higher by 25, 1 Kč/m 2 without the application of the individual assessment. Using the Corine Land Cover mapping, the lower values were found, compared to the combined method Natura 2000 -BVM, using both valuation approaches (with and without an individual assessment). In the conclusion of the thesis the forest conditions were evaluated. The biotope L 5. 4 Acidophylic beechwood was found to be the most vulnerable to the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>biotope</b> character. The results of the thesis contributed to the problems with the evaluation of the biodiversity at the landscape scale, even from financial point of view. The comparison of Natura 2000 -BVM and Corine Land Cover allows us to select a more appropriate cartographic underlay for the mapping <b>of</b> specific <b>biotopes</b> in the landscape. The evaluation of the forest conditions in study area could be another one contribution for understanding the dynamics of the Šumava forest ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Many agriculturally {{important}} {{fruit trees}} {{occur in the}} genus Prunus, among other also Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus) and Sweet cherry (Prunus avium). P. cerasus {{is considered to be}} an allopolyploid hybrid originated by hybridization of Prunus fruticosa (2 n = 4 x = 32) and P. avium (2 n = 2 x = 16). The world production of sour cherry fruit (P. cerasus) in 2008 is estimated to be more than 1, 15 million tones. Prunus fruticosa is a steppe (forest steppe) relict species, severely endangered in the Czech Republic (C 2). The main threat of P. fruticosa are both the direct and indirect human activities, causing, above all the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>biotopes</b> and hybridization with cultivated species that ran wild to the nature. P. fruticosa hybridizes all over its occurrence area with wild P. cerasus (Sour cherry; which is not primary species of the Czech Republic) and originates fertile hybrid Prunus × eminens. The results of existing studies indicate that the hybrids are more common in the central Europe and that the frequency of hybridization rises towards the west. Such phenomenon is related to human activities (cherries cultivation and landscape changes). Many authors consider hybridization to be the main cause of endangerment of this species and noticed that in many habitats the hybrids could totally replace [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Soil is a {{key part}} <b>of</b> a <b>biotope</b> and {{microorganisms}} are dominant components contributing to soil functions. Conversely, established methods for valuation <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> according to Natura 2000 rely predominantly on the communities living on the surface. Here, we aimed to assess soil microbial biomass and community structure on five localities with range <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> values by means of phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. PLFA figures were affected both by sampling season (spring vs. autumn) and locality. In spring, the living microbial biomass (estimated by PLFAtot) exhibited poor correlation to biotope values. These were, on the contrary, correlated to trans/cis PLFA, an indicator of microbial stress, (i. e., lower stress in higher-rated biotopes), and fungal/bacterial PLFA (i. e., higher-rated biotopes contained more fungi). The attempt to model biotope values from microbial characteristics explained a maximum of ~ 50 % of the variability; the best predictors were the trans/cis stress indicator, percentage of actinobacterial PLFA, and ratio of PLFA of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria. These results show that soil microbial characteristics present partly new information and indicate the need to amend the procedures <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> assessment. Soil PLFA profiling could serve as suitable methods for this purpose...|$|R

It was shown that both video survey and Smith- Mclntyre grab data exhibited negative spatial autocorrelation, allowing the creation <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> map polygons through spatial agglomeration of point data. However, a greater number <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> could be identified using the epibenthos (video) than the infauna (grab) data, demonstrating that the use <b>of</b> the existing <b>biotope</b> map {{as the basis for the}} design of a marine protected area would have led to an underrepresentation <b>of</b> epibenthic <b>biotopes.</b> It is suggested that the failure of the infaunal (grab) data to detect these biotopes was a result of the sacrifice of fine-scale replication for the sake of the large coverage required for management-scale biotope surveys and it is demonstrated that the remote-video survey method is a highly suitable method for mapping benthic biotopes on management-scale, allowing large spatial coverage without sacrificing fine scale replication.

40|$|The {{intensification}} of agriculture {{during the second}} half of the twentieth century, has caused sever declines of farmland biodiversity, where <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> semi-natural habitats is one of the major drivers. To halt further <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> habitat and biodiversity, agri-environmental schemes (AES) are used to compensate farmers to use methods less harmful to the environment. In this thesis, I have investigated the importance <b>of</b> preserving small <b>biotopes</b> (e. g. field boundaries, road verges, field islets and marl pits) for the persistence of plants and pollinators in agricultural landscapes of varying complexity. I also evaluated the effectiveness of a Swedish AES focused on preventing woody encroachment <b>of</b> small <b>biotopes,</b> with the partial aim of benefiting biodiversity, on the species richness and abundances of pollinators. I surveyed plants and pollinators in different types of habitats found within agricultural landscapes, to investigate the relative importance <b>of</b> small <b>biotopes</b> as habitat for these two groups. I also investigated the local- and landscape-scale effects of removing woody vegetation from small biotopes on pollinators and pollination. The results showed that small biotopes are important for the preservation of both plants and pollinators, within agricultural landscapes of varying structural complexity. Their importance as habitat for pollinators is highest when no mass-flowering crops are available. I also show that the removal of woody vegetation from small biotopes can benefit some pollinator groups while others may be negatively impacted, and although management may benefit pollinators locally, it may not affect the occurrences of pollinators at larger spatial scales. However, the results show that benefits from management <b>of</b> small <b>biotopes</b> are likely to be higher within structurally simple landscapes. The results from this thesis, thus highlights the importance <b>of</b> preserving small <b>biotopes</b> within agricultural landscapes for the conservation of farmland biodiversity. They further illustrate the importance of evaluating and understanding the effects of agri-environmental schemes, since the efficiency of these to enhance biodiversity can vary between organism groups and depend on landscape structure...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} the A. L. Belgard system of vascular plant species coenomorphs as indicators <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> by using standardized Y. P.  Didukh phytometer scales for 12 environmental factors. The classification and ordination of coenomorphs in the phytometer space was performed by using algorithms of discriminant analysis. The analysis is based on 2, 186 species of the vascular plant flora of Ukraine. The classification accuracy was around 80 % and above, the least homogenous was the petrophyte coenomorph. The validity of identification of ruderal coenomorphs was proved as an indicator <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> with increased content of soil nitrogen. Analysis of the a posteriori probability of species attribution to a coenomorph supports the validity of distinguishing transitional coenomorphs. Their number is small and each group contains {{a small number of}} species. The principal factors of classifying species by coenomorph are (in descending order of significance) : minimum soil moisture, minimum light (shade), impoverishment of salts in the soil solution, high porosity of soil and impoverishment of carbonates of calcium in the soil and maximum values for radiation balance. The analysis of the distribution of coenomorphs in the space of the square of Mahalanobis distances and the ordination in the discriminant functions axis has determined the ranking <b>of</b> coenomorph <b>of</b> <b>biotope</b> and coenotic substitution: soil moisture (first discriminant function), radiation balance and shade (second discriminant function), salt regime and soil aeration (third discriminant function). For the vegetation of Ukraine this ordination of coenomorphs corresponds to the zonal factors of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>biotopes</b> and their limiting factors and the factors determining A. L.  Belgard’s typology of natural and artificial forests: soil moisture, salinity of the soil solution, light conditions. The coenomorph optima for the principal factors have been defined in phytometer scales. This allows coenomorphs to be used as biotope phytometers and provides a preliminary assessment of those species whose place in the scales has not yet been determined. Analysis of posterior probabilities enabled us to determine the transitional coenomorphs, which are typical for ecotones between zonal and intrazonal vegetational ecosystems of Ukraine...|$|R
