[...] Davis {{said that the}} song's concept deals with his childhood, saying [...] "People think 'Daddy' was written because my father abused me, but that's not what the song's about. When I was a kid, I was being abused by someone else. I don't really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that song." [...] Some 14 minutes into [...] "Daddy"—well after the song has ended—a hidden track begins to play.

In the scene, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gives George Park, Fred O'Dwyer, and Milton Greene a tour around the backstage area of TGS.

Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served.

500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album {{where the majority of}} the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1966, Cooney hosted what she called [...] "a little dinner party" [...] at her {{apartment}} near Gramercy Park. [...] In attendance was her husband Tim Cooney, her boss Lewis Freedman, and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett, whom the Cooneys knew socially. [...] Lloyd Morrisett was a mid-level executive at [...] Carnegie Corporation (who later became its CEO), and was then responsible for funding educational research. The conversation turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children; Morrisett raised the question, [...] "Do you think television {{could be used to}} teach young children?" [...] Cooney replied, [...] "I don't know, but I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it." [...] According to Davis, the party was the start of a five-decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett. [...] A week later, Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers. [...] Freedman was opposed to Cooney's involvement because he did not think she would be interested in a project that focused on children and because {{he did not want to}} lose her at WNDT, but she was chosen to do the study.|$|E

When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form, Rhys covers for him, but makes it clear he wants something in return. Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin, Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon. Despite being warned that Martin does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> shop during his golf games, Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed. Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap [...] "And Karl {{has no choice but to}} agree that Rhys is a good doctor. It's a bit awkward, because Karl doesn't like the way Rhys operates— so to speak!" [...] Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program; however he forgets everything he knows and makes a fool of himself due to being hungover. Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling [...] "devastated and desperate." [...] Barber described the position as the Holy Grail for Rhys and because of a stupid act, he has lost it.|$|E
500|$|NME {{magazine}} ranked [...] "Secret" [...] {{at number}} 30 in {{their list of}} the best songs of 1994. Slant Magazine listed [...] "Secret" [...] as the 42nd [...] "Best Singles of the 1990s", stating that its [...] "one of the most organic-sounding singles of Madonna's career, taking its sweet time to get where it's going and not giving up too much along the way. The arrangement gets off on being withholding, and, at least for one glorious single, so does Madonna: When she sings, [...] "You knew all along/What I never wanted to say," [...] she sounds positively rapturous. Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 30 on his list of [...] "Best Madonna Songs", stating [...] "its slinky R groove made 'Secret' something special, even if it's not remembered for an accompanying scandal or bawdy 'moment'. We <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about her ability to produce controversy and headlines, {{but at the end}} of the day, here's what Madonna makes best: pop music". Louis Virtel of The Backlot listed the song at number 14 on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs", calling it [...] "meditative, moving" [...] and [...] "sexy as hell". Rooksby concurred that [...] "its a good track" [...] but felt that the time could have been reduced from five minutes, which made it a little long. He also felt that the drums looping around the track made it a [...] "bit monotonous".|$|E

I'll go to Gilly (Adam Gilchrist) and even Matty Hayden, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn... The way I think {{is not going to be}} right 100 percent of the time, but that's the way I do it.

[...] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during an interview session with WWE Superstars including Punk, he was asked if WWE was trying to erase Benoit from history. Punk responded that while Benoit is in the history books and that cannot be changed, it does not make any sense for WWE to promote him, due to the horrific nature of the crimes he committed.|$|E
2500|$|Though Lynn {{has been}} outspoken about her views on often {{controversial}} {{social and political}} subjects, she stated, [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about things where you're {{going to get one}} side or the other unhappy. My music has no politics." [...] She has visited the White House six times since 1976, under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and in her autobiography, she said her father was a Republican and her mother a Democrat.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Nassau Agreement, the two governments {{negotiated}} the Polaris Sales Agreement, a treaty under the terms of which the US supplied Polaris missiles, which was signed on 6 April 1963. The missiles were equipped with British warheads. The UK retained its deterrent force, although its control passed from the RAF to the Royal Navy. Polaris was a better weapon system for the UK's needs, and has been referred to as [...] "almost the bargain of the century", and an [...] "amazing offer". The V bombers were immediately reassigned to NATO {{under the terms of the}} Nassau Agreement, as were the Polaris submarines when they entered service in 1968. The Polaris Sales Agreement was amended in 1980 to provide for the purchase of Trident. British politicians did not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "dependence" [...] on the United States, preferring to describe the Special Relationship as one of [...] "interdependence".|$|E
2500|$|Bains {{played a}} key role in {{founding}} the predecessor to the CPC (ML) on March 13, 1963 as the [...] "Internationalists", a student group at the UBC championing what they described as anti-revisionism. [...] "If you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> join the Internationalists", opined the UBC student newspaper under the headline [...] "Hot air types form own group." [...] But while co-organizer Mayling Weaver spoke of welcoming [...] "students of any race, religion, or political beliefs," [...] and both asserted that [...] "the university is a coffee-shop," [...] Bains was setting for itself much more adventurous goals than just [...] "an extension to the extra-curricular programme" [...] with [...] "free-wheeling, year-round academic symposiums.". Bains desired in The Internationalists to form a future communist movement, founded on what he considered orthodox Marxist revolutionary theory, including opposition to De-Stalinization. He fused his writings and lectures on Marxism with certain ideas that were existentialist and current with radical youth in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Tarkan {{was in a}} {{relationship}} with a French model in the early 1990s, and with a Turkish journalist between 1994 and 1996. Because Tarkan does not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his personal life, there has been speculation about his sexual orientation in the popular press. Photos stolen from his house in New York in 2001 were portrayed as compromising; they were photos with other men in swimwear at a public nude beach. In one of the pictures he appears to be kissing a man. In an interview with Hürriyet, Tarkan contested the widespread assumption that he was gay. He said: [...] "Men ! Definitely. It's because I destroy [...] they try to show off as manhood!" [...] One of his ex-girlfriends also denied he was gay. Tarkan later gave fewer and fewer interviews and television appearances, limiting himself to a small number of trusted journalists. In 2006, he said that his relationship with the media had gone wrong.|$|E
