5|$|L.A.P.D. (Love And Peace Dude, later <b>Laughing</b> <b>As</b> People Die) was an American funk metal band {{formed in}} 1989 in Bakersfield, California. From 1989 to 1991, the member line-up was James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria and Richard Morrill. The group has {{released}} one studio album, one extended play, and one compilation album.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} Bad Brains concert, MacKaye and Nelson began {{playing in a}} punk band, the Slinkees, with school friends Grindle and Mark Sullivan. The Slinkees played a single show before Sullivan went to college. After a failed attempt to recruit MacKaye's friend Henry Garfield (later Henry Rollins), the band added Strejcek as the vocalist. The Slinkees soon renamed {{themselves}} the Teen Idles. After touring and practicing for several months, the band recorded two demo sessions at a local studio in February and April 1980, despite the engineer and a visiting band openly <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> they recorded. They also began playing at house parties and pizza parlors, and opened for Bad Brains at an art gallery, in a dilapidated row house in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, called Madam's Organ.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is grateful for the insight the experience gave him.|$|E

5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
25|$|Two early ALF raids led to {{the closure}} of several {{university}} studies. A May 28, 1984 raid on the University of Pennsylvania's head injury clinic caused $60,000 worth of damage and saw the removal of 60 hours of tapes, which showed the researchers <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> they used a hydraulic device to cause brain damage to baboons. The tapes were turned over to PETA, who produced a 26-minute video called Unnecessary Fuss. The head injury clinic was closed, the university's chief veterinarian was fired, and the university was put on probation.|$|E
25|$|In August 2007, Branson {{announced}} on The Colbert Report {{that he had}} named a new aircraft Air Colbert. He later doused political satirist and talk show host Stephen Colbert with water from his mug. Branson subsequently took a retaliatory splash from Colbert. The interview quickly ended, with both <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> shown on the episode aired on Comedy Central on 22 August 2007. The interview was promoted on The Report as the Colbert-Branson Interview Trainwreck. Branson then made a cameo appearance in The Soup, playing an intern working under Joel McHale who had been warned against getting into water fights with Stephen Colbert, and being subsequently fired.|$|E

25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, and {{tried to get him to}} drink some water, but someone had packed his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E
500|$|Nkomo claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack {{in an interview with the}} BBC's Today radio programme the next day, <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> he did so, to the horror of most Rhodesian observers, both black and white. He said that he had received intelligence that the Hunyani was being used for military purposes. Nkomo said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party's policy to kill civilians, and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground; by contrast, he said that his men had helped them, and had left them alive. He also accused Air Rhodesia of surreptitiously hauling troops and war materiel for the government, an allegation that Captain Pat Travers, Air Rhodesia's general manager, called a [...] "downright, deliberate lie".|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June 1966, Lamb {{appeared}} without legal counsel at Essex County Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination. As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him. A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was [...] "hyperactive and agitated"; {{he was unable to}} sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.|$|E

500|$|The unsafe {{homeless}} {{man with whom}} Peter was seen leaving a youth-baseball team in Stewie's flashback was originally based on John Wayne Gacy, but people claimed he didn't look scary enough, so Povenmire changed the character completely {{to that of a}} {{homeless man}}. The idea of Stewie and Bertram <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> they go down the slide during their sword fight was pitched by Povenmire's wife and, although negative about the idea at first, Povenmire included it in the episode because the original sketch was not going so well. During Peter and Lois' [...] "fat sex", Peter repeatedly states [...] "almost, almost"; originally, {{there was going to be}} approximately twice as many of these, but they were never included in the episode. The DVD version of the episode shows Peter arriving at the sperm bank and saying to the receptionist: [...] "I have an appointment to banish a White Russian from my Kremlin", to which she replies with [...] "This is a sperm bank, you don't have to use innuendo", and Peter concludes the conversation with [...] "Where do I splooge?".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{wrote that}} [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is [...] "the most old-school work" [...] on Femme Fatale, with Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{considering}} the album's production [...] "polished, intriguing and – {{best of all}} – fun", exemplifying the piano breakdown in the song. Keith Caulfield of Billboard said he could [...] "completely hear this track blasting in a club, with Spears cooing 'I can be your treble' while the crowd screams back 'you can be my bass!'." [...] The Daily Collegians stated that the song is [...] "catchy", yet different from [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me", and added that [...] "the combined star power of Spears and Will.i.am would have surely made it a radio hit." [...] The Independent journalist Andy Gill noted that the album sounds more programmed than natural, but said that the song [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound thought that the song [...] "might {{as well be a}} B-side to 'The Time (Dirty Bit)' (otherwise known as the most annoying Black Eyed Peas song ever created)." [...] Both Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic and About.com reviewer Bill Lamb selected it as a top song on Femme Fatale. Lamb further added that the song [...] "will leave you <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> you sing along on the dance floor." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lose Yourself" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television critics. James Poniewozik of Time has mixed {{reactions to the}} episode. He was critical of the plot arc between Grey and Chase, [...] harshly criticizing Grey's acting and expressing that [...] " [...] didn't think that Adrian Grenier had completely sold Vince’s downward spiral." [...] He continued: [...] "There’s something half-jokey about his manner that makes me think he’s about to break up <b>laughing,</b> <b>as</b> in a blooper reel." [...] In contrast, Poniewozik felt that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, I’m really interested to see what happens on Entourage next." [...] Dan Philips of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Philips praised [...] "Lose Yourself", opining that it was an [...] "excellent, extremely entertaining climax to this season's two main plot lines." [...] He added, [...] "Even though the episode never got around to providing any resolution, the overall journey was engaging enough to make its cliffhanger feel less like a cheap trick to get us to tune in for season eight." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Josh Wagler of MTV, who praised Grenier's performance, opining that it was his best performance to date. The A.V. Club writer Kyle Ryan gave the episode a 'B-' grade. Ryan wrote, [...] "The last episode teed up tonight’s many confrontations [...] For a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels, these were surprisingly high stakes." [...] He was critical with the development of Vincent Chase, as well as his storyline with Sasha Grey, commenting that [...] "Vincent and his coterie just aren’t that interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his 2009 {{interview}} for Australian Skeptics' podcast The Skeptic Zone, Minchin addressed his performance style {{as one that}} allows bringing up issues that can be upsetting or judgemental to others, such as the [...] "moral hypocrisy {{about the idea that}} the Bible is perfect, the only place that you need to go to for your moral guidance...and about, obviously, prejudice in the church, its role in ostracising homosexuals...your defences are down when you're <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> well and it's couched in music. All I'm doing is making things consumable that are otherwise difficult to consume." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Happier Than...." [...] duo {{features}} Jimmy (actor Timothy Ryan Cole) and Ronnie (musician Alex Harvey) {{playing a}} guitar and a mandolin, respectively, {{on a small}} portable stage. [...] They comment on a fictitious preceding event, such as a man dressed in 15th-century attire <b>laughing</b> <b>as</b> he leads a trio of speed boats with the painted names Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria. [...] After cutting to the duo, one says to the other [...] "You know, folks who save hundreds of dollars by switching to GEICO sure are happy." [...] The other then replied, [...] "How happy are they, (Jimmy/Ronnie)?" [...] {{and in the case}} above, the response is [...] "Happier than Christopher Columbus with speedboats!" ...|$|E
