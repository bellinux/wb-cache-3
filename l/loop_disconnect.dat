40|$|The archetypal {{model of}} the {{buckling}} of a compressed long elastic strut resting on a nonlinear elastic foundation is studied. Localised buckling is investigated when the foundation has both quadratic and cubic terms which initially destabilise but subsequently restabilise the structure. The primary solution can be detected by a double-scale perturbation procedure and is reminiscent of a solitary wave: essentially, it consists of a fast periodic oscillation which is slowly modulated and decays exponentially in both directions. Particular interest is paid {{to the process of}} adapting the procedure to account for the post-buckling behaviour of two-packet or double-humped solitary waves in this model. We employ the methods of beyond-all-orders asymptotics to reveal terms formally exponentially small in the perturbation parameter which have macroscopic effects on the post-buckling behaviour of the system including the interaction phenomenon of interest. The analysis is reinforced by direct numerical computations which reveal the so-called snaking behaviour in the subsidiary homoclinic orbits as is observed in the case of primary solutions. However, additional phenomena arise for these subsidiary forms including the formation of bridges linking solution paths and the appearance of a multitude of closed isolated <b>loops</b> <b>disconnected</b> from other features of the bifurcation diagram...|$|R

50|$|This {{telephone}} {{was able}} to operate on both <b>loop</b> <b>disconnect</b> (pulse) and MF4 (tone) dialing. The method was chosen by a switch on the base, {{as shown in the}} photograph.

50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name <b>loop</b> <b>disconnect</b> dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|E

50|$|But {{this was}} the GPO, and nothing was ever that simple. Even though all the design {{research}} had already been done by the major US companies, The GPO {{decided to do it}} all over again. Although, initially, they decided to modify the existing 700-type instruments, what hadn't been decided was how the push-buttons should best be laid out. Completely ignoring the then-standard US layout, an experiment was put into motion at the Dollis Hill Research Centre. Mock-ups were made of every conceivable combination and layout of buttons. Each of these had its own seated operator and digital readout. All the button pads and readouts were cabled to a primitive computer. For weeks on end the computer flashed random series of numbers to the digital readouts and the operators had the task of punching these numbers, as quickly as possible, onto the keypads. The speed and accuracy rate were continuously logged, as was the ergonomic comfort of the operators. At the end of many months, much expense, and to absolutely no-one's surprise, the results came out in favour of the existing American layout! Sadly this was too late for at least one major company. ICI had decided to press ahead unilaterally with their own design, the Tele 726, which had two rows of five buttons (no # or * buttons then) set horizontally across the centre of a circular face-plate. This proved very awkward to use. This was the outcome of the trials. A perfectly normal Tele. 746, but fitted with push buttons instead of a dial and re-dubbed 756. The push buttons just created the same <b>loop</b> <b>disconnect</b> signalling pulses as a dial telephone, which caused horrendous post-dialling delay and much knuckle rapping frustration. The model shown in the photograph is actually an 8756, which has been modified to enable it to be used with the 'New Plan' plug and socket system.|$|E
