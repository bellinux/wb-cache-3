2500|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the {{organization}} that regulates collegiate wrestling. The wrestling rules developed by the NCAA are followed by each of the NCAA's three divisions. In addition, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), and the National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) have also adopted them, with some modifications. The NCAA generally sets the standard for weight classes for college-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. There are currently 10 main weight classes currently open to college-level competition, ranging from 125lb to the Heavyweight division that ranges from 183lb to 285lb. Also, there is a 235lb weight class, which only the National Collegiate Wrestling Association, {{the organization}} that governs college wrestling for institutions outside the NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA, currently allows that ranges from 174lb to 235lb. The NCWA also allows eight weight classes for women ranging from 105lb to 200lb. A wrestler must normally have his weight assessed {{by a member of}} the institution's athletics medical staff (e.g. a physician, certified athletic trainer, or registered dietician) before the first official team practice. [...] The weight assessed is then his minimum weight class. The athletics medical staff member and the head coach then review all of the assessed weights of the wrestling team members and certify them online at the website of the National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA). After the certification, the wrestler may not compete below that weight class and may only compete at one weight class higher than his minimum weight. If a wrestler does gain weight over his certified weight class and wrestles at two weight classes above it, he forfeits his previous lowest weight class for the one weight class below where he wrestled. If a contestant wishes to weigh-in and wrestle at only one weight class above his certified weight class and later return to his lowest certified weight class, he may do so. However, the wrestler may only return to that certified weight class according to the weight-loss plan of the National Wrestling Coaches Association. This weight <b>loss</b> <b>plan</b> takes into account potential dehydration during the wrestling season and minimum amounts of body fat. All of this has been done in order to protect the wrestler's health and safety.|$|E

Compliance with this diet using either milk protein shakes or soy protein shakes resulted in significant weight loss and reductions in body fat. Average weight loss was approximately 26-29 pounds and did not differ significantly between groups. In a second study, overweight, postmenopausal women on a weight maintenance diet were asked to drink either a Revival Soy protein shake (20 g soy protein with 160 mg soy isoflavones) or a milk protein shake (20 g milk protein with no isoflavones) daily for 3 months. Different measures of body fat were evaluated after 3 months. Despite being on a weight maintenance diet plan, total abdominal (belly) fat was reduced in the soy protein group and increased in the milk protein group. These results show that Revival Soy protein can be a highly effective part of a weight loss program.|$|E
