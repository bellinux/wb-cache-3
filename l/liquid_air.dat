5|$|Earth has {{retained}} {{all of the}} noble gases that were present at its formation except helium. Krypton's concentration in the atmosphere is about 1 ppm. It can be extracted from <b>liquid</b> <b>air</b> by fractional distillation. The amount of krypton in space is uncertain, because measurement is derived from meteoric activity and solar winds. The first measurements suggest an abundance of krypton in space.|$|E
5|$|Krypton was {{discovered}} in Britain in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay, a Scottish chemist, and Morris Travers, an English chemist, in residue left from evaporating nearly all components of <b>liquid</b> <b>air.</b> Neon {{was discovered}} by a similar procedure by the same workers {{just a few weeks}} later. William Ramsay was awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovery of a series of noble gases, including krypton.|$|E

5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of <b>liquid</b> <b>air.</b> Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of <b>liquid</b> <b>air.</b> Since air is the only source, it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of <b>liquid</b> <b>air,</b> or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E

5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in <b>liquid</b> <b>air</b> temperature fluorine. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E

The {{lines from the}} low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} the engine is gimbaled for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them.

25|$|Pasteur {{performed}} {{several experiments}} to disprove spontaneous generation. He placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. Then {{he closed the}} flask, and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable <b>liquid.</b> <b>Air</b> was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} features of the Skylon's design is its powerplant, known as Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE). The design of the SABRE engine has drawn heavily upon the STRICT/STERN experimental engines, sharing many features such as the propellant and the adoption of the trialled Expansion Deflection Nozzle, as well as building upon the wider field of <b>liquid</b> <b>air</b> cycle engines (LACE). The engines are designed to operate much like a conventional jet engine to around Mach5.5 (1,700m/s), [...] altitude, beyond which the air inlet closes and the engine operates as a highly efficient rocket to orbital speed. The proposed SABRE engine is not a scramjet, but a jet engine running combined cycles of a precooled jet engine, rocket engine and ramjet. Originally the key technology for this type of precooled jet engine did not exist, as it required a heat exchanger that was ten times lighter than the state of the art. Research conducted since then has achieved the necessary performance.|$|E

500|$|Ramsay {{continued}} {{to search for}} these gases using the method of fractional distillation to separate <b>liquid</b> <b>air</b> into several components. In 1898, he discovered the elements krypton, neon, and xenon, and named them after the Greek words [...] ( [...] , [...] "hidden"), [...] ( [...] , [...] "new"), and [...] ( [...] , [...] "stranger"), respectively. Radon was first identified in 1898 by Friedrich Ernst Dorn, and was named radium emanation, but was not considered a noble gas until 1904 when its characteristics {{were found to be}} similar to those of other noble gases. Rayleigh and Ramsay received the 1904 Nobel Prizes in Physics and in Chemistry, respectively, for their discovery of the noble gases; in the words of J. E. Cederblom, then president of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, [...] "the discovery of an entirely new group of elements, of which no single representative had been known with any certainty, is something utterly unique in the history of chemistry, being intrinsically an advance in science of peculiar significance".|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem in}} the igniter fuel lines was not {{detected}} during ground testing because a stainless steel mesh covering [...] the fuel line became saturated with <b>liquid</b> <b>air</b> due to the extreme cold of the liquid hydrogen flowing through it. The <b>liquid</b> <b>air</b> damped a vibration mode that became evident when tests were conducted in a vacuum after the Apollo 6 flight. This was also a simple fix, involving replacing the flexible bellows section where the break occurred with a loop of stainless steel pipe. The S-IVB used the same J-2 engine design as the S-II {{and so it was}} decided that an igniter line problem had also stopped the third stage from reigniting in Earth orbit. [...] Ground testing confirmed that the slight underperformance seen in the first S-IVB burn was consistent with damage to the igniter line.|$|E

2500|$|Adult female brine shrimp ovulate {{approximately}} every 140 hours. In favourable conditions, {{the female}} brine shrimp can produce eggs that almost immediately hatch. While in extreme conditions, such as low oxygen level or salinity above 150‰, female brine shrimp produce eggs with a chorion coating {{which has a}} brown colour. These eggs, also known as cysts, are metabolically inactive and can remain in total stasis for two years while in dry oxygen-free conditions, even at temperatures below freezing.

By 1845, Michael Faraday had managed to liquefy most gases then known to exist, and reached a new record for lowest temperatures by reaching [...] Faraday believed that certain gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen, were permanent gases {{and could not be}} liquified. Decades later, in 1873 Dutch theoretical scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals demonstrated that these gases could be liquefied, but only under conditions of very high pressure and very low temperatures.
