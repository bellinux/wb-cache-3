5000|$|A parking lock was not {{provided}} until {{the advent of}} the aluminum-case Torqueflites in 1960 (standard-duty A-904) and 1962 (heavy-duty A-727), at which point a lever was added adjacent to the pushbuttons: Moving the lever to the [...] "Park" [...] position placed the car into Neutral and engaged a <b>lock</b> <b>pawl</b> on the transmission's output shaft. Moving the park lever out of [...] "Park" [...] position unlocked the shift buttons so that a driving range could be selected. The buttons were replaced by conventional steering column- or floor-mounted shift levers in all automatic Chrysler-built vehicles for the 1965 model year, though floor levers were available in certain sporty 1964 models.|$|E

In {{view of the}} {{problems}} existing in the present transportation ways of coal mine, a kind of new auxiliary haulage system has been designed, which can achieve the going there and back transportation only by using one winch in the multi-slope and undulating roadway. And {{according to the requirements}} of safety production of coal mine, the non-wheeled supply mine car without anti-car device and the safety interlock system of wheeled supply mine car have been designed. Meanwhile, finite element analysis software is adopted to check and analyze the <b>locking</b> <b>pawl</b> strength of the safety interlock system with wheeled supply mine car. The analyzing result shows that the <b>locking</b> <b>pawl</b> can completely stand the impact loading when the mine car sliding down. The haulage costs and the occurrence of security incidents have been reduced when the designed system is applied to coal mine. Engineering practice shows that the good results have been achieved...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of an OMV docking mechanism, {{based on an}} adaptation of the Shuttle Flight Support System Pallet Berthing Mechanism was completed. The mechanism uses automatically actuated motorized latches to engage towel bars on the target satellite. LED sensors establish the towel bar position within the capture envelope and the latch capture commands are issued. Then, <b>locking</b> <b>pawls</b> engage the bar, locking and pre-loading the mechanism. Two series of tests were conducted to test nominal and failure mode captures and to evaluate design parameters such as LED sensor locations, automatic closure algorithms, latch closure velocity, position/velocity entry envelopes, and closure method. The first test series involved single latch testing on the Flat Floor Facility, the 6 DOF Facility, and an analytic simulation model. The intent was to compare results in order to validate the various facilities. Reasonably good agreement was achieved. The second test series repeated the single latch testing on the refurbished 6 DOF Facility to validate the facility modifications. The individual latches were tested under free-drift conditions for functionality and performance. Next, the three-latch configuration underwent parametric testing. Test results validated the improved fidelity of the 6 DOF Facility and verified successful docking at the required entry velocity. The tests determined the 'best' design parameter definitions {{and concluded that the}} <b>locking</b> <b>pawls</b> should not <b>lock</b> until all three latches completely close...|$|R
50|$|The parking <b>pawl</b> <b>locks</b> the {{transmission}}'s {{output shaft}} to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam plate, pivot pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|R
