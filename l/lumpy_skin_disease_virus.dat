50|$|Capripoxvirus is a genus {{of viruses}} in the {{subfamily}} Chordopoxvirinae {{and the family}} Poxviridae. Capripoxviruses {{are among the most}} serious of all animal poxviruses. Sheep, goat, and cattle serve as natural hosts. These viruses cause negative economic consequences by damaging hides and wool and forcing the establishment of trade restrictions in response to an outbreak. The genus consists of three species: the type species: sheeppox virus (SPPV), goatpox virus (GTPV), and <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus</b> (LSDV). They share no serological relationship with camel pox, horse pox, or avian poxes. Capripoxviruses for sheeppox and goatpox infect only sheep and goat respectively. However, it is probable that North American relatives, the mountain goat and mountain sheep, may be susceptible to the strains but has not been experimentally proven. <b>Lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus</b> affects primarily cattle, but studies have been shown that giraffes and impala are also susceptible to LSDV.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> (LSD) is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} disease of cattle endemic in most Sub-Saharan African countries. It is economically devastating viral diseases which cause several financial problems in livestock industries {{as a result}} of significant milk yield loss, infertility, abortion and death. It is caused by <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>virus</b> of capripoxvirus. The disease is characterized by fever, enlarged lymph nodes, firm, and circumscribed nodules in the skin and ulcerative lesions particularly in the mucous membrane of the mouth. It occurs in all agro climatic conditions and has the potential to extend its boundaries. It is transmitted by insect vectors among the cattle sharing similar grazing and watering areas and those congregate in the same barn. Good understanding of epidemiology, economic significance and control mechanisms of the disease enabled to design suitable control measures. LSD could be diagnosed using appropriate serological and molecular techniques. Effective control measure of the disease is achieved through mass vaccination though separation and culling of infected animals are optional methods...|$|R

40|$|Sheep pox {{and goat}} pox (SPGP) <b>virus</b> and <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> (LSD) <b>virus</b> {{belong to the}} genus Capripoxvirus and cause disease with {{economic}} impacts in sheep/goats and cattle respectively. In 2013 / 14, outbreaks of SPGP were reported in sheep in Greece and Bulgaria and LSD outbreaks were reported in cattle in Turkey, Egypt and some countries in the Middle East. Clinical signs for both diseases include pox lesions, papules and scabs on the skin which may contain virus. This, together {{with the fact that}} Great Britain (GB) currently imports cattle hides, sheep skins and wool from European Union (EU) countries without the requirement for treatment prior to export, raises concern that capripoxviruses could be introduced into GB. A qualitative assessment presented here concluded that the current risk of entry of SPGP virus into GB through the importation of one untreated sheep skin, hide or wool bale from an EU Member State (MS) with similar flock prevalence to that in sheep in Greece in 2013 / 14 is low. In terms of SPGP virus levels, those infected sheep skins/hides entering GB {{are more likely to be}} from infected animals with normal skin (i. e., not showing lesions) and hence carrying lower levels of virus than those from animals showing papules and scabs which contain very high virus levels and are easier to detect. The predicted risk of importation of LSD virus per cattle hide/skin is also low (assuming LSD were to emerge in an EU MS with similar herd prevalence to that reported for SPGP in Greece in 2013 / 14). The levels of LSD virus on an infected cow's hide, if imported, may be very low.

Rinderpest and capripox (<b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> of cattle, sheep pox and goat pox) cause serious loss of productivity {{and can lead to}} mortality rates that can exceed 90 %. Vaccines have been available to control rinderpest and they are effective, but because of their poor thermal stability in the tropics, they have not led to the eradication of the disease. A capripox vaccine is widely used to vaccinate against sheep and goat pox. It is also effective in protecting cattle against <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease.</b> Researchers at the Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute of Animal Health, in the UK, have taken the capripox vaccine and added into it two genes from the rinderpest virus, to create what is known as a recombinant vaccine. These two genes produce proteins which play an important part in developing immunity against rinderpest. The genes are known as the Fusion or F gene, and the Haemagglutinin or H gene. Either the F or H gene are spliced into the genetic make-up of the <b>virus</b> that causes <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease,</b> making two recombinant vaccines. These recombinant vaccines continue to protect cattle, sheep and goats against <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> as well as producing either the F or H proteins which give protection against rinderpest. Thus one injection will provide protection against both diseases. The researchers have also achieved better shelf-life with the new vaccines than the old rinderpest vaccine.

40|$|The role of African {{wildlife}} in {{the occurrence of}} vector-borne infections in domestic animals has gained renewed interest as emerging and re-emerging infections occur worldwide at an increasing rate. In Africa, biodiversity conservation {{and the expansion of}} livestock production have increased the risk of transmitting vector-borne infections between wildlife and livestock. The indigenous African pathogens with transboundary potential, such as Rift Valley fever virus, African horse sickness virus, bluetongue virus, <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus,</b> African swine fever virus, and blood-borne parasites have received the most attention. There is no evidence for persistent vector-borne viral infections in African wildlife. For some viral infections, wildlife may act as a reservoir through the inter-epidemic circulation of viruses with mild or subclinical manifestations. Wildlife may also act as introductory or transporting hosts when moved to new regions, e. g. for <b>lumpy</b> <b>skin</b> <b>disease</b> <b>virus,</b> Rift Valley fever virus and West Nile virus. Wildlife may also act as amplifying hosts when exposed to viruses {{in the early part of}} the warm season when vectors are active, with spillover to domestic animals later in the season, e. g. with bluetongue and African horse sickness. Some tick species found on domestic animals are more abundant on wildlife hosts; some depend on wildlife hosts to complete their life cycle. Since the endemic stability of a disease depends on a sufficiently large tick population to ensure that domestic animals become infected at an early age, the presence of wildlife hosts that augment tick numbers may be beneficial. Many wild ungulate species are reservoirs of Anaplasma spp., while the role of {{wildlife in}} the epidemiology of heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium infection) has not been elucidated. Wild ungulates are not usually reservoirs of piroplasms that affect livestock; however, there are two exceptions: zebra, which are reservoirs of Babesia caballi and Theileria equi, and buffalo, which are reservoirs of Theileria parva. The latter causes Corridor disease when transmitted from buffalo to cattle, but this appears to be a self-limiting condition, at least in southern Africa. Wild animals are important reservoirs of tsetse-transmitted Trypanosoma spp. infection. The distribution and abundance of some tsetse species, e. g. Glossina morsitans and G. pallidipes, are closely related to the occurrence of their preferred wildlife hosts. [URL]...|$|E

The genomic sequences of the South African LSDV Neethling Warmbaths isolate (LD) and the South African LSDV Neethling vaccine strain (LW), were compared to each other. The virulent South African isolate, LD was also compared to the previously sequenced virulent LSDV Neethling strain 2490 (LK), to determine molecular differences. The LSDV genome is approximately 150 kbp in size and consists of 156 putative genes. Of the 156 potential encoded proteins of the virulent LSDV field isolates, the South African LSDV Neethling Warmbaths isolate (LD) and the LSDV Kenyan Neethling strain 2490 (LK), 120 were identical, 21 showed differences of a single amino acid, 7 showed two amino acid differences, while only one showed three amino acid differences. These were mostly found in the variable terminal regions. The LSDV Kenyan Neethling strain 2490 (LK) was isolated in Kenya in 1958 and than re-isolated in 1987 from lesions of an experimentally infected cow (Tulmanet al. 2001).

These were again mainly in genes of the terminal regions and a number of these led to frameshifts that caused truncated open reading frames (ORFs) as well as deletions of up to nine amino acids and insertions of up to 42 amino acids. These modified open reading frames (ORFs) encode proteins that are involved in various aspects, such as the regulation of host immune responses [a soluble interferon (IFN) -gamma receptor, and an interleukin-l (IL-l) receptor-like protein], gene expression (mutT motif proteins), DNA repair (superoxide dismutase), host-range specificity (ankyrin-repeat protein, kelch-like proteins) including proteins with unassigned functions. These differences could lead to a reduction in immuno evasive mechanisms and virulence factors present in attenuated LSDV strains. At this stage, {{it is not possible to}} define which amino acid differences in particular are responsible for dramatic alterations in viral virulence. A good indication, however are differences occurring in functional domains. A mutation in a trans-membrane region, for example, could alter the levels of secretion of a protein involved in the regulation of the host immune response. We conclude that the attenuated effect is likely to be the sum of the altered phenotypes of the expressed proteins, although it is also likely that a few specific proteins carry more weight. Further studies to determine the functions of the relevant encoded gene products will hopefully confirm this. The molecular design of an effective vaccine is likely to be based on the strategic manipulation of such genes. Dissertation (MSc (Microbiology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
