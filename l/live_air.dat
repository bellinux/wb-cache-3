On <b>live</b> <b>air,</b> Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future.

Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E

60|$|Dew {{and rain}} fall everywhere, Harvests ripen, flowers are fair, And the whole round earth is bare To the moonshine and the sun; And the <b>live</b> <b>air,</b> fanned with wings, Bright with breeze and sunshine, brings Into contact distant things, And {{makes all the}} {{countries}} one.|$|E
6000|$|... "The <b>live</b> <b>air</b> that waves the lilies waves {{the slender}} {{jet of water}} [...] Like a holy thought sent feebly up from soul of fasting saint: [...] Whereby lies a marble Silence, {{sleeping}} (Lough the sculptor wrought [...] her), [...] So asleep she is forgetting to say Hush!--a fancy quaint.|$|E
60|$|With a gasp of hope {{we pushed}} on. In five minutes {{there was no}} longer any doubt; it was a patch of faint light. A minute more and a breath of real <b>live</b> <b>air</b> was fanning us. On we struggled. All at once the tunnel narrowed. Sir Henry went on his knees. Smaller yet it grew, till it was only {{the size of a large}} fox's earth--it was earth now, mind you; the rock had ceased.|$|E

60|$|He {{took that}} private passage {{which he had}} trodden so often in less momentous hours. The porter let him out: and the bountiful, cold air {{of the night and}} the pure glory of the stars {{received}} him on the threshold. He looked round him, breathing deep of earth's plain fragrance; he looked up into the great array of heaven, and was quieted. His little turgid life dwindled to its true proportions; and he saw himself (that great flame-hearted martyr!) stand like a speck under the cool cupola of the night. Thus he felt his careless injuries already soothed; the <b>live</b> <b>air</b> of out-of-doors, the quiet of the world, as if by their silent music, sobering and dwarfing his emotions.|$|E
60|$|Next dawning, {{entering}} a buggy of fragile construction, {{with the old}} people from Chicago, I embarked on my perilous career. We ran straight up a mountain till we could see, sixty miles away, the white houses of Cook City on another mountain, and the whiplash-like trail leading thereto. The <b>live</b> <b>air</b> made me drunk. If Tom, the driver, had proposed to send the mares in a bee-line to the city, I should have assented, and so would the old lady, who chewed gum and talked about her symptoms. The tub-ended rock-dog, which is but the translated prairie-dog, broke across the road under our horses' feet, the rabbit and the chipmunk danced with fright; we heard {{the roar of the}} river, and the road went round a corner. On one side piled rock and shale, that enjoined silence for fear of a general slide-down; on the other a sheer drop, and a fool of a noisy river below. Then, apparently {{in the middle of the}} road, lest any should find driving too easy, a post of rock. Nothing beyond that save the flank of a cliff. Then my stomach departed from me, as it does when you swing, for we left the dirt, which was at least some guarantee of safety, and sailed out round the curve, and up a steep incline, on a plank-road built out from the cliff. The planks were nailed at the outer edge, and did not shift or creak very much--but enough, quite enough. That was the Golden Gate. I got my stomach back again when we trotted out on to a vast upland adorned with a lake and hills. Have you ever seen an untouched land--the face of virgin Nature? It is rather a curious sight, because the hills are choked with timber that has never known an axe, and the storm has rent a way through this timber, so that a hundred thousand trees lie matted together in swathes; and, since each tree lies where it falls, you may behold trunk and branch returning to the earth whence they sprang--exactly as the body of man returns--each limb making its own little grave, the grass climbing above the bark, till at last there remains only the outline of a tree upon the rank undergrowth.|$|E
