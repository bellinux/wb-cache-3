25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout parts of its range. Due to its abundance, it {{may be one of}} the primary species in a fishery. The availability of fisheries statistics for the species is variable throughout its range, with the Americas having separate statistics kept for the species, while in Africa and Europe it is lumped in with other carangids in statistics. In the Americas, recent catch data suggests an increased amount of the species is being taken (or reported), with the 2006 and 2007 catch averaging between 6000 and 7000 tonnes, while during the 1980s and 1990s, there was rarely an annual catch greater than 1000 tonnes. Research on the fisheries of local regions has shown how important the fish is to certain fisheries. Artisanal fisheries in Santa Catarina Island have shown blue runner to be third most important and abundant species, making up 5.6% of landings, or 4.38 tonnes. Even subsistence fisheries at the edge of its range in Brazil show a catch of 388kg in two years from beach seines. Throughout its range the blue runner is commercially taken by haul seines, <b>lampara</b> nets, purse seines, gill nets, and hook and line methods. The fish is sold at market either fresh, dried, smoked or as fishmeal, oil or bait.|$|E

40|$|El trips de las flores Frankliniella occidentalis (P.) es, sin dudas, uno de los insectos del orden Thysanoptera de mayor peligrosidad en el mundo, ya que produce importantes pérdidas económicas. Esto se debe a su periódica aparición y al daño que ocasiona, tanto por la extracción de savia como por la transmisión de enfermedades virósicas, principalmente en cultivos hortícolas y plantas ornamentales tales como rosa, gerbera y clavel. El monitoreo con trampas adhesivas de color proveen un método simple para estimar la densidad poblacional del trips con poco esfuerzo. Las mismas pueden medir poblaciones de la plaga más fácilmente que los métodos absolutos de monitoreo con uso intensivo de mano de obra, ya que continúan capturando en el tiempo mayor cantidad de trips. La efectividad del uso de trampas adhesivas de color como herramienta para monitoreo de trips ha sido evaluada en invernáculos estando condicionado al atractivo de las trampas y a las tasas de captura de trips según la especie. Al observarse un importante daño de trips, predominantemente en las flores en un cultivo de Gerbera jamesonii ubicado en un invernáculo de producción {{de flores}} de corte de la EEA INTA Concordia, provincia de Entre Ríos (Argentina), se inició el presente trabajo cuyo objetivo fue evaluar la efectividad de trampas de luz adhesivas de dos coloraciones (amarillas y azules, ambas seleccionadas por su reconocida atracción a diferentes especies de trips y con diferentes intensidades de luz (25 y 40 watts) sobre la captura de trips de las flores. La unidad muestral fue la trampa de luz, mientras que los tratamientos fueron: color de la trampa de luz (amarilla y azul), a dos intensidades distintas (25 y 40 watts), siendo por cada tratamiento un total de cuatro repeticiones. Las trampas de luz adhesivas fueron dispuestas en los canteros de Gerbera jamesonii, a razón de cuatro por cantero a los lados de los mismos, {{a la altura}} media de las flores de corte. La disposición de las trampas de cada tratamiento en la parcela {{experimental}} fue al azar. Las <b>lámparas</b> eran encendidas al atardecer y apagadas por la mañana, momento en que se llevaban al laboratorio con el fin de contabilizar el número de trips adultos capturados. Las trampas de luz amarillas de ambas intensidades (25 y 40 watts) resultaron ser significativamente más atractivas para la captura de adultos de F. occidentalis en comparación con las de color (azul) e igual intensidad. Por otra parte, las trampas de luz adhesivas indistintamente de su color, tanto amarillo como azul, resultaron ser significativamente más eficientes en la captura del trips F. occidentalis cuando las <b>lámparas</b> poseían una intensidad de 40 watts. Flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis (P.) may cause severe economic losses due to its periodic occurrence, {{the damage caused by}} sucking sap and spreading plant diseases through the transmission of viruses, mainly in horticultural crops and ornamental plants, such as roses, gerbera and carnation. Monitoring through sticky colored traps provides a simple method of obtaining estimates of thrips population densities. These traps may measure a far more rapid estimate of pest population than labor-intensive absolute methods of counting individuals, as these traps continuously catch a higher number of thrips throughout the time. The utility of these sticky colored traps methods as tools for monitoring thrips population has been assessed in greenhouses, taking into consideration the traps attractiveness and the capture rate according to species. This work was conducted once a serious damage on flowers (Frankliniella occidentalis) caused by thrips was observed, mainly in a Gerbera jamesonii crop located in a greenhouse for cut flowers production in the Argentine Agricultural Experiment Station (EEA) of the National Institute for Agricultural Technology (INTA) of Concordia, Province of Entre Rios (Argentina). The main purpose of this work was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} sticky light traps of two colors (yellow and blue, both of them selected due to its known attractiveness to various thrips species and different light intensities (25 and 40 watt bulb)) on the capture of flower thrips. These traps were made from cardboard boxes (22 x 30 x 20 cm) with an opening (10 x 15 cm) through which light passes and covered with a plastic wrap coated with adhesive material on which the adults thrips become trapped (The Tanglefoot Company Adhesive Pest Management & Tree Protection Products, USA). The trial consisted of the following four treatments: (i) yellow light trap with 25 watt bulb; (ii) yellow light trap with 40 watt bulb; (iii) blue light trap with 25 watt bulb and (iv) blue light trap with 40 watts bulb. Each treatment was replicated four times. Four sticky light traps were positioned on both sides of the Gerbera jamesonii flowerbeds to half-height of cut flowers. For each trial, the trap placement in each experimental design was at random. The bulbs were turned on at sunset and turned off in the morning when the traps were removed and carried to the laboratory and the number of adult thrips caught was counted. On the one hand, yellow light traps with both intensities (25 and 40 watt bulbs) became significantly more attractive to F. occidentalis adults in comparison to the capture rate on the blue ones with the same intensity; and, on the other hand, both yellow and blue sticky light traps were much more efficient for the capture of thrips F. occidentalis with 40 watt intensity bulbs. One reason why thrips would respond to various visual stimuli (a more effective response to w color and its high intensity) would be related to its response to the different changes of physiological features of plants. These changes would play a significant important role in sending a visual signal (color and intensity), which would lead Frankliniella occidentalis (P.) to change the search behavior as to its feeding sources and oviposition...|$|R

40|$|For {{this study}} the {{emerging}} contaminant ß-blocker Metoprolol (MET) {{has been selected}} due {{that it is a}} highly prescribed pharmaceutical and it has been detected in waste water treatment plants influents, thus, in natural waters. Several studies, focused on the toxicological potential of Metoprolol, indicate its potential environmental relevance and its recalcitrant nature. To remove MET from water, different Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) were used. MET removal was studied, in different reactors with natural and artificial light, by photolysis, UVC/H 2 O 2, photocatalysis, Fenton, photo-Fenton, bicarbonate-activated hydrogen peroxide (with cobalt or iron) processes. The different set-ups and technologies tested have been compared in order to establish the efficiency of the processes. The experiments were normally carried out with 50 mg/L of initial MET in Milli-Q water, free pH, and 25 ± 5 ºC. Thus, photolysis experiments were done in (solarbox (SB), Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC), Black light blue lamps (BLB) and UVC 254 nm (UVC) reactors). The best result obtained was 93. 5 % of MET removal in UVC reactor after 240 minutes. UVC/H 2 O 2 experiments were carried out in UVC reactor. Different H 2 O 2 concentrations and pH were tested and the maximum removals were MET (98 %) and TOC (70. 7 %) for 125 mg H 2 O 2 /L. Photocatalysis was carried in SB and CPC with different TiO 2 concentrations (0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 40 g /L). Experiments were also carried out varying the initial MET concentration (25, 50 and 100 mg/L), pH and the water matrix with 0. 4 g TiO 2 /L in SB or adding 25 and 150 mg/L of H 2 O 2. The best results obtained were a complete MET removal and 45. 7 % of mineralization in SB and 81. 5 % of MET degradation and 29. 2 % of mineralization in CPC. The dark-Fenton experiments were carried out at pH in a reactor of 2 L. Two different concentrations of Fe (II) (2. 5 mg/L or 10 mg/L) and H 2 O 2 (25 mg/L or 150 mg/L) were used. To improve the Fenton process, the total Iron (II) concentration was divided in equal parts (5) and added at constant periods of time (12 minutes) during 1 hour. With the highest concentrations of iron and H 2 O 2 the maximum MET conversion was 87. 0 % and mineralization 15. 6 %. Photo-Fenton experiments were done at pH 3, and temperature of 14 or 25 ºC in four reactors (BLB, SB, CPC and UVC). Two different concentrations of Fe (II) (2. 5 mg/L or 10 mg/L) and H 2 O 2 (25 mg/L or 150 mg/L) were used. With the highest iron and H 2 O 2 concentrations, the best results in MET degradation were observed (BLB: 100 % in 7 min; SB: 97. 3 % in 7 min; CPC: 98. 3 % in 3 min). The dark- Bicarbonate/hydrogen peroxide experiments were carried out with 5 mg/L of MET in drinking water, pH 6. 2, and room temperature in a reactor of 0. 5 L. To improve the process, cobalt (II) or iron (II) as catalyzer were added in the batch reactor. A complete MET conversion in 40 minutes was achieved. The efficiency of different AOPs and reactors tested was compared from the ratio between accumulated energy and MET eliminated. The energy is better used in CPC (0. 065 kJ/mg) than in SB (0. 275 kJ/mg). For photo-Fenton process (0. 04 kJ/mg) UVC and (0. 05 kJ/mg) BLB reactors exhibit a much better performance than (0. 30 kJ/mg) SB and (0. 26 kJ/mg) CPC reactors. From the intermediates identified, a possible MET fragmentation was proposed for the different processes, where, mainly oxidative attacks were detected. On the other hand, the irradiation in the photocatalytic reactor (SB) was measured by o-NB actinometry, based on pH or o-NB concentration. In addition, this work has demonstrated that the o-NB actinometry, followed by o-NB concentration consumption, could be used {{in the presence of the}} catalyst TiO 2. En este trabajo se ha estudiado la eficacia de varios Procesos de Oxidación Avanzada (UVC/H 2 O 2, fotocatálisis, Fenton, foto-Fenton, bicarbonato/H 2 O 2 con y sin catalizador) para degradar el fármaco Metoprolol (MET). Además se ha comparado la eficiencia energética de los diferentes procesos y diferentes instalaciones en la eliminación de MET. Los experimentos se realizaron con 50 mg/L iniciales de MET en agua Mili-Q, pH libre y 25 ºC. En el caso de la fotólisis, se usaron cuatro instalaciones (solarbox (SB), concentradores parabólicos compuestos (CPC), <b>lámparas</b> black light blue (BLB) y UVC 254 nm (UVC)) y el mejor resultado obtenido fue (UVC: 93, 5 %). Los experimentos UVC se realizaron a diferentes pH y concentraciones de H 2 O 2 con una eliminación de MET de 98 %. Los experimentos de fotocatálisis se llevaron a cabo con luz natural y artificial, variando la concentración de TiO 2 (0, 05, 0, 10 y 0, 40 g/L). También se realizaron experimentos con 0, 4 g/L TiO 2 pero variando la concentración inicial del MET (25, 50 y 100 mg/L), el pH, la matriz acuosa y adicionando peróxido de hidrógeno. Los mejores resultados fueron (CPC: 81, 5 % y SB: 100 %). Los experimentos de Fenton se realizaron a pH 3, 0 en un reactor de 2 L. Para mejorar el proceso, la adición del Fe (II) se dividió en 5 adiciones realizadas a intervalos constantes de tiempo durante 60 minutos. La mejor degradación de MET fue 87 %. Los experimentos de foto-Fenton se realizaron a pH 3, 0 y temperaturas de 14 ºC y 25 ºC en cuatro instalaciones diferentes (BLB, SB, CPC y UVC). Los mejores resultados obtenidos para la eliminación de MET fueron (BLB: 100 %; SB: 97, 3 % y CPC: 98, 3 %). Los experimentos con bicarbonato/H 2 O 2 se realizaron con 5 mg/L iniciales de MET en agua potable, pH libre y temperatura ambiental en un reactor de 0, 5 L. Adicionalmente se utilizó Co (II) y Fe (II) como catalizadores. Eliminación de MET de 100 %. Se realizó la identificación de los diferentes intermedios y se han establecido los posibles caminos de degradación del MET. Finalmente se realizó un estudio de un método actinométrico para poder realizar mediciones de radiación en un reactor fotocatalítico en presencia de un catalizador en suspensión...|$|R
