The team missed the all-round ability of George Giffen, who {{had refused to}} join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success.

He took only one wicket, dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1. Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1not out and in the second, 5runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288runs {{at an average of}} 8.47 and took 52wickets at an average of 21.75.
