5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that {{there ought to be a}} political balance in every branch of public service. Lack of balance in public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the <b>legal</b> <b>standing</b> of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed to accept an appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event had occurred because the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed by the Clinton administration when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of <b>legal</b> <b>standing,</b> an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections.

5|$|In September 2008, Beshear's {{administration}} {{attempted to}} {{seize control of}} 141 gambling-related domain names {{in an attempt to}} block Kentucky residents from accessing those websites. Beshear claimed the sites were conducting illegal, unregulated gambling operations in the state and providing untaxed competition to the state's horse racing industry. Later that year, a Franklin County judge ruled that Beshear had the authority to seize the domain names, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned that ruling on appeal. Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court, partially on grounds that the web site owners were being represented by gambling associations and players groups who Beshear said had no <b>legal</b> <b>standing</b> in the case. In 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court agreed with Beshear and ordered the web site owners themselves to appear before the court. On December 23, 2015, Franklin County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Wingate ruled in favor of the state and awarded it $870 million in damages. The other party to the case, Amaya Gaming, announced they would appeal the decision.|$|E
5|$|Seats are {{allocated}} on {{a regional}} basis, {{each of the}} four major regions receives 24seats, and the remainder of the available seats being assigned to smaller regions. The four major regions are Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island), and the Western provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan). The seats for Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut are assigned apart from these regional divisions. The province of Quebec has 24 Senate divisions that are constitutionally mandated. In all other provinces, a Senate division is strictly an optional designation of the senator's own choosing, and has no real constitutional or <b>legal</b> <b>standing.</b> A senator who does not choose a special senate division is considered a senator for the province at large. The distribution of seats has been criticized for not being proportional per region. For example, Ontario has 40 percent of Canada's population but only 24seats, while the smaller Atlantic provinces have a combined 30, and British Columbia, the third most populous province, only has six seats.|$|E

5|$|While the {{production}}'s lawyers {{worked to}} clarify its <b>legal</b> <b>standing</b> in the Summer of 2005, it emerged that Humbert Balsan's deeply indebted production company Ognon Pictures had pledged all {{rights to the}} production to Coficiné in exchange for loans.

After meeting with the producers and their new French partner, Paul Saadoun of 13 Production, Coficiné consented to completing the film.

5|$|In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip {{assumed the}} {{position}} of Governor of the new British colony of New South Wales which according to his commission included New Zealand. The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern Māori. In 1835, following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry, the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection. Ongoing unrest, the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company (which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori) and the dubious <b>legal</b> <b>standing</b> of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Māori. The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. In response to the New Zealand Company's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa, Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840, even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign. With {{the signing of the}} Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants, particularly from the United Kingdom, began to increase.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 1861, Davis {{appointed}} General P. G. T. Beauregard {{to command}} all Confederate {{troops in the}} vicinity of Charleston, South Carolina, where state officials prepared to take possession of Fort Sumter. Beauregard was to prepare his forces but await orders to attack the fort. Within the fort the issue was not of the niceties of geo-political posturing but of survival. They would be out of food on the 15th. The small Union crew had but half a dozen officers under Major Robert Anderson. Famously, this included the baseball folk hero Abner Doubleday. More improbable yet was a Union officer who had the name of Jefferson C. Davis. He would spend the war being taunted for his name but not his loyalty to the Northern cause. The newly installed President Lincoln, not wishing to initiate hostilities, informed South Carolina Governor Pickens that he was dispatching a small fleet of ships from the navy yard in New York to resupply but not re-enforce Fort Pickens in Florida and Fort Sumter. The US President did not inform CSA President Davis of this intended resupply of food and fuel. Jefferson Davis, for Lincoln, was the leader of an insurrection and so without <b>legal</b> <b>standing</b> in US affairs. To deal with him would be to give legitimacy to the rebellion. Holding to the belief that Sumter was the property of the sovereign United States was the reason for maintaining the garrison on the island fortress. He informed Gov. Pickens that the resupply mission would not land troops or munitions unless they were fired upon. As it turned out, just as the supply ships approached Charleston harbor, the bombardment would begin and the flotilla watched the spectacle from 10 miles at sea.|$|E

40|$|Under {{sixth century}} Roman law (Corpus Juris Civilis) and Frankish law (Pactus Legis Salicae), women, while lacking full {{juridical}} equality with men, nevertheless possessed many legal rights and freedoms. While similarities {{existed between the}} <b>legal</b> <b>standings</b> of women in both worlds, a fundamental difference underlay the laws and legal systems. Over centuries, the Roman legal system evolved from dependence on family for justice to dependence on the state. The presence of a relatively strong and stable Roman government, legal system, and policing force gradually decreased Roman women's legal dependence on their families and weakened the legal control of male agnates and husbands on Roman women's lives, creating a system which gave women legal recourse against kin (paterfamilias excepted). Frankish law was more dependent on family and kin for enforcement; hence, Frankish women, lacking legal recourse against family, were subject to greater legal control by male relatives...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the Polish nobles who had owned serfs, the Ukrainian nobles did not experience economic losses when serfdom was abolished. Instead, they experienced a loss in social status and standing. The Ukrainian nobles lost all of their privileges, they were placed under the same legal authority and given the same obligations as the peasants. In 1860, noble self-government was abolished and noble and peasant elected bodies were integrated. The nobility attempted to continue to unofficially elect their own leaders, traditionally known as prefects, despite official integration with the peasant community. Multiple appeals to the Austrian government in the 1860s seeking to obtain separate <b>legal</b> <b>standings</b> for themselves failed, with rare exceptions such as sometimes being able {{to avoid having to}} perform compulsory roadwork. Thus, in the mid nineteenth century the political and socioeconomic differences between the Ukrainian nobles and the Ukrainian peasants disappeared.|$|R

40|$|Trafficking {{in human}} beings and {{prostitution}} is an increasing occurrence within the EU. However, vast differences in legal frameworks regarding prostitution can be detected among member states. The Netherlands is an example where prostitution is regarded a legal activity. In other member states <b>legal</b> <b>standings</b> toward prostitution remain ambivalent, where Sweden here serves an example. Finally, Lithuania is among member states where prostitution is considered illegal. The {{purpose of this paper}} is therefore to study underlying attitudes and approaches that these three countries have in this rather delicate political question. By interpreting the content and quoting parts of propositions, an ideology analysis is constructed. The theory chapter consists of Rousseau’s theories, Objectivism, Radical Feminist Theory, and Sex-positive Feminist Theory. A model with the most important features of these theories is constructed and works as a base for the analysis. The general results suggest that the Government of Lithuania consistently uses arguments pending towards Radical Feminist Theory and Rousseauan values, with catholic morality as an additional important feature in the argumentation against prostitution. The Government of Sweden also views prostitution with predominantly Rousseauan and Radical Feminist theories. The Government of the Netherlands arguments greatly differ from these viewpoints. Instead, individualistic and sex-positive arguments remain dominant here...|$|R
