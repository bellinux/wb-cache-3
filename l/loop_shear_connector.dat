In the {{construction}} of composite bridge structures, various types of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are usually used to provide an efficient load transfer and the composite action {{of two or more}} different materials. In the previous work conducted by authors, a new type of the <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was introduced, which is the perforated <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> with flange heads (T-shaped perforated <b>shear</b> <b>connector),</b> and the structural behavior of the <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was discussed {{based on the results of}} push-out tests. For the practical design of new <b>shear</b> <b>connector,</b> it is necessary to develop the equation for the prediction of the load carrying capacity of the <b>shear</b> <b>connector.</b> In this study, the existing design equations for the Perfobond <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> were briefly analyzed and the equation for the prediction of the shear capacity of T-shaped perforated <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> was suggested empirically.

The existing Y-type perfobond rib <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are designed for girder slabs of composite bridges. Therefore, the rib and transverse rebars of the conventional Y-type perfobond rib <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are extremely large for the composite frames of building structures. Thus, this paper proposes stubby Y-type perfobond rib <b>shear</b> <b>connectors,</b> redefining the existing connectors, for composite frames of building structures; these were used to perform push-out tests. These <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> have relatively small ribs compared to the conventional Y-type perfobond rib <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> To confirm the shear resistance of these stubby <b>shear</b> <b>connectors,</b> we performed an experiment by using transverse rebars D 13 and D 16.

However, considering the superposition effect of the two should depend on the <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> because the natural bonding function between cold-formed thin-walled C steel and foam concrete is not changed by <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The main influence factor is the buried depth of <b>shear</b> <b>connector.</b> For instance, when the <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> buried depth is too small and near to the loading end, it will be premature to reach the ultimate shear capacity. That means the failure of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> shall occur in the increasing segment of natural bond-slip. Otherwise the <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> will fail in the descending phase of natural bond-slip. Therefore, the maximum value will happen on the situation that the two peaks overlap.

40|$|Full-depth precast {{concrete}} deck systems have several advantages over traditional cast-in-place concrete decks. Higher concrete quality, accelerated construction, and reduced life-cycle cost {{are the main}} advantages. Full-depth {{precast concrete}} deck systems can be designed as composite or non-composite systems with the supporting girders. Composite systems are commonly used due to their superior structural performance and cost effectiveness. These systems {{require the use of}} <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> between the precast concrete deck panels and the supporting girders to transfer interface shear and achieve composite action. The use of discrete clustered <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> is highly preferred in order to simplify panel and girder fabrication and improve system constructability. However, existing code provisions for the design of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were developed for continuous small-diameter <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> and might not be adequate for the design of discrete clustered connectors especially when large diameter connectors are used. ^ The objective of this research is to develop design equation for discrete <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in precast concrete bridge deck systems. The proposed design equation accounts for cohesion and friction between the deck and girder; and the dowel effects of clustered <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Interface <b>shear</b> test data obtained from the literature are used to validate the reliability of the proposed equation. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the connection between precast deck and girder is performed to understand its behavior of and stress distribution at <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Also the influence of concrete strength and <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> properties on the interface shear capacity of connection is studied.

40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{generally}} used {{to link the}} slab and girders together in slab-on-girder bridge structures. Damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in such structures will result in shear slippage between the slab and girders, which significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of the bridge. Because <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are buried inside the structure, routine visual inspection {{is not able to}} detect conditions of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> A few methods have been proposed in the literature to detect the condition of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> based on vibration measurements. This paper proposes a different dynamic condition assessment approach to identify the damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in slab-on-girder bridge structures based on power spectral density transmissibility (PSDT). PSDT formulates the relationship between the auto-spectral densities of two responses in the frequency domain. It can be used to identify <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> conditions with or without reference data of the undamaged structure (or the baseline). Measured impact force and acceleration responses from hammer tests are analyzed to obtain the frequency response functions at sensor locations by experimental modal analysis. PSDT from the slab response to the girder response is derived with the obtained frequency response functions. PSDT vectors in the undamaged and damaged states can be compared to identify the damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> When the baseline is not available, as in most practical cases, PSDT vectors from the measured response at a reference sensor to those of the slab and girder in the damaged state can be used to detect the damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Numerical and experimental studies on a concrete slab supported by two steel girders are conducted to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. Identification results demonstrate that damages of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are identified accurately and efficiently with and without the baseline.

Assessment of the integrity of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> {{is an important issue}} in the maintenance and health monitoring of such structures. In this study, a 1 : 3 scaled bridge model was constructed with removable anchors linking the slab and girders as <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Each anchor consisted of a threaded bar penetrating through the soffit of a girder and anchored in the slab by an embedded nut cap with welded steel bar. Different damage scenarios were simulated by removing some of these connectors. A signal-based damage detection method in which the damage feature is characterized by the wavelet packet energy changes was applied to the damage identification of the <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Using measurements of hammer impact responses, the locations of the loosening of the <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were effectively detected. This paper demonstrates that the wavelet packet-based energy index is a sensitive local damage indicator. The results also show that comparison of the relative vibration between the slab and the girders is a more effective technique for evaluating the <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> damage than comparison of the vibration of the slab before and after <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> damage.

This study presents and discusses the behavior of composite beam with cold formed steel section and innovative <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The composite beam comprises two cold formed steel of lipped C-sections oriented back to back to form I-steel beam and perpendicular metal decking concrete slab. Three types of bracket <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> namely single bracket (SBSC), double bracket (DBSC) and hot rolled plate (HPSC) <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were developed and used; the proposed <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> were fixed to the web of steel beam by bolts. In addition, headed stud (HSSC) <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> welded to the top flange of cold formed steel beam was also investigated. Push tests in accordance with Eurocode 4 were carried out to determine the strength capacity and ductility of the proposed <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Sequentially, full-scale beam tests were conducted to investigate the actual behavior of the composite beam with the proposed <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> The length of full-scale specimen between supports is 4000 mm. Theoretical validation for the experimental results was performed based on the plastic analysis of composite beam. The experimental results of push tests showed very good strength with extreme deformation capacity for all bracket <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> suggesting that they are strong and ductile enough to provide composite action between steel beam and concrete slab. Also, it was observed that strength capacity of <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> increases as the thickness of steel beam increases. For headed stud <b>shear</b> <b>connectors,</b> the stud possess strength capacity as high as its predicted strength. The results of full-scale beam tests showed very good agreement as compared to theoretical values that predicted based on push test results. The bending resistance and stiffness of the composite beams were improved up to 170 % and 270 % respectively as compared to non-composite cold formed steel beam.

40|$|Nowadays {{steel and}} {{concrete}} composite beams are widely applied in structures mainly subjected to dynamic loads, such as railway and road bridges exposed to traffic loads and industrial crane runways exposed to folk-lift truck loads, the fatigue resistance of these structures must be generally and carefully verified. And normally the shear forces between concrete flange and steel beams are all transferred by {{different kinds of}} <b>shear</b> <b>connectors,</b> fatigue failure of composite beam may happen on <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> So the fatigue resistance of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in composite beams is significant for the safe of whole structure {{and needed to be}} well investigated. The fatigue strength of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> could be explained in three ways, the fatigue endurance described by the relationships between stress range (S) and number of cycles (N), the static residual strength after a certain number of cycling loading, and the slip behavior during the cycling tests. S-N curves which widely used for steel fatigue assessment are also useful for <b>shear</b> <b>connectors.</b> Although there are already S-N curves for headed steel studs in Eurocodes and AASHTO, they are normally available for common studs. Whether these S-N curves applicable for large diameter studs or studs embedded in high strength concrete or other kind <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> is questionable. And the factors influencing fatigue life of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are needed more research. Furthermore, for the fatigue life assessment of existing structures, it is important to attain the residual strength after a certain service life or the principles of slip developing behavior during the service life. Then it is possible to assess how long the <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> could still service...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{generally}} used {{to link the}} slab and girder together in slab-on-girder bridge structures. Damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in such structures will result in shear slippage between the slab and girder, which significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of bridges. A damage detection approach based on transmissibility in frequency domain is proposed in this paper to identify the damage of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in slab-on-girder bridge structures with or without reference data from the undamaged structure. The transmissibility, which is an inherent system characteristic, indicates the relationship between two sets of response vectors in frequency domain. Measured input force and acceleration responses from hammer tests are analyzed to obtain the frequency response functions at the slab and girder sensor locations by the experimental modal analysis. The transmissibility matrix that relates the slab response to the girder response is then derived. By comparing the transmissibility vectors in undamaged and damaged states, the damage level of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> can be identified. When the measurement data from the undamaged structure are not available, a study with only the measured response data in the damaged state for the condition assessment of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> is also conducted. Numerical and experimental studies on damage detection of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> linking a concrete slab to two steel girders are conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method {{can be used to}} identify <b>shear</b> <b>connector</b> damages accurately and efficiently. The proposed method is also applied to the condition evaluation of <b>shear</b> <b>connectors</b> in a real composite bridge with in-field testing data.
