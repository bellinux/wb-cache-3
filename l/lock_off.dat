500|$|Believing the {{military}} forces to be neutralised, Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault itself as Goldfinger arrives {{in a helicopter}} with the atomic device. In the vault, his henchman Kisch handcuffs Bond to the bomb. The troops attack; Goldfinger takes off his coat, revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and the troops seeking to open the vault, then makes his escape. Kisch attempts to stop the bomb, but Oddjob kills him. Bond frees himself from the handcuffs, but Oddjob attacks him before he can disarm the bomb. Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob, then forces the <b>lock</b> <b>off</b> the bomb using gold bars from the vault, but is unable to disarm it. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter arrives with seconds to spare, and simply turns off the device with the timer stopped on [...] "0:07".|$|E
2500|$|PickLock – A round post on {{the back}} base of the blade locks into a hole in a spring tab in the handle.

50|$|Active belay {{devices have}} a {{built-in}} mechanism that <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> the rope {{without the help}} of any other pieces of equipment. The GriGri by Petzl is an example of an active belay device. The offset cam in the GriGri <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> the rope automatically to catch a falling climber, much like a seat belt in a car <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> to hold a passenger securely.|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge of}} the Bird of Prey was lit by {{overhead}} lights through patterned grids. One scene which featured over a hundred Klingons on scene was shot with only fifty extras.

5000|$|A money line {{began at}} $4,444 and {{eighteen}} random cards were dealt. Each player began with $1,000. The object was {{to select a}} card (numbered 1-18) that raised {{one of the four}} suits (clubs, spades, diamonds, or hearts). Doing so added $100 to their score and gave them the option to pick another card or pass control to the player to their left. Whenever an 8 was selected, the suit would be <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> and could never come down. Selecting a card that did not raise a suit or a card from a <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> suit would incur a strike. Three strikes eliminated a player. The last player left in the game or the player who found the last [...] "8" [...] won the game and the amount in the money line, or their score, whichever was greater. All players kept what they won.|$|R
6000|$|As Mark {{examined}} {{them carefully}} the Squire stood {{up with his}} back to the fire, and looking round walked to the door and said: [...] "I thought there was a draught somewhere; either Ramoo did not shut the door when he went out or it has come open again. It has done that once or twice before. When I go into town tomorrow I will tell Tucker to send a man up to take the <b>lock</b> <b>off.</b> Well, what do you make out of that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sadness in his eye, a sweet {{smile on}} his lip, and {{serenity}} on his brow, joined with the fevered cheek, the air of lassitude, and the panting, oppressed breath, there was a strange, melancholy beauty about him; and while Amy felt an impulse of ardent, clinging affection to one so precious to her, there was joined with it a sort of awe and veneration for one who so spoke, looked, and felt. She hung over him, and sprinkled him with Eau-de-Cologne; then as his hair teased him by falling into his eyes, {{he asked her to}} cut the front <b>lock</b> <b>off.</b> There was something sad in doing this, for that 'tumble-down wave,' as Charlotte called it, was rather a favourite of Amy's; it always seemed to have so much sympathy with his moods, {{and it was as if}} parting with it was resigning him to a long illness. However, it was too troublesome not to go, and he looked amused at the care with which she folded up the glossy, brown wave, and treasured it in her dressing-case, then she read to him a few verses of a psalm, and he soon fell into another doze.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{he looked}} at me as keenly as he spoke, [...] "all that is in doubt is the {{conscience}} of the employer, and the belief of your policemen {{as to whether or not}} that employer has a good conscience or a bad one. Your police must indeed be zealous men and clever, oh so clever, in reading the heart, that they trouble themselves in such matter. No, no, my friend Jonathan, you go take the <b>lock</b> <b>off</b> a hundred empty houses in this your London, or of any city in the world, and if you do it as such things are rightly done, and at the time such things are rightly done, no one will interfere. I have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in London, and when he went for months of summer to Switzerland and lock up his house, some burglar come and broke window at back and got in. Then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door, before the very eyes of the police. Then he have an auction in that house, and advertise it, and put up big notice. And when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them. Then he go to a builder, and he sell him that house, making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time. And your police and other authority help him all they can. And when that owner come back from his holiday in Switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been. This was all done en regle, and in our work we shall be en regle too. We shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of, shall deem it strange. But we shall go after ten o'clock, when there are many about, and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house." ...|$|E

50|$|Belay {{devices are}} {{mechanical}} friction brake devices {{used to control}} a rope when belaying. Their main purpose is to allow the rope to be <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> with minimal effort to arrest a climber's fall. Multiple kinds of belay devices exist, {{some of which may}} additionally be used as descenders for controlled descent on a rope, as in abseiling or rappelling.|$|R

Con Edison workers inspected the installation just an hour before the explosion, but did not pass it, for reasons not related to safety. The new line was <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> and not operational.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the three}} [...] "BBK"'s dead, Sarah shoots the <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> of the {{emergency}} doors and the two survivors escape the bowling alley. Traumatized and, above all, upset that Jamie did nothing to prevent the murders, Sarah turns the gun on him, pumps it saying: [...] "'cuz we're both fucked". The screen cuts to black as a gunshot is heard, indicating that Sarah murdered Jamie {{and is on the}} run.|$|R
5000|$|Richmond, Virginia: There are {{a series}} of {{connected}} tunnels between state government buildings in the city of Richmond. Certain passageways are <b>locked</b> <b>off</b> but {{a good portion of the}} tunnels are accessible from buildings. The purpose of the tunnels is not generally known; the two most common explanations are that they were built to allow people to move between buildings in inclement weather or that they were built as part of an emergency evacuation plan.|$|R
50|$|If the climber climbs {{three feet}} {{higher than the}} last piece of {{protection}} in the rock, and then falls, the rope allows him to fall the three feet to the protection, and another three feet below that. If they fall any further, rope is pulled upwards through the protection from the belayer below. Because the belayer generally keeps the rope <b>locked</b> <b>off,</b> the climber's fall should be arrested and they are left suspended, but safe, somewhere below the protection.|$|R
50|$|A Guide Plate, {{also known}} as an auto-blocking belay device, is a metal plate with an {{elongated}} slot for the bight to go through and then a carabiner is attached so that when pull from the climber occurs the carabiner will be pulled to <b>lock</b> <b>off</b> the device.|$|E

50|$|The single track, {{owned by}} Network Rail, is still {{connected}} to the National Rail network via Whitemoor Junction near March, but <b>locked</b> <b>off.</b> New signalling was installed at the junction during late 2007 {{for the benefit of}} outward bound engineering trains from the re-opened Whitemoor Yard, once the second biggest freight yard in Europe during World War II and now a stabling point for engineering trains. The railway's infrastructure, including the level crossings, remains largely in place.|$|R
5000|$|As {{long as the}} {{clove hitch}} can feed over the drum, the rope will feed through the device. In a fall, the drum is back driven by the rope as the device slides down the rope; when the drum {{rotation}} exceeds a certain angular velocity, it <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> to the frame {{and the increase in}} friction induced between the stationary drum and the rope causes the clove hitch to rapidly tighten around the locked drum to arrest the fall.|$|R
5000|$|The Enhanced Traction System is an all-speed engine based {{traction}} control system used by General Motors Corporation in many of their automobile models. In some models, the driver has the option to disable this system by pushing a button marked [...] "ETS". The system uses sensors to monitor wheelspin and reduces engine speed, upshifts or retards ignition timing to improve traction. The Button is usually located on the gearshift and <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> when the check engine light comes on for any other reason.|$|R
50|$|In one episode, {{when the}} Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the Closet of Silence. In the Closet, {{there are so}} many coats and jackets, they can barely hear each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the <b>lock</b> <b>off,</b> {{injuring}} Larabee in the process.|$|E
50|$|The Vinten Mk 3 Pan & Tilt head used risers and cams to {{maintain}} the centre of gravity. This made the tilting of heavy cameras considerably easier and if correctly mounted a camera could be left at any tilt angle without <b>lock</b> <b>off.</b> The design (by William Vinten's son Bill) was highly innovative for the time.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the homeowner}} leaves, {{the two men}} notice all the food and liquor he has and decide that it will go to waste if it's not consumed. They shoot the <b>lock</b> <b>off</b> his liquor cabinet and invite {{numerous}} people to his house to party: have naked conga lines, throw people into his swimming pool, and partake in his commodities.|$|E
25|$|Releasable abseil - Used by some guides with inexperienced abseilers. A rope {{is set up}} by {{anchoring}} it with a munter hitch and <b>locking</b> <b>off</b> the non-rappelling {{strand of}} the rope. The client descends on the non-locked strand of the rope. The guide unlocks the other strand and lowers the client or the rappeller if the client gets into trouble. Useful with an inexperienced rappeller or when the rappeller gets into trouble, for example, by getting {{a piece of clothing}} or hair entangled in the descender.|$|R
2500|$|Hammer drills {{almost always}} have a lever or switch that <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> the special [...] "hammer clutch," [...] turning the tool into a {{conventional}} drill for wood or metal work. Hammer drills are more expensive and more bulky than regular drills, but are preferable for applications where the material to be drilledconcrete block or wood studsis unknown. [...] For example, an electrician would use a hammer drill for attaching items (such as an electrical box) to either wood studs (if used as a conventional power drill) or masonry walls (if used as a hammer drill).|$|R
50|$|However, the GriGri's {{automatic}} {{action can}} lead to less alert belayers. The GriGri is not a hands-free belay device and constant vigilance is required by the belayer {{no matter what kind}} of device is used. One common mistake with the GriGri is reverse threading it, rendering the camming action useless. Though, in a fall with a reverse threaded GriGri, bending the rope sharply under the GriGri provides more than enough friction to hold a falling climber as long as the belayer <b>locks</b> <b>off</b> the rope as they would with a tube style (passive) device.|$|R
