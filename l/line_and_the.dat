5|$|The {{station was}} built {{as part of}} the Chrystie Street Connection between the Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. The Chrystie Street Connection was first {{proposed}} in 1947 as {{the southern end of the}} Second Avenue Subway (SAS), which would feed into the two bridges, allowing Sixth Avenue Line trains to access the BMT Jamaica Line, BMT Fourth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> BMT Brighton Line in Brooklyn. Construction started in 1962, and the first part of the connection, including this station, opened on November 26, 1967, when the link between the Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan Bridge north tracks opened. The connection was fully opened on July 1, 1968 with the opening of the 57th Street and the opening of the connection between the Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Williamsburg Bridge. With the connection completed, the most significant service changes ever carried out in the subway's history were introduced.|$|E
