40|$|In an {{industrial}} Fluid CokerTM, <b>liquid</b> <b>bitumen</b> is injected into {{a bed of}} hot coke particles through spray nozzles, grouped in several banks at different vertical positions. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether significant improvements in liquid-solid contact could be achieved by optimizing {{the location of the}} spray nozzles. In the coker regions where bitumen is injected, the gas is a mixture of product vapors and steam. Steam introduced at different levels rises through the coker: the stripping steam is injected near the bottom, then the attrition steam above the stripper and finally the bitumen atomization steam. As a result, the cross-sectional averaged gas velocity greatly varies vertically, from the lowest spray bank to the highest spray bank. In addition, there are large radial variations in gas velocity, as gas bubbles tend to concentrate in the central region of the bed. In this study, the impacts on liquid-solid contact of gas velocity and uneven gas distribution were investigated. The effects of spray pulsations and atomization gas flowrate on liquid distribution were also studied. Effects of bed hydrodynamics on the initial liquid distribution and on the subsequent drying were studied separately. The results indicate that jet pulsations or increasing the atomization gas flowrate improve the liquid distribution. Large improvements in liquid distribution were achieved by increasing the superficial gas velocity and also increasing the gas velocity {{at the end of the}} spray jet cavity, for all types of spray jets, pulsating or non-pulsating...|$|E

40|$|In this study, capillary-driven flow of {{different}} pure <b>liquids</b> and diluted <b>bitumen</b> samples were studied using microfluidic channel (width of 30 um {{and depth of}} 9 um). Capillary filling kinetics of liquids {{as a function of}} time were evaluated and compared with theoretical predictions. For pure liquids including water, toluene, hexane, and methanol experimental results agreed well with theoretical predictions. However, for bitumen samples, as concentration of bitumen increased the deviation between theoretical and experimental results became larger. The higher deviation for high concentrations (i. e. above 30 %) can be due to the difference between dynamic contact angle and bulk contact angle. Microchannels are suitable experimental devices to study the flow of heavy oil and bitumen in porous structure such as those of reservoirs.

40|$|Based on {{the study}} of the {{molecular}} mass distribution in n-alkanes of bitumen of the Semilukskian horizon, the presence of migrational hydrocarbons was revealed in them with a different generation source. The results obtained {{on the basis of the}} molecular mass distribution are in good agreement with the group composition of bitumen, as well as with the results of gass <b>liquid</b> chromatography (<b>bitumen</b> and oil) and pyrolytic studies. The high convergence of the results obtained by different methods confirms the expediency of using the molecular mass distribution method for estimating the migration component in rocks of different productive horizons and in shale strata. The dominant process in the formation of initial organic matter of the Semilukskian horizon was the active bacterial environment, caused by anoxid conditions with hydrogen sulfide contamination of the sedimentation basin. The occurrence of anoxic environments with hydrogen sulphide contamination was most likely due to the periodic activation of volcanic activity and other endogenous processes that were regional in nature and took place on a significant area of the continental slope of the ancient platform. The existence of anoxidic environments in different parts of the sedimentation basin varied in intensity, duration, and periodicity of occurrence. The area of their distribution in the Sargaevskian-Mendymskian time was more regional in nature. Then, due to changes in the intensity of endogenous processes, it narrowed. The continued periodic occurrence of anoxidic events along deep faults led to the formation of intra-formation deflections of the Kama-Kinel system...|$|R

This layer uses open gradation (open graded), which is spread over a layer of impermeable asphalt. Dominated by a mixture of coarse aggregate, to obtain a sufficiently high pore in order to obtain high permeability of porous asphalt, where the permeability function for subsurface drain. In Indonesia the growing national needs can not be met asphalt bitumen production in the country, so that half of the amount is still to be imported. One alternative that can be considered to reduce the import of bitumen while improving performance is the use of liquid asphalt mix Asbuton. The problem is the porous asphalt can only be traversed by the traffic volume was due to the number of pores that exist in this type of pavement.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} all solid {{sedimentary}} fossil fuels, i. e. coal, the main one for geological reserves and resources, peat, and oil shales. Definitions of coal (< 50 % ash) and coal seam (thickness and depth limits) are examined {{in view of}} an international agreement regarding new concepts for a common reserves and resources evaluation using the same nomenclature. The 50 % ash limit, already adopted by UN-ECE for coal definition, allows {{the creation of a}} new category—the organic shales (50 – 75 % ash) —comprising energetic materials still valuable for thermal use (coal shales) or to be retorted for oil production (oil shales). Geological relations between coals, oil shales, solid <b>bitumen,</b> <b>liquid</b> hydrocarbons, natural gas, and coalbed methane are also examined together with environmental problems. As a final synthesis of all topics, the paper discusses the problems related with a modern geological classification of all solid sedimentary fuels based on: various rank parameters (moisture content, calorific value, reflectance), maceral composition, and mineral matter content (and washability). Finally, it should be pointed out that the paper is presented as series of problems, some of them old ones, but never resolved until now. In order to facilitate the next generation of coal geologists to resolve these problems on the basis of international agreements, all sections begin with documented introductions for further questions opening an international enquiry. The authors hope that the answers will be abundant enough and pertinent to permit synthetic international solutions, valuable for the new millennium, with the help of interested consulted authorities, international pertinent organisations, and regional experts.

40|$|Free mica {{particles}} in crushed rock aggregates for constructional purposes affect {{the quality of}} the end product. It is also known that mica-bearing rocks may cause damages of the road constructions, especially in regions with a temperate climate. The negative influence arises in both bounded and unbounded layers. The deterioration of the construction is related to the ability of mica particles to be released during crushing and to concentrate in the aggregate fine fractions. As the free mica particles absorb and hold <b>liquid</b> such as <b>bitumen</b> and water, the unbounded base course becomes susceptible to frost weathering and the mechanical properties of the asphalt mixture are negatively influenced. The water absorption ability is in turn caused by an increased specific surface area of the fine fraction depending on the grain shape of mica particles and their intra crystalline cavities. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate, emphasise, and contribute to an understanding of the performance of free mica {{particles in}} the fine fractions of crushed rock aggregates. The free mica problems are well- known, but sparsely taken into account in projecting and prospecting activities. The mineralogical composition (i. e. the quality) of the rock material is often a subordinated task in early stages in planning for roads and railways. Connected with establishment of quarries the estimation of rock materials quality is generally based on petrographic and mechanical analyses of drill-cores. The study presented consists of: * The investigation of the ability of free mica particles to enrich in fine fractions of granitoid crushed rock aggregates. The comparison study to examine a possible correlation between the content of mica in original rock materials, the content of free mica particles in rock aggregate products, and the content of free mica particles in drill cuttings. * The development of a method to estimate free mica particles in aggregate fine fractions using image analysis of grain mounts. * The development and practical applicability of a method to estimate rock aggregates quality using analyses of drill cuttings. The study reveals that mica-bearing rocks exposed to mechanical impact release free mica particles that concentrate in the fine fractions of crushed rock aggregates. The original grain size of mica in the host rock is suggested to influence on the process. Coarse-grained rocks seem to separate free mica grains in earlier phases of the crushing process than fine-grained ones. The enrichment is suggested to depend on the textural characteristics of the rock rather than on the mineralogical composition. These aspects must be taken into consideration when the grain size fractions for analyses of free mica content are selected. The statistical evaluation of the new method for estimation of free mica particles points out its certainty and repeatability. Due to the possibility to save the images of the statistical operation, the results of the method are controllable. These factors mentioned make the method satisfactory and statistically acceptable from a scientific point of view. The concept using drill cuttings for estimation of rock aggregates quality is practically tested and evaluated as an effective field method. The further development and calibration should focus on improvement of sampling concerning the content of coarse drill cuttings. The homogeneity/heterogeneity of the bedrock is crucial for the selection of the samples and stresses the necessity of representative sampling. Godkänd; 2008; 20080521 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|Solvent {{extraction}} technology (Vapor extraction/VAPEX) {{has drawn}} {{a lot of}} industry attention due to its potential to be an alternative to Steam assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) in heavy oil production. However the mass transfer mechanisms involved {{is yet to be}} fully comprehended. Reliable oil production rate data is scarce, hence the reluctance from oil companies to implement the technology on a field/commercial scale. More work is required at the experimental level to fully understand the intricacies of the technology and hence facilitate its commercialization. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the one-dimensional diffusivity of butane solvent in Athabasca bitumen at varying temperatures. Given diffusion is driven by concentration gradient, the diffusivity cannot be assumed constant throughout the whole diffusion process. Hence the diffusivity was found as a function of butane solvent concentration (mass fraction). Diffusivity functions for ideal mixing and non-ideal mixing were computed. Butane vapor temperature (24. 00 ⁰C and 34. 65 psi) is kept constant while the bitumen temperature is varied at 5 levels (27. 00 ⁰C, 30. 25 ⁰C, 33. 50 ⁰C, 36. 75 ⁰C and 40. 00 ⁰C). Assuming ideal mixing between hydrocarbons in VAPEX experiments is prevalent in the field. This is because finding a parameter in the solvent-bitumen mixing system that accounts for non-ideal mixing without upsetting the system is difficult. This work accounts for non-ideal mixing by constantly measuring the <b>bitumen</b> <b>liquid</b> hydrostatic pressure via pressure differential transmitters as diffusion occurs. With bitumen height change and amount of diffused butane solvent being monitored, the real density reduction (non-ideal density reduction) can be computed. Results showed that assuming ideal mixing over-estimates the density reduction. The deviation between ideal and non-ideal mixing density values increase as temperature increases. This is supported by most literature in the field. As temperature tends to standard temperature (25. 00 ⁰C), the effects of non-ideal mixing become insignificant. A MATLAB model is used to predict the ‘bitumen growth’ (bitumen swelling), this is compared to ‘bitumen growth’ observed experimentally. The difference between the two (experimental – predicted) is minimized by optimizing the diffusivity function coefficients. Results showed that the diffusion values (obtained via diffusivity functions) decreases as temperature increases. There was no ‘live oil’ drainage in this experiment so diffusion is governed by the butane solvent solubility in the bitumen. This butane solvent solubility decreases with increasing temperature. At equal mass fractions (ωs) all non-ideal mixing diffusivity functions yielded higher diffusion values than ideal mixing diffusivity functions. This is logical because diffusion is driven by concentration gradient. Ideal mixing scenarios over-estimate density reduction on mixing and hence provide a smaller concentration gradient compared to non-ideal mixing. The assumption of ideal mixing conditions clearly underestimates the real diffusivity values. The deviation between ideal and non-ideal diffusivity functions also increased as temperature increased. This follows the same trend as the deviation between ideal and non-ideal mixing density results. A macroscopic mass balance was used to independently validate the diffusivity functions. This mass balance predicted the change in solvent height after ‘bitumen growth’ had been resolved for the full experimental time. This is an independent validation because change in solvent height data was not used to obtain the diffusivity functions. All but one of the diffusivity functions (40. 00 ⁰C) was independently validated. Lack of validation in the 40. 00 ⁰C run was due to technical issues while running the experiment. For all validation data, the non-ideal diffusivity functions provided a better fit for the experimental data than the ideal diffusivity functions. Finally, the experimentally determined butane slope decrease, bitumen slope increase and non-ideal mixing coefficients for all varied temperature conditions were used as input values to make models in Design Expert (DE). These models were used to predict the aforementioned parameters at a random bitumen temperature (28. 50 ⁰C). An extra experiment was run at this temperature (28. 50 ⁰C) to compare the diffusivity functions coming from the experimental data to those from (DE) predictions. The DE originated diffusivities functions showed a good fit with the experimentally originated diffusivity functions. The model is therefore a robust model and can be used to predict diffusivity of butane at 24. 00 ⁰C, within a given bitumen temperature range of 27. 00 ⁰C - 40. 00 ⁰C, while also accounting for non-ideal mixing and concentration dependency...|$|R
