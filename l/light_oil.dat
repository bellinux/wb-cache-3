25|$|The {{same company}} also rebuilt a German 2-10-0 {{locomotive}} to new standards with modifications such as roller bearings, <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> firing and boiler insulation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{heavy oil}} discoveries {{came with the}} pursuit of {{conventional}} light and medium crude oil. Because much of western Canada's heavy oil is in pools close to the surface, early explorers using older rigs discovered many of those pools before they came upon the deeper <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs.|$|E

50|$|A thermo{{hydrometer}} is a hydrometer {{that has}} a thermometer enclosed in the float section. For measuring the density of petroleum products, such as fuel oils, the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature. <b>Light</b> <b>oils</b> are placed in cooling jackets, typically at 15 °C.Very <b>light</b> <b>oils</b> with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a floating piston sampling device to minimize light end losses.|$|R
25|$|Brazil is a net {{exporter}} of oil since 2011. However, the country still imports some <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> from the Middle East, because several refineries, {{built in the}} 1960s and 1970s under the military government, are not suited to process the heavy oil in Brazilian reserves, discovered decades later.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{turbines}} burn mainly {{natural gas}} and <b>light</b> <b>oil.</b> Crude oil, residual, and some distillates contain corrosive components and as such require fuel treatment equipment. In addition, ash deposits from these fuels result in gas turbine deratings of up to 15%. They may still be economically attractive fuels however, particularly in combined-cycle plants.|$|E
25|$|That {{changed in}} 1947, when Imperial Oil {{discovered}} <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> {{just south of}} Edmonton. Imperial's success was inspired by their much earlier discovery at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories. The link was that {{there appeared to be}} Devonian reefs in Alberta. At the Norman Wells discovery, Imperial had located just such a reservoir in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, on October 6, the Yom Kippur War {{broke out}} – a nail-biting affair between Israel and the Arab states. OPEC used the {{conflict}} {{to double the}} posted price for a barrel of Saudi Arabian <b>light</b> <b>oil,</b> to US$5.14. Saudi and the other Arab states then imposed embargoes on countries supporting Israel, and oil prices rose quickly to $12.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to grasp the immensity of Canada's oil sands and heavy oil resource. Fields in northern Alberta include four major deposits which underlie almost 70,000 square kilometres of land. The volume of bitumen in those sands dwarfs the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> reserves of the entire Middle East. One of those deposits, the Athabasca oil sands, is the world's largest known crude oil resource.|$|E
25|$|China's onshore oil {{resources}} are mostly {{located in the}} Northeast and in Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Oil shale is found {{in a number of}} places, especially at Fushun in Liaoning, where the deposits overlie the coal reserves, as well as in Guangdong. High quality <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> has been found in the Pearl River estuary of the South China Sea, the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai, and the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang. The country consumes most of its oil output but does export some crude oil and oil products. China has explored and developed oil deposits in the South China Sea and East China Sea, the Yellow Sea, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the Bohai Sea.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{concerns}} with heavy oils {{are similar to}} those with <b>lighter</b> <b>oils.</b> However, they provide additional concerns, such as the need to heat heavy oils to pump them out of the ground. Extraction also requires large volumes of water.|$|R
25|$|The {{proportion}} of light hydrocarbons in the petroleum mixture varies greatly among different oil fields, ranging from {{as much as}} 97 percent by weight in the <b>lighter</b> <b>oils</b> to as little as 50 percent in the heavier oils and bitumens.|$|R
50|$|The company claims its {{reserves}} {{to have a}} lifetime of 11.8 years at the current production rate, although it actively seeks to acquire new properties. In 2007, 65% of its production was natural gas, and 35% <b>light</b> <b>oils</b> and NGLs.|$|R
25|$|The {{oil sands}} of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) were {{formed as a}} result of the {{formation}} of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting over the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now compose most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies over the plains, forming the Canadian Rockies. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta very deep, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil.|$|E
25|$|The ensuing {{explosion}} and firestorm burned down 40 {{buildings in the}} town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings {{may need to be}} demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but Bakken formation light crude oil being imported into Canada from North Dakota to the Irving Oil Refinery in New Brunswick. Although near a huge oil import port on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America is too expensive to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability.|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} case of scrotal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma in a cotton worker in the Manchester Hospital records in 1887, shale oil {{had been used in}} the mills for 35 years. A heavier oil was used once a day on the carriage and wheels but a <b>lighter</b> <b>oil</b> was applied three to four times to the spindles. The heavier oil may come into contact with the minders’ hands, but it was the <b>lighter</b> <b>oil</b> that was sprayed from the spindles and saturated the spinners’ light cotton trousers {{at the level of the}} pubis and groins above the scrotum. Piecers would remove any heavy oil from their hands by wiping them on the trousers.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its high}} viscosity, motor oil {{is not always}} the {{preferred}} oil for certain applications. Some applications make use of lighter products such as WD-40, when a <b>lighter</b> <b>oil</b> is desired, or honing oil if the desired viscosity needs to be mid-range.|$|R
5000|$|Atwood {{then decided}} to distill and refine [...] "Canada pitch" [...] which was {{obtained}} from petroleum overflows around Petrolia, Ontario in Canada. He refined the <b>oil</b> to obtain <b>light</b> and heavy <b>oils.</b> He refined the <b>light</b> <b>oils</b> to a water-white burning oil. The heavy oils he refined to a quality grade of paraffine lubricating oil. From the paraffine oil he obtained a solid white paraffine, which melted at about 130 F.|$|R
2500|$|While {{working with}} Pratt, Rogers invented an {{improved}} way of separating naphtha, a <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> similar to kerosene, from crude oil. He was granted [...] on October 31, 1871.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{up on the}} {{positive}} results of the A-52 well, Shell drilled a discovery well at Panuke, [...] southwest of Cohasset. The Shell Panuke B-90 wildcat encountered a relatively thin zone that tested <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> {{at a rate of}} 1,000 m³ (8,648 barrels) per day. The following year, Petro-Canada drilled the F-99 delineation well at Panuke. That well tested oil at 8,000 m³ (69,188 barrels) a day for six days.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Brazil had [...] {{the second-largest}} proven oil {{reserves}} in South America after Venezuela. The {{vast majority of}} proven reserves are located at Campos and Santos offshore basins on the southeast coast of Brazil. [...] In November 2007, Petrobras announced that it believes the offshore Tupi oil field has between 5 and [...] of recoverable <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> and neighbouring fields may even contain more, which all in all could result in Brazil {{becoming one of the}} largest producers of oil in the world.|$|E
50|$|Heavy oils, oil sands, bitumen and biodegraded oils (as {{bacteria}} cannot assimilate asphaltenes, but readily consume {{saturated hydrocarbons}} and certain aromatic hydrocarbon isomers - enzymatically controlled) contain much higher proportions of asphaltenes than do medium-API <b>oils</b> or <b>light</b> <b>oils.</b> Condensates are virtually devoid of asphaltenes.|$|R
50|$|During a make run, steam {{would be}} {{passed through the}} {{generator}} to make blue water gas. From the generator the hot water gas would pass {{into the top of}} the carburetor where <b>light</b> petroleum <b>oils</b> would be injected into the gas stream. The <b>light</b> <b>oils</b> would be thermocracked as they came in contact with the white hot checkerwork fire bricks inside the carburettor. The hot enriched gas would then flow into the superheater, where the gas would be further cracked by more hot fire bricks.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the process}} of coal-tar distillation, the {{distillate}} is collected into four fractions; the [...] "light oil", which remains lighter than water, the [...] "middle oil" [...] which passes over when the <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> is removed; the [...] "heavy oil", which sinks; and the [...] "anthracene oil", which when cold is mostly solid and greasy, of a buttery consistence. Creosote refers to the portion of coal tar which distills as [...] "heavy oil", typically between 230270°C, also called [...] "dead oil"; it sinks into water but still is fairly liquid. Carbolic acid is produced in the second fraction of distillation and is often distilled into what {{is referred to as}} [...] "carbolic oil".|$|E
2500|$|The Eastern Venezuelan Basin has a {{structure}} {{similar to the}} WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the Orinoco oil sands where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the Guyana Shield is only about [...] The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, source rocks buried deep {{by the rise of}} the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced <b>light</b> <b>oil</b> that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early Tertiary (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1882, Atlas {{was moved}} to nearby Deptford Creek. In February 1885, {{a meeting of the}} Metropolitan Asylums Board was {{informed}} that the Admiralty had stated that it the board wished to continue using Atlas and Endymion, they would have to purchase them at a cost of £8,400 and £6,500 respectively. The board replied that they would purchase the ships, but asked for the cost to be reduced. [...] In June, it was reported that the board were authorised to purchase both ships. [...] Following a fire on the training ship [...] in 1875, engines and a generator were installed on board Atlas in 1886 to provide the ship with electric <b>light.</b> <b>Oil</b> lamps being deemed a fire hazard. Atlas served as a hospital ship until 1904, when the new Joyce Green Hospital opened at Dartford, Kent. Atlas [...] was sold by auction in December, along with Endymion and Castaliâ for a total of £8,045. Atlas realised £3,725.|$|E
