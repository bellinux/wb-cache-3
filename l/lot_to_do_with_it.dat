[...] The song became an unexpected US hit for the band, reaching number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, which Chris Difford attributed to the video for the song {{as much as the}} song itself: [...] "I would think that the video has had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It’s been played a lot, and everybody you speak to compliments you on it.

When asked in 2009 if he invented the blast beat, Benante replied, [...] "If you mean that I decided to sit in my room and invent it, no it wasn’t like that. The thing was something that had been around the NY hardcore scene for ages but hadn’t been used for other things.

[...] Lions head coach and general manager Wally Buono later confirmed that Foley had changed his mind and {{signed with the}} Argonauts instead of the Lions. [...] "He's done an about face.

5000|$|Almost a {{year after}} Soundgarden's break-up, in summer 1998, Cameron was invited by rock-colleagues Pearl Jam to drum on its U.S. Yield Tour after the band's drummer Jack Irons left due to the touring {{scheduling}} conflicting with his health issues {{and a desire to}} spend more time with his family. Cameron had worked with members of the band before on the Temple of the Dog project and had helped them record some early instrumental demos in 1990. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly (Curtis, Pearl Jam's manager). I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "We knew him from being around the same scene and seeing him on tour. It had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> We knew he was a normal cat too, a normal guy." [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. He was hired on an initially temporary basis, but soon, during the tour, he was invited to become a full-time member. Cameron stated, [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a little bit different, I think, than what they were used to. And they've been through so many different drummers, I don't even know if they knew what they wanted. So, I just kind of played the way I played and then eventually we kind of figured out what worked best for the band." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Last Resort" [...] {{is about}} suicide. In an {{interview}} with Songfacts, Papa Roach member Tobin Esperance spoke about the song and its lyrics, saying: [...] "I think the lyrics had a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Because originally the song was about a friend of ours that we grew up with, {{and he was going}} through a rough time in his life. And there was that suicide element to it, just like growing up and the struggles of life and questioning whether or not you want to keep going on, and I {{think a lot of people}} connected with that. For the kids who had also gone through those kinds of feelings, those kinds of emotions, the lyrics really helped connect with that song." [...] Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix described the song as a [...] "cry for help". He also said [...] "That song was about one of my best friends, and then 12-13 years later, that song was about me. I found myself in that place, where I was like, [...] "I can't go on this way. I can't do it anymore."" [...] Shaddix said that [...] "Last Resort" [...] is about a roommate he had who tried to commit suicide. Shaddix then said: [...] "We caught him and took him to the hospital and he went into a mental facility and then he came out the other side better. He actually found God through the process, which was kind of crazy. So he's on a whole different path of his life now, which is cool. I'm really proud of him for the changes he's made in his life." ...|$|E
5000|$|The album's sound {{had a lot}} to do {{with the}} environment, {{according}} to its author: [...] What I like is when sound textures interweave and some come in and out like waves. But I am not going to go ‘ocean’ because that doesn’t suit my whole Wisconsin perspective. I usually record in the winter because I am holed up. It's cold outside but warm inside with the heater and blankets. A lot of the songs are cold but in the coldness you find warmth. Winter has a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Being from the Midwest, you experience a lot of harsh climat. Living in the country, there are a lot of harsh realities that teach you how to deal with things. Some argued that the inclusion of the two earlier singles' material illustrated the development of the Zola Jesus sound. [...] "The earlier singles are dirtier, sexier, more intense... Her voice, really, is the soul and core of the music," [...] and on The Spoils she used [...] "more reverb and single vocal tracks. I've never observed the loss of warmth and charm when switching to digital recording from analogue more apparently than here," [...] remarked a Brainwashed reviewer. [...] "I love weird power electronics and industrial music, but then I also really love intensely powerful melodic songs. Something like a Ronettes song hits you in such a different way than noise stuff. For me, the ideal is bringing both the experimental and the pop music in," [...] Zola Jesus commented, noting that percussion played an important role in the album's structure too. [...] "I will always have intense beats and have an epic sound structure," [...] the singer said, speaking toLA Record.|$|E
