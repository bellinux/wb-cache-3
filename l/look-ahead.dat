5|$|More recent {{research}} has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and <b>look-ahead</b> search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much {{recent research}}. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example, Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere {{are more likely to have}} been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.|$|E
25|$|The <b>look-ahead</b> {{function}} {{is designed to}} overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. <b>Look-ahead</b> is a misnomer in that the future is not actually observed. Instead, the input signal is split, and one side is delayed. The non-delayed signal is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower attack rate {{can be used to}} catch transients. The cost of this solution is that the signal is delayed.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Donald Knuth {{invented the}} LR parser (Left to Right, Rightmost derivation). The LR parser can {{recognize}} any deterministic context-free language in linear-bounded time. Rightmost derivation has very large memory requirements and implementing an LR parser was impractical {{due to the}} limited memory of computers at that time. To address this shortcoming, in 1969, Frank DeRemer proposed two simplified versions of the LR parser, namely the <b>Look-Ahead</b> LR (LALR) and the Simple LR parser that had much lower memory requirements {{at the cost of}} less language-recognition power, with the LALR parser being the most-powerful alternative. In 1977, memory optimizations for the LR parser were invented but still the LR parser was less memory-efficient than the simplified alternatives.|$|E
25|$|While the single-tasking DOS had {{provisions}} for multi-sector reads and track blocking/deblocking, {{the operating system}} and the traditional PC hard disk architecture (only one outstanding input/output request {{at a time and}} no DMA transfers) originally did not contain mechanisms which could alleviate fragmentation by asynchronously prefetching next data while the application was processing the previous chunks. Such features became available later. Later DOS versions also provided built-in support for <b>look-ahead</b> sector buffering and came with dynamically loadable disk caching programs working on physical or logical sector level, often utilizing EMS or XMS memory and sometimes providing adaptive caching strategies or even run in protected mode through DPMS or Cloaking to increase performance by gaining direct access to the cached data in linear memory rather than through conventional DOS APIs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{computer}} science, an LALR parser or <b>Look-Ahead</b> LR parser is {{a simplified}} {{version of a}} canonical LR parser, to parse (separate and analyze) a text according {{to a set of}} production rules specified by a formal grammar for a computer language.

2500|$|In {{computer}} circuitry, {{this method}} is no faster than the [...] "complement and add one" [...] method; both methods require working sequentially from right to left, propagating logic changes. The method of complementing and adding one can be sped up by a standard carry <b>look-ahead</b> adder circuit; the LSB towards MSB method can be sped up by a similar logic transformation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} making music {{releases}} [...] "hotter" [...] began {{to appeal to}} people within the industry, {{in part because of}} how noticeably louder some releases had become and also in part because the industry believed that customers preferred louder sounding CDs, even though that may not have been true. Engineers, musicians, and labels each developed their own ideas of how CDs could be made louder. In 1994, the digital brickwall limiter with <b>look-ahead</b> (to pull down peak levels before they happened) was first mass-produced. While the increase in CD loudness was gradual throughout the 1990s, some opted to push the format to the limit, such as on Oasis's widely popular album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, which averaged −8dBFS on many of its tracks—a rare occurrence, especially in the year it was released (1995).|$|E
5000|$|Algorithmic {{delay is}} 20 ms per frame. For bit-rates of 12.2, {{there is no}} [...] "algorithm" [...] <b>look-ahead</b> delay. For other rates, <b>look-ahead</b> delay is 5 ms. Note that there is 5 ms [...] "dummy" [...] <b>look-ahead</b> delay, to allow {{seamless}} frame-wise mode switching {{with the rest of}} rates.|$|E
50|$|A carry <b>look-ahead</b> adder {{can reduce}} the delay. In {{principle}} the delay can be reduced {{so that it is}} proportional to logn, but for large numbers this is no longer the case, because even when carry <b>look-ahead</b> is implemented, the distances that signals have to travel on the chip increase in proportion to n, and propagation delays increase at the same rate. Once we get to the 512-bit to 2048-bit number sizes that are required in public-key cryptography, carry <b>look-ahead</b> is not of much help.|$|E

Carry propagation can be speeded up with carry <b>look-ahead</b> logic, but this still makes addition very much slower than it needs to be (for 512-bit addition, addition with carry <b>look-ahead</b> is 32 times slower than addition without carries at all).|$|E
