5|$|Angkor Wat is {{the prime}} example of the {{classical}} style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. By the 12th century Khmer architects had become skilled and confident {{in the use of}} sandstone (rather than brick or <b>laterite)</b> as the main building material. Most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks, while <b>laterite</b> was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts. The binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified, although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa mainly occurs {{from west}} of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. It grows in shallow sand over <b>laterite,</b> in deep sand, and {{occasionally}} atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges.|$|E
5|$|B.violacea {{occurs in}} {{southern}} regions of Western Australia, from Woodanilling to Esperance {{and as far}} north as Hyden. This distribution includes areas of the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. It favours white sandy soils, often overlying <b>laterite,</b> clay or quartzite. It usually grows among heath and shrublands, associated with mallee eucalypts and Banksia sphaerocarpa var. caesia. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the 1950 Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia.|$|E
30|$|Magnetic susceptibilities of the <b>laterites</b> {{distributed}} {{around the}} Srayang village ranged from 1.3 to 3.1 [*]×[*] 10 - 3 SI units, covering the same range as <b>laterites</b> from the Koh Ker monuments.|$|R
25|$|The mineralogical and {{chemical}} compositions of <b>laterites</b> {{are dependent on}} their parent rocks. <b>Laterites</b> consist mainly of quartz, zircon, and oxides of titanium, iron, tin, aluminium and manganese, which remain {{during the course of}} weathering. Quartz is the most abundant relic mineral from the parent rock.|$|R
40|$|Iron-rich aluminosilicates with disordered {{structure}} (<b>laterites)</b> {{due to the}} corrosion of kaolinite by iron minerals {{were investigated}} as solid precursors for geopolymerization. The particle size distribution, B. E. T surface area, thermal activation, and chemical and mineralogical compositions were {{used to evaluate the}} reactivity of iron-rich <b>laterites</b> (35  wt. % of Fe 2 O 3 -FeO). The raw materials in the temperature range between 25 and 500  °C showed geopolymerization behaviour similar to that of metakaolin. At temperatures higher than 500  °C, the coarsening of particles and the decrease of B. E. T surface area correspond to an initial sintering of <b>laterites</b> explaining the poor polycondensation/geopolymerization and the decrease of strength of the final products. The increase of the temperature of calcination of raw <b>laterites</b> between 25 and 500  °C corresponds to a reduction of the setting time of geopolymer products. However, this variation of temperature did not significantly affect the flexural strength that remained between ~  4 and ~  6  MPa, confirming the possibility to produce sustainable matrices, with more energy saving, using highly corroded <b>laterites...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{eastern area}} of Birbhum {{is a part}} of the rice plains of West Bengal, and the {{vegetation}} includes usual characteristics of rice fields in Bengal, such as species of Aponogeton, Utricularia, Drosera, Philcoxia, Scrophulariaceae and similar aquatic or palustrine genera. In the drier western region of the district, the characteristic shrubs and herbs include species of Wendlandia, Convolvulaceae, Stipa, Tragus, Spermacoce, Ziziphus, Capparis and similar plants that grows on <b>laterite</b> soil. Mango, palm, and bamboo are among common trees in Birbhum. Other common species of plants are jackfruit, arjun, sal, guava, kend and mahua.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{is located}} in the {{south-west}} corner of the inner enclosure of the Jagannath temple complex and on the right hand western corner of the tower of Jagannath, next to the sacred pond Rohini kunda. The temple faces east and is built of sandstone and <b>laterite.</b> It is built in the Deula style that has four components namely, vimana (structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana (assembly hall), nata-mandapa (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings). The temple is maintained and was renovated around 2005 by the Archaeological Survey of India, Bhubaneswar Circle.|$|E
5|$|The species tolerates a {{range of}} soils, {{requiring}} only that its soil be well-drained. Like most dryandras, it grows well in lateritic soils and gravels, although this species {{is also found in}} deep sand, sand over <b>laterite,</b> and sand over limestone. It also occurs in {{a range of}} vegetation complexes, including coastal and kwongan heath, tall shrubland, woodland and open forest. It is a common understorey plant in drier areas of Jarrah forest, and forms thickets on limestone soils of the Swan Coastal Plain. Banksia sessilis sets a large amount of seed and is an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open areas; for example, it has been recorded colonising gravel pits in the Darling Scarp.|$|E

40|$|<b>Laterites</b> are regoliths {{developed}} under tropical to subtropical {{conditions and}} are host to key deposit types, notably bauxites (major sources of Al, derived from weathering of aluminosilicate rocks) and Ni-Co <b>laterites</b> (derived from ultramafic rocks). Research {{on the western}} Tethys region, where bauxites and Ni-Co <b>laterites</b> developed during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, probably peaking at the Paleogene-Eocene thermal maximum when geology, paleogeography, and climate were ideal for the deep weathering of favorable lithologies, is reported in this article. Bauxites were developed on the rocks forming the continental margins to the various branches of the Tethys Ocean and were already forming in the Triassic, whereas the Ni-Co <b>laterites</b> developed on fragments of obducted ophiolite from the Tethys Ocean, which were only uplifted and exposed to weathering after the Jurassic. Residual lateritic bauxites are known in the region but karst bauxites are much more common. Ni-Co <b>laterites</b> are found as residual profiles, ranging from oxide, to clay-silicate, to hydrous-silicate types, but are also represented by distinctive, extensively redeposited clay-oxide ores. This diversity of styles probably reflects differences in topography and uplift history because the deposits all formed within a similar, restricted climatic time window. The bauxite belt extends from Spain in the west, through the type locality of Les Baux in France, and intermittently through the Balkans, Greece, and Turkey to Iran and beyond. Bauxite resources in Europe constitute around 2...|$|R
5|$|The {{two major}} rivers {{draining}} Tiruchirappalli are the Kaveri and its tributary the Kollidam, {{but the city}} is also drained by the Uyyakondan Channel, Koraiyar and Kudamuritti river channels. The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and maize are cultivated. Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil. A belt of Cretaceous rock known as the Trichinopoly Group runs to the north-east of the city, and to the south-east there are layers of archaean rocks, granite and gneiss covered by a thin bed of conglomeratic <b>laterite.</b> The region falls under Seismic Zone III, which is moderately vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|In December 1895, {{two months}} after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular {{resistance}} to French rule emerged {{in the form of the}} menalamba ("red shawl") rebellion. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity and political corruption quickly spread throughout the island and was principally conducted by peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red <b>laterite</b> soil of the highlands. The resistance movement gained ground until it was effectively put down by the French military at the end of 1897. Members of Ranavalona's court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen's uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her minister of war, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen's aunt, was exiled to Réunion, as the French were reluctant to execute a woman.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka {{consists}} of four main types of geological formations— the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses, the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. Significantly, about 60% {{of the state is}} composed of the Archean complex which consist of gneisses, granites and charnockite rocks. <b>Laterite</b> cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Spodosols, Alfisols, Ultisols, Oxisols, Aridisols, Vertisols, Andisols and Histosols. Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic, black, alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils.|$|E
50|$|In {{the northwestern}} part i.e. Tirathgarh, Kamanar, Kotamsar there is outcrop of limestone, sandstone, {{quartzite}} and <b>laterites.</b> In northern middle part form Nagalsar to Radhanaras at many places limestone is well exposed and outcrops of quartzite and <b>laterites.</b> limestone caves of Kotamsar, Dandak, Devgiri, and Kailash {{are present in}} this part. In the northeastern part from Pulcha to Kolab River, rock is shale and some quartzite with outcrops of granite.|$|R
25|$|<b>Laterites</b> vary {{significantly}} {{according to their}} location, climate and depth. The main host minerals for nickel and cobalt can be either iron oxides, clay minerals or manganese oxides. Iron oxides are derived from mafic igneous rocks and other iron-rich rocks; bauxites are derived from granitic igneous rock and other iron-poor rocks. Nickel <b>laterites</b> occur in zones of the earth which experienced prolonged tropical weathering of ultramafic rocks containing the ferro-magnesian minerals olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole.|$|R

5|$|The German missionary Plebot set up {{the first}} tile factory at Mangalore in 1860. It was called the Basel Mission tile factory. Mangalorean Catholics learnt the {{technique}} of preparing Mangalore tiles. The Albuquerque tile factory, the first Indian Mangalore tile factory, was started in South Canara by Pascal Albuquerque at Panemangalore in 1868. Since then, Mangalorean Catholics have been actively involved in manufacturing the tiles. The Alvares tile factory was established in Mangalore by Simon Alvares, a Mangalorean Catholic from Bombay, in 1878. In 1991–1992, out of twelve Mangalore tile manufacturing factories in Mangalore, six were owned by Christians. These tiles, prepared from hard clay, were in great demand throughout India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, and were even shipped to East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India, and still define Mangalore's skyline and characterise its urban setting. Urban and rural housing follows the traditional variety of <b>laterite</b> brick structures with Mangalore tile roofing on steeply sloped roofs. Inside the house, a spacious hall is present while a large verandah is present {{in front of the}} house. The traditional houses tend to have spacious porticos, red cement or terracotta floors, and have fruit trees outside the house. The old Catholic houses of South Canara bear traces of Portuguese influence. The tall windows, pointed roofs, and verandahs are some of the Portuguese influenced architectural features of the century-old houses.|$|E
5|$|On 19 February, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} by helicopter, taking over from 2nd Battalion, US 38th Infantry Regiment. Preece immediately instituted {{a program of}} twenty-four-hour dispersed patrolling, and within two days this had succeeded in reducing the level of Viet Cong activity against the road construction. Two platoons of American M48 Patton tanks were also moved into the area, patrolling by day with the Australian armoured personnel carriers, while securing the <b>laterite</b> pit at night. Several contacts took place and by 22 February the Australians began to suspect that a major attack on them was being planned, noting that they were now facing Main Force elements. In the early morning of 23 February three Viet Cong soldiers were killed in an Australian ambush, while several others were wounded but escaped. The dead soldiers were well equipped with new AK-47 assault rifles and webbing, and they were identified as being from 761st Main Force Regiment. Also captured was a large quantity of ammunition, rations and medical supplies. Later that night a North Vietnamese engineer officer was also killed in a separate ambush, adding further weight to the Australian suspicions. As dawn broke the next day, two half-platoon ambushes from B Company, 1 RAR—under the command of Major Ian McFarlane—engaged two squads of Viet Cong Main Force. Preece immediately warned Glotzbach of an imminent attack, and then informed Sargent that the Australians were moving {{to set up a}} defensive position, recommending that the engineers relocate in order to join them.|$|E
25|$|Historically, <b>laterite</b> was {{cut into}} brick-like shapes {{and used in}} monument-building. After 1000 CE, {{construction}} at Angkor Wat and other southeast Asian sites changed to rectangular temple enclosures made of <b>laterite,</b> brick and stone. Since the mid-1970s, some trial sections of bituminous-surfaced, low-volume roads have used <b>laterite</b> in place of stone as a base course. Thick <b>laterite</b> layers are porous and slightly permeable, so the layers can function as aquifers in rural areas.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 361 - 383 <b>Laterites</b> above ultramafic {{complexes}} in Brazil and the Philippines {{consist of}} in-situ (autochthonous) and partly transported (semi-autochthonous) horizons. Enrichment {{and distribution of}} minor and trace elements in the <b>laterites</b> are controlled by weathering processes and the morphology of the peridotite massifs. Mn and Co migrate towards the base of doline-like depressions of the peridotite karst where they precipitate in the ferruginous horizon above the saprolite, due to rising pH and concentration of the solution. Mass balance calculations reveal absolute enrichment of Mn and Co and depletion of Zn and Cr. Semi-autochthonous <b>laterites</b> represent a mixture of Fe-Cr-rich limonitic material derived from ultramafic rocks and Al-Si-Ti-Zr-rich kaolinitic material derived from sialic rocks. They may reveal unusually high contents of Al 2 O 3, SiO 2, TiO 2 and Zr, thus camouflaging the underlying ultramafic bedrock. During and after deposition of semi-autochthonous <b>laterites,</b> acidic leaching under humid (sub-) tropical climate leads to the mobilization of rees from the weathering products of sialic rocks. Subsequent migration and precipitation of rees together with Mn {{at the base of}} depressions result in concentrations of predominantly Ce which under favourable conditions exceed 0. 5 wt. %. High proportions of sialic weathering material in <b>laterites</b> can be expected in geological settings where ultramafic and sialic rocks occur in close spatial association. Enrichment of rees in weathering profiles above ultramafics is favoured by the abundance of weathering material from ree-rich alkaline rocks like those of the Alkaline Complex of Jacupiranga, Brazil...|$|R
25|$|Francis Buchanan-Hamilton first {{described}} and named a <b>laterite</b> formation in southern India in 1807.

25|$|In Northern Ireland, {{phosphorus}} enrichment {{of lakes}} due to agriculture {{is a significant}} problem. Locally available laterite—a low-grade bauxite rich in iron and aluminium—is used in acid solution, followed by precipitation to remove phosphorus and heavy metals at several sewage treatment facilities. Calcium-, iron- and aluminium-rich solid media are recommended for phosphorus removal. A study, using both laboratory tests and pilot-scale constructed wetlands, reports the effectiveness of granular <b>laterite</b> in removing phosphorus and heavy metals from landfill leachate. Initial laboratory studies show that <b>laterite</b> is capable of 99% removal of phosphorus from solution. A pilot-scale experimental facility containing <b>laterite</b> achieved 96% removal of phosphorus. This removal is greater than reported in other systems. Initial removals of aluminium and iron by pilot-scale facilities have been up to 85% and 98% respectively. Percolating columns of <b>laterite</b> removed enough cadmium, chromium and lead to undetectable concentrations. There is a possible application of this low-cost, low-technology, visually unobtrusive, efficient system for rural areas with dispersed point sources of pollution.|$|E
