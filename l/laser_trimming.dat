40|$|Electronic devices {{with high}} {{performance}} are becoming smaller and lighter. The passive components required to enable high performance consume premium {{space on the}} surface of the printed circuit board. Integrating the resistor function into the laminate substrate frees up the PCB surface area consumed by the discrete component, enabling increased device functionality by the placement of more active components. When the typical 5 to 20 % tolerance of embedded resistors can be allowed, the resistors satisfy the device requirements. The resistive materials and the PCB fabrication processes used to fabricate the resistors are currently not able to achieve precision of 1 % or less. <b>Laser</b> <b>trim</b> technology achieves < 1 % tolerance on thin film embedded resistor panels.

50|$|Thick film {{technology}} {{is often used}} as the interconnecting medium for hybrid integrated circuits. The use of screen printed thick film interconnect provides advantages of versatility over thin film although feature sizes may be larger and deposited resistors wider in tolerance. Multi-layer thick film is a technique for further improvements in integration using a screen printed insulating dielectric to ensure connections between layers are made only where required. One key advantage for the circuit designer is complete freedom {{in the choice of}} resistor value in thick film technology. Planar resistors are also screen printed and included in the thick film interconnect design. The composition and dimensions of resistors can be selected to provide desired values.

40|$|Homoepitaxial {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) of diamond requires {{high quality}} substrate crystals. This paper describes the process of diamond substrate crystal recovery so that the original substrate can be reused for multiple synthesis processes. A three-stage treatment is applied after homoepitaxial CVD growth. First the original substrate is separated by laser cutting, then the cut surface is mechanically polished, and finally polycrystalline material {{at the edges of}} the recovered seed plate is <b>laser</b> <b>trimmed.</b> This recovery process yields reusable diamond substrates that do not differ appreciably from their original state in terms of stresses and impurity concentrations. While the recovery process was demonstrated using HPHT seed substrates the process can also be applied to the as-grown CVD diamond plates. Infrared absorption spectral analysis, surface profilometry, birefringence imaging and Raman spectroscopy are performed after each processing step to monitor crystal quality. The nitrogen concentration in the substrate crystal remains constant throughout CVD and recovery processes. When using HPHT type Ib substrates the detected nitrogen concentration is 110 - 180 ppm. The nitrogen is mainly incorporated in form of C center defects and no transformation to other forms of defect centers occurs during the CVD process. Birefringence imaging showed a low level of internal stress within the HPHT crystals. No change is observed during CVD growth and recovery processes. It is shown that the polycrystalline rim removal is essential for repeatable CVD deposition on the same seed substrate. Substrate crystal recovery allows growth of up to 20 crystals from one original seed...|$|R
