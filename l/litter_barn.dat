40|$|A 2 -year {{study was}} carried out {{to examine the effects}} of solid cattle manure storage method on (1) total carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) losses, (2) first-year and residual manure dry matter (DM) and N disappearance after litterbag placement on grassland, and (3) apparent herbage N recovery (ANR) after a single surface application to a sandy grassland field. About twelve tonnes of fresh (FRE) manure taken from a <b>litter</b> <b>barn</b> were stored per treatment as stockpiled (STO), composted (COM) and covered (COV) heaps for 130 days, and total C and N losses were estimated. Thereafter, patterns of DM and N disappearance from FRE, COM and COV manures were monitored using litterbags with three mesh sizes (45 µm, 1 mm and 4 mm). Herbage ANR from these manures was measured at application rates of 200, 400 and 600 kg N ha- 1. During the storage period, only about 10 % of the initial Ntotal was lost from the COV heap, whereas these losses were 31 % from the STO heap and 46 % from the COM heap. The respective Ctotal losses were 17, 59 and 67 %. After field placement, overall manure DM and N disappearance rates from all mesh sizes of the litterbags were in the order: COV > FRE > COM (P < 0. 05). Independent of N application rate, total herbage ANR was the highest from COV and the lowest from COM manure over two growing seasons (23 vs. 14 %; P < 0. 05). Including the N losses during storage, an almost three times higher herbage ANR (20 vs. 7 %) of the manure N taken from the barn was observed by using COV versus COM manure. In case of FRE manure this ANR fraction was 17 %. It is concluded that COV storage reduced storage C and N losses to a minimum. After field application, manure stored under this method decomposed faster and more N was available for plant uptake, especially when compared to COM manure...|$|E
40|$|Poultry {{producers}} in the United States have attempted to maintain barn aerial ammonia (NH 3) levels below 25 ppm to improve air quality, and more recently to decrease aerial emissions to the atmosphere. Our objective {{was to investigate the}} influence of litter management strategies on NH 3 emissions from commercial broiler barns employing new bedding, acid-treated built-up litter (sodium bisulphate), or untreated built-up litter (normal practice). Nearly 400 barn-days of NH 3 emissions data were collected from 12 broiler barns on four farms monitored in 48 -hour episodes over one year. On each study farm, the barns were paired for repetition of conditions. Emission was calculated as the product of gas concentration of the exhaust air and barn ventilation rate. Use of new bedding for every flock led to consistently lower NH 3 emission (averaging 0. 35 g NH 3 /(bird d)) at day 21 of the 42 -day flock grow-outs, followed by flocks raised on the annual cleanout with new bedding (0. 52 g NH 3 /(bird d)). Built-up litter without any treatment had the highest emission (0. 73 g NH 3 /(bird d)), followed by the built-up litter with acid treatment (0. 63 g NH 3 /(bird d)). One study site was managed with two <b>barns</b> using <b>litter</b> treatment and two identical barns with untreated, built-up litter for a side-by-side comparison of results under field conditions. Ammonia emissions from treated built-up <b>litter</b> <b>barns</b> were similar to those from untreated built-up <b>litter</b> <b>barns,</b> however, the temporal pattern of emissions provided evidence that ammonia held in the acid-treated litter {{at the beginning of the}} flock was released during the latter period of the flock cycle...|$|R
40|$|Composting is {{becoming}} a popular way to handle livestock mortalities. The co-compost material, {{sometimes referred to as}} carbon source or bulking agent, is used to cover the mortalities and provide a microenvironment for bacteria. The co-compost material should be readily available, inexpensive, and free of pesticide residues. Some commonly used co-compost materials are turkey brooder litter, poultry <b>litter,</b> hoop <b>barn</b> manure, corn stalks, ground corncobs, wood shavings, and wood chips. Use of a compost thermometer is helpful {{to be sure that the}} process is occurring properly. Temperatures in the 110 to 150 o F range indicate decay that will be fast and odor free whereas cold temperatures indicate problems...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} for development of diarrhea in litters of preweaned piglets, data were analyzed from records of 4, 397 litters of swine farrowed on a central California ranch 1978 - 1982. Sixty-four percent of litters were treated for diarrhea. Statistical analysis by multiple logistic regression showed that litters born to young sows (parity {{less than or equal}} to 2) were 1. 7 times more likely to develop diarrhea before weaning than were litters born to older sows (parity greater than or equal to 3) and that litters born on one end of farrowing barns were 1. 3 times more likely to develop diarrhea than were litters born in the other end. The association of diarrhea with other variables [...] dam breed, sire, gestation group, gestation length, size of litter, number of mummies, runts or stillbirths per <b>litter,</b> farrowing <b>barn</b> of birth or day of the week farrowed [...] was weak or nonexistent (P greater than 0. 01) ...|$|R
50|$|Instead of feed uses, corn stover {{can also}} be {{collected}} for use as bedding or litter for the livestock (that is, cellulosic bulk to catch and contain the animal manure), {{or it can be}} a vegetable manure that stays in the field as plant litter (serving as green manure, although less green than some others, with a higher C/N ratio). When used as bedding (<b>barn</b> <b>litter),</b> it is then removed and directly spread on the fields or composted (in long piles handled by loaders) for later field spreading. In either of the latter two use cases, it ends up as organic matter for soil amendment.|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} for intensive broiler breeding using deep litter method provides convenient conditions for production of odour substances inside the barn. As a consequence, there are relatively high odour {{emissions in the}} breeding area and its surrounding, which has significant impacts on the life quality of both people and animals. The amount of produced emissions increases in time because it {{is closely related to}} the amount of poultry droppings accumulated in <b>litter</b> inside the <b>barn.</b> This paper deals with changes in odour intensity depending on time measured since the beginning of broiler fattening. Odour intensity was measured by methods of dynamic olfactometry. The estimated values gradually increased from 45 ouE·m- 3 to the highest value of 259 ouE·m- 3, which was determined in the final fattening phase (broilers’ age 33 days). The calculated odour substances emission values were in range from 0. 02 ouE·s- 1 ·bird- 1 at the beginning of fattening up to 0. 10 ouE·s- 1 ·bird- 1 in the final fattening phase. Odour emissions increased five times during the fattening period...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. This project {{investigated}} the age effect of turkey barns built on clay loam soils {{on the soil}} properties. Three turkey barns with ages of 10, 20, and 45 years were studied, and soil samples were collected {{both inside and outside}} the barns in 30. 54 cm intervals to a depth of 152. 7 cm. The information obtained indicated that turkey <b>barn</b> <b>litter</b> had little influence on the clay loam soil moisture content, regardless of the barn age. For barns less than 10 years old, only the topsoil layer (30. 54 cm) had increased nitrate and ammonium nitrogen concentrations. Therefore, replacing the topsoil layer every 10 years may be an option to reduce potential groundwater pollution by nitrogen leaching. For barns over 20 years old, repairing the barn floor to hinder nitrogen leaching becomes virtually impossible. A linear relationship was observed for soil nitrate concentration with ammonium concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9515, indicating that the high nitrate concentration found in the soil was likely caused by the nitrification process. Data also showed that phosphorus leaching into clay loam soils was a relatively slow process, and replacing the topsoil layer of the barn floor every 20 years may be considered as an option to prevent this. Although barn age had a profound impact on soil pH, the correlation of the reduced soil pH with nutrient distribution in soil profiles was not observed...|$|R
40|$|Sustaining Animal Health and Food Safety in Organic Farming (SAFO) is an European Commission funded project, {{with the}} {{objective}} to contribute to improved animal health and food safety in organic livestock production systems in existing and candidate member countries of the European Union. Workshops form {{a central part of}} the SAFO activities. This volume, with the contributions to the 2 nd SAFO Workshop in Witzenhausen, Germany in March 2004, is one in a series of five proceedings published during the lifetime of the project (2003 - 2006). Electronic version of the proceedings will also be available at the SAFO web-site at [URL] The 2 nd SAFO workshop focussed on the impact of farm level practices on animal health and quality aspects of organic livestock production. While most farm assurance schemes, including the organic farming certification, are primarily concerned with regulating the production system, the outcomes of the system, in terms of animal health and welfare, are particularly important in livestock production. The status quo assessments presented in the Workshop suggested that animal health and welfare outcomes of the organic production systems do not necessarily fulfil high consumer – or indeed animal – expectations. It was also suggested, that there may be particular problems in relation to the quality and safety of animal products, particularly in situations where regulations to achieve wider objectives – e. g. animal welfare - could have negative impact in relation to zoonotic diseases. Some of the speakers highlighted the inadequacies of the current inspection and certification systems, in terms of securing high levels of health and welfare in organic livestock systems. – Improved health planning, combined with a structured assessment of health and welfare outcomes, as part of certification, was suggested as a potential solution to these problems. Perhaps the most valuable offering of the 2 nd SAFO Workshop was the wealth of information on husbandry, feeding and breeding techniques that are being developed for organic livestock production systems all over the Community. In spite of some formidable problems, marked strides forward are being taken by the farmers and their advisers in areas like improving the poultry husbandry, identifying suitable feeding and breeding strategies for dairy cows and controlling parasites with minimal medicine inputs. – One of the important tasks of the SAFO Network is to ensure that the messages from these projects are taken into consideration {{in the development of the}} EU Regulation on organic livestock production.
