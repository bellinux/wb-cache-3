5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} <b>lug</b> <b>nut.</b> This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides {{a different type of}} cargo, which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, as well as a mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E

25|$|Despite these changes, the Z8 {{remained}} extremely {{faithful to}} the concept car. The side-mounted turn indicators were integrated into the side vents in a fashion that rendered them invisible until activated. The vintage simplicity of the interior was preserved by hiding the modern equipment under retracting panels. Complex compound curves were preserved {{through the use of}} an expensive MIG-welded aluminum space frame. The Z8 even retained the concept's five-spoke wheel design, albeit without the race-style center <b>lug</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wheel <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> {{may have}} {{different}} shapes. Aftermarket alloy and forged rims often require specific <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to match their mounting holes, so it is often required {{to get a new}} set of <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> when the rims are changed.|$|R

25|$|In the Food City 500 at Bristol, Johnson {{finished}} 23rd {{after making}} an unscheduled pit stop {{due to a}} loose <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> on lap 300. At Richmond, he led 44 laps early in the race and finished 3rd. At Talladega, Johnson was spun by Paul Menard and got involved in a multi-car accident with 28 laps to go, finishing 22nd. Johnson's streak of misfortune continued through the next several months, crashing out at Dover, Pocono, Daytona, Kentucky and at Watkins Glen, where he finished last {{for the first time}} in his career. His top-10 finishes during the period came only in the Coca-Cola 600 and Brickyard 400, where he finished 3rd in both races. Johnson finished 7th and 6th at Bristol and Michigan the following two weeks, but finished 33rd at Darlington after he spun out of turn 4. Johnson then finished 11th at Richmond. He qualified 8th for the Chase.|$|E

500|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops began on lap 199; Johnson stopped on lap 203, while Earnhardt made a pit stop on the {{following}} lap. After the pit stops, Kahne retook the lead. Johnson drove to the track's inside at turn three and passed Kahne for the lead on lap 211 and started {{to pull away from}} the rest of the field. Bowyer drove to his garage on lap 216 for a transmission change because he lost the use of third gear. Jeff Gordon had closed the gap to Kahne by lap 229. Green-flag pit stops started six laps later when Kahne made a pit stop from second place. Johnson took on four tires at his stop on lap 239, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon, who ceded it to Earnhardt two laps later. Martin's pit crew dropped a <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> which resulted him remaining stationary for 21.7 seconds. Burton stalled his car which required his crew to push him to the end of pit road. An eighth caution was triggered on lap 242 when Yeley attempted to drive down pit road, and Martin was approaching him. Martin tried to avoid Yeley by steering left onto the turn four apron but made contact with him. Martin then spun and went hard into the tri-oval wall; his car got airborne in the process. Robby Gordon could not avoid the melee and hit Yeley. Gordon consequently spun into the front stretch grass but continued.|$|E
50|$|Wheels must {{be fitted}} {{with the correct}} type of <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> on wheel studs, or bolts. <b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> (aka wheel nuts in British English) are usually either flat, tapered (generally at 60 degrees and {{referred}} to as conical seat), or ball seats, meaning the mounting surfaces are flat, tapered, or spherical respectively.Most Mercedes have ball lug seats from the factory while most aftermarket wheels have a tapered lug design. Wrong <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for the wheel will not properly center it and cause wobble. Some manufacturers (e.g. Toyota and Lexus) have used taper <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for steel wheels and flat seated <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> for alloy wheels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> must be {{installed}} in an alternating pattern, {{commonly referred to as}} a star pattern. This ensures a uniform distribution of load across the wheel mounting surface. When installing <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> it is recommended to tighten them with a calibrated torque wrench. While a lug, socket or impact wrench may be used to tighten <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> the final tightening should be performed by a torque wrench, ensuring an accurate and adequate load is applied. Torque specifications vary by vehicle and wheel type. Both vehicle and wheel manufacturers provide recommended torque values which should be consulted when an installation is done. Failure to abide by the recommended torque value can result in damage to the wheel and brake rotor/drum. Additionally, under tightened <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> may come loose with time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> may {{be removed}} using a lug, socket or impact wrench. If the wheel {{is to be}} removed then an {{automotive}} jack to raise the vehicle and some wheel chocks would be used as well. Wheels that have hubcaps or hub covers need these removed beforehand, typically with a screwdriver, flatbar, or prybar. <b>Lug</b> <b>nuts</b> {{can be difficult to}} remove, as they may become frozen to the wheel stud. In such cases a breaker bar or repeated blows from an impact wrench can be used to free them. Alternating between tightening and loosening can free especially stubborn <b>lug</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The centerbore of a {{wheel is}} the size of the hole {{in the back of the}} wheel that centers it over the {{mounting}} hub of the car. Some factory wheels have a centerbore that matches exactly with the hub to reduce vibration by keeping the wheel centered. Wheels with the correct centerbore to the car they will be mounted on are known as hubcentric. Hubcentric wheels take the stress off the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts,</b> reducing the job of the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to center the wheel to the car. Wheels that are not hubcentric are known as lugcentric, as the job of centering is done by the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> assuming they are properly torqued down.|$|R

50|$|A <b>lug</b> <b>nut</b> or {{wheel nut}} is a fastener, {{specifically}} a nut, used {{to secure a}} wheel on a vehicle. Typically, lug nuts are found on automobiles, trucks (lorries), and other large vehicles using rubber tires.|$|E

50|$|Loose {{wheel nut}} {{indicators}} are small pointed tags, usually made of fluorescent orange or yellow plastic, which are {{fixed to the}} <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> of the wheels of large vehicles. The tag rotates with the nut, and if the nut becomes loose, {{the point of the}} tag shifts noticeably out of alignment with the other tags. If too many <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> are loosened, the wheel can detach from the wheel stud; loose wheel nut indicators allow identification of loose nuts before this can occur.|$|R
50|$|Rarely, {{and more}} often with large trucks and lorries, {{insufficient}} force {{can lead to the}} nuts coming undone while in use. Because of this, it is best to use a torque wrench or similar tool to finally tighten the wheel <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> to the proper torque specification as soon as possible after using a lug wrench to affix a wheel. At the very least, the <b>lug</b> <b>nuts</b> should be checked for tightness after 50-100 km/miles when things have been subject to some vibration and thermal cycling.|$|R
