Experimental procedures applying optical methods to intact, living animals were similar to those used previously to investigate the migration of retinula cell pigment granules in Hymenoptera. The data obtained from nymphalid butterflies and Hymenoptera show close parallels, favouring the pigment migration hypothesis. The retinula cell pigment granules control the <b>light</b> <b>flux</b> <b>in</b> the butterfly rhabdom and hence are part of a pupil mechanism.

The hymenopteran pupil mechanism has a familiar sigmoid intensity dependence; the time constant is 5 - 15 s. The pupil absorbance spectrum is broad, peaking at about 520 nm. The correspondence of this spectrum with known spectral sensitivities exemplifies that the pupil mechanism is a useful part of the visual system. ...|$|R

A table-top terawatt laser {{was used to}} generate 200 fs light pulses at 790 nm with a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The light pulses were focused through a cuvette filled with water to produce white light pulses and optical filters were placed in the beam path to select the wavelength of the light focused onto the leaf surface.

40|$|Light {{in natural}} and {{biological}} media {{is known as}} freely diffusing. When light undergoes multiple scattering through inhomogeneous dielectric biomacromolecules, interference is ignored. If scattered waves return to their origin points along the time-reversed paths for constructive interference, outgoing waves can be forbidden, occasionally being on-resonance or off-resonance with Anderson localized modes. However, such a phenomenon in optics requires high-refractive-index contrasts, which intrinsically do not exist in organic molecules (e. g. proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids). Here we predict and show experimentally that the long-standing perception of diffusive nature of light in biological media is broken by an exquisite distribution of silk protein structures produced from Bombyx mori (silkworm) and layered aragonite structures produced from Haliotis fulgens (abalone). We demonstrate how optical transmission quantities (e. g. <b>light</b> <b>flux</b> <b>in</b> transmission channels) are analyzed satisfying critical values of the Anderson localization transition. We find {{that the size of}} modes is smaller than specimen sizes and that the statistics of modes, decomposed from excitation at the gain-loss equilibrium, clearly differentiates silk and nacre from diffusive structures sharing the microscopic morphological similarity. This explains how the dimension, the size, and the distribution of disordered biological nanostructures result in enhanced light-matter interactions, in spite of low refractive index contrasts of constituent materials. As wave localization is universal, the presented results of electromagnetic waves will allow us to extend insight into electronic and mechanical waves in biological systems. Importantly, such optical resonances are extremely sensitive to subtle nanoscale perturbations, and thus can be implemented to biosensing platforms. ...|$|R

We have also measured its chemical composition in mineral and organic ions, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), aldehydes, H 2 O 2, and the absorption spectra of water-soluble chromophores. Mercury concentrations were also measured in spring 2006, when conditions were similar. The SSA of DD ranges from 79. 9 to 223 m** 2 /kg. The calculated ice surface area in the atmosphere reaches 11000 (± 70 %) µm** 2 /cm** 3, {{much higher than the}} aerosol surface area.

The composition of DD is markedly different from that of snow on the surface. Its concentrations in mineral ions are much lower, and its overall composition is acidic. Its concentrations in aldehydes, DOC, H 2 O 2 and mercury are much higher than in surface snows. Our interpretation is that DOC from the oceanic surface microlayer, coming from open leads in the ice off of Barrow, is taken up by DD. Active chemistry in the atmosphere takes place on DD crystal surfaces, explaining its high concentrations in aldehydes and mercury. After deposition, active photochemistry modifies DD composition, as seen from the modifications in its absorption spectra and aldehyde and H 2 O 2 content. This probably leads to the emissions of reactive species to the atmosphere...|$|R

We show that this duality relation indeed survives transition to the most general linear electrodynamics without birefringence, which rests on a spacetime geometry constituted by a Lorentzian metric and two scalar fields, a dilaton and an axion. By computing the Poynting vector and optical scalar transport in the geometrical optics limit of this framework, we derive the modification of the <b>light</b> <b>flux</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of a}} dilaton field and present improved constraints on the gradient of the dilaton field from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum. Although this flux modification may seem applicable also to fundamental modifications of the Etherington relation, we show that the distance duality relation still holds true. Thus any deviations within this classical theory would imply non-metricities, once astrophysical sources for attenuation, such as dust, are accounted for. Moreover, using the most up-to-date measurements of the luminosity distances to Supernovae of Type Ia, and the inferred angular diameter distances from the baryon acoustic feature measurements, we perform a scale-free and nearly model-independent test of the Etherington distance duality relation between redshifts of 0. 38 and 0. 61.

The results of experimental studies of a number of modern LED lamps have been described. Investigation has been made for a number of LED lamps produced by Philips, Xavax and Melitec. The experimental data have been obtained with the complex of devices: the dual-channel oscilloscope (GDS- 71042), the power quality analyzer (Fluke- 434) and the multi-function device EcoLight- 01 (light-, pulse- and luminance meter). It has been shown that operation of LED lamps is characterized by emission of higher current harmonics and reactive power consumption, which depends on the type and design of the lamp driver. It has been found that the value of luminance created by LED lamps in case of acceptable (for ships) prolonged deviation of voltage (– 10 %) is reduced by 3 %; in case of permissible short-term voltage deviation (– 20 %) luminance is reduced by 7 %. For incandescent lamps this indicator is characterized by a decrease in luminance by 40 % and 60 %, respectively. Despite the low sensitivity to voltage changes (in comparison with other types of lamps), the operation of LED lamps is also associated with the appearance of flicker.

Histamine also elicited a significant and reversible increase in [K+]gl that was blocked by chromanol 293 B, a blocker of KCQN 1 K+ channels. Histamine failed to induce net water flow in the presence of chromanol 293 B. In the “resting state,” stimulation of CaR with diverse agonists resulted in significant increase in [TEA]gl. CaR activation also significantly reduced histamine-induced water secretion and apical K+ transport. Our data validate the strong link between histamine-stimulated acid secretion and water transport.

The radiant luminous efficacy (LER) is {{the ratio of the}} visible <b>light</b> <b>flux</b> emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power radiated over all wavelengths. The source luminous efficacy (LES) is the ratio of the visible <b>light</b> <b>flux</b> emitted (the luminous flux) to the total power input to the source, such as a lamp. Visible light is measured <b>in</b> <b>lumens,</b> a unit which is defined in part by the differing sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light. Not all wavelengths of visible electromagnetic energy are equally effective at stimulating the human eye; the luminous {{efficacy of}} radiant energy (LER) is a measure of how well the distribution of energy matches the perception of the eye. The units of luminous efficacy are [...] "lumens per watt" [...] (lpw). The maximum LER possible is 683lm/W for monochromatic green light at 555 nanometers wavelength, the peak sensitivity of the human eye.|$|R
