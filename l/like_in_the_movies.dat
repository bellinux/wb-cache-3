5000|$|Harry Osborn appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Spider-Man 2 video game, again {{voiced by}} Josh Keaton. <b>Like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> he's obsessed with killing Spider-Man for his father's murder and goes {{as far as}} asking Doctor Octopus to capture Spider-Man.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in June 2006, this {{character}} {{was in a}} DirecTV commercial with Mini-Me. The plot {{was that he was}} talking about how Mini-Me was looking good to eat, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> (see above). Mini-Me thinks that he is crazy. He also uses two of his lines from the movie. His famous line in this commercial is [...] "Come on, get in my belly!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Later in the episode, Tommy himself {{shows up}} as a {{casualty}} {{on the operating}} table, having been shot by the enemy on the front lines. Just before being anesthetized, he weakly tells Hawkeye that he in fact had heard a bullet just before being hit, just <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> Hawkeye, close to tears, suggests that [...] "Sometimes You Hear the Bullet" [...] is a better title anyway, and tries frantically to save Tommy's life. Unfortunately, Tommy dies {{on the table and}} Henry Blake orders Hawkeye to move away and help Trapper.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was just}} <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> This bloke on the {{prosecution}} asks me, [...] "What {{would you do}} if you saw an Asiatic attacking your mother?" [...] - remember this is 1953. I said, [...] "I'd try to stop him". He said, [...] "What if the only way was to kill him?" [...] I said, [...] "I'd kill him." [...] He said. [...] "Well, that's what a soldier does, so why are you objecting to being a soldier?" [...] I said, [...] "Now wait a minute, you asked me what I'd do, what decision I'd take on my own initiative. If I'm a soldier someone else takes the initiatives for me, and that's an entirely different thing." [...] This went on for an hour; at one point they tried to ascertain whether there were any religious grounds on which I wouldn't be a soldier. I said, [...] "No, it seems to me the best soldiers get religion" [...] - and that didn't go down too well either ...|$|E
5000|$|Stuart Little (voiced by David Kaufman) is Mr. and Mrs. Little's {{second son}} and the middle child. Stuart also narrates the show's episodes, which all begin with Stuart <b>in</b> {{computer}} animation (<b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> series) on a shelf with his red car and a family portrait.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1991 film, New Jack City, the character, Nino Brown and his associates, {{were largely}} based on the real life Detroit gang <b>The</b> Chambers Brothers. <b>Like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> <b>The</b> Chambers Brothers were also known for taking over an {{apartment}} complex known as [...] "The Boulevard" [...] on E. Ferry St. in Detroit (name was changed to [...] "The Carter" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film), which was used to house their drug selling operations.|$|R
2500|$|The Crow are <b>the</b> main {{antagonist}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1972 film Jeremiah Johnson {{based on}} the real-life mountain man John Liver-Eating Johnston who, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> fought against <b>the</b> Crow earning him the nickname [...] "Crow killer". Liver-Eating Johnson later made allies with <b>the</b> Crow as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|R
5000|$|At home, Ashley has a {{fight with}} her mother Stacy Collins (Jennifer Taylor) because Vincent had called her and {{requested}} she take Ashley to group therapy at the hospital. Ashley attends the group therapy sessions, but refuses {{to participate in the}} discussion. Things become worse when one member becomes aggressive and is dragged away by hospital attendants. Ashley returns to the park to smoke where she meets Vickey (Danielle Morrow), who asks for a smoke. Asking if her lighter is real gold, Vickey suggests that she should try to scratch it <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> Ashley hands Vickey her switchblade and impressed, she invites Ashley to her house. Vickey tells Ashley she can contact her under the username [...] "SapphoGirl13" [...] on her computer. Vickey and Ashley begin kissing when Vickey notices cuts along Ashley’s wrists. Ashley becomes turned on when Vickey touches her wrists, but Vickey becomes disturbed when Ashley wants to use the switchblade and asks her to leave. At home, Ashley contacts Vickey on her computer using the alias [...] "HomeStarch99" [...] and they begin to have cybersex however Ashley quickly becomes uninterested, turns off the computer and cuts herself instead.|$|E
5000|$|Like Zamazu, {{this album}} {{begins with a}} short ritual recitation by Fonseca's mother, Mercedes Cortes Alfaro. The pervading {{influence}} of South Africa's Abdullah Ibrahim is apparent on both [...] "Lo Que Me Hace Vivir" [...] and [...] "La Flor Que No Cuidé," [...] while [...] "Cuando Uno Crece" [...] is clearly dedicated to Rubén González. On [...] "Lo Que Me Hace Vivir", Fonseca explores a [...] "bass line exploration vamp that accompanies right-hand runs, defining his thoughts as he emerges from the dense clusters of notes." [...] Fonseca dedicates the dreamy ballad [...] "Como En Las Películas" [...] (<b>Like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Movies)</b> {{to the music of}} France, and claims that [...] "Bulgarian" [...] was inspired by that country. Even so, the combination of Fonseca's piano, the complex time signatures and Javier Zalba's eastern-inflected clarinet on this piece suggest Turkey's Ayşe Tüntüncü Trio. The contrarily titled [...] "Lento Y Despacio" [...] (Slow and slowly) is a stop-start percussive jam, similar in style to Aron Ottignon. The BBC considers the most striking piece to be [...] "Drume Negrita", describing it as [...] "a cool, relaxed vibe and features some lovely sax work by Zalba." [...] Cape Verdean singer Mayra Andrade sings on [...] "Siete Potencias" [...] (Bu Kantu).|$|E
5000|$|Jason is not {{linked to}} Superman. Brutus is killed by Lois by pulling a {{bookcase}} down his head, snapping his neck (p. 256). However, just <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> it is Jason who finds Superman near-drowning (p. 303). There is no scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book where Superman recites Jor-El’s words to Jason.|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> episode, Bebe tells Stan {{to try and}} win Wendy back by {{standing}} outside her window, holding up a boom box, and playing Peter Gabriel; {{a reference to the}} John Cusack film Say Anything.... However instead of playing [...] "In Your Eyes," [...] <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> Stan plays [...] "Shock the Monkey".|$|R
50|$|In {{this early}} version the cave itself was {{described}} as Batman's underground study and, like the other rooms, was just a small alcove with a desk and filing cabinets. <b>Like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> serial, <b>the</b> Batman's symbol was carved into the rock behind the desk and had a candle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of it. The entrance was via a bookcase {{which led to a}} secret elevator.|$|R
5000|$|An {{episode of}} the TV series Remington Steele, [...] "Springtime for Steele", has two men trying to pull the same scam by {{promoting}} a tour of an untalented singer after selling the rights for major profit. <b>Like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> though, <b>the</b> scam is undone when the tour is a sellout. Keeping with a running theme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series, Steele cites <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> as inspiration for the scheme.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} narrated by Santa Claus rather than Papa Elf. <b>The</b> story <b>in</b> <b>the</b> musical {{is said to}} have begun three years ago - rather than thirty years ago, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> - so that there's no age limit on the actor playing Buddy. Buddy and Jovie's child is changed from a boy to a girl. The musical also adds a subplot about Michael's disbelief in Santa.|$|R
50|$|Just <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> <b>the</b> TV series {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of Hunt Stevenson (here, played by Scott Bakula as opposed to Michael Keaton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie),</b> a laid-back American employee liaison of a Japanese car company in Hadleyville, Pennsylvania. Much of the humor arose from the abounding clashes between Hunt and the new Japanese plant manager, Kaz Kazuhiro (Gedde Watanabe, who was reprising his role from <b>the</b> <b>movie)</b> while {{looking for ways to}} bridge the culture gap between one another.|$|R
5000|$|One of the adverts was a spoof of the [...] "deli scene" [...] from <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> When Harry Met Sally; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advert Monkey {{describes}} {{the taste of}} PG Tips by saying [...] "Oh Yes" [...] repeatedly <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> finishing with a woman at a table nearby asking the waiter [...] "I'll have whatever he's having". The ad ends with the tagline [...] "How {{would you describe the}} taste?". It was first shown on 3 February 2010.|$|R
2500|$|In World of Warcraft, the Ruby Slippers are a pair {{of level}} 70 epic cloth shoes dropped by the Wizard of Oz-themed [...] "opera event" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Karazhan raid instance. The shoes {{function}} similarly to the hearthstone that all characters start out with, allowing them to teleport from their current location to the inn where the hearthstone is set. The caption under the statistic lines, much <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> is [...] "There's no place like home." ...|$|R
2500|$|Vault Multiball: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{top-right}} {{section of}} the playfield is a blue bookcase, representing the bookcase that Gomez shows Uncle Fester <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> [...] Hits to it award letters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "Greed". [...] Once the word is completed, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> <b>the</b> bookcase turns, revealing a shot to the vault behind the bookcase (it is possible but rare for a ball {{to go into the}} vault when <b>the</b> bookcase is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blocking position). [...] A shot to the vault locks the ball for future multiball use, or starts the multiball when two balls have been previously locked. [...] The bookcase also opens access to the vault at certain other times during the mini games, with varying scores and effects.|$|R
50|$|The game {{starts out}} as John is {{called in to}} dispel a demon from a little girl's body in a hotel. (Just <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.)</b> After <b>the</b> {{exorcism}} is completed, the girl wakes from her hypnosis, feeling better. The screen then cuts to Beeman's office, where John is being informed about the weakened line between Hell and Earth by Beeman. John then steps into a puddle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner of the room, utters an incantation and winds up in Hell.|$|R
5000|$|Stone {{also made}} an {{extended}} version of Alexander. [...] "I'm doing a third version on DVD, not theatrical", {{he said in}} an interview with Rope of Silicon. [...] "I'm going to do a Cecil B. DeMille three-hour-45-minute thing; I'm going to go all out, put everything I <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> He Alexander was a complicated man, it was a complicated story, and it doesn't hurt to make it longer and let people who loved the film ... see it more and understand it more." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film, {{specifically}} the iconic [...] "Get Happy" [...] sequence, has been referenced in many pop culture contexts. Michael Jackson performed [...] "Dangerous" [...] {{in a way}} that paid tribute to <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> most notably at the 1993 American Music Awards and the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. Jackson and his dancers wore suits, and a dancer stood in front of Jackson until the beginning of <b>the</b> song, just <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> <b>in</b> which Judy is covered by a dancer at first. Some excerpts from the song can be heard in Jackson's performance.|$|R
40|$|Every now and then, {{our legal}} system interacts with the spirit world, whether by virtue of seances being used <b>in</b> {{establishing}} <b>the</b> defense <b>in</b> a criminal matter or {{being used by the}} prosecution to impugn the defendant, or because of the impact that ghosts may have on stigmatized property or by virtue of houses being built on cemeteries, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> 2 ̆ 2 Poltergeist. 2 ̆ 2 Our legal system has an uneasy relationship with the spirit world and this chapter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book explores that relationship...|$|R
50|$|During {{the filming}} of James Cameron's Avatar all of the scenes {{involving}} this process were directed in realtime using Autodesk Motion Builder software to render a screen image which allowed the director and the actor {{to see what they}} would look <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> making it easier to direct <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> as it would be seen by the viewer. This method allowed views and angles not possible from a pre-rendered animation. Cameron was so proud of his results that he even invited Steven Spielberg and George Lucas on set to view <b>the</b> system <b>in</b> action.|$|R
5000|$|... 300 - Introduced in 2007, {{clips from}} <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> 300 {{were added to}} the [...] "Thunderstruck" [...] {{introduction}} sequence. A clip of Spartan King Leonidas shouting, [...] "Spartans! What is your profession?" [...] is played whenever <b>the</b> opponent is <b>in</b> a third down situation. The crowd responds with an emphatic [...] "Ha-Ooh! Ha-Ooh! Ha-Ooh!" [...] while thrusting their fists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air as if they were carrying spears <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b> This is very popular with the football team. On October 16, 2010, 300 star Gerard Butler attended the Spartans' homecoming game. At the beginning of the game Butler walked onto the field repeating the familiar call to fans.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{occurring}} in Royal City, Washington, {{the event of}} Race Wars also occurs <b>in</b> Australia, where <b>the</b> automobile scene is very active. The event {{is very similar to}} that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States; usually consisting of a small fee to enter into the drag races and an even smaller fee to spectate/park. People do not race for pink slips or large amounts of cash <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> however, as it is just an event where people can test their cars on the strip, see how they match up to other vehicles, {{and have a good time}} in a safe environment. In efforts to reduce illegal street racing, this event allows for people to push their cars to <b>the</b> limit <b>in</b> a controlled environment.|$|R
2500|$|The 2003 album Give Up by {{electronic}} music group The Postal Service includes a song titled [...] "Clark Gable". The song's narrator {{says he wants}} love <b>like</b> something <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies,</b> and includes <b>the</b> lyrics [...] "I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired, I thought it classic." ...|$|R
25|$|Lopez {{admitted}} that she <b>liked</b> her experience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> industry because it gave her a great possibility to express her creative potential without respecting any limits.|$|R
500|$|Sklar {{worked on}} the Garrison {{side of the story}} while Stone added the Oswald story, the events at Dealey Plaza and the [...] "Mr. X" [...] character. Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550 triple-spaced page {{screenplay}} and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length. Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the [...] "Mr. X" [...] character played by Donald Sutherland. This was a technique that would be criticized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> press. He was a mix of Richard Case Nagell and retired Air Force colonel Fletcher Prouty, another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and the Pentagon. Meeting Prouty was, for Stone, [...] "one of the most extraordinary afternoons I've ever spent. Pretty much <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> he just started to talk." [...] According to Stone, ...|$|R
50|$|Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler's Green {{utilizes}} traditional first-person shooter gameplay. Players can use {{a variety}} of either melee weapons or firearms to fight through the zombie hordes. Some weapons are capable of dismembering the zombies, whilst other weapons are not. The zombies' jaws, heads, arms, forearms, and legs can be shot or chopped off by the player. This can very effectively save the player so as to make an escape. The zombies themselves appear in many varieties (regular, ones armed with a melee weapon, crawlers, puking ones, screamers that summon other zombies, and poisonous, exploding ones) and each takes a different amount of hits to kill, which varies upon the difficulty setting of the game. The player cannot become a zombie, but it is stated that people who die for any reason become zombies, <b>like</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Calculator appears <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Lego Batman <b>Movie</b> {{where he}} dresses up <b>like</b> a calculator. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie</b> he builds a CD rack <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Joker's hideout only {{for it to}} fall apart.|$|R
50|$|Many former Google interns and Google {{employees}} {{noted the}} accuracy of the company environment depicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie,</b> but also pointed out that the internship process is nothing <b>like</b> that shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>movie.</b>|$|R
