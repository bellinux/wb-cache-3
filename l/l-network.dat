5000|$|With {{the narrow}} band tuners, the <b>L-network</b> {{has the lowest}} loss, partly because it has the fewest components, but mainly because it {{necessarily}} operates at the lowest [...] possible for a given impedance transformation. With the <b>L-network,</b> the loaded [...] is not adjustable, but is fixed midway between the source and load impedances. Since most of the loss in practical tuners {{will be in the}} coil, choosing either the low-pass or high-pass network may reduce the loss somewhat. The <b>L-network</b> using only capacitors will have the lowest loss, but this network only works where the load impedance is very inductive, as occurs with a small loop antenna or a straight-wire antenna that is between a quarter and a half wave long. Note, however, that problematic straight-wire antennas are typically too short, rather than too long.|$|E
50|$|The basic circuit {{required}} when lumped capacitances and inductors {{are used}} is shown below. This circuit {{is important in}} that many automatic antenna tuners use it, and also because more complex circuits can be analyzed as groups of <b>L-networks.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{is called}} an L network {{not because it}} {{contains}} an inductor, (in fact some <b>L-networks</b> consist of two capacitors), but because the two components are {{at right angles to}} each other, having the shape of a rotated and sometimes reversed English letter ‘L’. The T (“Tee”) network and the π (“Pi”) network also have a shape similar to the English and Greek letters they are named after.|$|R
50|$|Note, , the {{reactance}} in parallel, has {{a negative}} reactance because it is typically a capacitor. This gives the <b>L-network</b> the additional feature of harmonic suppression since it is a low pass filter too.|$|E

50|$|The Low R, high L circuit {{is shown}} feeding a small loop antenna. Below {{resonance}} {{this type of}} antenna has so much inductance, that more inductance from adding a coil would make the reactance even worse. Therefore the <b>L-network</b> is composed of two capacitors.|$|E
50|$|The <b>L-network</b> {{can have}} eight {{different}} configurations, six {{of which are}} shown here. The two missing configurations {{are the same as}} the bottom row, but with the parallel element (wires vertical) {{on the right side of}} the series element (wires horizontal), instead of on the left, as shown.|$|E
50|$|The Low R, high C circuit {{is shown}} feeding a short {{vertical}} antenna, such {{as would be}} the case for a compact, mobile antenna or otherwise on frequencies below an antennas lowest natural resonant frequency. Here the inherent capacitance of a short, random wire antenna is so high that the <b>L-network</b> is best realized with two inductors, instead of aggravating the problem by using a capacitor.|$|E
50|$|There {{is usually}} an antenna {{matching}} unit to match the impedance of the transmitter or feeder to the antenna. Depending on the power involved, {{this may be a}} small box or a hut or building. It will typically contain an <b>L-network</b> to transform the modulus of impedance, and a coil or capacitor in series with the mast connection to 'tune out' any reactive component.|$|E
50|$|Example 3 {{shows the}} result is a Π-network rather than an <b>L-network.</b> The {{reason for this is that}} the shunt element has more {{capacitance}} than is required by the transform so some is still left over after applying the transform. If the excess were instead, in the element nearest the transformer, this could be dealt with by first shifting the excess to the other side of the transformer before carrying out the transform.|$|E
50|$|An <b>L-network</b> is the {{simplest}} circuit that will {{achieve the desired}} transformation; for any one given antenna and frequency, once a circuit is selected from the eight possible configurations (of which six are shown above) only one set of component values will match the in impedance to the out impedance. In contrast, the circuits described below all have three or more components, and hence have many more choices for inductance and capacitance that will produce an impedance match. The radio operator must experiment, test, and use judgement to choose among the many adjustments that produce the same impedance match.|$|E
50|$|The {{general rule}} (with some exceptions, {{described}} below) {{is that the}} series element of an <b>L-network</b> goes on the side with the lowest impedance.So for example, the three circuits in the left column and the two in the bottom row have the series (horizontal) element on the out side are generally used for stepping up from a low-impedance input (transmitter) to a high-impedance output (antenna), similar to the example analyzed in the section above. The top two circuits in the right column, with the series (horizontal) element on the in side, are generally useful for stepping down from a higher input to a lower output impedance.|$|E

40|$|This {{tutorial}} describes {{methods for}} broadbanding matching networks using cascaded sections and compensating reactance Impedance matching {{is probably the}} most engineering task in RF/microwave design. This tutorial is intended to demonstrate the first steps from simple twoand three-element networks that are designed for a specific center frequency, to larger networks that provide an acceptable match over a wider bandwidth. These wider bandwidth networks are important for modern communications systems that have operating bandwidths that are much wider than older technologies using FM and BPSK modulation. Even at narrower bandwidths, many digital modulation formats require flat amplitude and linear phase response, which can be achieved by using wideband matching networks, which have much smaller variation over a signal’s occupied bandwidth. Classic L, T and Pi Matching Networks The simplest impedance transformation network is the <b>L-network,</b> which requires just two reactive components. Like a filter, the <b>L-network</b> can have a highpass or lowpass frequency response characteristic. Even if the particular response is unimportant, it means that two topologies are available—which is important when matching reactive loads, as we will see later. Figure 1 shows the two <b>L-network</b> configurations and their design equations for resistive sources and loads. Note that Q is determined by the ratio of the impedances to be matched and cannot be chosen by the designer. Thus, L-networks are low-Q for small impedance transformations and high-Q for R 1 C 1 R 2 R 1 Figure 1 · The two basic <b>L-network</b> topologies and their design equations. large impedance transformations. Also note that the equation for Q requires the shunt reactance to be located adjacent to the higher impedance. Two <b>L-network</b> sections can be connected back-to-back, as shown in Figure 2.

As for the rectifier, a half-wave rectifier with a single zero-bias Schottky diode HSMS 2820 was selected for high powers (≥ 5 dBm) and HSMS 2850 for low powers (< 5 dBm). First, a theoretical analysis was performed that takes into account the parasitic capacitance of the diode. Then, simulations with ADS (Harmonic Balance) were carried out taking into account the circuit layout. Both in the analysis and simulations, the antenna was substituted by an AC generator with an output resistance of both 50  and 300 Ω. Finally, a printed circuit board (PCB) implementation was performed using a 0. 5 pF capacitor and a 27 nH inductor for the <b>L-network.</b> First, the input power was generated by an RF generator and directly connected to the circuit.

Na rede-P, os pontos de parada de ônibus representam os nós e as arestas são representadas pela existência de linhas de ônibus que passam em dois pontos. Na rede-L, as linhas de ônibus representam os nós. Se duas linhas passam por, pelo menos, um ponto de parada em comum, então existe aresta nesse par de linhas de ônibus. A rede-B é uma rede bipartida, nesse caso, tanto os pontos de parada como as linhas de ônibus representam os nós da rede, onde as arestas ligam somente os nós de tipos diferentes. Geramos as matrizes de adjacências AP, AL, MP e ML, essas duas últimas representam grafos de multiplicidade de arestas (redes ponderadas) dos dois primeiros e a matriz de incidência B representa a rede-B bipartida. Construímos a matriz-T, matriz de transbordo, para análise do número de transbordos necessários numa situação em que não exista conexão direta entre dois nós. Obtivemos resultados de rede de mundos pequenos para a rede- P não ponderada, por meio da análise do coeficiente de aglomeração e do número de transbordos. Como resultados da análise do grau do nó, encontramos a distribuição do grau do nó das redes ponderadas e calculamos sua entropia, observamos que a rede-B apresenta uma curva do tipo lei de potência para a distribuição do grau do nó. Além disso, concluímos que a rede-P apresenta características de rede de mundos pequenos. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTIn this work, {{we studied}} Distrito Federal's Urban {{transport}} System using complex network theory, from {{the definition of}} three networks: the P-network, the <b>L-network</b> and the B- network.
