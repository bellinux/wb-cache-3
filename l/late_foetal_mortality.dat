Age of mother at childbearing has an impact on child mortality and morbidity. Similarly, a late paternal age at childbearing, controlling for mother’s age, has a statistically significant impact on neonatal mortality and on <b>late</b> <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> as well as on the risk for the child of suffering from various congenital anomalies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the timing of <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> in gilts of a segregating F 2 cross of Large White and Meishan pigs on the basis of the length distribution of mummified foetuses and the frequency of non-fresh stillborn piglets in order to establish whether critical periods for <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> exist. All expelled conceptuses and placentae of 192 farrowing gilts with a normal health status were meticulously investigated to recover all mummified foetuses. The length of each mummified foetus was measured. The predicted number of foetuses present per gilt at the early foetal stage of gestation was calculated as the sum of numbers of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn, fresh stillborn and liveborn piglets. Foetal loss was calculated as the sum of mummified foetuses and non-fresh stillborn piglets. The average <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> rate per gilt was 8. 7 %. In total 162 mummified foetuses were found (average 0. 84 per litter), ranging in length from 0. 4 to 33. 0 cm. This indicates a range in foetal age at death of similar to 35 - 100 days. Although mummified foetuses of all lengths within the above mentioned range were found, relatively many had a length of less than 4 cm or of 10 - 21 cm. The total number of non-fresh stillborn piglets (i. e. <b>late</b> <b>foetal</b> deaths) was 58 (average 0. 30 per litter). It can be concluded that <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> occurred in these gilts throughout the period from day 35 to term, with relatively high incidences at the early foetal stage (days 35 - 40), shortly after mid-pregnancy (days 55 - 75) and after similar today 100 of gestation. These three periods coincide with reported periods of change in porcine placental growth. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|To {{compare the}} change in <b>foetal</b> and {{neonatal}} <b>mortality</b> in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2010 with {{the change in}} other European countries. Descriptive, population-based study. Data from the Euro-Peristat project on <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality</b> in European countries were analysed for changes between 2004 and 2010. The Netherlands was compared with 26 other European countries and regions. International differences in registration and policy were taken into account using figures on <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> starting at 28 weeks of pregnancy and neonatal mortality starting at 24 weeks of pregnancy. <b>Foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> in the Netherlands declined by 33 %, from 4. 3 per 1000 births in 2004 to 2. 9 per 1000 births in 2010 while neonatal mortality declined by 21 %, from 2. 8 per 1000 live births in 2004 to 2. 2 per 1000 live births in 2010.

40|$|A best {{evidence}} topic was written {{according to a}} structured protocol. The question addressed was whether cardiopulmonary bypass can be used safely with satisfactory maternal and foetal outcomes in pregnant patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A total of 679 papers were found using the reported searches of which 14 represented the {{best evidence}} to answer the clinical question. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. Reported measures were maternal and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> and complications, mode of delivery, cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times, perfusate flow rate and tempera-ture and maternal NYHA functional class. The most recent of the best evidence studies, a retrospective observational study of 21 preg-nant patients reported early and late maternal mortalities of 4. 8 and 14. 3 %, respectively, and a <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> of 14. 3 %. Median cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 53 and 35 min, respectively, and the median bypass temperature was 37 °C. Three larger retrospective reviews of the literature reported maternal mortality rates of 2. 9 – 5. 1 % and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> rates of 19 – 29 %.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Ethnic {{disparities in}} {{perinatal}} mortality are well known. This study aims {{to explore the}} contribution of demographic, socioeconomic, health behavioural and pre-existent medical risk factors among different ethnic groups on foetal and early neonatal mortality. Methods: We assessed perinatal mortality from 24. 0 weeks gestation onwards in 554, 234 singleton pregnancies of nulliparous women in the linked Netherlands Perinatal Registry over the period 2000 - 2006. Logistic regression modelling was used. Results: Considerable ethnic differences in perinatal mortality exists especially in <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Maternal age, socioeconomic status and pre-existent diseases could not explain these ethnic differences. Late booking visit could explain some differences. Compared to the ethnic Dutch, African women had an increased <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> risk of odds ratio 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 4 to 2. 1), South Asian women of 1. 8 (1. 4 to 2. 3), other non-Western women of 1. 3 (1. 1 to 1. 6) and Turkish/Moroccan women of 1. 3 (1. 1 to 1. 4). The risk on early neonatal mortality was only increased in other non-Western women, odds ratio 1. 3 (1. 0 to 1. 8). Ethnic differences were even present in the women without risk factors including preterm births. Mortality risk for East-Asian and other Western women was lower or comparable to the ethnic Dutch. Conclusion: Important ethnic differences in <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> exist, especially among women of African and South Asian origin.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve {{knowledge}} on Escherichia coli bacteraemia during pregnancy, we studied clinical data and performed molecular characterization of strains for 29 E. coli bacteraemia occurring in pregnant women. Bacteraemia mostly occurred in the third trimester of pregnancy (45 %) and was community-acquired (79 %). Portals of entry were urinary (55 %) and genital (45 %). E. coli strains belonged mainly to phylogroups B 2 (72 %) and D (17 %). Four clonal lineages (i. e. sequence type complex (STc) 73, STc 95, STc 12 and STc 69) represented 65 % of the strains. The strains exhibited {{a high number of}} virulence factor coding genes (10 (3 – 16)). Six foetuses died (27 %), five of them due to bacteraemia of genital origin (83 %). Foetal deaths occurred despite adequate antibiotic regimens. Strains associated with <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> had fewer virulence factors (8 (6 – 10)) than strains involved in no <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> (11 (4 – 12)) (p 0. 02). When comparing E. coli strains involved in bacteraemia with a urinary portal of entry in non-immunocompromised pregnant vs. non-immunocompromised non-pregnant women from the COLIBAFI study, {{there was no significant difference}} of phylogroups and virulence factor coding genes.

40|$|Perinatal {{mortality}} rates have dropped {{sharply in the}} past few decades, in the Netherlands as well as in all other European countries. However, as the decrease has generally slowed down since the 1980 s, the Netherlands has lost its prominent position in the international ranking of countries with favourable perinatal {{mortality rates}}. This lower ranking is not only the result of the dialectics of progress, but also the consequence of a relatively restrained use of antenatal diagnostics. In addition, the Netherlands is among the European countries scoring highest on a number of important risk factors. This article examines the effect on perinatal mortality rates of known risk factors, in particular the presence of non-western foreigners, multiple births and older mothers. With respect to the latter factor, it is concluded that children of older mothers run a significantly higher risk of <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> whereas babies of young mothers (including women in their early twenties) run a higher risk of infant mortality. For babies of non-western mothers, infant mortality rates are higher, although there are substantial differences between ethnic backgrounds. First week mortality is most unfavourable for Surinamese and Antillean/Aruban children, and post-neonatal mortality is highest among Turkish and Moroccan babies. The fact that relatively many non-western foreigners from countries with relatively high risks of perinatal mortality have settled in the Netherlands, {{is one of the reasons}} for the fall in the international ranking. Lastly, the increase in the number of multiple births has been stronger in the Netherlands than in most other countries. The higher incidence of assisted reproduction explains most of this increase. ethnicity, <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> infant and child mortality, mortality, multiple births, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, Peristat, risk factors...|$|R
40|$|Aims To {{describe}} {{the outcome of}} pregnancy in patients with structural or ischaemic heart disease. Methods and results In 2007, the European Registry on Pregnancy and Heart disease was initiated by the European Society of Cardiology. Consecutive patients with valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease, ischaemic heart disease (IHD), or cardiomyopathy (CMP) presenting with pregnancy were enrolled. Data for the normal population were derived from the literature. Sixty hospitals in 28 countries enrolled 1321 pregnant women between 2007 and 2011. Median maternal age was 30 years (range 16 - 53). Most patients were in NYHA class I (72 %). Congenital heart disease (66 %) was most prevalent, followed by valvular heart disease 25 %, CMP 7 %, and IHD in 2 %. Maternal death occurred in 1 %, compared with 0. 007 % in the normal population. Highest maternal mortality was found in patients with CMP. During pregnancy, 338 patients (26 %) were hospitalized, 133 for heart failure. Caesarean section was performed in 41 %. <b>Foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> occurred in 1. 7 % and neonatal mortality in 0. 6 %, both {{higher than in the}} normal population. Median duration of pregnancy was 38 weeks (range 24 - 42) and median birth weight 3010 g (range 300 - 4850).

40|$|Summary. During the {{breeding}} seasons 1957 - 58 and 1958 - 59, {{a total of}} 280 fertilized eggs collected from Suffolk and Welsh Mountain ewes, mated to rams of their own breeds, was transferred at rates of either two or five eggs per animal to the Fallopian tubes or uterine horns of eighty Suffolk recipient ewes. Half of the recipients had been pre-treated with injections of 1500 i. u. PMS in order to induce superovula-tion. The survival and development of transferred eggs, however, {{was found to be}} unaffected either by superovulation or by the breed of eggs transferred. Overall prenatal mortality was divided into two periods (1) up to 17 or 18 days and referred to throughout as embryonic mortality or loss, and (2) 17 or 18 days to term, referred to as <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> or loss. Two peaks of embryonic mortality were observed, one occurring before and the other after attachment of embryos to the endometrium. Embryonic death accounted for almost all the prenatal mortality and the majority of the loss occurred before attachment. <b>Foetal</b> <b>mortality</b> occurring later than the 17 th or 18 th day of pregnancy was negligible. The proportion of recipients becoming pregnant was the same in the groups which received two eggs and the group which received five eggs, but the ovum-survival rate following the transfer of five eggs was sig¬ nificantly lower than that following the transfer of two eggs. However, those ewes which received five eggs and subsequently became pregnant had significantly more lambs at term and normal embryos at autopsy than those which received only two eggs. Of all the eggs transferred to the uteri and tubes, 49 % and 29 %, respectively, developed into normal embryos or lambs. The smaller survival rate following tubai transfers was due to a higher rate of embryonic mortality...|$|R

We investigated impact of distance to closest maternity unit on perinatal mortality. Methods: Data from the French National Vital Statistics Registry were used to construct <b>foetal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality</b> rates over 2001 - 08 by distance from mother's municipality of residence and the closest municipality with a maternity unit. Data from French neonatal mortality certificates were used to compute neonatal death rates after out-of-hospital birth. Relative risks by distance were estimated, adjusting for individual and municipal-level characteristics. Results: Seven percent of births occurred to women residing at ≥ 30 km from a maternity unit and 1 % at ≥ 45 km. <b>Foetal</b> and neonatal <b>mortality</b> rates were highest for women living at < 5 km from a maternity unit. For <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> rates increased at ≥ 45 km compared with 5 - 45 km. In adjusted models, long distance to a maternity unit had no impact on overall mortality but women living closer to a maternity unit had {{a higher risk of}} neonatal mortality. Neonatal deaths associated with out-of-hospital birth were rare but more frequent at longer distances. At the municipal-level, higher percentages of unemployment and foreign-born residents were associated with increased mortality.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{well-known}} effect of tobacco on embryo growth retardation, of the higher perinatal mortality of the offspring of smoking mothers, and of the dependence of perinatal mortality risk on small birth weight, it has consistently been found that small infants of smoking mothers have lower mortality rates than small infants of non-smoking mothers. This problem was studied on the perinatal database of a hospital, using adverse outcomes (death or Apgar score < 7 at the 10 th minute of life) as endpoints rather than perinatal or <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality.</b> A stochastic model constructed to account for cause-effect relations demonstrated that tobacco influences weight and mortality by independent pathways. Furthermore, this model {{shed some light on}} the non-tobacco determinants of small birth weight and neonatal morbidity. The method undertaken, based on the use of latent variables, had the advantage of analysing the prevalence, consequences and interactions of some risk factors without identifying them...|$|R
40|$|The clinical, biochemical, and {{pathological}} {{features of}} an unusual expression of infantile spongy degeneration of the central white matter are presented with emphasis on neuropathological observations. The topographical distribution of the spongy change along with the observed defect in myelination were such as to suggest an arrest in development of the white matter in <b>late</b> <b>foetal</b> life. Of additional interest, in the present case, is the observed deposition of glycogen in the brain, heart, and liver along with a markedly fatty liver. Our findings are compared with those in other cases of so-called spongy degeneration, {{as well as with}} certain of the aminoacidurias and, as a consequence, we wish to suggest that the basic pathogenetic factor probably lies in a disturbance of the biochemical energy supply system rather than in a disorder of myelin lipid metabolism per se...|$|R
40|$|The {{lipoprotein}} lipase {{activity of the}} lung, skeletal muscle, heart muscle and brown adipose tissue of the rat was studied {{during the period from}} <b>late</b> <b>foetal</b> to adult life. The enzyme activity in all four tissues emerged substantially during the first 24 th after birth. Subsequently, heart and lung enzyme activity remained relatively constant per unit wet weight of tissue. The enzyme activity present in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle was elevated per unit weight of tissue during suckling compared with other periods of life. Delivery of near-term foetuses stimulated the emergence of enzyme activity in all four tissues with the same time course as that evoked by normal delivery. The significance of the presence of the enzyme in the tissues and the activity changes which occurred during development are discussed in relation to possible mechanisms of control...|$|R
40|$|In mammalians {{following}} fertilization and {{fusion of}} gametes, the zygote undergoes subsequent mitotic divisions, which determines {{the formation of}} the blastomeres. These phenomena occur initially into the oviduct and subsequently into the uterus. Usually, embryos reach the uterus at morula stage and undergone continue divisions until blastocyst formation. The rupture of zona pellucida represents the event for a new stage of the embryo. In this moment the hatched blastocyst survival is strictly dependent by the uterine environment and the conceptus exposes the surface of trophectoderm directly to the uterus. Starting from this moment, the cross-talk between mother and embryo is fundamental in order to guarantee embryonic development and attachment. Several factors can affect these stages in all mammalian species, leading to the phenomenon of embryonic and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality.</b> Buffalo species, because of its reproductive characteristics, can show a high incidence of embryonic mortality, in particular in some periods of the year. In this review the main factors involved in these phenomena in buffalo will be analysed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has been}} {{undertaken}} since 1986 in the Ghibe valley, southwest Ethiopia, monitoring approximately 840 village East African Zebu cattle monthly {{to assess the}} effects of trypanosomiasis on productivity. The average monthly trypanosome prevalence between 1986 and 1989 was about 30 percent. Many cases of parasitaemia that were treated were found parasitaemic again the following month, pointing to the possible existence of drug resistance; this was confirmed in the laboratory with all trypanosome isolates tested showing resistance to diminazene aceturate. With such {{a high incidence of}} drug resistance, a higher monthly trypanosome prevalence might have been expected in the village cattle. Thus, whilst treatment was not eliminating infections, it may have helped to limit the trypanosome growth and allowed the cattle to maintain reasonable levels of health and productivity. This was confirmed by statistical analysis of the productivity data. Although there were statistically significant effect of trypanosomiasis appeared to be on calf and <b>foetal</b> <b>mortality,</b> particularly during periods of very high tsetse challenge or increased trypanosomiasis risk brought about by other stress-related factors...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the main}} cause of mortality and morbidity in Western countries, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Genetic polymorphisms, once thought to represent a major determinant of cardiovascular risk, individually and collectively, only explain a tiny fraction of phenotypic variation and disease risk in humans. It is now clear that non-genetic factors, i. e., factors that modify gene activity without changing the DNA sequence and that are sensitive to the environment can cause important alterations of the cardiovascular phenotype in experimental animal models and humans. Here, we will review recent studies demonstrating that distinct pathological events during the perinatal (transient perinatal hypoxemia), <b>late</b> <b>foetal</b> (preeclampsia), and early embryonic (assisted reproductive technologies) periods induce profound alterations of the cardiovascular phenotype in humans and experimental animals. Moreover, we will provide evidence that epigenetic modifications are contributing importantly to this problem and are conferring the potential for its transmission to subsequent generations...|$|R
