5000|$|Since May 2009, 'N' series {{passports}} issued as a biometric or ePassport. The passport {{was black}} instead {{of blue and}} had a slight font and case change to the word 'Passport' on the front cover. The front cover printing was in silver. Additional fraud counter-measures were included including a 'Ghost Image' and 'Retro-Reflective Floating Image' on the <b>laminated</b> <b>page.</b> Each page featured images of Australia printed throughout the document making every visa page unique {{and more difficult to}} reproduce.|$|E

40|$|This handy pocket sized book equips {{the student}} with the {{essential}} information that they will need whilst on placement. It has a clinical/practical focus and is easily accessible. The book contains important and common terminology such as standard abbreviations, basic drug calculations and standard CPR procedures. The book also has wipe-down <b>laminated</b> <b>pages</b> making it ideal for use on a ward. " "This text is recommended for nursing students starting their placements at year 1 and is also extremely useful for nursing students at year 2 and 3 {{as well as for}} practicing nurses may also want a copy to refer to during their work.

2500|$|When Frank Miller {{expanded}} most of Daredevil's abilities, {{he attempted}} to make them [...] "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with Superman", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, {{the first thing he}} did to the character was [...] "revamp" [...] his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the [...] "proximity" [...] sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his fingers over the letters on a <b>page</b> though <b>laminated</b> <b>pages</b> prevent him from reading the ink. Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing to serve as a polygraph for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. This ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have an artificial pacemaker.|$|R
5000|$|The {{preservation}} of these key comics is necessary {{due to the}} acidic pulp paper that the books were printed on during the first fifty years of this art : “Comic books were not designed to last for generations, under normal storage conditions”. [...] The project's method of preservation is to remove the pages from the comic books, find any missing pieces and duplicate them if necessary and <b>laminate</b> each <b>page.</b> Once <b>laminated,</b> the comics are encapsulated in binders that open for reading and then close up to protect their contents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front cover}} of the {{temporary}} passport is clearly marked with the white band on {{the lower half of}} the cover to distinguish it from a regular passport. The temporary passport only has 16 pages as opposed to Pass 03, which has 32 pages. There is no polycarbonate card, a <b>laminated</b> security paper <b>page</b> with the personal information of the bearer. The temporary passport matches the international security standards for these types of documents and is machine readable.|$|R
5000|$|Context is the {{physical}} and temporal circumstances in which readers use communication—for example: at their office desks, in a manufacturing plant, during the slow summer months, or {{in the middle of}} a company crisis. [...] Understanding the context of a situation tells the technical writer how readers use the communication. This knowledge significantly influences how the writer formats the communication. For example, if the document is a quick troubleshooting guide to the controls on a small watercraft, the writer may have the <b>pages</b> <b>laminated</b> to increase usable life.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the Pb-based magnetoelectric laminates (MELs), we find in the BaTiO 3 and NiFe 2 O 4 laminates (number of layers n = 5 - 25) that the longitudinal magnetoelectric (ME) voltage coefficient Alpha E 33 becomes {{much larger than the}} transverse one due to preferential alignment of magnetic moments along the NiFe 2 O 4 plane. Moreover, upon decreasing each layer thickness down to 15 um, we realize enhanced Alpha E 33 up to 18 mV/ (cm Oe) and systematic increase of the ME sensitivity in proportion to n to achieve the largest in the Pb-free MELs (400 * 10 ^- 6 V/Oe), thereby providing pathways for tailoring ME coupling in mass-produced, environment friendly <b>laminates.</b> Comment: 16 <b>pages,</b> 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Transforming {{the future}} of repair and {{retrofit}} with FRP Twenty years ago, I presented {{the findings of a}} study on strengthening concrete beams with external bonding of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>laminates</b> in the <b>pages</b> of Concrete International. 1 In the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, I proposed an extension of my earlier research to retrofit deficient bridge piers by lateral confinement with FRP. 2 What appeared to be unusual approaches at the time have since become mainstream techniques for the repair and retrofit of structures worldwide. The high tensile strength, light weight, durability, and versatility of FRPs have made them the material of choice for many repair and rehabilitation projects. To date, numerous bridges, buildings, pipelines, and other structures have been retrofitted with these product...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hypertension and pre-hypertension in {{children}} and adolescents are frequently missed despite current screening recommendations and the potential benefit for early diagnosis and intervention. Difficulty in interpretation of office blood pressure readings {{in children}} has been partially blamed for the significant under-diagnosis of childhood hypertension. The objective of our group was to develop and evaluate a simple tool designed to assist primary health care physicians to interpret office blood pressure readings {{in children and}} adolescents. Methods: A multi-disciplinary advisory group in our institution undertook the development of a diagnostic tool based on currently accepted gold standard parameters. Input from Family Physicians and Pediatricians was used in the design process. The tool was then distributed among Family Physicians in our catchment area and evaluated with a post-distribution survey. Results: A <b>laminated</b> one <b>page</b> summary of pediatric blood pressure parameters and initial approach to pediatric hypertension was created and distributed. Feedback from primary care physicians was mostly positive and supportive of this initiative. Conclusions: Innovating and simplifying the screening process for hypertension and pre-hypertension in childhood may promote early detection and intervention however the effect of such initiatives on the rate of diagnosis of pediatric hypertension will need to be tested prospectively by appropriately designed studies...|$|R
40|$|We {{determine}} the effective {{behavior of a}} class of composites in finite-strain crystal plasticity, based on a variational model for materials made of fine parallel layers of two types. While one component is completely rigid {{in the sense that}} it admits only local rotations, the other one is softer featuring a single active slip system with linear self-hardening. As a main result, we obtain explicit homogenization formulas by means of Γ-convergence. Due to the anisotropic nature of the problem, the findings depend critically on the orientation of the slip direction relative to the layers, leading to three qualitatively different regimes that involve macroscopic shearing and blocking effects. The technical difficulties in the proofs are rooted in the intrinsic rigidity of the model, which translates into a non-standard variational problem constraint by non-convex partial differential inclusions. The proof of the lower bound requires a careful analysis of the admissible microstructures and a new asymptotic rigidity result, whereas the construction of recovery sequences relies on nested <b>laminates.</b> Comment: 25 <b>pages,</b> 2 figure...|$|R
