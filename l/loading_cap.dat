Therefore, efforts {{have been made to}} improve the properties and biological performance of solid PMMA. A porous structure would seem to be advantageous for anchoring purposes. This work studied the bulk physicochemical, mechanical and interconnectivity properties of porous PMMA cements loaded with various amounts of calcium phosphate (CaP). As a measure of bioactivity, changes of PMMA cements under simulated physiological conditions were studied in a calcium phosphate solution for 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), micro-computed tomography (mu-CT) and mechanical compression tests were performed to characterize the morphology, crystallographic and chemical composition, interconnectivity and mechanical properties, respectively. SEM allowed observing the result of <b>loading</b> <b>CaP</b> into the porous PMMA, which was corroborated by XRD, FTIR and mu-CT. No interference of the CaP with the PMMA was detected. mu-CT described similar interconnectivity and pore distribution for all CaP percentages. Mechanical properties were not significantly altered by the CaP percentages or the immersion time. Hence, porous PMMA was effectively loaded with CaP, which provided the material with properties for potential osteoconductivity...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses an {{economic}} catchment model to assess changes in land use, enterprise distribution, {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and nutrient loading levels {{from a series of}} policies that introduce carbon prices or nutrient reduction caps on land-based production in the Hurunui Catchment in Canterbury, New Zealand. At $ 20 /tCO 2 e, net revenue for the catchment is reduced by 7 % from baseline levels while GHGs are reduced by 3 %. At $ 40 / tCO 2 e, net revenue is reduced by 15 % while GHGs are reduced by 21 %. Nitrogen and phosphorous loading levels within the catchment were also reduced when landowners face a carbon price, thus providing other benefits to the environment. Additional scenarios in this paper assess the impacts from developing a large-scale irrigation project within the catchment. Results show that while adding irrigation can improve farm output and revenue, it also results in dramatically higher GHG emissions and nutrient loads. Placing a carbon price on land-based activities diminishes some of these pollutants, but not {{at the same rate as}} when the policy what enacted on the baseline irrigation levels. Finally, we investigate the impacts of imposing a nutrient <b>loading</b> <b>cap</b> on farm activities instead of a carbon price and find that if landowners had greater access to irrigation but were constrained to hold the nutrient loads at baseline levels, revenue could increase by 6 % over the baseline while GHG emissions could be reduced by 5 %. Our findings suggest that while there is a potentially a strong trade-off between water quantity and water quality in the Hurunui Catchment, imposing the right policy levers could reduce some of the environmental impacts from an increase in land-use intensity without placing a large economic or regulatory burden on its landowners.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a three-layer model and elastic solutions to capture nonlinear response of rigid, passive piles in sliding soil. Elastic solutions are obtained for an equivalent force {{per unit length}} ps of the soil movement. They are repeated {{for a series of}} linearly increasing ps (with depth) to yield the nonlinear response. The parameters underpinning the model are determined against pertinent numerical solutions and model tests on passive free-head and capped piles. The solutions are presented in non-dimensional charts and elaborated through three examples. The study reveals the following: On-pile pressure in rotationally restrained, sliding layer reduces by a factor α, which resembles the p-multiplier for a laterally <b>loaded,</b> <b>capped</b> pile, but for its increase with vertical loading (embankment surcharge), and stiffness of underlying stiff layer: α= 0. 25 and 0. 6 for a shallow, translating and rotating piles, respectively; α= 0. 33 - 0. 5 and 0. 8 - 1. 3 for a slide overlying a stiff layer concerning a uniform and a linearly increasing pressure, respectively; and α= 0. 5 - 0. 72 for moving clay under embankment loading. Ultimate state is well defined using the ratio of passive earth pressure coefficient over that of active earth pressure. The subgrade modulus for a large soil movement may be scaled from model tests. The normalised rotational stiffness is equal to 0. 1 - 0. 15 for the capped piles, which increases the pile displacement with depth. The three-layer model solutions well predict nonlinear response of capped piles subjected to passive loading, which may be used for pertinent design...|$|R

40|$|In higher eukaryotes, the ataxia {{telangiectasia}} mutated (ATM) and ATM and Rad 3 -related (ATR) checkpoint kinases play distinct, but partially overlapping, {{roles in}} DNA damage response. Yet their interrelated function {{has not been}} defined for telomere maintenance. We discover in Drosophila that the two proteins control partially redundant pathways for telomere protection: the loss of ATM leads to the fusion of some telomeres, whereas the loss of both ATM and ATR renders all telomeres susceptible to fusion. The ATM-controlled pathway includes the Mre 11 and Nijmegen breakage syndrome complex but not the Chk 2 kinase, whereas the ATR-regulated pathway includes its partner ATR-interacting protein but not the Chk 1 kinase. This finding suggests that ATM and ATR regulate different molecular events at the telomeres compared with the sites of DNA damage. This compensatory relationship between ATM and ATR is remarkably similar to that observed in yeast {{despite the fact that}} the biochemistry of telomere elongation is completely different in the two model systems. We provide evidence suggesting that both the <b>loading</b> of telomere <b>capping</b> proteins and normal telomeric silencing requires ATM and ATR in Drosophila and propose that ATM and ATR protect telomere integrity by safeguarding chromatin architecture that favors the <b>loading</b> of telomere-elongating, <b>capping,</b> and silencing proteins...|$|R

40|$|Nutrient credit {{trading is}} a market-based policy {{currently}} proposed {{in several countries}} to mitigate nutrient pollution underpinning eutrophication and anoxic “dead zones” in coastal waters and lakes. Under nutrient credit trading programs regulated sources of nutrient pollution with high discharge compliance costs, such as wastewater treatment plants, are allowed to meet discharge restrictions by purchasing credits representing discharge reductions from other sources with low compliance costs, such as agricultural operations. The potential for cost savings is huge; also nutrient credit trading can, in theory, incentivize traditionally non-regulated sources, such as agriculture, to voluntarily adopt better nutrient management practices and thereby reduce nutrient pollution at an aggregate scale. Despite its intuitive appeal, and the successes of emissions trading markets for some atmospheric pollutants, the performance of nutrient credit trading is widely considered to be disappointing. A recent international survey by the World Resources Institute found over 50 nutrient trading programs at some early stage of development, yet very few trades had actually occurred. Many of the reasons offered by researchers for the apparent stagnation of nutrient credit trading appear {{to be due to}} learning impediments. Nutrient credit trading presents a difficult learning environment featuring multiple agents with disparate decision making criteria, complex feedback and stock-and-flow structures, and lengthy time lags between causes and effects. This research develops a system dynamics model to facilitate understanding of the dynamic complexity in nutrient credit trading systems. It is anticipated that following models developed on similar principles, and configured into appropriate user-friendly formats, may provide valuable insights to designers of these systems. The model explicitly takes into account feedback, stock-and-flow effects, time lags, and agent decision-making processes. A guiding principle in the model development was to capture the essential dynamic complexity of the nutrient trading system while striving to maximize model transparency and comprehensibility. A range of policy experiments were made with the primary objective of developing a realistic design that attains aggregate nutrient loading targets recommended by researchers. These experiments focus on settings and interactions between policy elements that include <b>loading</b> <b>caps,</b> trading ratios, exceedance penalties, investment of funds accumulated from exceedance penalty payments. Specific design recommendations are offered; however, these recommendations should not be considered definitive but exploratory in nature.
