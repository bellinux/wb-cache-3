It would have been ugly but for the deep, {{flashing}} eyes. There was tenderness and humour in them.|$|E

50|$|In 1903, {{the jewels}} were {{transferred}} to a safe, {{which was to be}} placed in the newly constructed strongroom in Dublin Castle beside the Ulster King of Arms' office. The new safe was too large for the doorway to the strongroom, and Arthur Vicars, the Ulster King of Arms, instead stored it in his office. Seven <b>latch</b> <b>keys</b> {{to the door of the}} Office of Arms were held by Vicars and his staff, and two keys to the safe containing the insignia were both in the custody of Vicars. Vicars was known to regularly get drunk on overnight duty and he once awoke to find the jewels around his neck. It is not known whether or not this was a prank or a practice for the actual theft.|$|R

50|$|In {{parallel}} with locks and <b>latches,</b> <b>key</b> charms evolved from functional key holders into exquisitely decorated personal accessories. They were passed from mothers to daughters {{as a symbolic}} reminder of the responsibility women bear for ensuring the good management of household affairs. It was customary for families to celebrate special occasions by adorning their walls with auspicious animal motifs incorporated into the design of key charms. Embroidered key charms were widely available in Chosŏn Korea, regardless of age or social class, as they did not {{require the use of}} relatively costly metals which made them affordable for everyone. Mothers often presented them to their daughters as a wedding gift. In this context, embroidered key charms were doubly meaningful since they were not only intended to serve as a decoration, but also as a talisman to expel bad spirits. Flowers, butterflies, and birds—traditional symbols of the harmony and loving union of a married couple—were embroidered on silk fabric dyed with natural materials. Some of the most frequently employed motifs in embroidered key charms were peonies and peaches. The former is a symbol for wealth and happiness, while the latter is a symbol for eternal love and longevity.|$|R

6000|$|The constable on {{the beat}} had in truth seen {{something}} of Mrs Verloc; only coming from the lighted thoroughfare {{at the other end}} of Brett Street, she had been no more to him than a flutter in the darkness. And he was not even quite sure that there had been a flutter. He had no reason to hurry up. On coming abreast of the shop he observed that it had been closed early. There was nothing very unusual in that. The men on duty had special instructions about that shop: what went on about there was not to be meddled with unless absolutely disorderly, but any observations made were to be reported. There were no observations to make; but from a sense of duty and for the peace of his conscience, owing also to that doubtful flutter of the darkness, the constable crossed the road, and tried the door. The spring <b>latch,</b> whose <b>key</b> was reposing for ever off duty in the late Mr Verloc’s waistcoat pocket, held as well as usual. While the conscientious officer was shaking the handle, Ossipon felt the cold lips of the woman stirring again creepily against his very ear: ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel means of {{describing}} local image appearances using binary strings. Binary descriptors have drawn increasing interest {{in recent years}} due to their speed and low memory footprint. A known shortcoming of these representations is their inferior performance compared to larger, histogram based descriptors such as the SIFT. Our goal is to close this performance gap while maintaining the benefits attributed to binary representations. To this end we propose the Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes descriptors, or <b>LATCH.</b> Our <b>key</b> observation is that existing binary descriptors are at an increased risk from noise and local appearance variations. This, as they compare the values of pixel pairs; changes to either of the pixels can easily lead to changes in descriptor values, hence damaging its performance. In order to provide more robustness, we instead propose a novel means of comparing pixel patches. This ostensibly small change, requires a substantial redesign of the descriptors themselves {{and how they are}} produced. Our resulting LATCH representation is rigorously compared to state-of-the-art binary descriptors and shown to provide far better performance for similar computation and space requirements...|$|R
40|$|The Spartan Release Engage Mechanism (REM) is {{a system}} {{designed}} to restrain the Spartan spacecraft during Space Transportation System (STS) launch and landing. The mechanism is designed to allow deployment and retrieval of the Spartan free flyer spacecraft from the shuttle payload bay. Because current Spartan spacecraft payloads are much heavier than payloads intended for the original REM, an extensive redesign, analysis, and test program was necessary. Also, increased emphasis on safety in the post-Challenger era prompted a reevaluation of possible failures. Much of the design effort focused on improving the <b>latch</b> mechanism gearbox. <b>Key</b> concerns were effective gear lubrication, thermal gradients at the gearbox mounts, operation at thermal extremes, and gear-train failure contingencies. Increased concern for reliability led {{to the design of}} an Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) backup latch system...|$|R

50|$|It {{appears that}} a young married lady, Mrs. Wallaby, living at Croydon, and always in great fear of burglars, is left alone meditating upon a little {{adventure}} she has had at Victoria Station. She had been to an entertainment, and from excitement or fatigue had felt faint, when a benevolent young gentleman, a stranger, came to her assistance. Arriving safely at Croydon, however, she is rather startled at receiving a visitor, no other than the gentleman who had so kindly rendered assistance. The stranger, after an apology for troubling her so late, ultimately explains that he cannot get into his rooms, and is locked out, the fact being that in his desire to hasten her recovery he had put his <b>latch</b> <b>key</b> down the lady's back. With many apologies the gentlemen requests Mrs. Wallaby to shake herself a little in order to discover if she is carrying the <b>latch</b> <b>key</b> about her, and with some confusion the lady consents, and after much comic gesticulation the key eventually falls on the floor. Meanwhile, poor Mr. Fraser, the benevolent owner of the key, hears the shriek and roar of the last train to London, and the rain is coming down in torrents. What is to be done? Mrs. Wallaby has not the heart to turn him out, and so, anticipating her husband's speedy return, she supplies the stranger with brandy and water, cigars, her husband's slippers and dressing gown, and leaves him. Mr. Fraser accordingly makes himself comfortable, takes off his wet coat, and wetter boots, mixes a stiff glass of brandy and water, and waxes enthusiastic respecting the charming young wife. He, however, first hangs up his dripping clothes in the hall, but is speedily startled at hearing footsteps, and presumes {{this must be the}} burglar whose appearance Mrs. Wallaby so much dreaded. It is no burglar, but her own husband, who, discovering a man in the house is terribly alarmed. Both the men are desperately afraid of each other, and the situation serves for the introduction of an amusing duet. In the height of their excitement a policeman enters. He has been waiting for an interview with the cook, and wonders that the siren of the kitchen is so long in coming to meet him. Curious to ascertain the cause of the delay, he comes cautiously into the house through the French windows opening on the garden, and immediately pounces upon the two men. Mr. Fraser, the owner of the <b>latch</b> <b>key,</b> at once gives the husband in charge; but Mrs. Wallaby enters, and explains, and all ends happily, the stranger being invited to spend the remainder of the night with them.|$|E
50|$|An {{international}} co-production between Canada’s Muse Entertainment, Summit Crescent Productions and France’s Breakout Films, Family Biz centres {{around three}} <b>latch</b> <b>key</b> kids, Eli (16), Avalon (15) and Ronnie (11), {{who have the}} run of the Keller house. Their corporate parents are too busy at work and teen insanity rules! That is until their Dad, Dave Keller, gets fired and decides to work from home in the Keller attic. To feel useful, Dave launches the Keller Family Corp. and sets about “reinvolving” himself in the lives of his teenage kids, much to his offspring’s total embarrassment. Whenever a problem occurs, Dad looks to his years of business knowledge to find the solution, whether it is getting to know his kids through in-depth marketing surveys or outsourcing all their phone messages to India.

With the exception of Mt.
