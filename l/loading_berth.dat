The present study was worked out on soil samples from steel <b>loading</b> <b>berths,</b> the metal content being determined using the FAAS technique. This type of samples is very rich in Fe, Si and Al, but it also contains heavy metals in low concentrations (Cr and Ni). Because of the presence of Si in the samples, the use of HF at digestion is compulsory; it proved to be benefic for the digestion of soil samples, in general, since the metal content was found higher in samples treated with HNO 3 +HCl+HF, comparing with those treated with HNO 3 +HCl in the standard method, due to the complete digestion of the sample. The heavy metals Ni and Cr were determined at concentrations close to the detection limit. Making-up a matrix with 0. 2 g/L Fe and 0. 02 g/L Si and 0. 002 g/L Al for the standard curves of minor elements (Ni, Cr), the influence of major elements (Fe, Si, Al) on the analysis result was investigated. Also, the {{determination of}} minor elements Cr and Ni was checked by addition of 0. 2 g/L of each metal to the samples, so that the concentration would be found in the middle concentration range of standard curves.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2011 This report {{provides}} {{design guidelines}} and recommendations for side-berthing loads on ferry landing structures. <b>Berthing</b> <b>loads</b> on ferry <b>berthing</b> structures are not well understood {{due to a lack}} of information and research for ferry class vessels. The load criteria for the design of ferry berthing structures are thus often based on a number of assumptions, often leading to uneconomical or unreliable structures. The Alaska Department of Transportation (AKDOT&PF) recognizes the need for an improved information base on <b>berthing</b> <b>loads</b> from ferry class vessels, for the design and operation of future facilities within the Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS). This study involves a one year empirical investigation into side-berthing loads at the Auke Bay ferry landing located in Juneau, Alaska. Measurements of fender displacement, approach velocity, and pile strain were used to determine <b>berthing</b> <b>loads</b> from scheduled berthings from four different vessels. Measured parameters were analyzed statistically, and used to establish distributions and design recommendations for berthing energy, force, velocity, and berthing coefficient based on reliability theory. This study provides an assessment of load criteria currently used by the AK DOT&PF Marine Department, as well as design load recommendations for both service and ultimate side-berthing loads from ferry class vessels...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{demand for}} {{electricity}} in India is particularly acute {{in the southwestern}} region. Consequently, to meet this demand the Government of India has initiated {{plans to build a}} thermal power plant near the coastal city of Kayamkulam. Ultimately, in the year 2005, this plant is to be capable of producing 1, 936 mega-Watts of electricity. To achieve this output, 8 million tons of domestic coal, originating from the Talcher Coal Fields in the northeast of the country, must be delivered to Kayamkulam. Previous preliminary feasibility studies, which compared 2, 000 km overland transport of coal by rail or slurry pipeline to transport of coal by coastal vessel, showed the latter method to be the most advantageous. Specifically, this will involve moving the coal by rail from the inland Talcher Coal Fields to the existing Port of Paradip on the northeastern coast. Here, it can be loaded into colliers to be transported south, around Sri Lanka and the Indian Cape Comorin, to a new unprotected offshore terminal along the southwestern coast near Kayamkulam. Objective Given the fact that the coastal transport of coal is more attractive than overland transport, this study had the objective to: "design, on the basis of operational and financial criteria, the optimum coastal transport chain configuration by which to move the ultimately required amount of coal from the Talcher Coal Fields to the new thermal power plant at Kayamkulam". Methodology To design the optimum coastal coal transport chain a "Five Task" methodology was developed and adopted. Tasks 1 and 2 comprised the identification of, and research on, the operational and financial design factors, respectively. In this regard, operational design factors are those which, collectively, determine the coal transporting capacity of the chain. They may be, for example, the size and number of colliers procured; or the downtime at a port due to inclement weather or the malfunction of equipment. Financial design factors are those which, together, determine the annual cost of a particular configuration. For instance, the length of the berths (which is dependent upon the size of the colliers) determines their annual costs. Task 3 constituted the conceptualization and programming of a computer simulation model. This mathematical tool was used to identify those transport chain configurations that would be operationally feasible, i. e. that could annually deliver the required 8 million tons to Kayamkulam. To program this computer simulation model use was made of the language PERSONAL PROSIM. The name CoalTran (Coal Transport) was aptly given to this model. Task 4 consisted of the application of the model CoalTran. In executing this task, a multitude of simulation runs were performed. However, before doing so a detailed experimental design was developed which ensured that the experimental simulation process would be as efficient as possible. In particular, the predominant design factors varied during the simulation runs were the (un) loading capacity per collier berth as well as the (un) loading capacity of the unit train berths. Finally, Task 5 involved calculating the annual costs of each of the operationally feasible transport chain configurations. Having done this, the configuration which displayed both satisfactory operational characteristics and low annual costs could be brought forward as the optimum from an operational and financial perspective. Conclusions In broad terms, the optimum coastal coal transport chain was determined to comprise the following: (1) two 5, 000 tph train <b>loading</b> <b>berths</b> at Talcher; (2) a fleet of 14 diesel powered unit trains, each composed of bottom dump wagons and capable of transporting 6, 750 tons; (3) two 5, 000 tph train unloading berths at Paradip; (4) a four pile, four stacker/reclaimer, stockyard layout at Paradip with a storage capacity of 1, 900, 000 tons; (5) two 5, 000 tph collier <b>loading</b> <b>berths</b> at Paradip; (6) a fleet of four 65, 000 DWT conventional colliers; (7) one 3, 000 tph collier unloading berth at Kayamkulam; (8) a three pile, two stacker/reclaimer, stockyard layout at Kayamkulam with a storage capacity of 600, 000 tons.

In sequencing for a single ship, a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is proposed, and a heuristic approach based on the model is developed that produces good solutions. The model is then reformulated as a generalized set covering problem and solved exactly by branch and price (B&P). For multiship sequencing, the yard congestion constraints are relaxed in the spirit of Lagrangian relaxation, so that the problem decomposes by vessel into smaller subproblems solved by B&P. An efficient primal heuristic is also designed. Computational experiments reveal that large-scale problems can be solved in a reasonable computational time...|$|R
5000|$|Midtown Walmart is a {{controversial}} proposal by Walmart {{to build a}} 203000 sq ft supercenter location on a 4.6 acre site in the planned sub-district of Midtown {{in the city of}} Miami, Florida, USA. The initial proposal did not meet local regulations and was rejected in February 2013, but was redesigned by Gensler and approved by the city commission in August 2013. It has faced public and political opposition from area residents, business owners, and community activists even as it has been adapted to meet strict zoning regulations that resulted in the design differing greatly from the typical layout, such as utilizing second story roof parking versus a surface lot and street liner retail instead of a blank wall perimeter. The original 2012 plan included 10500 sq ft of retail and about 550 parking spaces on two levels above the 184000 sq ft store. This more urban footprint is similar to what Walmart did to build a location in Santurce, (downtown) San Juan, Puerto Rico, known as [...] "Plaza 18", as well as Washington, D.C. where the city's first Walmart is a true mixed-use development, with third party retail as well as 300 apartments above the store. Purchased in January 2014 for US$8.2 million, the currently vacant site sits at the southern tip of Midtown between North Miami Avenue and Midtown Boulevard from Northeast 29th and 31st Streets, between the burgeoning neighborhoods of Wynwood and Edgewater. It would be the first traditional Walmart location within the actual City of Miami limits, although there are several locations just outside city limits in Doral, Hialeah, Gladeview, North Miami Beach, and Westchester, as well as a [...] "Neighborhood Market" [...] in the western fringes of the city. In January 2016, Fort Lauderdale opened its first Walmart. After {{more than a year of}} litigation, Walmart won a court battle in August 2015. Specifically the litigation targeted the proposed zoning variance for two extra <b>loading</b> <b>berths</b> and traffic congestion caused by the development. Ridership at the Northside Metrorail station increased significantly after the adjacent Gladeview location opened. Other criticism is due to the fabric of the neighborhood amid an urban revival that included small, locally owned businesses and warehouse renovation versus new construction.

40|$|The {{potential}} for marine fisheries {{resources in the}} EEZ around the Andaman and Nicobar Inlands has been estimated and marine fishing at present is confined to the artisanal fisheries limited to the very narrow belt of the coastal areas which {{can be reached by}} the indigenous fishing crafts operating the traditional fishing gears. The rich fisheries wealth around these islands have to be exploited by suitable craft and gear specially oriented for the pelagic fisheries resources. After conducting research work on assessment of fisheries resources of the area, it is felt that there is great scope for developing sea farming in the coastal areas of Andaman and Nicobar islands for finfish and molluscs. Examination of fish catches at a number of places on the islands and those from the confiscated vessels indicated that fish may be dying due to old age. This is a clear indication of under exploitation of the resources. Development of offshore and oceanic fisheries needs development of necessary infrastructural facilities on the islands for <b>berthing,</b> <b>loading,</b> unloading, repair, dry docking, bunkering and storage. The National Marine Park area harbours a number of varieties of corals, ornamental fishes, live-bait and other invertebrates. The potential of various marine ornamental fishes has to be assessed for rational exploitation in due course...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of liquids being {{exchanged}} between a ship and the Standard Oil Company oil loading wharf, ca. 1920. In the foreground to the right, several steel pipes and valves sitting atop {{a group of}} three horizontal pipes can be seen. These pipes and valves stretch down the edge of the wharf. At center, a small wooden platform can be seen connecting the wharf to the deck of the ship on the right. A few steel pipes and valves can also be seen {{on the deck of the}} ship. A large rubber hose is visible connecting a pipe on the ship's deck to a pipe on the wharf's edge. Several rectangular compartments decorate the deck of the ship. In the far background, a triple-layered structure showing several doors can be seen rising from the upper deck of the ship. On the wooden wharf to the left, an empty bows and part of a metal beam are visible at center. In the far background, a wooden pile sits adjacent to a large structure. Further to the left, a line of utility poles running along a metal fence can be seen. A small sign near the fence above a small structure reads: "Firehose 150 ft. Single Wrap". The Standard Oil Company oil <b>loading</b> wharf included <b>Berths</b> 97 and 98...|$|R
40|$|Piles {{supporting}} marine {{structures such as}} jetties, relieving platforms, quay {{walls and}} fixed offshore structures are subjected to lateral <b>loads</b> due to <b>berthing</b> and mooring forces, wind, waves, storm surges and current forces. This paper presents some factors that affect the design of pile groups supporting marine structures founded in cohesionless soils. Some main aspects {{that should be considered}} in the pile group design are addressed such as pile batter angle, pile group arrangement, pile spacing, pile slenderness ratio and magnitude of lateral static loading. Numerical analyses were conducted to investigate these design aspects with and without impact of scour. Different scour depths were considered to cover the possible root causes of scour around pile groups such as waves, current and ship propeller jets. The study revealed that scour has greater impact on lateral loading of pile groups compared to its impact on single piles. Pile groups with side-by-side arrangement exposed to scour are more critical than single piles and piles groups with tandem arrangement due to the combined effect of scour and pile-soil-pile interaction. It is also concluded that scour protection is not always required. More attention and considerations should be given to scour protection around piles especially if the piles are closely spaced, arranged side-by-side and if slenderness ratio is less than 12. 5...|$|R
