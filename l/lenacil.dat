40|$|The {{action of}} the {{herbicide}} <b>lenacil</b> on spinach cultivation was evaluated, with the overall object of reaching a compromise between an advanced agronomic technique and environmental protection. A spinach crop was treated at pre-emergence with Venzar® at the dosage of 1. 0 kg ha- 1 and the residues were analyzed in spinach plants collected 30 and 60 days later. One month after <b>lenacil</b> spraying, the concentration of residues in spinach leaves was 0. 102 ppm, whereas {{two months after the}} treatment the amount of residues was drastically reduced to 0. 009 ppm. The efficacy of <b>lenacil</b> in weed control, measured in 60 % reduction of weed density, was assessed in comparison to untreated plots...|$|E

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} experiments with undisturbed soil columns were performed {{for assessing the}} mobility and persistence of chloridazon and <b>lenacil</b> in a clayey soil in the marshes of Lebrija, southwest Spain. In the laboratory we tried to evaluate the herbicides fate when applied with doses greater than normal, as it happens by overlap when spraying the herbicides. Thus, the herbicides doses in the field experiments {{were similar to those}} applied by the growers in the area, while the doses applied to the soil columns were four times greater. Apart from that, in the field experiments the herbicides were incorporated into the soil just after the application, by sprinkling irrigation, as it is usually made by the growers. Sometimes, however, there is a delay in irrigating after herbicide application, which may favour adsorption by the soil. To evaluate how this can influence the fate of the studied herbicides in the soil, in the soil columns water was applied for the first time one week after applying the herbicides. Both herbicides showed a low mobility, being the amounts of residues found in the top 0. 05 m of soil several times greater than deeper in the soil. Negligible amounts of chloridazon were found at about 4 weeks after application, both in the field and in the soil columns. <b>Lenacil</b> showed a greater persistence, taking about 7 weeks after application for the herbicide to dissipate. The half-life values calculated from the field samples were 11 d for chloridazon and 16 d for <b>lenacil.</b> Calculations from the data of the soil column samples yielded half-life values of 4 d for chloridazon and 14 d for <b>lenacil.</b> The air temperature recorded in the laboratory during the experiments (18 ± 2 oC) was greater than in the field (average maximim temperature = 17. 2 oC; average minimum temperature = 8. 7 oC; minimum temperature = 1. 5 oC), which may explain the quicker dissipation of the herbicides in the soil columns. Also the higher herbicide concentration in column experiments could to have enhanced biodegradation process. For the studied conditions, neither chloridazon nor <b>lenacil</b> represent a serious risk of groundwater contamination. The values of the coefficient of variation of the herbicide residues in soil samples from the columns were similar to those from the field, suggesting that the technique for herbicide application in the soil columns should be improved to decrease variability.

40|$|The {{conclusions}} of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) following the peer review of an initial risk assessment {{carried out by the}} competent authority of the rapporteur Member State Belgium, relating to the pesticide active substance <b>lenacil</b> are reported. The context of the peer review was that requested by the European Commission following the submission and evaluation of confirmatory environmental fate and behaviour data and an associated argumentation on the potential for effects / relevance of possible groundwater metabolites. The conclusions were reached {{on the basis of the}} evaluation of the representative uses of <b>lenacil</b> as a herbicide on sugar beet and fodder beet for the control of grass and broad-leaved weeds. The reliable endpoints concluded as being appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment, derived from the available studies and literature in the dossier peer reviewed, are presented. The concern was identified, that the assessment of the relevance of potential groundwater metabolites, present in the leachate of relevant lysimeter studies, could not be finalised with the available information...|$|E

40|$|Four {{series of}} new pyrazoles, namely, 5 4 -carboxypyrazolo- 3 -tert-butylcarboxamide and 6 4 -carboxypyrazolo- 3 -cyclopropylcarboxamide {{derivatives}} and 10 pyrazolo[3, 4 -d][1, 3]thiazine- 4 -one and 9 pyrazolo[3, 4 -d][1, 3]thiazine- 4 -thione derivatives, were synthesized and screened as potential inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport. The structures were confirmed by 1 H NMR, elemental, and IR analyses. Their biological activity was evaluated in vitro {{as the ability}} to interfere with the light-driven reduction of ferricyanide by isolated spinach chloroplasts. Only a few compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory properties in the micromolar range, comparable to those of commercial herbicides sharing the same target, such as diuron, <b>lenacil,</b> and hexazinone. Nevertheless, most of the remaining molecules exerted a remarkable inhibition in the millimolar range. Combined with previous results on 6 pyrazolo[1, 5 -a][1, 3, 5]triazine- 2, 4 -dione and 4 pyrazolo[1, 5 -c][1, 3, 5]thiadiazine- 2 -one derivatives, these data allowed a comprehensive analysis of structure-activity relationship. Molecular modeling studies were undertaken to rationalize the structural determinants of activity in terms of shape, size, and molecular fields. Results suggested that the inhibitory potential of these compounds is associated mainly with their electrostatic properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the FOCUS version of the MACRO model (4. 3) in simulating the fate and mobility of two herbicides (chloridazon and <b>lenacil)</b> in a clay soil cropped with sugar beet was {{compared with that of}} the latest version 5. 0. In addition to field experiments, laboratory experiments-with undisturbed soil columns were carried out to evaluate tracer transport and the fate and mobility of the two herbicides. Additional laboratory erperiments were carried out to establish the degradation and sorption properties of the herbicides. The measured profiles of soil water and herbicide contents were compared with the values simulated by the two versions of tre model, after calibrating the most sensitive parameters with a sequential uncertainty domain parameter fitting procedure (SUFI). The experiments showed little indication of macropore flow. This was attributed to the fine tilth in the seedbed produced by tillage. Both model versions gave reasonably good predictions', but the estimated values of some parameters were quite different. This was attributed to small differences between the models in process descriptions (e. g. soil hydraulic functions) and numerical solution methods, combined with the effects of subjective choices made during an inverse parameter optimisation procedure that was insufficiently constrained by data.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the time of occurrence of the emergence, budding, fruiting and seed shedding stages, as well as the degree of advancement of the white goosefoot fruiting and diaspores shedding stages in fodder beet, spring wheat and faba bean crops under mechanical and chemical weed control. Phenological observations were conducted in the years 2000 - 2002 at 10 -day intervals, starting from the day of crop sowing on alluvial soil made of light loam. Chemically weed controlled objects were treated with herbicides: fodder beet - <b>lenacil</b> 80 %; spring wheat - MCPA 30 % + dicamba 4 %; faba bean - linuron 50 %. It was proven that the times of occurrence and the scale of the studied phenological stages of white goosefoot depended on the crop species, the in-crop weed control method and the pattern of weather conditions in the study years. White goosefoot had the most favourable conditions of growth in the fodder beet crop. The herbicides in the fodder beet and faba bean crops delayed the emergence and the time of occurrence of successive white goosefoot growth stages. These agents also decreased the degree of diaspores shedding by the weed species studied. The most white goosefoot specimens shed fruits on the mechanically weed controlled plots. The diaspores dissemination was promoted by a warm and moist growing season...|$|E
40|$|The Clearfield® {{production}} system for winter oilseed rape is now registered in France and a introduction for Germany is planned. In this {{production system}}, imidazolinone herbicides are used. These herbicides {{belong to the}} same mode of action (HRAC group B) as the active ingredient triflusulfuron-methyl in the herbicide Debut®. Therefore, a reduced efficacy of this active ingredient for the control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape is expected. Today non-Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape in sugar beets is effectively controlled with triflusufuronmethyl. Due to the fact that oilseed rape and sugar beet are increasingly cultivated in the same crop rotation, Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape could be expected in future sugar beet crop rotations. To determine the performance of different herbicide treatments for a sufficient control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape in sugar beet, in 2010 and 2011 14 field-trials were conducted in four countries, Germany, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. These trials had been set up in a two way split-plot design with non-Clearfield®-rape and Clearfield® oilseed rape. The effects of ten treatments with different herbicides and application dates were tested. The results of both years showed large differences in the herbicide efficacy among the herbicide treatments. Pre-emergence application led to insufficient results in both years on both cultivars. Applied post-emergence, the herbicide treatment with Debut® (triflusulfuron-methyl) controlled non-Clearfield® volunteer rape considerable better, than the Clearfield® volunteer rape. A combination of herbicides in addition with Venzar® (<b>Lenacil)</b> provided good control of volunteer Clearfield® oilseed rape...|$|E
40|$|On-farm biopurification {{systems were}} {{developed}} to remove pesticides from contaminated water generated at the farmyard. An important process in the system's efficiency is the sorption of pesticides to the substrates used in the biopurification systems. The composition and type of material present in the biobed are crucial for retention of chemicals. This study investigated the sorption of linuron, isoproturon, metalaxyl, isoxaben, bentazon and <b>lenacil</b> on substrates commonly used in a biopurification system, i. e. cow manure, straw, willow chopping, soil, coconut chips, garden waste compost, and peat mix. Linear, Freundlich. and Langmuir sorption isotherms were fitted to the obtained data. The best fit was obtained with the Freundlich model. More immobile pesticides (i. e. linuron and isoxaben) tended to associate with the organic substrate, while more mobile pesticides partition in the water (i. e. bentazon). According to sorption capacity, the substrates {{could be classified as}} peat mix > compost, coco chips, straw > cow manure, willow chopping > sandy loam soil. Sorption capacity was positively correlated with the organic carbon content, CaO and the cation exchange capacity. Furthermore, no significant differences in sorption could be found between technical and formulated isoproturon and bentazon, Moreover, the individual sorption coefficient K-d was additive, which means that individual sorption coefficients can be used to calculate the sorption coefficients of a mixture of substrates. What concerns the mutual interaction of pesticides it could be observed that the sorption of linuron and metalaxyl was significantly lower in combination with isoproturon and bentazon, while the latter pesticides were not influenced by the presence of linuron and metalaxyl. As guidelines, firstly, it could be stated that using the most sorbing materials such as peat mix, might significantly increase the biopurification systems efficiency. Secondly, the treatment of very mobile pesticides, such as bentazon, should be taken with care as these will easily leach through the system. Additional chemical treatment might be necessary for these type of pesticides. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
