25|$|The {{coalition}} arose out {{of protests}} against H.R. 4437, a <b>legislative</b> <b>proposal</b> {{that was passed}} by the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2005, by a vote of 239 to 182, only to die in the United States Senate by not being brought to the floor before the 109th Congress ended.

It also called for the construction of new border security fences along portions of the 2,000-mile United States–Mexico border.

The March 25, 2006, protests were noted for their peaceful nature, despite the controversy surrounding the immigration issue.|$|E
