5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver</b> maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the main dam at Scar House finally severed the line to Angram in 1933. By 1936, with construction completed, the railway was lifted, and a sale was held at Pateley Bridge on 1 March 1937, where everything was sold as a single lot. The staff of the Nidd Valley Light Railway were laid off, and although their jobs did not qualify for a pension, pensions were paid to G Pearson, {{who had worked for}} the company as a <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver</b> for 30 years, and to J Brown, who had been a platelayer for 20 years. Pensions were also to be paid to another platelayer and the locomotive fireman on reaching the age of 65. At its peak, the Scar House reservoir project had employed about 780 men, and the population of Scar Village had been 1,135. By 1936, there were just eight houses occupied, and seven pupils at the school, which closed on 31 January 1938.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of eye injuries and the factors influencing it among <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> and Sentul workshop workers of Keretapi Tanah Melayu in 1994. The sample was selected using convenient sampling technique. A total of 200 <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> and loo workshop workers were studied and the prevalence of eye injuries was 20. 0 %. The prevalence of eye injuries was significantly associated with mean age, types of job and length of services (p 0. 05). It was also found that brake block dust was the main causal agent among <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> while the causal agent for workshop workers was dust (p< 0. 05). The study also concluded that the mean annual sick leave among the workshop workers was higher than the <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> (p< 0. 05). Most of the eye injuries involved the left eye (56. 7 %) and the majority of these injuries were diagnosed as foreign bodies in the cornea (88. 3 %). None of those, injured was blinded or had serious complication...|$|R

2500|$|The {{engineers}} or {{drivers of}} the locomotives, called mechaniciens, had a particularly difficult job; the cabs of the locomotives had no roofs and no sides, and {{were exposed to}} rain, hail and snow. In addition, it was scorching hot, since they had to work {{in front of the}} boiler. [...] A <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver</b> earned 10 francs a day.|$|E
2500|$|Cross {{compound}} locomotives have {{a fundamental}} design issue, {{which is that}} if the HP cylinder is stopped [...] "on center", the locomotive cannot start. [...] To resolve this, all practical cross compound locomotives have some form of starting valve, which allows admission of HP steam into the LP cylinder on starting. [...] In some cases this is manually operated by the <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver,</b> while in other cases it is automatic; in the latter case the valve {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "intercepting valve". [...] The primary difference between various forms of cross compound locomotives is in the design and operation of the intercepting valve.|$|E
50|$|In Germany, the {{locomotive}} cab {{was introduced by}} the Saxon railway director and writer Max Maria von Weber. However, until 1950 the railway directorates of the German-speaking countries continued {{to believe that a}} standing posture was essential to maximise crew vigilance. Steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers,</b> who had to lean out of their cabs for better visibility, therefore frequently developed occupational diseases, along with rheumatism, and electric <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> suffered from wear to the knees.|$|R

2500|$|On 13 April 1948 {{a serious}} {{accident}} {{took place at}} the Waterloo Armstrong Lift; coal was still taken down to the original generating station which powered station offices at Waterloo. A shunt of wagons was being propelled on to the lift at the upper level; four pawls were supposed to be engaged to provide partial support to the lift table, but it appears that some had not engaged. The table tilted, drawing the wagons and M7 locomotive number 672 on to the table; the table and the entire shunt including the locomotive fell down the shaft. The locomotive and wagons were cut up in situ. [...] There is no information as to the fate of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Virtually all {{railroad}} {{rolling stock}} {{is equipped with}} manually operated mechanical hand brake devices that set and release the brakes. [...] Most of these involve a chain linked to the brake rigging, most often at the brake cylinder, that when tightened pull the piston out against the releasing springs, thus applying the brakes on the car (if {{there is only one}} brake cylinder per car) or bogie (if there is more than once cylinder per car). [...] Newer locomotives have electric systems that simply place an electric motor in place of the chain winding mechanism. [...] This brake acts independent of the action of the automatic air brakes, which function collectively when coupled in a train and are {{under the control of the}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver</b> / engineer.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was equipped}} was a multiple-unit control. The idea behind {{this was to}} lead a 425 t-train on the adjacent lines with low gradient using a Be 4/6 and then boosting {{it up for the}} steep gradients at the gotthard railway line using a Be 3/5. The idea of operating the train with one <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver</b> on the leading locomotive was definitely plausible. But the problem was, that for driving back the locomotive to the starting point another <b>locomotive</b> <b>driver</b> was needed. It is unknown if the multiple-unit control ever was tested.|$|E
50|$|Belluzzo {{contributed to}} the design of a 2-8-2 {{locomotive}} built by Ernesto Breda in 1931. It used four turbines in a multiple expansion arrangement. Belluzzo's US patent from that period shows the turbine driving a jackshaft through a gearbox in front of the <b>locomotive's</b> <b>drivers.</b> This <b>locomotive</b> was never completely fitted out.|$|R
50|$|After {{the removal}} of the {{regenerative}} brake the locomotive returned 1931 to Erstfeld. 1938 she was relocated to the depot of Basle. There she was leading miscellaneous freight trains. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> did not like the quite poor running characteristics. On the other hand, they had to admit that they liked the high tractive force at lower speeds.|$|R

50|$|Using the countersteam brake, {{experienced}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>drivers</b> can {{reverse the}} running {{direction of a}} steam locomotive {{almost as if it}} hasn't been brought to a stop, because the actual changeover point occurs whilst the locomotive is still moving in the initial direction of travel. This technique requires detailed knowledge and experience because if it is not carried out correctly, damage to the locomotive engine may result.|$|R
