40|$|AbstractThe Offshore Oil & Gas industry, {{shipping}} {{and the ocean}} resource development industries {{play a vital role}} in the development of a country. The harsh marine environment and the need to explore for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deep waters has put in place technology and specialized marine support vessels to explore and produce hydrocarbons from below the ocean bed. The specialized vessels engaged in such operations have to maintain a fixed position in relation to a fixed point at the ocean bed despite the harsh vessel position deviating forces of sea currents, waves and wind acting on the floating vessel as little change in the position may lead to accident in the sea. So by the method of “Dynamic Positioning” the vessel is kept stationary in the sea and then oil and gas is extracted by using drilling vessels or drill ships. This method also allows other vessels like crane vessels, shuttle tanker, dredging and rock dumping vessels, pipelay, <b>cable</b> <b>lay</b> <b>and</b> <b>cable</b> repair vessels to remain stationary in sea so that extraction process takes place efficiently...|$|R

50|$|Plumbing and {{electrical}} conduit {{can be placed}} inside the forms and poured into place, though settling problems could cause pipes to break, creating costly repairs. For this reason, plumbing and conduit as well as electrical cables are usually embedded directly into the foam before the wall coverings are applied. A hot knife or electric chainsaw is commonly used to create openings in the foam to <b>lay</b> piping <b>and</b> <b>cabling.</b> electrical cables are inserted into the ICF using a Cable Punch. while ICFs made from other materials are typically cut or routed with simple carpentry tools. Versions of simple carpentry tools suitable for cement-bonded type forms are made for similar use with autoclaved aerated concrete.|$|R

50|$|The newest {{design of}} cable layers, though, is a {{combination}} of cable-laying and repair ships. An example is the USNS Zeus, the only U.S. naval cable layer/repair ship. The Zeus uses two diesel electric engines that produce 5000 horsepower each and can carry her up to 15 knots (about 17 miles per hour), <b>and</b> she can <b>lay</b> about 1000 miles of telecommunications cable to a depth of 9000 feet. The purpose of the Zeus was to be a cable ship that could do anything required of it, so the ship was built to be able to <b>lay</b> <b>and</b> retrieve <b>cable</b> from either the bow or the stern with ease. This design was {{similar to that of the}} first cable ship, the Great Eastern. The Zeus was built to be as maneuverable as possible so that it could fulfill both roles: as a cable layer or a cable repair ship.|$|R

The success of an offshore oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico in 1947 was soon repeated elsewhere in the world, and by 1970 it was technically feasible to operate in waters 4,000 metres deep.
