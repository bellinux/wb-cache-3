40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} first {{indicates the}} melt front delay of wedge-shaped <b>lightguiding</b> plate of backlight module on micro injection molding. This research fabricated {{the patterns of}} mold insert of <b>lightguiding</b> plate by photo etching process. The micro-facture of <b>lightguiding</b> plate was manufactured by micro injection molding. The <b>lightguiding</b> plate of backlight module {{was used for the}} PMMA material. The single parameter method was used to discuss the flatness and replication properties for different processing parameters (mold temperature, melt temperature, packing pressure, packing time and injection pressure). The results show that there are melt front delays due to the slow injection velocity, the low temperature induced by the little effect of shear heating, the high viscosity, the large flow resistance and the slow flow velocity. The mold temperature is the most important factor for the flatness and the replication of micro-feature of liughtguiding plate. Lower mold temperature induces better flatness properties.

50|$|For a non-ELP {{backlight}} {{to produce}} even lighting, which {{is critical for}} displays, the light is first passed through a <b>lightguide</b> - a specially designed layer of plastic that diffuses the light {{through a series of}} unevenly spaced bumps. The density of bumps increases further away from the light source according to a diffusion equation. The diffused light then travels to either side of the diffuser; the front faces the actual LCD panel, the back has a reflector to guide otherwise wasted light back toward the LCD panel. The reflector is sometimes made of aluminum foil, a simple white-pigmented surface, or, as in the 3M Vikuiti ESR, hundreds of polymer layers alternating between a low and high refractive index. Between the <b>lightguide</b> and the LCD panel is usually placed a reflective polarizer film which vastly increases efficiency by repeatedly reflecting any unpolarized light back, which would otherwise be absorbed by the LCD's rear polarizer.|$|E

The direction of their travel is focused to the <b>lightguide</b> by a metal coating on the scintillator acting as a mirror.
