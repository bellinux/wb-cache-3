5|$|During the <b>late</b> <b>sixties,</b> a {{radio series}} {{starring}} Peter Cushing as The Doctor from the Dalek films {{had been planned}} to be produced. A collaboration between Stanmark Productions and Watermill Productions, a pilot had been recorded and a further 52 episodes were to be produced. The pilot story titled Journey into Time featured The Doctor and his granddaughter travel {{to the time of}} the American Revolution. The script was written by future television series writer Malcolm Hulke and the recording remains lost.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} department, Syme was succeeded by Peter Brunt. In the sciences, Dr John Baltrop was {{sometime}} Bursar; Bryan Birch, Professor of Arithmetic {{and co-author of}} the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture; and Nicholas Kurti, Vice-President of the Royal Society. Overall, although the immediate post-War staff remained traditional– if not overly conservative in nature– with a third drawn from Brasenose itself, the <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> signalled a change on this front. Then, a wave of new face emerged: among them, Laszlo Solymar (later Professor of Applied Electromagnetism), Vernon Bogdanor (Professor of Government), Robert Evans (Regius Professor of Modern History) and Graham Richards, Oxford's Chairman of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|During his 1965-1966 world tour, Dylan {{was backed}} by a five-member rock group, The Hawks, who would later become famous as The Band. After Dylan was injured in a {{motorcycle}} accident in July 1966, four members of The Hawks came to Dylan's home in the Woodstock area to collaborate with him on music and film projects. While Dylan {{was out of the}} public's eye during an extended period of recovery in 1967, he and the members of The Hawks recorded more than 100 tracks together, incorporating original compositions, contemporary covers, and traditional material. Dylan's new style of writing moved away from the urban sensibility and extended narratives that had characterized his most recent albums, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, toward songs that were more intimate and which drew on many styles of traditional American music. While some of the basement songs are humorous, others dwell on nothingness, betrayal and a quest for salvation. In general, they possess a rootsy quality anticipating the Americana genre. For some critics, the songs on The Basement Tapes, which circulated widely in unofficial form, mounted a major stylistic challenge to rock music in the <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wiegman {{acquired}} fame in the <b>late</b> nineteen <b>sixties</b> as {{a progressive}} ceramist. He made true-to-form rusted cans and military bags from clay. By doing so he demonstrated a combination between ‘future’ and ‘past’, {{with the creation}} of something new that was modeled after something in decay.|$|R

25|$|Lacan's {{writings}} {{from the}} <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> and seventies (thus {{subsequent to the}} 1966 collection) were collected posthumously, along with some early texts from the nineteen thirties, in the Éditions du Seuil volume Autres écrits (2001).|$|E
25|$|Prior to the <b>late</b> <b>sixties,</b> {{music in}} the Soviet Union was divided into two groups: music {{published}} by state record company Melodiya, and everything else. Under this second group were the bards, underground folk singer–songwriters.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Selleck {{plays the}} {{character}} as {{straight from the}} novels as possible; he is older (<b>late</b> fifties/early <b>sixties</b> vs. <b>late</b> thirties in the books) than Stone. The author, Robert B. Parker, said that he found the Jesse Stone movies the most accurate television adaptations of his novels. On his blog, he wrote that [...] "Tom nails the character".|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} made a becoming show of deprecation. He {{said he did}} {{not think}} the story would bear immediate repetition, or was even worth telling once, but, if we had nothing better to do, perhaps we might do worse than hear it; the most he could say for it was that the thing really happened. He wore a large, drooping, gray mustache, which, with the imperial below it, quite hid his mouth, and gave him, somehow, a martial effect, besides accurately dating him of the period between the <b>latest</b> <b>sixties</b> and earliest seventies, when his beard would have been black; I liked his mustache not being stubbed in the modern manner, but allowed to fall heavily over his lips, and then branch away from {{the corners of his mouth}} as far as it would. He lighted the cigar which Halson gave him, and, blowing the bitten-off tip towards the fire, began: ...|$|R
40|$|In the <b>late</b> {{nineteen}} <b>sixties</b> it {{was observed}} that the recursively enumerable languages form an infinite proper hierarchy bassed {{on the size of the}} Turing machines that accept them. We examine the fundamental position of the finite languages and their complements in the hierarchy. Several results are shown that how the hierarchy can be separated by finite languages of moderate complexity...|$|R
25|$|Mondt left Capitol in the <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> and {{although}} the WWWF had withdrawn from the NWA, Vince McMahon, Sr. quietly re-joined in 1971. Capitol renamed the World Wide Wrestling Federation to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979.|$|E
25|$|During the <b>late</b> <b>Sixties</b> {{and into}} the Seventies O'Keefe's {{personal}} life became increasingly busy. One of the biggest personal blows O'Keefe suffered {{was the end of}} his marriage and the 1966 divorce from his wife Marianne, whom he had married in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Denis O'Dea {{the actor}} came from 54 Richmond St., {{where his mother}} kept a {{boarding}} house. He married actress Siobhán McKenna in 1956 and {{they lived in the}} house until the <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b> They had a son Donnacha O'Dea, who was a pupil of Synge Street CBS.|$|E
40|$|The Danish avant-garde {{magazine}} Mak contained {{throughout its}} short life an extensive discussion {{on whether or}} not art {{could be used as a}} weapon in the struggle for the new society the counterculture was dreaming about in the <b>late</b> nineteen <b>sixties.</b> Mak was devoted to this question: How can art move from the (aesthetic) periphery to the centre of (political) influence?...|$|R

The line {{was completed in}} the <b>late</b> eighteen <b>sixties</b> and the LNWR were operating passenger trains over the line by 1872.|$|R
25|$|In Pakistan, {{the art of}} {{calligraphy}} was {{relegated to}} a second-class status until Sadequain adapted this medium in the <b>late</b> nineteen <b>sixties.</b> Until then a few painters experimented with the medium but it remained as just that, an experiment. After Sadequain transformed the art of calligraphy into a mainstream art form, most of the known Pakistani artists have followed Sadequain and calligraphic art now dominates the art scene.|$|R

25|$|The New Super-Spirituality: Claims the {{intellectual}} decadence {{of students and}} the counter-culture from the <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> to the early seventies {{can be traced back}} to the conformism of their fathers, only with fewer moral absolutes, and predicts the contamination of the church. Offers an analysis of Postmodernism.|$|E
25|$|Side {{trawlers}} – {{have the}} trawl set {{over the side}} with the trawl warps passing through blocks which hang from two gallows, one forward and one aft. Until the <b>late</b> <b>sixties,</b> side trawlers were the most familiar vessel in the North Atlantic deep sea fisheries. They evolved {{over a longer period}} than other trawler types, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers.|$|E
50|$|The Admiral is a tall, heavyset man, {{apparently}} in his <b>late</b> fifties-early <b>sixties</b> with graying hair {{set in a}} ponytail. He's dedicated to protecting the GSA from the Varn threat, {{and is willing to}} use any means necessary to achieve that goal.

25|$|Automobiles Dangel is a French {{specialist}} automobile {{company based}} in Sentheim, Alsace. It has produced 4x4 versions of Citroën and Peugeot vehicles since 1980. Its first conversion was the Peugeot 504 and since then Dangel has converted over 22,000 vehicles. Originally a producer of competition cars, beginning in the <b>late</b> <b>sixties,</b> their first four-wheel drive conversions were developed with the direct assistance of Peugeot's own engineers.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, James {{became a}} car owner / driver, a dual role that {{continues}} to this day. Hylton found his way to victory lane {{for the first time}} on March 1, 1970 at the Richmond 500, driving the familiar number 48 Ford. During the <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> and early seventies, Hylton amassed an amazing consistency record that was rivaled only by those of Richard Petty and Cale Yarborough.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{conversion}} This is {{a method}} where the kinetic energy of a particle is converted into voltage. It was first suggested by Richard F. Post in conjunction with magnetic mirrors, in the <b>late</b> <b>sixties.</b> It has also been suggested for Field-Reversed Configurations. The process takes the plasma, expands it, and converts a large fraction of the random energy of the fusion products into directed motion. The particles are then collected on electrodes at various large electrical potentials. This method has demonstrated an experimental efficiency of 48 percent.|$|E

[...] and during the <b>late</b> nineteen <b>sixties</b> another well respected envoy John Eisenhower, the son of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, served as Ambassador to Belgium.|$|R
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Quintus Aemilius Papus, {{himself the}} son of Gnaeus Aemilius Papus. His {{probable}} father was Quintus Aemilius Papus, who had been consul twice and censor once; if true, he would have been born to a father already in his <b>late</b> fifties to <b>sixties</b> at the very least.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1964, {{the federal}} {{government}} tried to address concerns about competition and local production by licensing a third station in major cities, beginning with Channel 0 in Melbourne and Channel 10 in Sydney. More third-licence stations were established in other capitals and regional cities {{over the next few}} years and by the <b>late</b> <b>Sixties</b> these stations joined forces to create Australia's third commercial network, originally known as the Independent Television System (ITS), then later changed to the 0–10 Network, and now called Network Ten.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{developed}} {{some of the}} first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He later credited himself as being the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer. (It should be noted that his electromechanical devices, some with motors moving photocells past lights, bore little resemblance to the all-electronic sequencers of the <b>late</b> <b>sixties.)</b> He began working on a machine he said composed using artificial intelligence. The Electronium, as Scott called it, with its vast array of knobs, buttons and patch panels is considered the first self-composing synthesizer.|$|E
25|$|The 1951 census in Pakistan {{recorded}} 671,000 {{refugees in}} East Pakistan, {{the majority of}} which came from West Bengal. The rest were from Bihar. According to the ILO in the period 1951–1956, half a million Indian Muslims migrated to East Pakistan. By 1961 the numbers reached 850,000. In {{the aftermath of the}} riots in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, Biharis continued to migrate to East Pakistan well into the <b>late</b> <b>sixties</b> and added up to around a million. Crude estimates suggest that about 1.5 million Muslims migrated from West Bengal and Bihar to East Bengal in the two decades after partition.|$|E
