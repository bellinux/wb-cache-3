We use the Arnold-Winther Element in the mixed &# 64257;nite element discretization. An overlapping Schwarz preconditioner and a multigrid preconditioner for the discrete system are developed and analyzed. We start by introducing the mixed formulation (stress-displacement formulation) for the <b>linear</b> plane <b>elasticity</b> problem and its discretization. A {{detailed analysis of}} the Arnold-Winther Element is given. The &# 64257;nite element discretization of the mixed formulation leads to a symmetric inde&# 64257;nite linear system.

2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial static stress field. This is a non-linear effect of the constitutive relation between mechanical stress and finite strain in a material of continuous mass. In classical <b>linear</b> <b>elasticity</b> theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress. The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory) between the applied stress and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear sound velocities dependent of the stress state of the material. In the limit of an unstressed material the sound velocities of the linear elastic theory are reproduced.|$|E

The fundamental [...] "linearizing" [...] assumptions of <b>linear</b> <b>elasticity</b> are: infinitesimal strains or [...] "small" [...] deformations (or strains) and linear relationships between the components of stress and strain. In addition <b>linear</b> <b>elasticity</b> is valid only for stress states that do not produce yielding.

40|$|AbstractImportant {{mechanisms}} in muscle contraction {{have recently been}} reevaluated based on analyses that rely on the assumption of <b>linear</b> myofilament <b>elasticity.</b> However, the present theoretical study shows that nonlinearity of this elasticity, even when so minor {{that it may be}} difficult to detect in experimental data, could have great impact on the interpretation of muscle mechanical experiments. This is illustrated by using simulated stiffness and strain-versus-force data for muscle fibers shortening at different constant velocities. There is substantial quantitative agreement, for this condition, between models with distributed myofilament compliance and models where the compliance of the myofilaments and the actomyosin cross-bridges are lumped together into two separate elastic elements acting in series. The data thus support the usefulness of the latter, simpler, type of model in the analysis. However, most importantly, the data emphasize the importance of caution before reevaluating fundamental mechanisms of muscle contraction based on analyses relying on the assumption of <b>linear</b> myofilament <b>elasticity...</b>|$|R

This study extends this research to show that taxes behave asymmetrically and nonlinearly during expansions and contractions.
