By using an immunochemical method residual egg proteins were detected in the experimental red wines only for doses of fining agent of 50 g/hL or higher, whereas no residual proteins were detected by this system in a commercial red wine. A simple method based on the recovery and identification of the wine fining proteins by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) in a gel-free approach was developed. This allowed the detection of egg proteins in red wines fined down to 5 g/hL of commercial egg white preparation and also in the commercial red wine. These results indicate that the analytical approach here suggested is superior to the immunochemical methods in detecting egg proteins in wines. Therefore hypersensitivity reactions after consumption of wines treated with egg proteins can be a real risk for eggallergic people...|$|R

Prediction models for SFA, MUFA and PUFA expressed on total FA exhibited coefficients of determination of calibration of 0. 822, 0. 367 and 0. 780 on intact samples, and 0. 879, 0. 726 and 0. 908 on minced samples, respectively. Good results were also obtained when FA groups were expressed as g/ 100 g of fresh meat: the coefficient of determination of calibration increased to values larger than 0. 915. Moreover, comparing the slightly lower coefficient of determination in crossvalidation of intact compared with minced meat suggested that equations developed for minced samples were more accurate than those built for intact products.

The primary objective {{of this study was}} to examine nutritive values of such complementary infant food on the UK market in order to ascertain their suitability relative to dietary guidelines for the 6 – 9 months age group. Quantitative analyses were conducted on eight different products representing four popular brands (meat and vegetable based) currently on sale in the UK. Eight major mineral and trace elements, namely: calcium, copper, magnesium, iron, zinc, potassium, sodium and selenium were measured by ICP–OES and ICP–MS. The results of these studies were referenced to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) values for 6 – 9 months old children, and a menu of entire daily intake of minerals and trace elements was composed taking into consideration the nutrient and energy intake from milk consumption. Based on these comparisons, all the food samples studied in this work contained less essential minerals than expected from the RNI values except for potassium in meat and vegetable based recipes. These results suggest that commercial complementary infant foods on the UK market may not contain the minimum levels of minerals required for the <b>labelling</b> <b>declaration</b> of micronutrient content (Commission Directive 2006 / 125 /EC).

40|$|Evidence {{is lacking}} for three health claims of herbal {{products}} with Ginkgo biloba. Besides, analysis of 29 Ginkgo products showed {{that most of}} these products did not comply with the <b>declaration</b> on the <b>label.</b> Furtermore, safety can not be guaranteed at the recommended daily dose. This was observed in a study performed by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). Manufacturers claim that Ginkgo biloba products can improve bloodcirculation and memory, and can diminish symptoms of old age. The RIVM tested the scientific-based substantiation of these health claims against new European criteria. From this it can be concluded that insufficient evidence for these health claims was provided in the available studies. This was mainly because lack of data from studies with healthy volunteers and unclarity about content levels. In the evaluated studies only results with the standardized Ginkgo biloba extract was described. Most analyzed products, however, did not contain the standardized extract. Moreover, in most preparations the content of active substances was not in conformity with the <b>label</b> <b>declaration.</b> Since toxicity data of Ginkgo biloba are very limited, a safety limit could not be established. In case studies, bleedings are reported at the recommended daily dose for not-specified Ginkgo biloba preparations. The use of not-standardized Ginkgo biloba extract can pose a risk, since it cannot be excluded that such preparations contain subtances with e. g. genotoxic and carcinogenic properties.

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} examine the nutritive values and safety of such complementary infant foods on the UK market in relation to dietary and safety guidelines. Quantitative analyses were conducted on eight different products representing four popular brands (poultry and fish based) of ready to-feed infant foods currently on sale in the UK. Six essential elements, namely: calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc were determined by ICP-OES. The concentrations of six essential trace elements (selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, copper, chromium, manganese) and eight non-essential, potentially toxic, elements (arsenic, barium, nickel, cadmium, antimony, lead, mercury, aluminium) were determined by ICP-MS due to the higher sensitivity required. The total daily intakes of essential and trace elements from the consumption of such products were then estimated, based on the results of this study, and were referenced to the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) values and safety guidelines for 6 – 9 months old children. Based on these comparisons the concentration of essential, except for potassium, and trace elements were found to be inadequate in meeting the RNI. In terms of the risk of exposure to toxicity, the concentration of toxic elements in ready to feed products analysed in this study, were not considered to be of concern. These results suggest that commercial complementary infant foods on the UK market may not contain minimum levels of minerals required for <b>labelling</b> <b>declaration</b> of micronutrient content (Commission Directive 2006 / 125 /EC).

40|$|An assay for the {{simultaneous}} quantitative determination of riboflavin and pyridoxine in eight different complementary infant meal products {{has been developed}} in order to (1) estimate the daily intake of these vitamins from commercial infant food consumption, and (2) ascertain their nutritional suitability relative to dietary guidelines for the 6 – 9 months age group. The method involves mild hydrolysis of the foods, an extraction of the supernatant by centrifugation followed by quantitative determination using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. Separation of the two water soluble vitamins is achieved within one minute and the resultant sample is also LC–MS compatible. Despite wide individual differences between brands (p = 6. 5 e- 12), {{no significant differences were}} observed in the level of pyridoxine between the meat and vegetable-based varieties (p = 0. 7) per 100 g of commercial infant food. Riboflavin was not detected in any of the samples where the detection limit was below 0. 07 μg/mL. In terms of the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI) of pyridoxine for 6 – 9 months old infants, the complementary infant meal products analysed herein provided less than 15 % of the RNI values with mean (SD) values of 12. 87 (± 4. 46) % and 13. 88 (± 4. 97) % for the meat- and vegetable-based recipes, respectively. The estimated total daily intake of riboflavin and pyridoxine from the consumption of commercial complementary food was found to be satisfactory and in accordance with the Dietary Reference Values (DRVs). The intake of both riboflavin and pyridoxine was estimated to be mainly derived from the consumption of formula milk which could be a cause of concern if the quality of an infant’s milk diet is compromised by an inadequate or lack of supplemented milk intake.

Besides being an acknowl¬edged communication tool for promoting management strategies on an environmental and social scale, ecolabel¬ing is also a marketing tool.

This approach has resulted in the proliferation of tools at inter¬national, national, and European levels that contribute to sustainability initiatives from an economic, environmental, and ethical perspective (i. e., the triple bottom line approach coined by John Elkington in 1994). Ecolabeling programs can become an effective driving force in the transition process towards ecosustainability when current critical elements are eliminated. The main critical factor is undoubtedly consumer disorientation that results from the vast range of environmental label¬ing systems available on the market.
