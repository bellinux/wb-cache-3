The PLCP preamble has two distinct parts: a unique synchronization sequence and a channel estimation sequence. It helps the receiver in timing synchronization, carrier-offset recovery, and channel estimation. In our proposed MU-synchronization, TX 0 with 0 shift starts to transmit a PPDU first based on its <b>local</b> <b>timer</b> and the other nodes, i.e. TX 1, TX 2, RX 0, RX 1, and RX 2, start to listen to the synchronization sequence of TX 0 for the synchronization with their local timers. The transmitters, TX 1 and TX 2, start to transmit their PPDUs with their shifted TFCs after the synchronization. Then, the TX-RX pairs can communicate synchronously.|$|E

There are two novel contributions in this work. Firstly, a flexible timing mechanism is proposed to integrate external time source and <b>local</b> <b>timer</b> utility, enabling the distributed nodes to advance their timeline simultaneously at different speeds with high precision. A data transmission solution is also presented in which the reflective memory card (VMIC) is employed to provide fast data transmission with minimum delay. Secondly, a system partition schema is proposed in MLRTI to reduce the solution errors introduced by transforming a continuous system into distribution system, which is common {{in a class of}} control applications where the system is designed in centralized model but simulated in distributed environment for constrains on system structure or the need to balance computation load. Experiments are conducted and the results show this schema effectively reduces the possible errors by properly partitioning the system into parts that are suitable to be deployed in distributed environment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the Forecasting Routing Technique (FORTEL), a routing protocol for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANETs) {{based on the}} nodes' Location Information. FORTEL stores the nodes' location information in the Location Table (LT) in order to construct routes between the source and the destination nodes. FORTEL follows the source routing strategy, which has rarely been applied in position-based routing. According to the source routing strategy, the end-to-end route {{is attached to the}} packet, therefore, the processing cost, in regards to the intermediate nodes that simply relay the packet according to route, is minimized. FORTEL's key mechanisms include: first, the location update scheme, employed to keep the LT entries up-to-date with the network topology. Besides the mobility variation and the constant rate location update schemes applied, a window location update scheme is presented to increase the LT's information accuracy. Second, the switching mechanism, between "Hello" message and location update employed, to reduce the protocol's routing overhead. Third and most important is the route computation mechanism, which is integrated with a topology forecasting technique to construct up-to-date routes between the communication peers, aiming to achieve high delivery rate and increase the protocol robustness against the nodes' movement. FORTEL demonstrates higher performance as compared to other MANET's routing protocols, and it delivers up to 20 % more packets than AODV and up to 60 % more than DSR and OLSR, while maintaining low levels of routing overhead and network delay at the same time. The effectiveness of the window update scheme is also discussed, and it proves to increase FORTEL's delivery rate by up to 30 % as compared to the other update schemes. A common and frequently occurring phenomenon, in wireless networks, is the Hidden Terminal problem that significantly impacts the communication performance and the efficiency of the routing and MAC protocols. Beaconless routing approach in MANETs, which delivers data packets without prior knowledge of any sort `of information, suffers from packet duplication caused by the hidden nodes during the contention process. Moreover, the throughput of the IEEE MAC protocol decreases dramatically when the hidden terminal problem occurs. RTS/CTS mechanism fails to eliminate the problem and can further degrade the network's performance by introducing additional overhead. To tackle these challenges, this thesis presents two techniques, the Sender Suppression Algorithm and the Location-Aided MAC, where both rely on the nodes' position to eliminate packet duplication in the beaconless routing and improve the performance of the 802. 11 MAC respectively. Both schemes are based on the concept of grouping the nodes into zones and assign different time delay to each one. According to the Sender Suppression Algorithm, the sender's forwarding area is divided into three zones, therefore, the <b>local</b> <b>timer,</b> set to define the time that the receiver has to wait before responding to the sender's transmission, is added to the assigned zone delay. Following the first response, the sender interferes and suppresses the receivers with active timer of. On the other hand, the Location-Aided MAC, essentially a hybrid MAC, combines the concepts of time division and carrier sensing. The radio range of the wireless receiver is partitioned into four zones with different zone delays assigned to each zone. Channel access within the zone is purely controlled by CSMA/CA protocol, while it is time-based amongst zones. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through simulation tests. Location-Aided MAC considerably improves the network's throughput compared to CSMA/CA and RTS/CTS. However, remarkable results come when the proposed technique and the RTS/CTS are combined, which achieves up to 20 % more throughput as compared to the standalone RTS/CTS. Finally, the thesis presents a novel link lifetime estimation method for greedy forwarding to compute the link duration between two nodes. Based on a newly introduced Stability-Aware Greedy (SAG) scheme, the proposed method incorporates the destination node in the computation process and thus has a significant advantage over the conventional method, which only considers the information of the nodes composing the link.

40|$|Quest-V is {{a system}} we have been {{developing}} from the ground up, with objectives focusing on safety, predictability and efficiency. It is designed to work on emerging multicore processors with hardware virtualization support. Quest-V is implemented as a "distributed system on a chip" and comprises multiple sandbox kernels. Sandbox kernels are isolated from one another in separate regions of physical memory, having access to a subset of processing cores and I/O devices. This partitioning prevents system failures in one sandbox affecting the operation of other sandboxes. Shared memory channels managed by system monitors enable inter-sandbox communication. The distributed nature of Quest-V means each sandbox has a separate physical clock, with all event timings being managed by per-core <b>local</b> <b>timers.</b> Each sandbox is responsible for its own scheduling and I/O management, without requiring intervention of a hypervisor. In this paper, we formulate bounds on inter-sandbox communication {{in the absence of}} a global scheduler or global system clock. We also describe how address space migration between sandboxes can be guaranteed without violating service constraints. Experimental results on a working system show the conditions under which Quest-V performs real-time communication and migration. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficient}} {{wireless communications}} have recently received much attention, {{due to the}} ever-increasing energy consumption of wireless communication systems. In this paper, we propose a new energy-efficient cooperative relaying scheme that selects a subset of relays before data transmission, through proactive participation of available relays using their <b>local</b> <b>timers.</b> We perform theoretical analysis of energy efficiency under maximum transmission power constraint, using practical data packet length, and taking account of the overhead for obtaining channel state information, relay selection, and cooperative beamforming. We provide the expression of average energy efficiency for the proposed scheme, and identify the optimal number and location of relays that maximise energy efficiency of the system. A closedform approximate expression for the optimal position of relays is derived. We also perform overhead analysis for the proposed scheme and study the impact of data packet lengths on energy efficiency. The analytical and simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme exhibits significantly higher energy efficiency as compared to direct transmission, best relay selection, all relay selection, and a state-of-the-art existing cooperative relaying scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme reduces the signalling overhead and achieves higher energy savings for larger data packets...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} distributed optimization problems {{in which the}} cost function is separable, i. e., a sum of possibly non-smooth functions all sharing a common variable, and can be split into a strongly convex term and a convex one. The second term is typically used to encode constraints or to regularize the solution. We propose a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on proximal gradient methods applied to the dual problem. We show that, by choosing suitable primal variable copies, the dual problem is itself separable when written in terms of conjugate functions, and the dual variables can be stacked into non-overlapping blocks associated to the computing nodes. We first show that a weighted proximal gradient on the dual function leads to a synchronous distributed algorithm with local dual proximal gradient updates at each node. Then, as main paper contribution, we develop asynchronous versions of the algorithm in which the node updates are triggered by <b>local</b> <b>timers</b> without any global iteration counter. The algorithms are shown to be proper randomized block-coordinate proximal gradient updates on the dual function. Comment: submitted to journa...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore new ways to achieve {{complexity}} reduction in discrete event systems (DES). We present three different ways of reducing complexity. First, we present a symbolic supervisory control design method for composite systems such that the complete state space never needs to be computed. Instead of a supervisor implemented by a static lookup table, we provide a function that can be efficiently and dynamically computed at each state to determine the control action. This symbolic function can be suitably modified {{to ensure that the}} system under control is free of deadlocks. Secondly, we present a heuristic algorithm {{to reduce the size of}} a (static) supervisor. Our symbolic supervision scheme is not able to guarantee non-blocking behaviour in the system under control. So to ensure non-blockingness it may be necessary to use a lookup table. Finding the smallest lookup table for a given control task is an NP-hard problem. We propose a greedy supervisor reduction algorithm based on the concept of control covers. This algorithm seems to work quite well in a large number of cases. Finally, we present a compact model of timed discrete event systems (TDES). We use <b>local</b> <b>timers</b> at each state of the TDES to model the passage of time. This model is quite robust to changes in tim...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The recent {{advances}} in VLSI technology have facilitated feature shrinking and hence a rapid {{increase in the level}}s of integration at the chip level. This increase in the level of integration has brought along with it a host of other constraints, the most crucial being timing management and increased power dissipation. Such constraints potentially prevent the full exploitation of the increased processing power made possible by technological advances. Timing in complex digital systems has traditionally been managed by using a global clock, controlled by which all the actions take place in lock-step. An alternative means of managing timing, called self-timing, simplifies the problems of timing management and results in a reduced power dissipation of complex digital systems. Systems designed using this self-timed or asynchronous protocol, work on a principle of handshaking, running at their own speed, governed by <b>local</b> <b>timers</b> and the availability of data on which to work. However, this hand-shaking introduces an overhead both in terms of hardware and computational speed. The work presented here examines the implementation of an adder, called a Parallel Half-Adder (PHA), which gains its speed by exploiting the power of asynchrony to calculate the sum. The adder has been implemented {{in the form of a}} tunable micropipeline and compared to traditional adders in terms of hardware complexity and speed. Comparable results have been obtained, implying that the overhead due to hand shaking is justified and the performance improvements due to self-timing can be fully exploited. The design of an array divider using the PHA has also been presented...|$|R

40|$|Timing {{of organ}} {{development}} during embryogenesis is coordinated such that at birth, organ and fetal size and maturity are appropriately proportioned. The {{extent to which}} <b>local</b> developmental <b>timers</b> are integrated {{with each other and}} with the signaling interactions that regulate morphogenesis to achieve this end is not understood. Using the absolute requirement for a signaling pathway activity (bone morphogenetic protein, BMP) during a critical stage of tooth development, we show that suboptimal levels of BMP signaling do not lead to abnormal morphogenesis, as suggested by mutants affecting BMP signaling, but to a 24 -h stalling of the intrinsic developmental clock of the tooth. During this time, BMP levels accumulate to reach critical levels whereupon tooth development restarts, accelerates to catch up with development of the rest of the embryo and completes normal morphogenesis. This suggests that individual organs can autonomously control their developmental timing to adjust their stage of development to that of other organs. We also find that although BMP signaling is critical for the bud-to-cap transition in all teeth, levels of BMP signaling are regulated differently in multicusped teeth. We identify an interaction between two homeodomain transcription factors, Barx 1 and Msx 1, which is responsible for setting critical levels of BMP activity in multicusped teeth and provides evidence that correlates the levels of Barx 1 transcriptional activity with cuspal complexity. This study highlights the importance of absolute levels of signaling activity for development and illustrates remarkable self-regulation in organogenesis that ensures coordination of developmental processes such that timing is subordinate to developmental structure...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of energy-hungry {{wireless}} multimedia services, telecom energy consumption is increasing at an extraordinary rate. Besides negative environmental impacts and higher energy bills for operators, it also affects user experience as improvements in battery technologies have not kept up with increasing mobile energy demands. Therefore, how to increase the energy efficiency (EE) of wireless communications has gained a lot of attention recently. Cooperative communication, where relays cooperatively retransmit the received data from the source to the destination, is seen as a promising technique to increases EE. Nevertheless, it requires more overhead than direct communication that needs {{to be taken into account}} for practical wireless cooperative networks. In order to achieve potential energy savings promised by cooperative communications in practical systems, overhead-aware cooperative relaying schemes with low overhead are imperative. For the case that not all relays can hear each other, i. e., hidden relays exist, an energy-efficient and a low-overhead cooperative relaying scheme is proposed. This scheme selects a subset of relays before data transmission, through the proactive participation of available relays using their <b>local</b> <b>timers.</b> Theoretical analysis of average EE under maximum transmission power constraint, using practical data packet length, and taking account of the overhead for obtaining channel state information (CSI), relay selection, and cooperative beamforming, is performed and a closed-form approximate expression for the optimal position of relays is derived. Furthermore, the overhead of the proposed scheme and the impact of data packet lengths on EE, are analysed. The analytical and simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme is significantly more energy-efficient than direct transmission, best relay selection, all relay selection, and a state-of-the-art existing cooperative relaying scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme reduces the overhead and achieves higher energy savings for larger data packets. The conventional cooperative beamforming schemes rely on the feedback of CSIs of the best relays from the destination, which cause extra energy consumption and are prone to quantization errors in practical systems. In the case of clustered relays with location awareness and timer-based relay selection, where relays can overhear the transmission and know the location of each other, an energy-efficient overhead-aware cooperative relaying scheme is proposed, making CSI feedback from the destination dispensable. In order to avoid possible collisions between relay transmissions during best relays selection, a distributed mechanism for the selected relays to appropriately insert guard intervals before their transmissions is proposed. Average EE of the proposed scheme considering the related overhead is analysed. Moreover, the impact of the number of available relays, the number of selected relays and the location of relay cluster on EE is studied. The simulation results indicate that the proposed cooperative relaying scheme achieves higher EE than direct communication, best relay selection, and all relay selection for relay clusters located close to the source. Independent of the relay cluster location, the proposed scheme exhibits significantly higher EE than an existing cooperative relaying scheme. Device-to-device (D 2 D) communication in cellular networks that enable direct transmissions between user equipments (UEs) is seen as a promising way to improve both EE and spectral efficiency (SE). If the source UE (SUE) and the destination UE (DUE) are far away from each other or if the channel between them is too weak for direct transmission, then two-hop D 2 D communications, where relay UEs (RUEs) forward the SUE's data packets to the DUE, can be used. An energy- and spectral-efficient optimal adaptive forwarding strategy (OAFS) for two-hop D 2 D communications is proposed. In a distributed manner, the OAFS adaptively chooses between the best relay forwarding (BRF) and the cooperative relay beamforming (CRB) with the optimal number of selected RUEs, depending on which of them provides the higher instantaneous EE. In order to reduce the computational complexity of relay selection, a low-complexity sub-optimal adaptive forwarding strategy (SAFS) is proposed that selects between the BRF and the CRB with two RUEs by comparing their instantaneous EE. Theoretical analysis of the average EE and SE for the proposed adaptive forwarding strategies is performed considering maximum transmission power constraints, circuit power consumption and the overhead for the acquisition of CSI, forwarding mode selection and cooperative beamforming. The theoretical and simulation results show that the proposed OAFS and SAFS exhibit significantly higher EE and SE than the BRF, CRB, direct D 2 D communications and conventional cellular communications. For short to moderate SUE-to-DUE distances, SAFS is almost as energy- and spectral-efficient as OAFS...|$|R
