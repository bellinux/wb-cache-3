5|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, poor {{transport}} forced self-sufficiency on small settlements. Lacking the urban centres created under the Romans {{in the rest}} of Britain, the economy of Scotland in the early Middle Ages was overwhelmingly agricultural. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain, farming was done on single homesteads or amongst a small cluster of three or four homes. Each of these probably contained a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. A system was adopted that distinguished between the infield, around the settlement, where crops were grown every year, and the outfield, further away, where crops were grown and then <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> in different years. This would be the predominant system until the eighteenth century.|$|E

This landscape, however, is composed of two soils series namely the Pulong Buhangin Series and Maysan Series. Pulong Buhangin Series has deficient organic matter content and high to moderate inherent fertility. This is principally utilized for paddy rice and built-up areas. Non-irrigated paddy rice constitutes the principal crop during wet season. These soils are <b>left</b> <b>fallowed</b> during dry season {{due to lack of}} irrigation and rainfall.

Meanwhile, the Maysan series {{consists of}} very gently sloping to gently undulating shallow moderately drained soils that is formed on degraded tuffaceous sandstone footslopes. This series is mainly utilized for paddy ricefields during wet season and generally left idle during dry season ...|$|R
50|$|In agriculture, a {{field is}} an area of land, {{enclosed}} or otherwise, used for agricultural purposes such as cultivating crops or as a paddock or other enclosure for livestock. A field may also be an area <b>left</b> to lie <b>fallow</b> or as arable land.|$|R
25|$|The {{agricultural}} land around Mole Creek is mostly suited to grazing, intensive in some areas, though some is marginal cropping land that requires careful crop rotation with seasons where the land must be <b>left</b> <b>fallow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{land was}} only {{cultivated}} {{for a few}} years before being <b>left</b> <b>fallow,</b> new lands constantly needed to be opened by drainage of low-lying fields or by clearing scrubland or forests.

25|$|The {{seed drill}} was also {{developed}} during this period, allowing farmers to drill seeds in precise rows, instead of casting them out randomly. During {{the reign of}} Emperor Wu of Han, The 'Dai Tian Fa', an early form of crop rotation was introduced.

25|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} (or slash and burn) is {{a system}} in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years. Then the plot is <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity {{in which there is no}} fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.|$|E
25|$|The Ashanti {{prepared}} the fields by burning before {{the onset of}} the rainy season and cultivated with an iron hoe. Fields are <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> for a couple years, usually after two to four years of cultivation. Plants cultivated include plantains, yams, manioc, corn, sweet potatoes, millet, beans, onions, peanuts, tomatoes, and many fruits. Manioc and corn are New World transplants introduced during the Atlantic European trade. Many of these vegetable crops could be harvested twice a year and the cassava (manioc), after a two-year growth, provides a starchy root. The Ashanti transformed palm wine, maize and millet into beer, a favorite drink; and made use of the oil from palm for many culinary and domestic uses.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{arable land}} in Greece was yet under {{cultivation}} in the Archaic period. Farms {{appear to have}} been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements. They were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster. Crop rotation was practiced, alternating between legumes and cereals (barley and durum), and the land was <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> every other year. Alongside these, farmers cultivated vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables as cash crops for sale in local centres and abroad. Livestock were of secondary importance. Sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth. A team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly, but were expensive to maintain. Horses and large herds of cattle were the preserve of the mega-rich.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{major issue}} of potato {{cultivation}} in temperate zones is the {{potato cyst nematode}} Globodera rostochiensis. Population density of G. rostochiensis is high in Mexican potato fields. Control currently consists of the inefficient application of high doses of chemical nematicides. We evaluated the population density of G. rostochiensis in potato production plots in central Veracruz, Mexico. Plots were treated with the biocontrol agent Paecilomyces sp. and rotation with two different leguminous crop plants, Pisum sativum and Vicia faba. A random block experimental design was used with four different treatments over two crop cycles: (1) biological control with crop rotation, (2) crop rotation only, (3) biological control applied to soil <b>left</b> in <b>fallow,</b> and (4) soil <b>left</b> in <b>fallow</b> only. We measured the number and content of cysts, {{and the number of}} J 2 juveniles of G. rostochiensis in the soil. We then estimated the infestation level in soil and the multiplication rate (Pf/Pi). The number of free-living nematodes was also quantified. Results show that the highest mitigation of G. rostochiensis was observed for the biological control rotation, with 89. 2  % reduction, and for the biological control fallow treatments with 84. 4  % reduction. In rotation plots, infestation level decreased by 30. 7  %. In the biological control rotation and biological control fallow treatments, the Pf/Pi was 0. 1 and 0. 15, respectively. The highest Pf/Pi of 0. 93 was found in the fallow plots. The biological control agent did not significantly affect the free-living nematode populations. In this study, the nematophagous fungus Paecilomyces sp. was used {{for the first time to}} efficiently reduce the population of G. rostochiensis in two crop cycles...|$|R
50|$|The {{agricultural}} {{viability of}} a chitemene region {{is limited to}} a few years, until the soil pH declines. After the yield declines, a new area is cleared for chitemene, and the initial site is <b>left</b> to lie <b>fallow.</b> Typically, the regrowth of branches and natural leaf litter from the coppiced or pollarded stumps will restore soil fertility in 20 to 25 years, at which point the chitemene process is repeated.|$|R
50|$|The 1855 NYS census {{gives us}} an account on how the farm land was used. The farm was divided into plowed, fallow, pasture and meadow zones. The plowed land was further divided. Products {{produced}} from seed in 1854 included; winter wheat, oats, Barley, buckwheat, corn, and Irish potatoes. The orchard produced 150 bushels of apples, and 2 barrels of cider were made. The meadow produced 10 tons of hay plus a half bushel of grass seed was harvested. Additionally, 11 acres were allowed to sit fallow - were not used allowing weeds and grass to grow. This last point is interesting because six of the Schenck’s immediate neighbors who were not of German or Pennsylvanian German heritage {{did not have any}} recorded land <b>left</b> to <b>fallow.</b>|$|R
25|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area. The most common system {{was based on}} infield and outfield agriculture. The infield was the best land, close to housing. It was farmed continuously and most intensively, receiving most of the manure. Crops were usually bere (a form of barley), oats and sometimes wheat, rye and legumes. The more extensive outfield was used largely for oats. It was fertilised from the overnight folding of cattle in the summer and was often <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> to recover its fertility. In fertile regions the infield could be extensive, but in the uplands it might be small, surrounded by large amounts of outfield. In coastal areas fertiliser included seaweed and around the major burghs urban refuse was used. Yields were fairly low, often around three times the quantity of seed sown, although they could reach twice that yield on some infields.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{had practiced}} two-field agriculture, with a crop grown in one {{field and the}} other <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> and {{ploughed}} under to eliminate weeds. Systematic agriculture largely disappeared and yields declined. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian which began in 541 and recurred periodically for 150 years thereafter killed as many as 100 million people across the world. Some historians such as Josiah C. Russell (1958) have suggested a total European population loss of 50 to 60 per cent between 541 and 700. After the year 750, major epidemic diseases did not appear again in Europe until the Black Death of the 14th century. The disease Smallpox which was eradicated in the late 20th Century did not definitively enter Western Europe until about 581 when Bishop Gregory of Tours provided an eyewitness account that describes the characteristic findings of smallpox. Waves of epidemics wiped out large rural populations. Most of the details about the epidemics are lost, {{probably due to the}} scarcity of surviving written records.|$|E
25|$|Since the 49th {{year was}} already a sabbatical year, the land was {{required}} to be <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> during it, but if the 50th year also had to be kept fallow, as the Jubilee, then no new crops would be available for two years, and only the summer fruits would be available for the following year, creating a much greater risk of starvation overall; Judah the Prince contended that the jubilee year was identical with the sabbatical 49th year. However, the majority of classical rabbis believed that the biblical phrase hallow the fiftieth year, together with the biblical promise {{that there would be}} three years worth of fruit in the sixth year, implies that the jubilee year was the 50th year. The opinion of the Geonim, and generally of later authorities, was that prior to the Babylonian captivity the Jubilee was the intercalation of the 50th year, but after the captivity ended the Jubilee was essentially ignored, except for the blast of the shofar, and coincided with the sabbatical 49th year; the reason was that the Jubilee was only to be observed when the Jews controlled all of Canaan, including the territories of Reuben and Gad and the eastern half-tribe of Manasseh.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} owned most of {{the land}} used by the modern agricultural sector and leased it to tenants (for example, the Gezira Scheme) or to private entrepreneurs, such as most operators of large-scale mechanized rainfed farming. In the late 1980s, however, the great area of land used for pasture and for subsistence cultivation was communally owned under customary land laws that varied somewhat by location but followed a broadly similar pattern. In agricultural communities, the right to cultivate an area of unused land became vested in the individual who cleared it for use. The rights to such land could be passed on to heirs, but ordinarily the land could not be sold or otherwise disposed of. The right was also retained to land <b>left</b> in <b>fallow,</b> although in Bahr al Ghazal, Aali an Nil, and Al Istiwai there were communities where another individual could claim such land by clearing it.|$|R
500|$|By [...] 900, {{developments}} in iron smelting allowed for increased production in Europe, leading to {{developments in}} the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs, hand tools and horse shoes. The carruca heavy plough improved on the earlier scratch plough, with the adoption of the Chinese mouldboard plough to turn over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of northern European forests and an increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population. At the same time, some farmers in Europe moved from a two field crop rotation to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was <b>left</b> <b>fallow</b> every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations permitted nitrogen-fixing legumes such as peas, lentils and beans. Improved horse harnesses and the whippletree further improved cultivation.|$|E

500|$|The Romans {{had used}} a two-field crop {{rotation}} agricultural system, but from the 8th century on, a three-field system became more common. [...] One field would be sown with a winter crop, the second with a spring crop, and the third <b>left</b> <b>fallow.</b> [...] This allowed a greater amount of spring crop of oats to be grown, which provided fodder for horses. Another advance during the Middle Ages was {{the development of the}} heavy mouldboard plough, which allowed dense and heavy soils to be tilled easily; this technology required the use of larger teams of draught animals including oxen and horses, as well as the adoption of larger fields. [...] Particularly after the 12th century, the increased use of both the horse collar and [...] use of iron horse shoes allowed horsepower to be directed more efficiently. Horse teams usually were four horses, or perhaps six, as compared to eight oxen, and the lesser numbers compensated {{for the fact that the}} horses needed to be fed grain on top of pasture, unlike oxen. The increased speed of horses also allowed more land to be ploughed in a day, with an eight ox plough team averaging half of an acre per day, but a horse team averaged a full acre per day.|$|E

50|$|In {{many areas}} sow thistles are {{considered}} noxious weeds, {{as they grow}} quickly {{in a wide range}} of conditions and their wind-borne seeds allow them to spread rapidly. Sonchus arvensis, the perennial sow thistle, is considered the most economically detrimental, as it can crowd commercial crops, is a heavy consumer of nitrogen in soils, may deplete soil water of land <b>left</b> to <b>fallow,</b> and can regrow and sprout additional plants from its creeping roots. However, sow thistles are easily uprooted by hand, and their soft stems present little resistance to slashing or mowing. Most livestock will readily devour sow thistle in preference to grass, and this lettuce-relative is edible and nutritious to humans — in fact this is the meaning of the second part of the Latin name of the common sow thistle, oleraceus. Attempts at weed control by herbicidal use, to the neglect of other methods, may have led to a proliferation of this species in some environments.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{changes in}} land use between 1945 and 1996, {{as well as}} current farm-management practices, to identify factors which may be intervening to prevent or delay {{the negative impact of}} population growth on the environment in Kabale District, Uganda. Transects conducted in 1945 provided the baseline against which we measured changes in land use; we also interviewed farmers concerning their management of individual fields. We found that a higher proportion of land was being <b>left</b> to <b>fallow</b> in 1996 than in 1945. Grazing land has been relocated from marginal land on steep back slopes to valley pastures reclaimed from wetlands. In 1996, the land allocated for woodlots was more than double that in 1945.

500|$|The {{system of}} infield and outfield agriculture, a {{variation}} of open field farming widely used across Europe, may have been introduced with feudalism and would continue until the eighteenth century.

40|$|Three tillage {{systems were}} {{compared}} over the 1973 - 74 spring-summer season on two trial sites. One trial site was tilled and <b>left</b> to <b>fallow</b> over the winter, {{while the other}} was left in pasture. The three tillage systems studied were:- 1. traditional plough/disc/harrow 2. direct-drilling or chemical tillage 3. rotary-cultivation. There {{were no significant differences}} between treatmens in the subsequent establishment and yield of dry matter of a crop of chou moellier on the trial site which had been <b>left</b> to <b>fallow.</b> On the non-fallowed site, direct-drilling resuited in a significantly lower number of plants compared to the other tillage treatments. Despite this, dry matter yields were highest on the direct-drilled plots and lowest in the rotavated treatment. Soil which had been direct-drilled remained the most stable as determined by wet-sieving of soil samples. Soil stability under the rotavated treatment appeared to decrease to a greater extent than under ploughing as the length of time out of pasture increased. Dry-sieving of samples showed the same effect. The rotary cultivation treatment resulted in the greatest proportion of soil in the smaller aggregate size fraction (less than diameter 1. 676 mm). Differences between tillage treatments were also observed in soil resistance as measured by a penetrometer, and resistance to wheel compaction between the non-tilled and the two mechanically tilled treatments. In general the ploughed and rotary-cultivated soil required a lower penetrometer force than the undisturbed direct-drilled profile. On the tracked areas, increase in penetrating force of the two mechanically tilled plots was on average 12 times the increase on the direct-drilled plots. It is probable that soil moisture levels were not affected by cultivation treatment. Differences which occurred, particularly in the non-fallowed trial, were thought to have been an effect of differences in plant density-soil water loss increasing with plant density. Data from the two trials showed that total fuel consumption for direct-drilled and rotary cultivated treatments to be 9. 7 and 1. 9 times respectively, less than the traditional ploughing treatment. This did not include the fuel requirements of weed control, which varied between treatments...|$|R
