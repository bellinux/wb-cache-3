60|$|The {{summer and}} the cricket season brought the battle of Ballhatchet's house to issue. The cricket ground was the field close to it, and for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> {{there had been a}} {{frequent}} custom of despatching juniors to his house for tarts and ginger-beer bottles.

If the lad gets caught, and gets two or three years' imprisonment, it will ruin his {{prospects}} in life. His mother will be broken hearted over the business, and I am sure Aggie will take it terribly to heart. They were great friends of old, though she hasn't seen much of him for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> and, of course, that affair of the other day has made quite a hero of him." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{he closed}} the door behind him, threw himself on his bed, and burst into a passion of tears. The Squire had been a good father to him, and had made him his friend and companion--a {{treatment}} rare indeed at a time when few sons would think of sitting down in their father's presence until told to do so. Since he had left school, eight years before, they had been very much together. For the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> Mark had been a good deal out, but in this his father had encouraged him.|$|E

I used to think I could never bear life if it kept on being the same every day, and I must always be doing things of no consequence, and never know anything greater. But, dear Philip, I think we are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking care of. Is it not right to resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied us?

60|$|When not {{upon the}} walls or in chapel, John {{spent much of}} his time in amusing the children, of whom there were many in the tanner's house. The change from their country quarters, the crowded town, the privation of milk, and the scantiness and unfitness of their rations, soon began to tell upon the little ones, and John felt thankful, indeed, that his mind had been stored with stories from his varied reading of the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> With these, he was able to {{interest}} and quiet the children, who sat round him with wrapt attention, while the booming of the guns and the occasional rattling of musketry outside passed unheeded.|$|E

Possibly, {{if you are willing}} to make concessions of a reasonable kind, I may be able to meet you--and you must remember that the friendship of the Company is of no slight advantage, and would assuredly be of infinite value to you, were your territory invaded by Scindia and the Peishwa. These may, at any moment, make up their differences. Purseram Bhow may again become the commander of the Peishwa's army and, after the manner in which your troops have, for the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> raided his jagheer, he would be your bitterest enemy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You make me so darn tired, Hawk. You {{talk about}} my having to learn to chum with people in overalls.

It took you two weeks to think of me as Forrest Haviland. I'm ashamed of you! If you're a socialist you ought to think that anything you like belongs to you." ...|$|E

When Mrs. Chebec has picked out just the place she wants, I'll help her build the nest. It certainly is good to be back here in the Old Orchard and planning a home once more. We've made a terribly long journey, and I for one am glad it's over." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{shall be}} asked, What {{about all this}} foreign {{investment}} that is going on? Is not British credit now being diverted abroad to foreign countries, {{to the detriment of}} our own country? Is not British capital fleeing from The Socialistic speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the President of the Board of Trade, and taking refuge in Germany, where of course there are no Socialists, or in other countries, where there is never any disturbance, like France, or Spain, or Russia, or Turkey? Now let us look into that. There are only two ways in which capital can leave this country for foreign investments. It is no good sending bits of paper to the foreigner and expecting him to pay a dividend in return. There are only two ways--one is by exports made by British labour, and the other by bullion. Now, if the exports were to increase, surely that should be a cause of rejoicing, especially to our Tariff Reformers, who regard the increase in exports as the index of national prosperity. As for the second--the export of bullion--would you believe it, it is only a coincidence, but it is an amusing coincidence, there are actually six million pounds' worth more gold in the country now, than there were {{at the beginning of the}} year before the Budget was introduced. The active and profitable investment abroad which has marked the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> which is bound to swell the exports of the next few years, has not been attended by any starvation of home industry. On the contrary, the amount of money forthcoming for the development of new industries and now enterprises in this country during the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> has compared very favourably with the years which immediately preceded them, when the Conservative Government was in power.|$|E
60|$|Tess, {{like her}} compeers, soon {{discovered}} {{which of the}} cows had a preference for her style of manipulation, and her fingers having become delicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had subjected herself at intervals during the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years,</b> {{she would have been}} glad to meet the milchers' views in this respect. Out of the whole ninety-five there were eight in particular--Dumpling, Fancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty, Tidy, and Loud--who, though the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots, gave down to her with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the fingers. Knowing, however, the dairyman's wish, she endeavoured conscientiously to take the animals just as they came, expecting the very hard yielders which she could not yet manage.|$|E
60|$|I {{am glad to}} be here. This is {{the hardest}} theatre in New York to get into, even at the front door. I never, got in without hard work. I am glad we have got so far in at <b>last.</b> <b>Two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> ago I had an {{appointment}} to meet Mr. Daly {{on the stage of}} this theatre at eight o'clock in the evening. Well, I got on a train at Hartford to come to New York and keep the appointment. All I had to do was to come to {{the back door of the}} theatre on Sixth Avenue. I did not believe that; I did not believe it could be on Sixth Avenue, but that is what Daly's note said--come to that door, walk right in, and keep the appointment. It looked very easy. It looked easy enough, but I had not much confidence in the Sixth Avenue door.|$|E
60|$|All {{eyes were}} turned. Standing in the {{triangular}} opening which formed {{the door of}} the tent was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had arrived there within the <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> minutes. A dead silence followed his affirmation.|$|R
