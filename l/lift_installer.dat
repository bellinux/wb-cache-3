50|$|Designed by {{architect}} Leslie Green {{the station}} was opened on 22 June 1907 by the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway. Located at the junction of Heath Street and Hampstead High Street, the name Heath Street was proposed for the station before opening: indeed, the original tiled station signs on the platform walls still read Heath Street. Hampstead is on a steep hill and the station platforms are the deepest on the London Underground network, at 58.5 m below ground level. It has the deepest lift shaft on the Underground at 55 m which houses high-speed lifts. They were previously Otis lifts, but were modernised by Wadsworth lifts, & again in 2014 by small generic <b>lift</b> <b>installer</b> Accord. There is also a spiral emergency staircase of over 320 steps.|$|E

50|$|The Singapore {{government}} {{is in the process}} of renovating the older public housing estates. Many of these flats had lifts which only stopped at certain floors (e.g. odd/even numbered or every three floors).
