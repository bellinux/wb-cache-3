Being a smaller network than NBC, TBS goal was to bring as much of OBriens united fan base over to their late-night programs as possible. Thus, to promote the never-before-seen late-night talk show as effectively as he did his tour and documentary, OBrien and TBS developed the Conan blimp. The orange airship, bearing [...] "CONAN" [...] across its side, was designed to engage fans with its social media functions {{and allow them to}} get a better feel for the new TBS programs vibe. This included an interactive blim website with a live map and a <b>livecam</b> to track the blimp, promotional television and YouTube commercials, a Flickr image collection and the #TheConanBlimp hashtag on Twitter. OBrien also developed his own mobile app to share pictures and videos of the Conan cast, crew and blimp.|$|E
