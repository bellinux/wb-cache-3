40|$|<b>Logging</b> {{has been}} a common {{practice}} for monitoring and diagnosing performance issues. However, <b>logging</b> comes at a cost, especially for large-scale online service sys-tems. First, the overhead incurred by intensive <b>logging</b> is non-negligible. Second, it is costly to diagnose a perfor-mance issue if there are {{a tremendous amount of}} redun-dant <b>logs.</b> Therefore, we believe {{that it is important to}} limit the overhead incurred by <b>logging,</b> without sacrific-ing the <b>logging</b> effectiveness. In this paper we propose <b>Log</b> 2, a cost-aware <b>logging</b> mechanism. Given a “bud-get ” (defined as the maximum volume of <b>logs</b> allowed to be output in a time interval), <b>Log</b> 2 makes the “whether to <b>log</b> ” decision through a two-phase filtering mechanism. In the first phase, a large number of irrelevant <b>logs</b> are discarded efficiently. In the second phase, useful <b>logs</b> are cached and output while complying with <b>logging</b> budget. In this way, <b>Log</b> 2 keeps the useful <b>logs</b> and discards the less useful ones.

40|$|A {{new type}} of <b>logs,</b> the command <b>log,</b> is being {{employed}} to replace the traditional data <b>log</b> (e. g., ARIES <b>log)</b> in the in-memory databases. Instead of recording how the tuples are updated, a command <b>log</b> only tracks the transactions being executed, thereby effectively reducing {{the size of the}} <b>log</b> and improving the performance. Command <b>logging</b> on the other hand increases the cost of recovery, because all the transactions in the <b>log</b> after the last checkpoint must be completely redone in case of a failure. In this paper, we first extend the command <b>logging</b> technique to a distributed environment, where all the nodes can perform recovery in parallel.
