40|$|A {{research}} organization responds {{to a variety}} of customer requests. Each high level request is broken down into a set of <b>low</b> level <b>requests.</b> For each <b>low</b> level <b>request,</b> the {{research organization}} follows a multi-step process: access, acquire, analyze and report. The customer is given an estimate of whether its request will be met, and if not, why not. The explanation may be provided at multiple levels of granularity including request level (e. g. <b>low</b> level <b>request</b> X cannot be fulfilled) and step level (e. g. the problem lies with acquisition). Available databases contain an incomplete history of past requests as well as information about current staffing and resources. The challenge is to provide an estimate of current capabilities for satisfying requests in general and to estimate the probability for meeting a specific incoming request. This paper proposes an abstract process model and an aggregation strategy for combining evidence across multiple levels of granularity into estimates that meet these challenges. It specifies an approach for constructing query-specific Bayesian networks in response to queries from the customers and research organization management. ...|$|R

For a particular single-chip system, a maximum 29 % bandwidth improvement and 60 % latency improvement are achieved when using the more efficient queue structures. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Due to high buffer and {{bandwidth}} requirement {{and rate}} variability of compressed video, delivering video {{across the wide}} area networks is a challenging issue. Proxy servers {{have been used to}} reduce bandwidth requirement and improve client access time on the internet by caching the passing data. In this paper, we propose a unique VoD architecture and On-line dynamic buffer allocation algorithm for efficient buffer and bandwidth management. This scheme reduces the bandwidth requirement between the main multimedia sever and the Proxy servers. Also reduces the client waiting time by sharing the videos among the proxy servers of the Local proxy servers group, by allocating and then reallocating the buffer at Proxy sever (PS) dynamically based on the current frame size. The proposed scheme results in efficient usage of buffer and bandwidth for the videos, very <b>low</b> <b>request</b> rejection ratio. And also results in low client waiting time by balancing the load among the neighboring proxy servers and non neighboring proxy servers of LPSG. And reduction of load on the main multimedia server by storing more number of frequently used videos at PS. Our simulation results shows very high buffer and bandwidth utilization, acceptable waiting time for user requests in all conditions, load sharing among the proxy servers and between the main multimedia server and proxy server with tracker’s coordination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a closed-loop (demand-driven) approach towards VoD services, called multicast with caching (Mcache). Servers use multicast to reduce bandwidth usage by serving multiple requests using a single data stream. However, this requires clients to delay receiving the movie until the multicast starts. Using regional cache servers, Mcache removes initial playout delays at clients, because clients can receive the pre x of a requested clip from regional caches {{while waiting for}} the multicast to start. In addition, the multicast containing the later portion of the movie can wait until the pre x is played out. While this use of caches has been proposed before, the novelty of our scheme lies in that the requests coming after the multicast starts can still be batched together to be served by multicast patches without any playout delays. The use of patches has been proposed to be used either with unicast or with playout delays. Mcache effectively hires the idea of a multicast patch with caches to provide a truly adaptive VoD service whose bandwidth usage is up to par with the best known openloop schemes under high request rates while using only minimal bandwidth under <b>low</b> <b>request</b> rates. In addition, ef cient use of multicast and caches removes the need for a priori knowledge of client request rates and client disk storage requirements which some of the existing schemes assume. This makes Mcache ideal for the current heterogeneous Internet environments where those parameters are hard to predict. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{conditions}} under which peer-to-peer (P 2 P) technology may be beneficial in providing IPTV services over typical network architectures. It has three major contributions. First, we contrast two network models used to study the performance of such a system: a commonly used logical “Internet as a cloud” model and a “physical ” model that reflects the characteristics of the underlying network. Specifically, we show that the cloud model overlooks important architectural aspects of the network and may drastically overstate the benefits of P 2 P technology by a factor of 3 or more. Second, we propose an algorithm called Zebra that pre-stripes content across multiple peers during idle hours to speed up P 2 P content delivery in an IPTV environment with limited upload bandwidth. We also perform simulations to measure Zebra’s effectiveness at reducing load on the content server during peek hours. Third, we provide a cost-benefit analysis of P 2 P video content delivery, focusing on the profit trade-offs for different pricing/incentive models rather than purely on capacity maximization. In particular, we find that under high volume of video demand, a P 2 P built-in incentive model performs better than any other model, while the conventional no-P 2 P model generates more profits when the request rate is low. The flat-reward model generally falls in between the usage-based model and the built-in model in terms of profitability except for <b>low</b> <b>request</b> rates.
