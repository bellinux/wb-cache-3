40|$|In the past, Ion beam {{diagnostics}} on FEEP thrusters {{was performed}} by means of simple electrostatic wire probes, which yield qualitative information on the ion current density distribution in the beam, integrated over {{the length of the}} probe. As these probes are neither suited to local investigation, nor capable of electron temperature and plasma potential measurement, some tests with double <b>Langmuir</b> <b>probes</b> have been recently carried out at Centrospazio. The aim of the activity was to develop a simple but nonetheless effective diagnostic tool for the investigation of phenomena occurring in the plasma plume of a FEEP thruster. To this end, the classical theory of electrost:ltic <b>Langmuir</b> <b>probes</b> was reviewed and adapted to the specific case of a plume with high directed ion velocities. In this modified theory the thruster plume is modelled as a collisionless and quasi-neutral plasma without external magnetic fields; the complex phenomena occurring in the immediate proximity of the probe are simplified and represented through the model of a wake region downstream of the probe. Secondary electron emission from the probe surface due to high-energy impacts of ions is taken into account through a constant current amplification factor. The experlmental part of this work comprised the construction of two double filament <b>Langmuir</b> <b>probes</b> and their integration in an existing FEEP test facility. A subsequent series of tests demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of <b>Langmuir</b> <b>probing</b> in a rarefied, high-velocity FEEP ion beam. Data obtained during these tests was analyzed and compared with theoretical previsions. It is shown that this technique is capable of providing conclusive results for two major quantities such as the specific plasma density and the electron temperature...|$|R

Significant wake perturbations in plasma density and temperature were found due to the probe body itself, even though the probes were of the order of or smaller than the Debye length. The largest effects of the wake are seen in the electron collection characteristics of the probe. The wake of small probes show apparent magnetic field aligned structure, even though the probes were much smaller than the ion gyroradius.
