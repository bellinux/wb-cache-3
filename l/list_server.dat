50|$|LIMDEP {{supports}} a <b>list</b> <b>server</b> based discussion group. Anyone (users and interested nonusers) may {{subscribe to the}} <b>list</b> <b>server.</b> The <b>list</b> <b>server</b> is maintained at the University of Sydney.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{mailing list}} servers may {{be set to}} forward {{messages}} to subscribers of a particular mailing list either individually as they are received by the <b>list</b> <b>server,</b> or in digest form in which all messages received on a particular day by the <b>list</b> <b>server</b> are combined into one email that is sent once per day to subscribers. Some mailing lists allow individual subscribers to decide how they prefer to receive messages from the <b>list</b> <b>server</b> (individual or digest).|$|E
50|$|Another {{special case}} are mailing lists, where the <b>list</b> <b>server</b> rewrites all reverse paths {{to its own}} error {{handling}} address for bounces (error messages) by recipients. The <b>list</b> <b>server</b> could automatically unsubscribe bouncing recipients. This type of address rewriting is known since RFC 821 and still used today (RFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, updated the SMTP chapter in RFC 1123).|$|E
5000|$|When it was released, qmail was {{significantly}} faster than Sendmail, particularly for bulk mail {{tasks such as}} mailing <b>list</b> <b>servers.</b> qmail was originally designed {{as a way for}} managing large mailing lists ...|$|R
5000|$|Yet {{another form}} of list is the yellow list which is a <b>list</b> of email <b>server</b> IP {{addresses}} that send mostly good email but do send some spam. Examples include Yahoo, Hotmail, and Gmail. A yellow <b>listed</b> <b>server</b> is a server that should never be accidentally blacklisted. The yellow list is checked first and if listed then blacklist tests are ignored.|$|R
50|$|Station {{directory}} services keep {{a current}} list of active Internet radio stations, their URI and streaming formats and list them sorted by genre, location, language and other criteria. Many devices use either proprietary vendor-specific station <b>list</b> <b>servers</b> or dedicated directory services.|$|R
50|$|Servernet was {{developed}} by Epic Games to provide a method of server to server link between <b>List</b> <b>Server</b> Applications hosted.|$|E
5000|$|RLS {{services}} (auid = rls-services). A Resource <b>List</b> <b>Server</b> (RLS) services {{application is}} Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application whereby a server receives SIP SUBSCRIBE requests for resource, and generates subscriptions towards the resource list.|$|E
50|$|MailEnable's {{features}} include support for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP email protocols with SSL/TLS support, <b>list</b> <b>server,</b> anti-virus and anti-spam and webmail functionality.

5000|$|It {{allows for}} a <b>list</b> of <b>servers,</b> and {{security}} as it has a user name login with password, which also appears ingame. The format of HyperLobby is with a <b>list</b> of <b>servers,</b> players, with abilities to add friends to a contact <b>list</b> and save <b>servers</b> into a favourite list. A chat function is also facilitated for [...] and new users can ask members in the chat for assistance.|$|R

50|$|Most {{of these}} issues may be addressed. E.g., botnets may expirefaster because users notice the high CPU load and takecounter-measures, and mailing <b>list</b> <b>servers</b> can be {{registered}} in whitelists on the subscribers' hosts and thus be relieved from the hashcashchallenges. But they represent serious obstacles to hashcashdeployment that remain to be addressed.|$|R
50|$|In October 1998, Offenberger founded Super Hero News, an Internet-based comics-news service {{utilizing}} the Yahoo! <b>List</b> <b>server.</b> While the service primarily distributes affiliate press releases, it's {{also been used}} as a vehicle for debate and contention by some of its members.|$|E

50|$|A website {{was created}} in 2001 by Brad Baker called stoporbs.org, to offer {{assistance}} to other mail administrators who had been listed on the ORBS blacklist {{for reasons other than}} open relays. Many administrators felt that by <b>listing</b> <b>servers</b> for other than the reasons advertised (open relays), the list was not reliable for the supposed purpose.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{has become}} a major {{resource}} for virtual organizations, and it has given new prominence to human discourse as a continuing source of knowledge. With the growth of usage of <b>list</b> <b>servers</b> and the World Wide Web, it is important to model and support the processes by which knowledge is acquired and disseminated through the net. The global virtual organizations of distributed intelligent agents, that is the Internet community at large, provides a `cybernetic living expert system' with a scope and scale well beyond that yet conceivable with computer-based systems alone. In developing new support tools is one asks "what is the starting point for the person seeking information, the existing information that is the basis for their search. " A support tool is then one that takes that existing information and uses it to present further information that is likely to be relevant. Such information may include relevant concepts, text, existing documents, people, sites, <b>list</b> <b>servers,</b> news gr [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the first conference, the {{organizers}} and sponsors continued to produce the event for 4 years. In 1995 the conference materials were also posted on the brand-new World Wide Web and accessible to a few people through the NCSA Mosaic browser. However, few people in the simulation industry had this type of access to the Internet in 1995, so most of the distribution and discussion continued to be managed via the Majordomo <b>list</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E

50|$|The MCWG {{was founded}} by Ed Gerck in 1997 and had {{participants}} from 26 countries. The discussions were public as in a <b>list</b> <b>server</b> but with a privacy innovation—the participants' names and email addresses were anonymized. This privacy feature, which any participant could break voluntarily by simply disclosing name and email address in the list, allowed the discussion to proceed on a technical level more easily, with less ad hominem attacks. This also allowed unwitting competitors to collaborate, creating an open climate.|$|E
5000|$|Players {{stepped in}} by listing servers on their clan websites. In 1996 this process became {{automated}} {{with the first}} server browsers: one integrated into Diablo via Battle.net, the other a desktop application for Quake players called QSpy (which became GameSpy Arcade). In both cases a [...] "master server" [...] stored and transmitted a list of IPs; Diablo also featured a contacts <b>list.</b> <b>Server</b> browsers made online gaming easy {{for the first time}} and its popularity grew rapidly as a result.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} testing phase in 2002, some {{information}} was revealed {{about the program}} via the Half-Life Dedicated Server mailing lists. It can detect versions of [...] "OGC's OpenGl Hack," [...] OpenGL cheats, and also detects CD key changers as cheats. Information on detected cheaters {{is sent to the}} ban <b>list</b> <b>server</b> on IP address 205.158.143.67 on port 27013, which was later changed to 27011. There is also a [...] "master ban list" [...] server. RAM/hardware errors detected by VAC may kick the player from the server, but not ban them.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of other}} auto replies are {{vacation}} mails, challenges from challenge-response spam filtering, replies from <b>list</b> <b>servers,</b> and feedback reports. These other auto replies {{are discussed in}} RFC 3834: auto replies {{should be sent to}} the Return-Path stated in the received mail which has triggered the auto reply, and this response is typically sent with an empty Return-Path; otherwise auto responders could be trapped in sending auto replies back and forth.|$|R
50|$|But {{when more}} than one server is {{returned}} for an MX query, the preference number for each record dictates the relative priority of the <b>listed</b> <b>server.</b> When a remote client (typically another mail server) does an MX lookup for the domain name, it gets a <b>list</b> of <b>servers</b> and their preference numbers. The smallest preference number has the highest priority and any server with the smallest preference number must be tried first. To provide reliable mail transmission, the SMTP client {{must be able to}} try (and retry) each of the relevant addresses in this list in order, until a delivery attempt succeeds. If {{there is more than one}} MX record with the same preference number, all of those must be tried before moving on to lower-priority entries.|$|R

50|$|Later {{on there}} was a mailing list {{organized}} through scifaiku.com (first post 15 February 1998). After problems with that mailing <b>list</b> <b>server,</b> the scifaiku list moved to Yahoo! Groups on 17 March 2001. As of 22 July 2006 there have been over 13,000 posts just on the scifaiku mailing list at Yahoo! Groups. From the home page: This group is for the writing and sharing of science fiction haiku (aka scifaiku). We also occasionally write similar genres, such as fantasy haiku and horror haiku. The members also write SF poems using other short poetry forms, such as waka, senryū, sijo, kanshi, etc.|$|E
50|$|The South African Ringing Scheme (SAFRING) {{is based}} at the University of Cape Town and {{provides}} bird ringing services in South Africa and other African countries. This entails providing ringing equipment to qualified ringers, and curating all ringing data. SAFRING communicates with ringers and interested parties through annually publishing one or two issues of a newsletter, Afring News, and by maintaining a <b>list</b> <b>server.</b> SAFRING holds national training courses, annually if there is sufficient demand. SAFRING liaises with the provinces who have the responsibility of issuing permits. SAFRING has a strict code of ethics {{to ensure the safety}} of birds handled. SAFRING acknowledges the importance of bird ringing in that it has been described as the most important tool in ornithology in the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|An {{organization}} was first {{registered in the}} state of New Jersey in the early 1992 under the name [...] "Association of Chinese Professionals" [...] (ACP) with a Chinese name [...] "中华专业人士协会". At that time, the first wave of the students from Mainland China was graduating from graduate schools and entering into the American work force. Many of them felt the need for having means to get reconnected to their peers after leaving schools. A Ph. D. graduate from Georgia Tech Mr. Wenming Kuai (蒯文明） made the first call by sending an email for this organization. Later a mailing list on listserver at emailogy.com was requested by Kuai to enable communications between the members. The <b>list</b> <b>server</b> was maintained by Xuning Shan (单旭宁），a Ph.D. graduate from Johns Hopkins University and a computer and network guru. Kuai's call for the organization received worldwide responses. The original name of the {{organization was}} called Chinese Professional Club (CPC). CPC was loosely organized as a social network. But the members felt the need to formalize the organization structure. A preparatory committee of twelve members was formed. The twelve members are Wenming Kuai (蒯文明), Kai Liu (刘凯), Zhaohua Deng (邓照华), Andrew Chu (初迅), Yadong Liu (刘亚东), Lingxiong Shao (邵凌雄), Taoyun Wang (王桃云), Jiaqin Yang (杨家勤), Dan Luo (罗丹), Yang Wang (王阳), Renda Yuan (袁仁达) and Fan Yang (扬凡) [...] also jokingly known as [...] "The Dirty Dozen". Lingxiong Shao, a Ph.D. a research assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania, took the task to register ACP as a non-profit organization in the State of New Jersey. In the meantime, a Board of Trustees was formed and the Constitution was created in accordance with the laws. The Board of Trustees consisted of 16 members, 12 of which were Executive Committee members and 4 were chairmen of Special Interest Groups (SIG). The 12 members of the preparatory committee formed the Executive Committee. Dr. Wenming Kuai was elected the first President of the organization and Dr. Kai Liu was the first Vice President. Andrew Chu was the Regional Chapter Coordinator. Zhaohua Deng was the Treasurer. Yadong Liu was the Mmebership Manager. Dan Luo was the Special Project Manager. Lingxiong Shao was the Network and Legal Manager. Taoyun Wang was the Editor-in-Chief of ACP Mutual, an ACP official newsletter. Yang Wang was the Special Interest Group (SIG) Coordinator. Jiaqin Yang was the Business SIG Chairman. Renda Yuan was the General Secretary. Fan Yang was the Director of Public Relations. The other 4 members of Board of Trustees are Minqi Bao (鲍民齐）, the Physics SIG Chairman; Huamin Ma （马华民）, ACP-EAM SIG Chairman； Dex Shi (施德祥）, the Entrepreneur SIG Chairman； and Ninjian Wang（王宁建）, the Computer Software SIG Chairman.|$|E
