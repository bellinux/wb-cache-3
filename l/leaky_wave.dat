40|$|<b>Leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna {{continuously}} {{attracts a}} lot interests for tuning the radiation direction {{over a large}} angle. Various types of <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna have been developed since 1940. However, most of these <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antennas suffered from their excessive volume and the required wide range of operating frequency (bandwidth) to achieve a large tuning angle. To circumvent these challenges, research in this thesis is focused on implementation of material (like PZT) with high dielectric constant (k) in a rectangular waveguide <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna. Due to the high dielectric constant of PZT ~ 1, 900, the propagation wavelength in the waveguide can be dramatically shortened. This allows the <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna to be operated at much lower frequency, or {{to have a significant}} volume reduction. In addition, using high k material enables bandwidth narrowing. In experiments, 70 degree tuning angle was observed by changing frequency from 2. 1217 GHz to 2. 235 GHz in a proto-type <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna filled with material of.

40|$|This {{review paper}} {{summarizes}} {{various aspects of}} directive beaming and explains these aspects in terms of <b>leaky</b> <b>waves.</b> Directive beaming occurs in antenna design where a narrow beam is obtainable by using fairly simple planar structures excited by a single source. These structures include Fabry-Pérot cavity structures as well as metamaterial structures made from artificial low-permittivity media.

40|$|Abstract: As an {{acoustic}} wave travels {{in a single}} or multilayer plate it reflects multiple times with the plate’s outermost boundaries and any internal interfaces. Due to the coupling between the longitudinal and transverse (shear vertical) waves the number of waves to track, and in turn the number of reflection and transmission calculations, increases exponentially with each internal reflection (or the distance traveled through the plate). By utilizing a ray technique and considering some basic properties of physics, mathematics, acoustics, and computing {{it is possible to}} simplify the process of tracking the acoustic waves, and reduce the number of calculations which determine the multiple reflections in the plate, and the transmissions of <b>leaky</b> <b>waves</b> outside of the plate. This allows the <b>leaky</b> <b>waves</b> to be calculated in a more efficient manner, especially as the distance from the acoustic source increases (or the number of internal reflections increase). By extending the ray to a plane wave (or wave of finite size) and considering the properties of acoustic waves (such as frequency, pulse shapes, and superposition effects) more realistic <b>leaky</b> <b>waves</b> can be calculated.

40|$|In this work, a {{continuously}} electrically tunable metamaterial <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna for Ka-band applications is designed, manufactured and investigated, {{which features}} one dimensional beam steering capabilities. The antenna concept is developed {{based on the}} theory of <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antennas and metamaterials. <b>Leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antennas provide low profile and high directivity while metamaterials offer design flexibility by means of dispersion engineering. Additionally, liquid crystal is employed as tunable material to achieve voltage tunable beam scanning. The design, implementation and characterization of the voltage tunable metamaterial unit cell that makes up the <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna is described in detail. The design {{and analysis of the}} dispersion characteristic of the unit cell is based on equivalent circuit, analytical and full-wave models. Moreover, tunability and loss analysis as well as far field investigations are carried out. Since technological constraints limit the feasibility of the unit cell, their influence on the design and fabrication process of the antenna is analyzed. Considering these constraints, a fabrication process that combines microwave structures with resistive voltage biasing networks and liquid crystal cavities is developed in this work. Different manufactured antenna prototypes are presented. A magnetically biased <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna, which uses a static magnetic field to achieve a beam steering at 27 GHz is used to demonstrate and investigate the proposed unit cell concept. In addition, an electrically biased <b>leaky</b> <b>wave</b> antenna, where the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is changed by a tuning voltage that yields voltage beam scanning capability around 27 GHz is developed. Simulation, vectorial network analysis and far field measurement results of both prototypes are compared and a detailed analysis of the magnetic and electric biasing techniques is presented.
