2500|$|Ruppelt {{concluded}} that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories {{were designed to}} make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote [...] "to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him...he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'" [...] According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, [...] "you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop" [...] in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted {{that many of his}} listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 12, 2006 Timothy James Truett of Montgomery Village {{allegedly}} made a [...] "call to Ali's {{office in}} which he asked if Ali was a Muslim and made derogatory remarks about Islam to Ali's campaign manager." [...] Afterward, Truett drove to [...] "the cul-de-sac outside Ali's Gaithersburg home, which doubles as his campaign office." [...] There, {{he sat down in}} a lawn chair near the home [...] "with a hand-lettered sign bearing a crude denunciation of Islam" [...] Truett [...] "wore a T-shirt reading 'This mind is an Allah-free zone'." [...] Ali went out to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and take pictures but did not speak to him, explaining [...] "I knew he was there to bait me." [...] Ali later recalled [...] "I felt like he was intimidating and trying to menace me and my family, similar to when people burned crosses in someone's front yard. I think it was the exact same message." [...] Ali's wife stepped outside and took pictures of Truett. [...] An older man approached Truett and offered him some water. Ali then spoke to the older man and the older man went back inside. Ali placed one of his campaign yard signs next to Truett and took a picture. [...] Truett then got up and left. Ali followed him and got pictures of his license plate. Truett then phoned Ali's office again but was hung up on. [...] Ali later posted pictures of Truett, Truett's birth date and address on his campaign web site.|$|E

60|$|When he had {{finished}} reading, Chauvelin quietly folded the paper up again, and then only did he <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> and the woman before him.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> boy <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man.</b> There was {{an excited}} {{appearance}} upon the broker's features.|$|R

60|$|Strangely Knell did {{not even}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{he was about to}} denounce. He leaned toward Poggin, his hands, his body, his long head all {{somewhat}} expressive of what his face disguised.|$|E
60|$|He bent {{once more}} over his work. I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{by my side}} in bewilderment.|$|R
60|$|Cliffe had not {{expected}} to be addressed in good English, and he <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> with surprise.|$|R
60|$|Oliver <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> in some surprise, for {{he spoke}} gruffly, almost angrily, and was evidently in earnest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look again!" [...] cried Anteek, pushing {{forward at}} that moment. [...] "He {{is not a}} Fire-spouter. He is one of us! But the one in front is a Fire-spouter woman. <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man!</b> Don't you know him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Since {{that time}} the boy used to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> every time he came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away before he met the smith's eye. It made Dawes furious. They hated each other in silence.|$|E
60|$|He {{bowed his}} head slightly, and stood by the table whilst the two men {{prepared}} to go. Chauvelin took a final long <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> whom he firmly believed he had at last brought down to abject disgrace.|$|E
60|$|Kit thanked him, and then, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> thoughtfully, {{added that}} he doubted if the things would fit.|$|R
6000|$|Instantly Thursday Smith {{straightened}} up and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> questioningly. Fogerty stretched {{out his hand and}} said, as if in wonder: ...|$|R

60|$|He {{spoke in}} French that the cook might not {{understand}} the sinister portent of his words. When he had done he banged out of the cabin without another <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who had interrupted him in his sorry work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and all hoarded up {{for sale}} by a poor {{creature}} with a lazy brute of a husband, who lets his wife {{do all the work}} while he spends all the money," [...] answered the woman, with a malicious <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> by her side.|$|E
60|$|Unvanquished philosopher!

60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{with some}} attention. He {{came from the}} city I {{intended}} to visit, and perhaps he might give me some information.|$|R
60|$|It is {{possible}} that few men under the circumstances would have framed their answer as Maxwell did; {{but he was in}} all things loyal, as his listener recognized. She was once more mistress of herself, but she did not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> as she answered him.|$|E
60|$|The sleeper moving an arm, he {{sat down}} again in his chair, and feigned to watch the storm from the window. It was a grand spectacle, but not so grand as to keep his eyes, for half a minute together, from {{stealing}} a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> upon the bed.|$|E
60|$|THE {{remaining}} external {{incidents of}} Fleeming's life, pleasures, honours, fresh interests, new friends, are not such as will bear {{to be told}} at any length or in the temporal order.

60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> {{with horror}} and surprise, and then glanced suspiciously at Philip. She {{saw that his}} eyes were laughing. She frowned a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "Was there {{anything}} found on him?" [...] said Dorian, leaning forward and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> with startled eyes. [...] "Anything that would tell his name?" ...|$|R
