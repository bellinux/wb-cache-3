The upright units, around which Brabham had designed their new car, were sold {{for use by the}} Arrows team. Senior figures at Brabham, including Murray, have admitted that by this stage Ecclestone had lost interest in running the team. The 1987 season was only slightly more successful than the previous year—Patrese and de Cesaris scoring 10 points between them, including two third places at the Belgian Grand Prix and the Mexican Grand Prix. Unable to locate a suitable engine supplier, the team missed the FIA deadline for entry into the 1988 world championship and Ecclestone finally announced the team's withdrawal from Formula One at the Brazilian Grand Prix in April 1988. During the season ending Australian Grand Prix, Ecclestone announced he had sold MRD to EuroBrun team owner Walter Brun for an unknown price.|$|E

500|$|Carriage of the {{existing}} Red Beard tactical nuclear bomb had been specified {{at the beginning of}} the TSR-2 project, but it was quickly realised that Red Beard was unsuited to external carriage at supersonic speeds, had safety and handling limitations, and its 15-kt yield was considered inadequate for the targets assigned. Instead, in 1959, a successor to Red Beard, an [...] "Improved Kiloton Bomb" [...] to a specification known as Operational Requirement 1177 (OR.1177), was specified for the TSR-2. [...] In the tactical strike role, the TSR-2 was expected to attack targets beyond the forward edge of the battlefield assigned to the RAF by NATO, during day or night and in all weathers. These targets comprised missile sites, both hardened and soft, aircraft on airfields, runways, airfield buildings, airfield fuel installations and bomb stores, tank concentrations, ammunition and supply dumps, railways and railway tunnels, and bridges. OR.1177 specified 50, 100, 200 and 300-kt yields, assuming a circular error probable of [...] and a damage probability of 0.8, and <b>laydown</b> delivery capability, with burst heights for targets from 0 to [...] above sea level. Other requirements were a weight of up to , a length of up to , and a diameter up to [...] (the same as Red Beard).|$|E

This paper attempts {{to determine whether}} the United States has appropriately scaled its maritime response to humanitarian disasters within the Pacific Region. The presence of excess capacity presents a number of difficulties and may indicate a failure to properly anticipate the operational environment due to the distinctive humanitarian nature of disaster assistance operations. By examining the maritime responses to the 2011 Great Japan Earthquake and tsunami, as well as the 2004 Aceh Earthquake and tsunami, I will look for consistencies in response and possible instances of excessive force <b>laydowns</b> in light of each respective disaster scenario. I believe this paper will indicate instances within which U. S. maritime assets do not undertake the role as primary agent in delivering aid and therefore fill operational space with capability that is either excessive or ill suited to the host nation.

5000|$|Hachem said he {{believes}} his discipline and control helps him make good decisions at the right time. He credited his success at the 2005 World Series of Poker in part to his ability to make difficult <b>laydowns.</b> Hachem has also advised amateur players against bluffing too often or without any outs. Hachem said he rarely bluffs without any outs, and only does so when [...] "you're confident the other guy can't stand {{the heat of a}} raise." [...] Hachem said he tries to maintain the same poker face for each hand. During intense hands, he focuses on a point on the table, keeps his breathing under control and tries not to give away any information. Hachem has said he likes playing at featured tables in televised poker tournaments because, [...] "Everyone wants to be on TV, and they are afraid to do anything silly so they don't get ridiculed. I try and take advantage of that." [...] Hachem's talent and personality has drawn him a large fanbase, and people often surround his table to watch him during tournaments.

2500|$|WE.177B weighed , with a fixed {{yield of}} [...] [...] Although it weighed {{in excess of}} 1000lb, it was known in RAF Service as the 'Bomb, Aircraft, HE 950lb MC', to {{differentiate}} it from the conventional 'Bomb, Aircraft, 1000 lb GP HE', which gave rise to its popular name '950'. [...] WE.177B had airburst, impact, or <b>laydown</b> options.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>laydown</b> {{delivery}} requirement, the weapon was also {{required to be}} used in a 'dive toss' mode; from both the TSR-2 (WE.177A/B), and the RAF version of the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 (WE.177A). [...] This involved releasing the weapon after a dive from , with weapon release at between [...] and , and, for the TSR-2, at speeds from Mach0.80 to Mach2.05.|$|E
2500|$|The 0.5kt yield {{was used}} {{only in the}} nuclear depth bomb role for {{detonation}} above [...] in shallow coastal waters, or in oceanic deep waters to limit damage to nearby shipping. [...] The full 10kt yield was used below [...] in deep oceanic waters where no shipping was at risk. [...] The full 10kt yield was also used by fixed-wing aircraft for surface attack.

2500|$|The casing of WE.177 {{was unusually}} robust, and complicated, for a British air-dropped bomb; made {{necessary}} by {{the requirement for}} the <b>laydown</b> delivery options. [...] The stresses from {{the opening of the}} drogue parachutes were particularly severe at the speed anticipated for the BAC TSR-2, the requirement stating a dropping speed of from Mach number M0.75 to M1.15, at a height of [...] for TSR-2; and M0.75 to M0.95 for the Blackburn Buccaneer. [...] This, together with the 'slap down' of the tail on impact required a strong, well-engineered bomb casing to ensure the enclosed warhead remained intact.|$|E

50|$|<b>Laydown</b> {{delivery}} is {{a mode of}} attack using a freefall nuclear weapon: the bomb's descent to the target is slowed by ribbon parachute so that it actually lands on the ground before detonating. <b>Laydown</b> delivery requires the weapon's case to be reinforced {{so that it can}} survive the force of impact and generally involves a time-delay fuze to trigger detonation e.g. 45 seconds after hitting the ground. <b>Laydown</b> mode can be used to increase the effect of the weapon's blast on built-up targets such as submarine pens or to transmit a shock wave through the ground to attack deeply-buried targets. An attack of this type produces large amounts of radioactive fallout.|$|E

50|$|Most {{versions}} of the B61 are equipped with a parachute retarder (currently a 24-ft (7.3 m) diameter nylon/Kevlar chute) to slow the weapon in its descent. This offers the aircraft a chance to escape the blast, or allows the weapon to survive impact with the ground in <b>laydown</b> mode. The B61 can be set for airburst, ground burst, or <b>laydown</b> detonation, and can be released at speeds up to Mach 2 and altitudes as low as 50 ft.|$|E
50|$|Various air-dropping {{techniques}} exist, including toss bombing, parachute-retarded delivery, and <b>laydown</b> modes, {{intended to}} give the dropping aircraft time to escape the ensuing blast.|$|E
50|$|The B53 was 12 ft {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of 50 in. It weighed 8850 lb, including the W53 warhead, the 800 to 900 lb parachute system and the honeycomb aluminum nose cone to enable the bomb to survive <b>laydown</b> delivery. It had five parachutes: one 5 ft pilot chute, one 16 ft extractor chute, and three 48 ft main chutes. Chute deployment depends on delivery mode, with the main chutes used only for <b>laydown</b> delivery. For free-fall delivery, the entire system was jettisoned.|$|E
50|$|In March 1962, the {{squadron}} converted to the Avro Vulcan and {{became part of}} the V-Force of RAF Bomber Command. Their Vulcans were equipped in late 1966 with WE.177 <b>laydown</b> nuclear bombs at RAF Cottesmore in the low-level penetration role and assigned to SACEUR, before spending six years in the same role 1969-74 at RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, as part of the Near East Air Force Wing (NEAF) where {{the squadron}} formed part of the United Kingdom's commitment to CENTO. The years 1975-82 were spent based at RAF Waddington, again assigned to SACEUR, and still equipped with WE.177 nuclear <b>laydown</b> bombs in the low-level penetration role before disbanding in April 1982.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this, since 1998, {{the owners}} of the Wendover potash {{facility}} have worked diligently in conjunction with the BLM to undertake the Salt <b>Laydown</b> Project under which solid salt from ponds located south of highway I-80 is dissolved and pumped on to the Bonneville Salt Flats north of I-80. During the following summer months, heat from the sun vaporizes the water and the precipitated salt becomes part of the race track surface. Since the onset of this project, more than 10.7 million tons of salt have been pumped on to the Bonneville Salt Flats. The Salt <b>Laydown</b> Project is now a required element of the facility’s operating plan.|$|E

5000|$|It has the {{additional}} advantage {{of allowing the}} carrier aircraft to fly very low and still escape from ground zero without being damaged or destroyed by effects of the nuclear explosion. That is particularly important for high-yield nuclear weapons such as the B83 and B53 nuclear bombs. Low-altitude delivery also helps hide the aircraft from surface-to-air missiles. It was for that reason that <b>laydown</b> was selected for the Vickers Valiant bomber of the Royal Air Force, as the design became increasingly vulnerable to Soviet weapons, especially the SA-2 missile. The low-level <b>laydown</b> delivery {{was referred to as}} [...] "Equipment 2 Foxtrot" [...] in RAF parlance; alternatives included [...] "2 Echo" [...] toss bombing and [...] "2 Hotel", a particular climbing delivery method used by the Avro Vulcan.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapon was}} 12 ft long, {{with a body}} {{diameter}} of 4 ft. It weighed 10,670 lb. It was carried only by the B-52 Stratofortress and B-47 Stratojet. It could be deployed in free-fall or aerial (parachute) configuration, and could be set for airburst, groundburst, or <b>laydown</b> delivery.|$|E
50|$|The {{specifications}} for the B77 required Full Fusing Options (FUFO) {{and the ability}} for a low altitude, transonic <b>laydown</b> delivery, {{as well as a}} free fall from supersonic speeds and altitudes of 60,000 feet delivery. To achieve the low-level delivery capability, the B77 employed a gas generator for roll control and a lifting parachute as the initial part of a two-stage parachute system. This combination would actually lift the bomb from a drop altitude of 100 feet to 300 feet for main parachute opening. The roll control/parachute system was tested at Mach 2.2. From a delivery altitude of 100 feet at mach 2.2, the B77 could be slowed to 40 mph allowing the delivery aircraft to be 2.3 miles past ground zero. Actual detonation time could be varied after the <b>laydown</b> had occurred.|$|E
