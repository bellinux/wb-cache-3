40|$|The {{ionophore}} <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> (X 537 A) and its metal salts {{have been}} investigated by high resolution (270 MHz and 360 MHz) proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to obtain structural and kinetic information in nonpolar solution. The proton resonances were assigned from double resonance studies on <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and on its salts, homologs, isomers, and chemically modified derivatives. Studies of proton and carbon longitudinal relaxation time suggest that <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> exists as a monomer, whereas the sodium and barium salts exist as dimers in nonpolar solvents. A study {{of the magnitude of}} the vicinal proton coupling constants and the chemical shifts and linewidths of the hydroxyl resonances suggest that the backbone conformation and intramolecular hydrogen bonds are similar for <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and its sodium and barium salts in nonpolar solvents. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the role of bound solvent molecules suggest a tightly bound water molecule in the barium complex dimer (crystallized from water-ethanol) and a weakly bound ethanol molecule in the <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> monomer (crystallized from ethanol) in cyclohexane. The selective changes in proton chemical shift on complexation [where the polar faces of two lasalocid anions coordinate the metal cation(s) in nonpolar solvents have been analyzed in terms of the proximity of the resonances to the cation, their linkage to the coordinating oxygen atoms, and the magnetic anisotropy effects of the polar groups of one ligand on the resonances of its partner in the dimer. The nuclear magnetic resonance studies in solution are compared with earlier observations on <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and its salts in the crystalline state. Thus, the short Ag-C 5 distance in the crystal structure of silver complex dimer is also observed in the solution structure.

Three polyketide natural products, namely erythromycin A, <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A,</b> and iso-lasalocid A, were subjected to both CAD and EID, and their fragment ions were assigned with sub-part-per-million accuracy. The number of fragment ions detected through EID was much greater than for CAD, leading to a greater amount of structural information obtained for each polyketide, albeit with a decreased signal-to-noise ratio. The effect of different bound cations on the fragment pattern of the isomers <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> and iso-lasalocid A was studied, with CAD and EID performed on the [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + Li]+, and [M + NH 4]+ precursor ions.

Addition of the ionophores to synchronized P. falciparum suspensions revealed that all P. falciparum stages were sensitive to the drugs. However, the schizont stages were three- to ninefold more sensitive, and 12 h was required for complete parasite clearance. Pretreatment of healthy erythrocytes with toxic doses of ionophores for 24 to 48 h showed that the activity was not due to an irreversible effect on the host erythrocyte. No preferential ionophore adsorption in infected or uninfected erythrocytes occurred. On the other hand, ionophore molecules strongly bound to serum proteins since increasing the serum concentration from 2 to 50 % led to almost a 25 -fold parallel increase in the ionophore 50 % inhibitory concentration. Mice infected with the malaria parasites Plasmodium vinckei petteri or Plasmodium chabaudi were successfully treated with eight ionophores in a 4 -day suppressive test. The 50 % effective dose after intraperitoneal administration ranged from 0. 4 to 4. 1 mg/kg of body weight, and the therapeutic indices were about 5 for all ionophores except monensin A methyl ether, 5 -bromo <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A,</b> and gramicidin D, whose therapeutic indices were 12, 18, and 344, respectively.

Our study showed that lasalocid mediated cell cycle arrest in G 0 /G 1 phase by reducing G 1 phase dependent proteins, indicating entering into apoptotic cell death pathway. Lasalocid-induced apoptosis was involved with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. In addition, lasalocid induced autophagy through microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC- 3) -II conversion, acidic vesicular organelles formation and GFP-LC- 3 punctuate, which was inhibited by 3 -methyladenine (3 -MA), a widely used pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, the autophagic phenomena were mediated by production of ROS, confirming that inhibition of ROS with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor, attenuated lasalocid-triggered autophagy.

This study aimed to develop an IMA drug delivery system (IMDS) of lasalocid for the treatment of bovine mastitis. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined applying the procedures recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Solid dispersions (SDs) of lasalocid were prepared and characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. IMDSs containing lasalocid of micronized, nano-sized, or as SD form were tested for their IMA safety in cows. Therapeutic efficacy of lasalocid IMDSs was tested in a bovine model involving experimental IMA challenge with the mastitis pathogen Streptococcus uberis. Results: Lasalocid demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the major Gram-positive mastitis pathogens including S. aureus (MIC range 0. 5 – 8  µg/mL). The solubility test confirmed limited, ion-strength-dependent water solubility of <b>lasalocid.</b> <b>A</b> kinetic solubility study showed that SDs effectively enhanced water solubility of lasalocid (21 – 35 -fold).

40|$|A {{supported}} {{liquid membrane}} (SLM) technique for {{the determination of}} free and labile copper in estuarine and coastal water was developed. The SLM consisted of 10 mM <b>Lasalocid,</b> <b>a</b> naturally occurring carboxylic polyether ionophore, dissolved in o-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE), immobilized on a thin microporous solid membrane. The solid membrane was sandwiched between two aqueous phases: (1) a source or sample solution containing the analyte (in this case free/labile copper) to be extracted and (2) a strip or acceptor solution into which the analyte(s) is trapped. The membrane support was clamped between two circular Teflon blocks each with circular groves like an Archimedes spiral. The SLM was used to extract free and labile copper from water samples collected from two sampling stations, Dumbarton Bridge and San Bruno Shoals in South San Francisco Bay The copper concentration in the SLM extracts was determined off-line by GFAAS. Between 90 - 97 % of the total dissolved copper was bound to organic ligands, and therefore not “bioavailable” to phytoplankton. Thus only about 5 - 10 % of the total dissolved copper existed as inorganic and/or labile organic copper species. The measurements were consistent with earlier copper speciation measurements that were made in South San Francisco Bay using electrochemical methods...|$|E

Title of Diploma Thesis: The {{determination of}} anticoccidials in chicken meat using QuEChERS and HPLC This diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the development of modified QuEChERS method in conjunction with HPLC and UV detection for the determination of five selected anticoccidials - flubendazole, robenidine, diclazuril, toltrazuril and <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A</b> in chicken meat. This thesis deals with the optimization of chromatographic conditions - selection of a suitable stationary and mobile phases, and a suitable wavelength for the UV detection and also deals with optimization of sample preparation using the modified QuEChERS method. At the end of the thesis the method has been partially validated - repeatability, precision, accuracy, linearity, and other parameters were evaluated. For the separation was chosen Ascentis Express Phenyl Hexyl column (4. 6 x 100 mm, 2. 7 micron), and as the mobile phase after a series of experiments was chosen 0. 1 % formic acid pH 4 (pH adjusted with triethylamine) with acetonitrile (50 : 50, v/v). Finally, the test of suitability of the chromatographic system (SST) was performed and the following [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Polycyclic {{polyether}} {{natural products}} have fascinated chemists and biologists alike owing to their useful biological activity, highly complex structure and intriguing biosynthetic mechanisms. Following the original {{proposal for the}} polyepoxide origin of lasalocid and isolasalocid and the experimental determination {{of the origins of}} the oxygen and carbon atoms of both lasalocid and monensin, a unified stereochemical model for the biosynthesis of polyether ionophore antibiotics was proposed. The model was based on a cascade of nucleophilic ring closures of postulated polyepoxide substrates generated by stereospecific oxidation of all-trans polyene polyketide intermediates. Shortly thereafter, a related model was proposed for the biogenesis of marine ladder toxins, involving a series of nominally disfavoured anti-Baldwin, endo-tet epoxide-ring-opening reactions. Recently, we identified Lsd 19 from the Streptomyces lasaliensis gene cluster as the epoxide hydrolase responsible for the epoxide-opening cyclization of bisepoxyprelasalocid A to form <b>lasalocid</b> <b>A.</b> Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of Lsd 19 in complex with its substrate and product analogue to provide the first atomic structure-to our knowledge-of a natural enzyme capable of catalysing the disfavoured epoxide-opening cyclic ether formation. On the basis of our structural and computational studies, we propose a general mechanism for the enzymatic catalysis of polyether natural product biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Clinical SciencesDaniel U. ThomsonBovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the largest animal health concerns in the cattle industry. BRD is a multifaceted group of pathogens, both viral and bacterial, that take advantage of an immune compromised calf to cause disease. This study took aim at comparing metaphylactic treatments for BRD in both the feedlot and pasture setting. In the feedlot study, heifers (n= 579, 403. 7 ± 27. 4 lbs) from Southwest Texas were identified as being high risk for BRD and shipped to the Clayton Livestock Research Center in Clayton, NM. Cattle were randomly allocated within truck load lots into 18 to 20 head treatment pens (30 pens; 3 treatments; 10 reps). Cattle were given one of three metaphylactic treatments based on the randomly assigned treatment for their pen within a replicate. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were fed a typical commercial starter diet for the first 56 - 60 d with a step-up ration change at day 28. At the end of the feeding period, pens were weighed and body weights recorded. Dry Matter Intake, morbidity, and mortality were recorded by CLRC personnel daily. Cattle administered tulathromycin had higher daily gains than cattle administered gamithromycin by 0. 29 lbs/d (P<. 01) and tended (P= 0. 09) have higher daily gains than cattle that received tilmicosin by 0. 18 lbs/d. Tulathromycin treated cattle tended (P = 0. 12) to have improved feed efficiency compared to gamithromycin treated cattle. Cattle that received tulathromycin (5. 2 %) had lower morbidity rates (P <. 02) than tilmicosin (14. 6 %) and gamithromycin (12. 79 %) treated cattle. There were no treatment differences in dry matter intake or mortality in cattle. For the wheat pasture study, heifers (n= 120, 393. 2 ± 28. 6 lbs) from the same origin and risk were shipped to the CLRC and processed before being trailed to a nearby wheat pasture. Cattle were randomly assigned into three treatment groups (3 treatments, 40 reps), and were given one of three metaphylactic treatments. The three antibiotic treatments administered at initial processing were: 1) Tulathromycin (2. 5 mg/kg), 2) Tilmicosin (13. 3 mg/kg), and 3) Gamithromycin (6. 0 mg/kg). Cattle were allowed to graze on wheat for 54 days with free-choice Hi-Pro mineral mixed with <b>Lasalocid,</b> <b>an</b> ionophore. After 54 days on wheat pasture, the cattle were trailed back to the CLRC facilities and final individual weights were recorded. Morbidity and mortality were recorded daily by CLRC personnel. No differences were identified for ADG (P= 0. 98), morbidity (P= 0. 46) or mortality (P= 0. 36) among the three treatment groups...|$|R
40|$|When mixed ruminal {{bacteria}} from cattle fed timothy hay {{were suspended}} {{in a medium}} containing a low concentration of potassium, monensin and <b>lasalocid</b> catalyzed <b>a</b> rapid depletion of potassium from cells. The ionophore-mediated potassium depletion was concentration dependent, and {{it was possible to}} describe the relationship with saturation constants. Mixed ruminal bacteria never lost more than 50 % of their potassium (Kmax = 46 %), and the concentrations of monensin and lasalocid needed to cause half-maximal potassium depletion (Kd) were 178 and 141 nM, respectively. When cattle were fed 350 mg of monensin per day, the ratio of ruminal acetate to propionate decreased from 4. 2 to 2. 9, and the Kd of monensin was eightfold greater than the value for mixed ruminal bacteria from control animals. Monensin supplementation also caused a twofold increase in the Kd of lasalocid. Lasalocid supplementation (350 mg per day) had no effect on the ruminal acetate-to-propionate ratio, but it caused a twofold increase in the Kd values of monensin and lasalocid. Increases in Kd occurred almost immediately after ionophore was added to the ration, and the Kd values returned to their prefeeding values within 14 days of withdrawal. Ionophore supplementation had no effect on the Kmax values, and approximately 50 % of the population was always highly ionophore resistant. Because the Kd values of even adapted ruminal bacteria were low (< 1. 5 microM), it appears that {{a large proportion of the}} ruminal ionophore is bound nonselectively to feed particles or ionophore-resistant bacteria...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in environmental chambers to {{study the effects of}} feeding lasalocid on broiler performance. Birds were randomly assigned at 31 or 35 days of age to one of four treatment groups: hot cyclic (26. 7 to 37. 8 C and 90 to 40 % RH) with basal diet; hot cyclic with lasalocid diet (88 mg/kg); moderate constant (21 C and 50 % RH) with basal diet; or moderate constant with lasalocid diet. All birds were killed and processed 2 wk after the start of each trial. Percentage of carcass yield and fat pad weight were determined. In the moderate temperature regimen, <b>lasalocid</b> feeding caused <b>a</b> depression in the 2 nd wk gain (469 versus 486 g) but not in the final 2 -wk gain. In the hot temperature regimen, birds fed lasalocid gained significantly more weight in the 2 nd wk than those fed the basal diet (341 g versus 325 g) and had a significantly better feed conversion in the 2 nd wk (2. 04 versus 2. 61) and overall (2. 07 versus 2. 32) than those fed the basal diet...|$|R
