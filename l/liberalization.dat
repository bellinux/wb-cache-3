5|$|For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 {{was a year}} of transition. The {{international}} situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut died in March; it was three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Poznań had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events set in motion resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by Władysław Gomułka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomułka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary <b>liberalization.</b> Eventually though, hopes for full <b>liberalization</b> were proven false, as Gomułka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinization in Poland had ended.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies empirically {{the effects}} of and the {{interactions}} amongst economic and political <b>liberalizations.</b> Economic <b>liberalizations</b> are measured by a widely used indicator that captures {{the scope of the}} market in the economy, and in particular of policies towards freer international trade (cf. Sachs and Werner 1995, Wacziarg and Welch 2003). Political <b>liberalizations</b> correspond to the event of becoming a democracy. Using a difference-in-difference estimation, we ask what are {{the effects of}} <b>liberalizations</b> on economic performance, on macroeconomic policy and on structural policies. The main results concern the quantitative relevance of the feedback and interaction effects between the two kinds of reforms. First, we find positive feedback effects between economic and political reforms. The timing of events indicates that causality is more likely to run from political to economic <b>liberalizations,</b> rather than viceversa, but we cannot rule out feedback effects in both directions. Second, the sequence of reforms matters. Countries that first liberalize and then become democracies do much better than countries that pursue the opposite sequence, in almost all dimensions. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} dynamic general {{equilibrium}} trade model, in which heterogeneous intermediate goods are produced and traded in a Melitz (2003) type sector. These intermediate goods {{are used in}} the production of a final good, which can be used for consumption, capital accumulation, or investment in market entry. Therefore capital accumulation is the direct alternative to investing in firm entry. This has a number of implications. First, in the short run following trade <b>liberalizations</b> a higher interest rate will prevail, which will tend to shelter incumbent firms from increased competition by discouraging investment in entry of new firms. Second, different forms of trade <b>liberalizations</b> with the same impact on the share of expenditure on domestic variety will have different effects on consumption, and thus welfare, both during transitions and in steady-state, due to different effects on aggregate investment. Third, the accumulation of capital will add a time dimension to the anti-variety effects of trade <b>liberalizations.</b> In effect, capital accumulation generates rich adjustment dynamics both in the aggregate and at the firm level. Further, the study of transitions in this framework provides important insights regarding the effects of different forms of trade <b>liberalizations</b> in general and on welfare and individual firms in particular. ...|$|R

5|$|Critics of {{the policy}} of {{economic}} <b>liberalization</b> pursued during the Menem Presidency argued that Argentina's economic woes were caused by neoliberalism, which had been actively promoted by the U.S. government and the IMF under the Washington Consensus.

A 2004 report by the IMF's Independent Evaluation Office criticised the IMF's conduct prior to Argentina's economic collapse of 2001, saying the IMF had supported the country's fixed exchange rate for too long, and was too lenient towards fiscal deficits.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} credit constraints {{are an important}} determinant of international trade flows. I exploit shocks to the availability of external finance and {{examine the impact of}} equity market <b>liberalizations</b> on the export behavior of 91 countries in the 1980 - 1997 period. I show that <b>liberalizations</b> increase exports disproportionately more in financially vulnerable sectors that require more outside finance or employ fewer collateralizable assets. This result is not driven by cross-country differences in factor endowments and is independent of simultaneous trade policy reforms. Moreover, it obtains with equal strength in the full panel of countries as well as in both panel and event-study analyses of countries which removed capital controls during the sample period. Finally, the effects of <b>liberalizations</b> are more pronounced in economies with initially less active stock markets, indicating that foreign equity flows may substitute for an underdeveloped domestic financial system. Similarly, opening equity markets has a greater impact in the presence of higher trade costs caused by restrictive trade policies...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} financial <b>liberalizations</b> and reforms in emerging markets on the dynamics of capital flows to these markets, using a simple model of international investors' behavior. We first show that the gradual nature of <b>liberalizations,</b> combined {{with the cost of}} absorbing large inflows in emerging economies, leads to rich dynamics of capital flows and often implies an initial period of overshooting as portfolios adjust. Asset prices will overshoot as well. Second, we show that if investors have incomplete information about new emerging markets, and learn over time, there can be high volatility of capital flows as well as contagion. Finally, we provide numerical estimates of long run capital inflows to emerging market economies and compare them to actual inflows. This gives a good indicator of upcoming crisis situations. ...|$|R
