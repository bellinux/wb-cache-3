40|$|The {{aim of this}} lecture is {{to clarify}} the concept of {{derivatives}} on quantum spaces [2]. These derivatives are an essential input {{for the construction of}} deformed field equations such as the deformed Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations [3]. These deformed field equations are in turn the starting point for field theories on quantum spaces. For a given coordinate space there are in general many ways to define derivatives [4]. We shall try to develop a general concept of such derivatives into which all the different sets of derivatives fit and that allows us by adding additional requirements-usually based on symmetries- {{to reduce the number of}} possible derivatives. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of the concept of deformed coordinate spaces (DCS) which we will use as quantum spaces.

Well, I am not old enough to be your mother, Mr. Brant, but I am old enough to have been, and might have been, the mother of your wife. That was what you meant then; that is what you mean now.

"Well, {{will the}} House of Commons {{help us to}} get purer Christianity, and cheaper government, by lawful and {{sufficient}} process of reform? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> again <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that this assembly has the power--if it has the will. Is it so constituted at present as to have the will? There is the question! The number of members is a little over six hundred and fifty. Out of this muster, one fifth only represent (or pretend to represent) the trading interests of the country. As for the members charged {{with the interests of}} the working class, they are more easily counted still--they are two in number! Then, in heaven's name (you will ask), what interest does the majority of members in this assembly represent? There is but one answer--the military and aristocratic interest. In these days of the decay of representative institutions, the House of Commons has become a complete misnomer. The Commons are not represented; modern members belong to classes of the community which have really no interest in providing for popular needs and lightening popular burdens. In one word, there is no sort of hope for us in the House of Commons. And whose fault is this? I own it with shame and sorrow--it is emphatically the fault of the people. Yes, I say to you plainly, it is the disgrace and the peril of England that the people themselves have elected the representative assembly which ignores the people's wants!

It is forgotten now; and the first mention of it puckers thy sweet countenance into a sneer: but it will be brought to mind again,--unless indeed the Law of Gravitation chance to cease, and men find that they can walk on vacancy. Unanimity of the Twenty-seven Millions will do nothing; walk not thou with them; fly from them as for thy life. Twenty-seven Millions travelling on such courses, with gold jingling in every pocket, with vivats heaven-high, are incessantly advancing, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> again <b>remind</b> <b>thee,</b> towards the firm-land's end,--towards the end and extinction of what Faithfulness, Veracity, real Worth, was in their way of life. Their noble ancestors have fashioned for them a 'life-road;'--in how many thousand senses, this! There is not an old wise Proverb on their tongue, an honest Principle articulated in their hearts into utterance, a wise true method of doing and despatching any work or commerce of men, but helps yet to carry them forward. Life is still possible to them, because all is not yet Puffery, Falsity, Mammon-worship and Unnature; because somewhat is yet Faithfulness, Veracity and Valour. With a certain very considerable finite quantity of Unveracity and Phantasm, social life is still possible; not with an infinite quantity! Exceed your certain quantity, the seven-feet Hat, and all things upwards to the very Champion cased in tin, begin to reel and flounder,--in Manchester Insurrections, Chartisms, Sliding-scales; the Law of Gravitation not forgetting to act. You advance incessantly towards the land's end; you are, literally enough, 'consuming the way.' Step after step, Twenty-seven Million unconscious men;--till you are at the land's end; till there is not Faithfulness enough among you any more: and the next step now is lifted not over land, but into air, over ocean-deeps and roaring abysses:--unless perhaps the Law of Gravitation have forgotten to act? ...|$|R

There is a certain something--I saw it myself--in your figure, and in some of your movements, which does recall the late Mrs. Eustace to those who knew her well, and which has evidently had its effect on Dexter's morbid mind.

It is not merely possible, it is highly probable, that he may betray himself far more seriously than he has betrayed himself yet if you give him the opportunity. I owe it to you (knowing what your interests are) to express myself plainly on this point. I have no sort of doubt that you have advanced one step nearer to the end which you have in view in the brief interval since you left Edinburgh. I see in your letter (and in my discoveries) irresistible evidence that Dexter {{must have been in}} secret communication with the deceased lady (innocent communication, I am certain, so far as she was concerned), not only {{at the time of her}} death, but perhaps for weeks before it. I cannot disguise from myself or from you, my own strong persuasion that if you succeed in discovering the nature of this communication, in all human likelihood you prove your husband's innocence by the discovery of the truth. As an honest man, I am bound not to conceal this. And, as an honest man also, I am equally bound to add that, not even with your reward in view, can I find it in my conscience to advise you to risk what you must risk if you see Miserrimus Dexter again. In this difficult and delicate matter I cannot and will not take the responsibility: the final decision must rest with yourself. One favor only I entreat you to grant--let me hear what you resolve to do as soon as you know it yourself." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{intellectual}} movement we call legal realism is today, I think, {{most often}} thought of as having an exclusively negative or critical character. But while this movement historically has had a strongly negative component, it has also had a positive or constructive side as well. It is that aspect of legal realism on which I would like to concentrate in my remarks this morning. But before I get to the positive or constructive side of realism <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just briefly <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> about {{the other side of}} realism, the iconoclastic side of the movement, as Karl Llewellyn characterized it many years ago. In the late twenties and early thirties the realists attacked a certain conception of legal science which they associated primarily with the great Harvard treatise writers of {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, Beale and Langdell being the particular objects of their intellectual ire. The realists claimed that the Langdellian project, the project of working out in detail in each branch of law a comprehensive and rigorously structured doctrinal science, was impossible to achieve. The law in each of its particular branches is too filled with conflict, with incompletenesses of one sort or another, it leaves too much open, too much to be decided in the particular case, for it ever to be exhaustively controlling in the way that Langdell and his followers assumed it was or hoped it might be made to be...|$|R
