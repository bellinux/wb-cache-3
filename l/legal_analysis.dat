25|$|Legal {{writing is}} of two, broad categories: (i) <b>legal</b> <b>analysis</b> and (ii) legal drafting. <b>Legal</b> <b>analysis</b> is two-fold: (1) {{predictive}} analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the United States, in most law schools students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) {{of a given}} action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{offers a}} feminist reading of Pashukanisâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s legal theory as a {{contribution}} to critical evaluation {{of the relationship between}} legality, commodification and gender. Contemporary feminist interests in the relationship between legal and non-legal norms, in the role of commodification, and in the limits of gender as a category of analysis, make a re-engagement with Pashukanis timely. For Pashukanis, legal form constitutes subjects as if they have property rights over objects, generates exchange value, and represents differently situated subjects as if they are equal. Here I develop an account of <b>legal</b> form <b>analysis</b> that recuperates Pashukanisâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s distinction between legal form and technical regulation, his theorisation of the subject of commodification, and his historical method of form/content analysis. Drawing on this critical reading of Pashukanis, I argue for the development of <b>legal</b> form <b>analysis</b> so as to accommodate the roles of social reproduction and consumption in the generation of care value and use value in commodity-exchanging societies. I illustrate this method by providing a <b>legal</b> form <b>analysis</b> of a conflict in consent rights over the use of genetically related embryos. Such an analysis asks how consent rights would extract care value from the subjectâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s reproductive wishes, recognise contributions {{to the development of the}} embryo, and recognise investments in the future use of that embryo. In this way, <b>legal</b> form <b>analysis</b> provides a reading of legal contributions to the generation of value from human reproductive activities without making assumptions about their gendered content...|$|R

25|$|Very {{soon after}} the {{enactment}} of the RMA, Fisher (1991) wrote a substantial <b>legal</b> <b>analysis</b> of the RMA showing that the definition of 'sustainable management' was possibly ambiguous. In spite of the 'biophysical bottom line' interpretation, as in Simon Upton's third reading speech, being perhaps the most grammatically correct, Fisher noted that a 'single integrated purpose' definition could be made where providing for human well being was equal with and not subordinate to the 'bottom line' paragraphs a) to c) of s 5(2).|$|E
25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's <b>legal</b> <b>analysis,</b> and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's <b>legal</b> <b>analysis,</b> taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E

Hughes made that choice. He failed to file his 2000 through 2002, and 2004 federal tax returns, despite having more than $300,000 in income over that period. In addition to his failure to file returns, Hughes also took affirmative steps to avoid having federal tax withheld from his income, including the filing of fraudulent forms.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{also point}} out that, even if the ruling's Lochner era <b>legal</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{appropriate}} and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E

500|$|In {{the words}} of a 2007 <b>legal</b> <b>analysis</b> of events {{following}} the Wong Kim Ark decision, [...] "The parameters of the jus soli principle, as stated by the court in Wong Kim Ark, have never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and have been accepted as dogma by lower courts." [...] A 2010 review {{of the history of the}} Citizenship Clause notes that the Wong Kim Ark decision held that the guarantee of birthright citizenship [...] "applies to children of foreigners present on American soil" [...] and states that the Supreme Court [...] "has not re-examined this issue since the concept of 'illegal alien' entered the language". [...] Since the 1990s, however, controversy has arisen over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, and legal scholars disagree over whether the Wong Kim Ark precedent applies when alien parents are in the country illegally. Attempts have been made from time to time in Congress to restrict birthright citizenship, either via statutory redefinition of the term jurisdiction, or by overriding both the Wong Kim Ark ruling and the Citizenship Clause itself through an amendment to the Constitution, but no such proposal has been enacted.|$|E
