40|$|The Government is {{introducing}} emergency legislation following a decision {{today by the}} Court of Appeal regarding {{a challenge to the}} Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The case dealt with the powers of the Government to control substances which are harmful to human health under Section 2 (2) of the Act. There is always a degree of uncertainty about the outcome of court cases. The outcome of this case does not affect existing laws regarding the supply, possession or sale of older drugs such as heroin, cocaine or cannabis. It does affect the possession of certain newer psychoactive substances which {{have been added to the}} Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by successive governments. However, we are advised that sale and supply of psychoactive substances remains an offence under existing legislation. The State successfully defended the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in the original High Court hearing in March 2014. The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Government made preparations for a possible negative outcome. This included the preparation of emergency legislation to be drafted in the event of a negative outcome for the State. It is now important from both a public health and criminal justice perspective that the legislation be enacted as soon as possible. Minister for Health Leo Varadkar will introduce this legislation in the Dáil <b>later</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> The intention is to pass through all stages in the Dáil and Seanad within 24 hours. “We had no way of knowing what the Court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet. The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment. I want to thank the Opposition in advance for its co-operation,” Minister Varadkar said...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the use of push-buttons in {{telephony}} originated around 1887 with a device called the micro-telephone push-button, but it was not an automatic dialing system as understood <b>later.</b> <b>This</b> use <b>even</b> predated the invention of the rotary dial by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. The Bell System in the United States relied on manual switched service until 1919, when it reversed its decisions and embraced dialed, automatic switching. The 1951 introduction of direct distance dialing required automatic transmission of dialed numbers between distant exchanges, leading to use of inband multi-frequency signaling within the Long Lines network while individual local subscribers continued to dial using standard pulses.|$|R

50|$|The moral {{credential}} {{effect is}} a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that {{increases the likelihood of}} less egalitarian decisions <b>later.</b> <b>This</b> effect occurs <b>even</b> when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential.

We monitored the emergence and development of such a bias during and after learning, in high and low trait anxious participants.

Learning performance during training evidenced a short-lived advantage for arousing-negative associated words, which was not present {{at the end of}} training. Cued recall and valence ratings revealed a memory bias for pseudowords that had been paired with arousing-negative pictures, immediately after learning and two weeks <b>later.</b> <b>This</b> held <b>even</b> for items that were not explicitly remembered. High anxious individuals evidenced a stronger memory bias in the cued-recall test, and their ratings were also more negative overall compared to low anxious persons. Both effects were evident, even when explicit recall was controlled for. Regarding the memory bias in anxiety prone persons, explicit memory seems to play a more crucial role than implicit memory. The study stresses the need for several time points of bias measurement during the course of learning and retrieval, as well as the employment of different measures for learning success...|$|R

2500|$|Although the Temple Lot church {{accepts the}} {{veracity}} of Joseph Smith as a prophet of God, {{it does not necessarily}} accept everything that Smith taught or claimed to be revelation.

Instead of a president–prophet, the Church of Christ is led by its Quorum of Twelve Apostles, with all members of that body being considered equal in precedence and authority. Members of the Temple Lot church believe that Smith was wrong to assume the office of church president, an office they deem to not have been provided for in either the Bible or the Book of Mormon, their two scriptural standards. Although Granville Hedrick was ordained to be president of his church in 1863, he <b>later</b> repudiated <b>this</b> ordination, <b>even</b> referring to Smith as a [...] "fallen prophet".|$|R

I did make one small change; I added the question mark. The question is two-fold: What does it mean to value the arts on their own terms and, once we’ve figured that out, is it really such a good idea? Allow me to answer both of those questions right up front so that should you zone out {{during the course of this}} rather lengthy monologue or feel the need to adjourn to the bar you’ll still be able to join the debate about the wrong-headedness of the keynote speaker <b>later</b> on <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Valuing the arts on their own terms means to ascribe the worth of a specific art form in terms of its intrinsic qualities. Let us take for example the visual arts. Intrinsic qualities of visual works of art are the sensorial, intellectual, and/or emotional stimuli derived from images and compositions of arranged lines, colors, textures, shapes, and forms or, in the case of Ceci n’est pas une pipe, the coupling of words and images. Thus, to value the visual arts on their own terms means to place great worth on the knowledge, experience, meaning, and observational and manual skills — in short, ways of thinking and doing – that emerge from contemplation of and reaction to such stimuli. Is valuing the arts on their own terms a good idea? I believe it is. But is justifying the arts on thei...|$|R

On May 13, 1863, Forwood was accompanying acting regimental commander George Henry Cram and two enlisted orderlies from General Buford’s headquarters back to their camp when they were captured by a band of Mosby’s guerillas. The group’s leader, Lieutenant Fairchild, after securing their horses and equipment, offered to release them if they would give their parole. Cram and the two soldiers did so and were released. Since medical officers on both sides had the right to be released without parole if captured, Forwood refused.

40|$|The {{technology}} Molded Interconnect Device (MID) offers {{high potential}} {{for the development of}} innovative product solutions. The integration of electronic and mechanical functions on spatial circuit boards allows the realization of modules with high functional density, freedom of design and a significant degree of miniaturization. However, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the technology the potentials are faced with barriers. These include mechanical, thermal and electrical interactions as well as restrictions between the product design and the production process. Therefore as a support during product development phases functional MID prototypes are necessary for the design of innovative MID-products. Prototypes are an efficient aid to support the product development. They assist the communication between the project partners and limit possible margin of errors at an early stage. Their usage helps to reduce modification costs in <b>later</b> dates. <b>This</b> is <b>even</b> more import ant since in the early stages the largest share of production cost is determined. A standardized guideline for the development of MID-prototypes does not exist yet. Many developers use established practices from related technologies (e. g. printed circuit technology).
