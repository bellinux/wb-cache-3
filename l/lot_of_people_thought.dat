The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that.

[...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

In response to the lower charting than the previous album, Anderson said: [...] "I felt that it didn't get the commercial success it deserved, it got the critical success. I think a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> the band had split up because Bernard had left." [...] Lead single [...] "We Are the Pigs", peaked at 18, plunging to 38 the following week.

[...] Titans quarterback Kerry Collins said of Ringer [...] "He is a good football player. Some guys are just football players, and Javon Ringer is a football player. He is patient, remarkably patient for a rookie running back. He sees blocking schemes well and has a good feel for when to cut back and when not to cut back. He has shown a lot of moves. I think the kid has a bright future.” Titans linebacker Keith Bulluck also said “He has an understanding of the game, you can tell by the cuts he makes at times. The way he runs, and the way that he pays attention. You don’t see the coaches get on him much for messing up, so that’s big for a rookie. I’ve been impressed.’’ Tackle Michael Roos also added in, “He sees the block in progress, He can tell when a block is going to be made and he trusts that it will be made, so sometimes he is cutting before the block has even been made. You don’t see that a lot. A few people have that, and he has definitely got it. Hopefully he can get reps with the (first team) a little more and see where it goes from there.’’ ...|$|E

5000|$|However, as {{time went}} on, {{it became clear that}} McCain was less a {{maverick}} and more part of the unified Republican opposition to the Obama administration's initiatives. [...] In part this was because the large Democratic majority in the Senate made them less open to deal-making with Republicans on some issues, in part because McCain was still concerned about a primary challenge from a conservative, and in part because McCain still had an edge left over from the campaign. [...] The departure of several key Senate staffers following the campaign may have also been a factor. [...] Advisor Mark McKinnon said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> including me, <b>thought</b> he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges." ...|$|R

McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off.

Surprisingly though, it was Mare Winningham who actually went on to receive an Oscar nomination (as well as an Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild nomination) as Best Supporting Actress, while Leigh was overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Speaking to MetroActive magazine, Winningham said: “I felt incredibly honored and touched to be nominated… But {{it was hard to}} be separated from Jennifer, because she was {{the heart and soul of}} that film. While we were making the movie, I thought not only that she would get a nomination, but that she would win. I saw the kind of work she was doing.

It doesn't matter if it's by ABBA or Stockhausen."- Björk, 1994 Björk's influences have been described [...] "as diverse as those she inspires". The Big Issue wrote that: [...] "her passion from everything from minimalist techno to free jazz has been well documented." [...] For his biography of her, Björk told Mark Pytlik: [...] "If I were to say who influenced me most, I would say people like Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno and Mark Bell." [...] Some [...] "confessional singer-songwriters" [...] Björk commends include Abida Parveen, Chaka Khan, Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush, the latter being a definitive influence in her career. According to The Big Issue, [...] "the artist that inspired Björk to start writing her own songs was Joni Mitchell." [...] She said: [...] "Growing up in Iceland I had no knowledge of Joni's impact on the whole hippy era and the Californian folk scene. ... Most of the music around at that time was created by men and the few female songwriters what were around were usually backed by male musicians. In comparison, Joni created her own musical universe with female emotion, energy, wisdom courage and imaginations. I found that very liberating." ...|$|R

500|$|Richard's death {{encouraged}} the furtherance of this later negative image by his Tudor successors {{due to the}} fact that it helped to legitimise Henry VII's seizure of the throne. The Richard III Society contends that this means that 'a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> what <b>people</b> <b>thought</b> they knew about Richard III was pretty much propaganda and myth building.' The Tudor characterisation culminated in the famous fictional portrayal of him in Shakespeare's play Richard III as a physically deformed Machiavellian villain, albeit courageous and witty, cheerfully committing numerous murders in order to claw his way to power; Shakespeare's intention perhaps being to use Richard III as a vehicle for creating his own Marlowesque protagonist. [...] Rous himself, in his History of the Kings of England, written during Henry VII's reign, initiated the process. He reversed his earlier position, and now portrayed Richard as a freakish individual who was born with teeth and shoulder-length hair after having been in his mother's womb for two years. His body was stunted and distorted, with one shoulder higher than the other, and he was [...] "slight in body and weak in strength". Rous also attributes the murder of Henry VI to Richard, and claims that he poisoned his own wife. Jeremy Potter, a former Chair of the Richard III Society, claims that 'At the bar of history Richard III continues to be guilty because it is impossible to prove him innocent. The Tudors ride high in popular esteem.' ...|$|R

Although original residents of the area could be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection. Everyone, including top military officials, and their automobiles were searched when entering and exiting project facilities. One Oak Ridge worker stated that [...] "if you got inquisitive, you were called on the carpet within two hours by government secret agents.

[...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have <b>thought</b> that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical.

[...] The Kings Ransom often played on the same bills as other Allentown {{groups such as the}} Hickeys, the Combenashuns at venues including the King's Court and the Lord's Estate. [...] The scene was competitive. [...] Dougherty elaborates: [...] "There were two stages at The Court. If there was another band across from you that was real good, it gave you the drive {{to be a little bit}} better. Joey Coloruso used to play down there with Quenn's Way Mersey". [...] The King's Ransom also played numerous college fraternity gigs in nearby towns such in Drexel, Lafayette, Lehigh, and Bucknell. [...] Dougherty has mentioned the band's rendition of Chris Kenner's [...] "Land of 1000 Dances" [...] as a highlight of their live shows. [...] They were regular fixtures at the Purple Owl and the King's Court, and played occasionally at the Mod Mill, sometimes on the bill with Jerry Deane, and at the Mad Hatter, a club which specialized in soul music.|$|R
