5|$|Ancient Egyptian <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> {{written in}} the Egyptian {{language}} from ancient Egypt's pharaonic period {{until the end of}} Roman domination.

5|$|Aramaic was {{the primary}} {{language}} of Syria and Mesopotomia, with several dialects. Syriac was in use around Antioch, {{one of the three}} largest cities of the Empire, and particularly by Christians. Syriac literature is known from the latter 2nd century, spreading from the Christian community in Edessa. Early Syriac <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> produced in a largely Greek intellectual milieu until the 4th century, but was distinctive for its use of rich symbolism and verse forms, and influenced Greek writers such as Eusebius, Basil and Theodoret. Among the earliest Syriac <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> the Diatessaron of Tatian, and translations of sections from the Bible.|$|E
5|$|Because Faulks {{felt that}} much of the extant World War I <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> deeply {{influenced}} by World War II literature, he deliberately avoided research with secondary documents, such as historical monographs, instead focusing on veteran interviews and period primary sources.|$|E
40|$|The starting-point {{for this}} study was an {{investigation}} into the relation between literature and philosophy. This resulted in a distinction of four trends: <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> the representation of a “world”, <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> a “means of knowledge”, <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> “concrete or implicit philosophy", <b>literature</b> <b>is</b> “experience”. All these conceptions fix important aspects of the relationship between literature and philosophy [...] Zie: Summar...|$|R

5|$|His role {{in shaping}} North Korean <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> to be pivotal. Cho's early works Mt. Paektu (MR: Paektusan, 1947) and Land (MR: Ttang, 1946) would point out the {{direction}} that North Korean <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> about to take. These works would soon become models for North Korean literature. Upon his return, he started writing for Chosŏn Sinmun, the Soviet Red Army's Korean-language paper, working as a correspondent and translator. He translated works of such Soviet poets as Mayakovsky, Gribachev, and Jambyl Jabayev.|$|E

5|$|Abovian was {{far ahead}} of his time and {{virtually}} none of his works was published during his lifetime. Only after the establishment of the Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited. Abovian is {{regarded as one of the}} foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> not as strong as it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{creation}} of <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, it is possible that women employed others to write documents.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met {{regularly}} at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many {{of its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen {{women have}} won the Nobel Prize in Literature, {{more than any other}} Nobel Prize with the {{exception}} of the Nobel Peace Prize. Among all the years the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded, there have been only four instances in which the award was given to two people (1904, 1917, 1966, 1974). There have been seven years in which the Nobel Prize in <b>Literature</b> <b>was</b> not awarded (1914, 1918, 1935, 1940–1943). The country with the most recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature is France, with 16, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom with 11.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{government}} censorship was commonplace. Magazines {{were routinely}} confiscated under the anti-obscenity Comstock laws; permits for labor rallies were often denied; {{and virtually all}} anti-war or anti-government <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> outlawed. Right-wing conservatives wielded vast amounts of power, and activists that promoted unionization, socialism, or government reform were often denounced as un-American or unpatriotic. In one typical instance in 1923, author Upton Sinclair was arrested for trying to read the First Amendment during an Industrial Workers of the World rally.|$|E
5|$|In the 9th century, {{a legend}} sprang {{up to the}} effect that an ancient column at the Forum of Taurus had an {{inscription}} predicting that Constantinople would be conquered by the Rus.

5|$|It {{was freed}} of Kotte control in 1467; its {{subsequent}} rulers directed their energies towards consolidating its economic potential by maximising revenue from pearls and elephant exports and land revenue. It was less feudal {{than most of}} the other regional kingdoms on the island of Sri Lanka of the same period. During this period, important local Tamil <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> produced and Hindu temples were built including an academy for language advancement.|$|E
5|$|Much Middle Scots <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} by makars, poets {{with links to}} the royal court. These included James I who wrote The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas {{have been seen as}} leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates Literature Researches in Taiwan in a {{viewpoint}} of outside researcher. The methodology of Informetrics {{will be used}} to analyze citations of Chinese Literature and ForeignLiterature’s research papers which had been published in Taiwan from 1996 to 2006. The citation types, citation disciplines, citation languages and citing half-life are examined. On average, the number of citations of each research paper of Foreign <b>Literature</b> <b>is</b> 22. 72; the number of Chinese <b>Literature</b> <b>is</b> 18. 66. The self-citation rate of Chinese <b>Literature</b> <b>is</b> 61. 25 %; the rate for Foreign <b>Literature</b> <b>is</b> 13. 90 %. Research papers on Chinese Literature have great interaction with General Literature, Philosophy, and History, but Foreign Literature papers have great interaction with Social Science. The major citation types of both Chinese Literature and Foreign <b>Literature</b> <b>are</b> “Book”. The written language of cited works is English for Foreign Literature; the written language of cited works is Chinese for Chinese Literature. The citing halflife of Chinese <b>Literature</b> <b>is</b> 19. 29 years and that of Foreign <b>Literature</b> <b>is</b> 11. 96 years. The citations of Chinese Literature have much larger time span and then have comparatively long influences. In general, with comparison to researches on Foreign Literature, Chinese <b>Literature</b> in Taiwan <b>is</b> relatively closed and independent and has little interaction with other disciplines except Philosophy, History and itself.

5|$|The {{development}} of Veerashaiva <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> {{at its peak}} {{during the reign of}} King Deva RayaII, the best-known of the Sangama dynasty rulers. The rule of King Krishnadeva Raya of the Tuluva dynasty and his successors was a high point in Vaishnava literature. The influence of Jain literature, which had dominated Kannada language in the previous centuries, was on the wane with increasing competition from the resurgent Veerashaiva faith and Vaishnava bhakti movement (devotional movement of the haridasas). Interaction between Kannada and Telugu literatures left lasting influences that continued after the Vijayanagara era.|$|E
5|$|After the Copts {{converted}} to Christianity {{in the first}} centuries AD, their Coptic Christian literature became separated from the pharaonic and Hellenistic literary traditions. Nevertheless, scholars speculate that ancient Egyptian literature, perhaps in oral form, influenced Greek and Arabic literature. Parallels are drawn between the Egyptian soldiers sneaking into Jaffa hidden in baskets to capture {{the city in the}} story Taking of Joppa and the Mycenaean Greeks sneaking into Troy inside the Trojan Horse. The Taking of Joppa has also been compared to the Arabic story of Ali Baba in One Thousand and One Nights. It has been conjectured that Sinbad the Sailor may have been inspired by the pharaonic Tale of the shipwrecked sailor. Some Egyptian <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> commented on by scholars of the ancient world. For example, the Jewish Roman historian Josephus (37–c. 100 AD) quoted and provided commentary on Manetho's historical texts.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which {{are rooted in}} the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian <b>literature</b> <b>was</b> viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
