40|$|A novel bioelectrochemical {{method for}} the direct {{determination}} of D(-) L(+) lactic acid and of <b>L(-)</b> <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> in wines is presented. Multienzymatic biosensors were realized for the selective {{determination of the}} three analytes: D(-) and L(+) lactic acid were measured by a trienzymatic biosensor based on the catalytic activities of the enzymes L(+) lactate oxidase (LOD), D(-) lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP); <b>L(-)</b> <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> was measured by a bienzymatic electrode, realized by coupling the enzymes L(-) malic dehydrogenase (L-MDH) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In both cases the enzymes were immobilized on an oxygen selective Clark electrode. The simultaneous determination of the two organic acids can be accomplished either in batch or in a flow injection analysis apparatus using the same biosensors as detectors. The analytical performance of the method, tested in standard aqueous solutions and on real samples of wines, showing high repeatability, short response times and reduced cost of analysis, suggest that the experimental approach here described could be followed to monitor the progress of malolactic fermentation.

40|$|Insufficient wine acidity {{can affect}} wine quality and stability. To {{overcome}} this problem, DL-malic acid {{can be added}} to the grape juice prior to fermentation. We have investigated the effect of DL-malic acid on wine fermentations and its influence on the final concentration of L-malic acid, naturally present in grape juice. To this end yeast strains that metabolise L-malic acid in different ways were tested and compared; namely, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (efficient L-malic acid degrader), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (non-degrader), hybrid strain S. cerevisiae x S. uvarum (intermediate degrader) and Saccharomyces uvarum (promoting L-malic acid synthesis). In all cases, D-malic acid passively entered the yeast cells and did not undergo malo-alcoholic fermentation. However, its presence in the juice, as a component of the mixture of D- and <b>L-</b> <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> (DL-malic acid), reduced the amount of L-malic acid that can be degraded or synthesised by yeasts during malo-alcoholic fermentation...|$|E

D(+) and <b>L(-)</b> <b>Malic</b> <b>acids</b> were also effective at the concentration of 2. 5 x 10 (- 2) - 5. 0 x 10 (- 2) mmoles/l. At 3. 0 x 10 (- 2) mmoles/l concentration the following acids are activators: acetic, oxalic, malonic, oxaloacetic, pyruvic, glyoxylic, glycolic; succinic is an inhibitor and acetoacetic is without effect. The activation is not in relation with the pKa of these acids. The inhibitory effects of organic acids are evident at the concentration of 5. 0 x 10 (- 2) mmoles/l.

L(+) tartaric <b>acid,</b> <b>L(-)</b> or D,L <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> and lactic acids are the only chemical acidifiers authorized by the OIV and European Community regulations. The use of calcium sulfate (gypsum: CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) is also authorized in the European Community as a complementary acidifier in generous and generous liquor 42 wines from Spain (a practice known as plastering), provided that the residual sulfate content in the wine does not exceed 2. 5  g/L expressed as potassium sulfate. However, this practice is not yet approved by OIV. To predict the effect on pH of different acidi- fiers, several chemical modeling approaches have been described in the literature, in particular a simplified model where the acidity of wine {{is considered to be}} due to a monoprotic acid. The aim of this work is to verify this model at pilot and industrial scale in the acidification of musts with tartaric and calcium sulfate, added either individually and in combination, using doses up to 3  g/L and to study the modifications that these practices produce on the compositions of the resulting wines.

So far, no studies have evaluated the fermentation performances of Saccharomyces in unripe grape musts, in terms of fermentation ability and reducing <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> contents, {{to improve the quality}} of this low-alcohol beverage. In this work, we evaluated 24 S. cerevisiae strains isolated from Italian and Croatian vineyards with different fermentation aptitudes.

Differences in <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> content are caused by differences in accumulation of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> in the vacuole. This accumulation {{may be caused by}} a gene that is responsible for transport of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> from the cytosol into the vacuole. Here, we provide evidence that a <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> transporter gene at the top of chromosome 16 caused significant differences in <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and pH of apples. The pH of apples in a segregating F 1 population was mapped and at the pH locus (named henceforth Ma locus for <b>malic</b> <b>acid),</b> two putative <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> transporter genes were detected. These genes show high homology to AtALMT genes that code for malate channel proteins located in vacuolar membrane in Arabidopsis. The expression of one of the candidate genes (Ma 1) cosegregated clearly with <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> content. The inheritance of at least one dominant allele of this gene sufficed for an increased expression level that likely caused the observed threefold increase of the <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and the reduction of the pH from 4 to 3 in mature apples, compared to the presence of the recessive, lowly expressed allele only.

Addition of Al to nutrient solutions stimulated excretion of <b>malic</b> and succinic <b>acids</b> from roots of wheat seedlings, and Al-tolerant genotypes excreted 5 - to 10 -fold more <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> than Al-sensitive genotypes. <b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> excretion was detectable after 15 min of exposure to 200 [mu]M Al, and the amount excreted increased linearly over 24 h. The amount of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> excreted was dependent on the external Al concentration, and excretion was stimulated by as little as 10 [mu]M Al. <b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> added to nutrient solutions was able to protect Al-sensitive seedlings from normally phytotoxic Al concentrations. Root apices (terminal 3 - 5 mm of root) were {{the primary source of}} the <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> excreted. Root apices of Al-tolerant and Al-sensitive seedlings contained similar amounts of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> before and after a 2 -h exposure to 200 [mu]M Al. During this treatment, Al-tolerant seedlings excreted about four times the total amount of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> initially present within root apices, indicating that continual synthesis of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> was occurring. <b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> excretion was specifically stimulated by Al, and neither La, Fe, nor the absence of Pi was able to elicit this response. There was a consistent correlation of Al tolerance with high rates of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> excretion stimulated by Al in a population of seedlings segregating for Al tolerance.

Unlike CAM, atmospheric CO 2 uptake in CAM-cycling occurs exclusively during the day; at night, the stomata are closed and respiratory CO 2 is recaptured to form <b>malic</b> <b>acid.</b> All species showed similar patterns of day-night {{gas exchange}} and overnight <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation, confirming the presence of CAM-cycling. Species averages for gas exchange parameters and <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> fluctuation were significantly different such that the species with the highest daytime gas exchange had the lowest <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> accumulation and vice versa. Also, daytime CO 2 exchange and transpiration were negatively correlated with overnight <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> fluctuation for all individuals examined together, as well as within one species. This suggests that <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> may effect reductions in both atmospheric CO 2 uptake and transpiration during the day. No significant correlation between <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> fluctuation and water-use efficiency was found, although a nonsignificant trend of increasing water-use efficiency with increasing <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> fluctuation was observed among species averages. This study provides evidence that CO 2 recycling via <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is negatively correlated with daytime transpirational water losses in well-watered plants.

The latter is more difficult to achieve in wines that have high acidity due to excess <b>malic</b> <b>acid,</b> since wine yeast in general cannot effectively degrade <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> during alcoholic fermentation. An indigenous Saccharomyces paradoxus strain RO 88 was able to degrade 38 % of the <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> in Chardonnay must and produced a wine of good quality.

40|$|The {{potency of}} SO 2 is highest {{when it is}} in a free or unbound state. High {{concentrations}} of SO 2 binders in wine may greatly diminish the efficacy of SO 2. The decreased preservative efficacy of bound SO 2 requires increased SO 2 additions to wine for adequate preservation action. However, additional sulfite concentrations may increase the risk of adverse health reactions for sensitive consumers and may also exceed legal limits for SO 2 in wines. Hence, this work investigated important SO 2 binding compounds throughout vinification and developed strategies for their control to increase the preservative efficacy of SO 2 and limit total additions to wine. Comprehensive analysis of SO 2 binding compounds at practical concentrations was achieved through the development of a novel UHPLC method that used the metal chelator, EDTA, to limit oxidation reactions during sample preparation. This method greatly improved existing protocols limited by complex sampling procedures and long HPLC analysis times. A survey of 237 wines from across NYS showed clear differences in the SO 2 binder profiles between different wine types. Red wines were typically higher in [alpha]ketoglutaric acid and galacturonic acid, whereas, white wines were higher in acetaldehyde, pyruvic acid and glucose. Major regulating factors for acetaldehyde production during alcoholic fermentation were SO 2 addition prior to inoculation, fermentation temperature and grape must type. With the exception of galacturonic acid, the concentrations of acetaldehyde, pyruvic acid and [alpha]-ketoglutaric acid decreased following inoculation with O. oeni. Overall bound SO 2 levels were decreased by 22 % during MLF and an additional 53 % one week later. During MLF, acetaldehyde bound SO 2 increased mean O. oeni lag times in a dose dependant manner. Metabolism of bound SO 2 by O. oeni resulted in concomitant increases in free SO 2 concentrations, which never rose about 8. 0 mg <b>l-</b> 1. <b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> was depleted by O. oeni, despite the presence of acetaldehyde bound SO 2.

Resistivity measurements on powder-in-tube MgB 2 monofilamentary wires established that the toluene/malic acid doped sample had the highest Bc 2. However, the toluene-only sample had the highest transport Jc over most of the magnetic field range (0 - 9 T), equaled only by that of toluene/malic acid sample in fields above 9 T.

40|$|<b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> is a C- 4 {{dicarboxylic acid}} that is {{currently}} mainly used in the food and beverages industry as an acidulant. Because of the versatility {{of the group of}} C- 4 dicarboxylic acids, the chemical industry has a growing interest in this chemical compound. As <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> will be considered as a bulk chemical, microbial production requires organisms that sustain high rates, yields, and titers. Aspergillus oryzae is mainly known as an industrial enzyme producer, but it was also shown that it has a very competitive natural production capacity for <b>malic</b> <b>acid.</b> Recently, an engineered A. oryzae strain, 2103 a- 68, was presented which overexpressed pyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase, and a <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> transporter. In this work, we report a detailed characterization of this strain including detailed rates and yields under <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> production conditions. Furthermore, transcript levels of the genes of interest and corresponding enzyme activities were measured. On glucose as carbon source, 2103 a- 68 was able to secrete <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> at a maximum specific production rate during stationary phase of 1. 87 mmol (g dry weight (DW)) (- 1) h(- 1) and with a yield of 1. 49 mol mol(- 1). Intracellular fluxes were obtained using C- 13 flux analysis during exponential growth, supporting the success of the metabolic engineering strategy of increasing flux through the reductive cytosolic tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) branch. Additional cultivations using xylose and a glucose/xylose mixture demonstrated that A. oryzae is able to efficiently metabolize pentoses and hexoses to produce <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> at high titers, rates, and yields...|$|R

Contamination of those by pathogenic microorganisms is considered {{as one of the}} major problems. Organic acid treatments, such as <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment, are used to control these contaminations. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antimicrobial activity of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli in Mango, Pineapple and papaya juices. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> against those bacteria were evaluated for all tested fruit juices which were stored at 5, 20 and 35 °C. Antibacterial effect of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> was observed against all tested bacteria under all tested conditions. The antibacterial activity was depended upon the type of bacteria, type of fruit juice and storage conditions. Antibacterial effect was higher in high temperature storage than low temperature storage. High concentration of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> was needed for Papaya juice compared to other fruit juices to reduce microbial population by a same amount. E. coli was found to be more resistant to antimicrobial activity of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> compared to the other two bacteria. According to the results of this study, E. coli can be recommended as a test bacterium in testing organic acids to be used as food preservatives. Further, these tests should be carried out in refrigerated temperature to find out more effective organic acids, as the lowest antibacterial activity of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> was observed at 5 °C in this study...|$|R

25|$|<b>Malic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{along with}} tartaric acid, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organic acids found in wine grapes. It is found in nearly every fruit and berry plant, but is most often associated with green (unripe) apples, the flavor it most readily projects in wine. Its name comes from the Latin malum meaning “apple”. In the grape vine, <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is involved in several processes which are essential for the health and sustainability of the vine. Its chemical structure allows it to participate in enzymatic reactions that transport energy throughout the vine. Its concentration varies depending on the grape variety, with some varieties, such as Barbera, Carignan and Sylvaner, being naturally disposed to high levels. The levels of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> in grape berries are at their peak just before veraison, when they can be found in concentrations as high as 20g/l. As the vine progresses through the ripening stage, <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is metabolized in the process of respiration, and by harvest, its concentration could be as low as 1 to 9 g/l. The respiratory loss of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is more pronounced in warmer climates. When all the <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> is used up in the grape, it is considered “over-ripe” or senescent. Winemakers must compensate for this loss by adding extraneous acid at the winery in a process known as acidification.|$|R

40|$|<b>Malic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a major}} acid {{found in}} grapes. In {{countries}} with cooler climates, such as New Zealand, this acid is not fully respired from grapes and will impart a sour taste on grape juices. Therefore steps {{must be taken to}} ensure deacidification of the juice or wine occurs. Deacidification is the process whereby the acidity of a juice or wine is lowered by physical, chemical or biological means. Biological methods of deacidification such as malolactic fermentation and maloethanolic fermentation involve the degradation of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> to other products. Malolactic fermentation is the bacterial conversion of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> to lactic acid and carbon dioxide and is commonly used in New Zealand wineries. Maloethanolic fermentation is the simultaneous conversion of grape sugars and <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> to ethanol by specialized yeast strains and is the focus of this investigation. This research examines several commercially available yeast strains (Lallemand Lalvin strains 71 B, ACID-, D 432 and reference strains EC 1118 and Red Star Montrachet (M)) and Schizosaccharomyces strain 442, for their ability to degrade <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> during grape juice fermentation under New Zealand conditions. A Simulated Grape Juice medium was used to mimic these conditions, as well as commercial Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc juices. Strains 71 B and D 432 consistently degraded the greatest percentage of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> under all conditions and parameters investigated in this research. Respectively, these strains degraded <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> by 36 % and 22 % of the initial concentration (7. 0 g/L) in industrial Chardonnay juice fermentations and by 47 % and 36 % of the initial concentration (3. 7 g/L) in industrial Sauvignon Blanc fermentations. Furthermore, in Sauvignon Blanc wines, a significant (P= 0. 05) difference was found between the wine made with strain 71 B and all other wines. However, in Chardonnay wines, a significant difference was found between the wine made with strain D 432 and all other wines. In addition, molecular genetic techniques (CHEF chromosomal banding pattern polymorphisms) were utilised to confirm yeast strain identity. from industrial fermentations. From this, it was concluded that all strains inoculated into the commercial juices were dominant at the most vigorous stage of fermentation. Factors influencing <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> degradation were investigated in Simulated Grape Juice fermentations. These included initial concentrations of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> and nitrogen and the initial pH level of the juice. It was found that strains 71 B and D 432 degraded the greatest percentage of <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> when the initial <b>malic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration of the juice was high (7. 5 g/L), the initial nitrogen concentration was low (463 mg/L with proline) and an initial pH of pH 3. 5. These results indicate that there is an interaction between yeast and grape variety/maturity, and that proper selection of yeast strain {{can be used as a}} tool for deacidification...|$|R
