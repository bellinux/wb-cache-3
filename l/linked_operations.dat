5000|$|The first option, making {{loads and}} stores go in-order, avoids RAW dependences {{because there is}} no {{possibility}} of a load executing before its producer store and obtaining incorrect data. Another possibility is to effectively break loads and stores into two operations: address generation and cache access. With these two separate but <b>linked</b> <b>operations,</b> the CPU can allow loads and stores to access the memory system only once all previous loads and stores have had their address generated and buffered in the LSQ. After address generation, there are no longer any ambiguous dependencies since all addresses are known, and so dependent loads will not be executed until their corresponding stores complete. This scheme still allows for some [...] "out-of-orderness"—the address generation operations for any in-flight loads and stores can execute out-of-order, and once addresses have been generated, the cache accesses for each load or store can happen in any order that respects the (now known) true dependences.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a forest}} that evolves via <b>link</b> <b>operations</b> {{that make the}} root of one tree {{the child of a}} node in another tree. Intermixed with <b>link</b> <b>operations</b> are nca operations, which return the nearest common {{ancestor}} of two given nodes when such exists. This paper shows that a sequence of m such nca and <b>link</b> <b>operations</b> on a forest of n nodes can be processed on-line in time O(mα(m,n) +n). This was previously known only for a restricted type of <b>link</b> <b>operation.</b> The special case where a link only extends a tree by adding a new leaf occurs in Edmonds' algorithm for finding a maximum weight matching on a general graph. Incorporating our algorithm into the implementation of Edmonds' algorithm in G 17 achieves time O(n(m + n n)) for weighted matching, an arguably optimum asymptotic bound (n and m are the number of vertices and edges, respectively).

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{component}} sharing across product categories, {{in contrast to}} earlier studies which examined component sharing within a specific category. Cross-category component sharing creates the potential for diversified product functionality by transferring new knowledge between categories, in addition to streamlining development, as previously noted. We collected evidence for this proposal from the Japanese digital audio-visual products market in the late 2000 s. Panasonic not only shared software modules and the design of large scale integration (LSI) among products in the same category, but also shared them among televisions and DVD recorders. Its competitors, Sony and Sharp, used shared software and the design of LSI only within a product category. Panasonic products were functionally more advanced than those of Sony and Sharp.

40|$|Production-quality {{parallel}} {{applications are}} often a mixture of diverse operations, such as computation- and communication-intensive, regular and irregular, tightly coupled and loosely <b>linked</b> <b>operations.</b> In conventional construction of parallel applications, each process performs all the operations, which might result inefficient and seriously limit scalability, especially at large scale. We propose a decoupling strategy to improve the scalability of applications running on large-scale systems. Our strategy separates application operations onto groups of processes and enables a dataflow processing paradigm among the groups. This mechanism is effective in reducing the impact of load imbalance and increases the parallel efficiency by pipelining multiple operations. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation using MPI, the de-facto programming system on current supercomputers. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} strategy by decoupling the reduce, particle communication, halo exchange and I/O operations in a set of scientific and data-analytics applications. A performance evaluation on 8, 192 processes of a Cray XC 40 supercomputer shows that the proposed approach can achieve up to 4 x performance improvement.

40|$|Consider {{a dynamic}} forest of unrooted trees over {{a set of}} n {{vertices}} which we update by link operations: Each <b>link</b> <b>operation</b> adds a new edge adjacent to vertices in two different trees. Every edge in the forest has a weight associated with it, and at any time {{we want to be}} able to answer a path-min query which returns that edge of minimum weight along the path between two given vertices. For the case where the weights are integers we give an algorithm that performs n − 1 <b>link</b> <b>operations</b> and m pathmin queries in O(n + mα(m,n)) time. This extends well known results of Tarjan [11] and Yao [12] to a more general dynamic setting at the cost of restricting the weights to be integers. Using our data structure we get an optimal data structure for a restricted version of the mergeable trees problem [9]. We also suggest a simpler data structures for the case where trees are rooted and the <b>link</b> <b>operation</b> always adds an edge between the root of one tree and an arbitrary vertex of another tree...|$|R
