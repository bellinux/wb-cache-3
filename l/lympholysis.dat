The Ir control of the response to several non-H- 2 histocompatibility antigens, including H-Y, H- 4, and H- 7 has been documented (4 - 7). Recent evidence suggests a further role of genes in the H- 2 complex in regulating the immunogenicity, or rejectability, of H-Y-incompatible skin grafts (8, 9), presumably through regulation of H-Y antigen expression.

Although some of these appear during late intrathymic ontogeny and are maintained on all peripheral T cells (T 3), others (T 4, TS) arise earlier in differentiation and are selectively expressed on functional subpopulations of human T lymphocytes (1 - 3). In {{the case of the}} 20, 000 -mol wt T 3 surface molecule, both its appearance in intrathymic ontogeny at the time of acquisition of immunologic competence (1, 4) and its critical role in T lymphocyte function suggested that it was closely linked to a recognition receptor for antigen.

40|$|Summary. -To {{evaluate}} cytotoxic function {{mediated by}} killer lymphocytes and macrophages in urological cancer patients, we examined antibody-dependent and spontaneous <b>lympholysis</b> of chicken erythrocyte target cells, which is mediated by macrophages. Our results demonstrate a discordance between cytotoxic mechanisms in cancer patients, killer-cell function being impaired whilst macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity was increased. RECENT STUDIES {{show that there}} are subpopulations of human lymphoid cells that are cytotoxic in vitro without prior sensitization to various target cells, including tumour cells (Perlmann et al., 1975; Pross & Baines, 1977). Cytotoxicity by unsensitized lymphoid cells is greatly enhanced when target cells are coated with specific antibody (Perlmann et al., 1975). This cytotoxic phenomenon is called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or antibody-dependent <b>lympholysis</b> (ADCC). Cells that mediate ADCC have been operationally defined as killer cells (Perlmann et al., 1975; Brier et al., 1975). It has been demonstrated that various types of effector cells can mediate ADCC depending upon the type of target cell. For example, antibody-coated chicken erythrocyte targets are susceptible to lysis by granulocytes, macrophages, and killer cells (MacDonald et al., 1975) whilst antibody-coated Chang human liver cells (Nelson et al., 1976) and many tumour-cell lines (O'Toole et al., 1977) are susceptible to lysis only by killer cells. Unsensitized lymphocytes are also capable of lysing target cells that are not coated with antibody, a process whic...|$|E

The mice survived in excellent health until sacrifice 6 mo later. Thoracic duct cannulation at this stage showed that the mice possessed normal numbers of recirculating lymphocytes. Close to 100 % of thoracic duct lymphocytes and lymph node cells were shown to be of donor strain origin. The capacity of lymphocytes from the chimeras to respond to host-type determinants was tested in mixed leukocyte culture and in an assay for cell-mediated <b>lympholysis</b> (CML). Mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR) were measured both in vitro and in vivo; tumor cells and phytohemmaglutinin-stimulated blast cells were used as target cells for measuring CML. 	While responding normally to third party determinants, cells from the chimeras gave a definite, though reduced MLR when exposed to host-type determinants. However, this proliferative response to host-type determinants, unlike that to third party determinants, {{was not associated with}} differentiation into cytotoxic lymphocytes.

Using K- 562 cell-line targets, spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity was inhibited by 2 -cyclohexene- 1 -one with an ID 50 of 0. 71 X 10 (- 4) M- 1. 48 X 10 (- 4) M, while antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity was less sensitive to inhibition, and required slightly higher concentrations of 1. 48 X 10 (- 4) M- 3. 98 X 10 (- 4) M to achieve 50 % inhibition. Similar results were seen with human colon tumour cell-line and Chang liver cell-line cells as targets. Maximal inhibition occurred when 2 -cyclohexene- 1 -one was added to the cytotoxicity assay 60 min prior to, at the start of, or within the first 60 min of a 4 -hr assay; inhibition of cytotoxicity occurred with pretreatment of effector cells; and no inhibition of cytotoxicity was observed with pretreatment of target cells.
