5|$|<b>Liguria</b> {{was built}} by the Ansaldo {{shipyard}} in Genoa; her keel was laid on 1 July 1889. Shortages of funding slowed the completion <b>Liguria</b> and her sister ships. Tight budgets forced the Navy to reduce the pace of construction so that the funds {{could be used to}} keep the active fleet in service. It took nearly four years to complete the hull, which was launched on 8 June 1893. Fitting-out work proceeded much more quickly, and the new cruiser was ready for service {{a year and a half}} later. She was commissioned into the fleet on 1 December 1894. That year, <b>Liguria</b> was assigned to the Third Division of the Italian fleet, along with , an ancient center battery ironclad, which had been launched in 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Corsican Buonapartes were {{descended from}} minor Italian nobility of Tuscan origin, {{who had come}} to Corsica from <b>Liguria</b> in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liguria</b> {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} her career. She frequently was assigned to the main fleet, but in 1904 she was deployed to the American Station. In 1906, she conducted tests with coaling while at sea, and from 1908 to 1911, she was fitted with an experimental observation balloon. She saw extensive action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112. She took part in the seizure of Benghazi, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Tripoli, and conducted bombardments of Ottoman ports in western Libya and the Red Sea coast of Arabia. She was still in service during World War I as a training ship, but she did not see action during the conflict. <b>Liguria</b> was eventually sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile {{is widely}} {{distributed}} {{in much of}} mainland Italy, especially in the provinces of Trento, Lombardy, Veneto, <b>Liguria,</b> Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Apulia, and Calabria, {{as well as on}} the island of Sicily. Although it used to be found as far north as Lake Garda, P.fluviatile no longer occurs north of the River Po.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli is {{sometimes}} served with pesto sauce, {{which is a}} common addition {{to it in the}} <b>Liguria</b> and Tuscany regions of Italy. Another dressing method includes the addition of olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic and basil. Significant amounts of sauce may absorb into testaroli.|$|E
5|$|This division, {{established}} by Augustus in 22BC, {{was accompanied by}} a redistribution of tribal settlement areas. It remained essentially unchanged until Diocletian's reforms in the third century, when parts of Switzerland each belonged to the provinces of Sequania, Vienna, Raetia Prima, <b>Liguria</b> and Alpes Graiae et Poeninae.|$|E
5|$|After {{gathering}} a large {{coalition of}} peoples, Alboin crossed the Julian Alps in 568, entering an almost undefended Italy. He rapidly {{took control of}} most of Venetia and <b>Liguria.</b> In 569, unopposed, he took northern Italy's main city, Milan. Pavia offered stiff resistance however, and was taken only after a siege lasting three years. During that time Alboin {{turned his attention to}} Tuscany, but signs of factionalism among his supporters and Alboin's diminishing control over his army increasingly began to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, <b>Liguria</b> {{was assigned to the}} Third Division of the First Squadron as a training ship. Italy declared neutrality {{at the start of the}} war, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. The old cruiser nevertheless saw no action during the war. She was sold for scrap on 15 May 1921 and was subsequently broken up.|$|E
5|$|In the Italian {{province}} of Massa and Carrara, {{located within the}} Tuscany region, it was a peasant food consumed as a one-course meal, topped with grated cheese and olive oil. In Massa and Carrara, it was sometimes accompanied with stracchino cheese or charcuterie. Testaroli remains a very popular dish in Pontremoli, a small city in the {{province of}} Massa and Carrara, where it is served at virtually every restaurant in the city, during both mornings and evenings. Testaroli is also a common and specialty dish in the Lunigiana region and historical territory of Italy, which is located between the <b>Liguria</b> and Tuscany regions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II she {{participated in}} several cruises to Mediterranean ports. During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she {{was captured by}} Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor. Initially designated N2, her armament was changed and her conning tower modified. Due to her age and shallow diving depth, when she was commissioned into the Regia Marina as Antonio Bajamonti her service was limited to training and experimentation. She was scuttled at La Spezia in <b>Liguria</b> by the Italians in September 1943 {{the day after the}} Italian surrender.|$|E
5|$|Alboin moved west in his march, invading {{the region}} of <b>Liguria</b> (north-west Italy) and {{reaching}} its capital Mediolanum (Milan) on September 3, 569, only to find it already abandoned by the vicarius Italiae (vicar of Italy), the authority entrusted with {{the administration of the}} diocese of Annonarian Italy. Archbishop Honoratus, his clergy, and part of the laity accompanied the vicarius Italiae to find a safe haven in the Byzantine port of Genua (Genoa). Alboin counted the years of his reign from the capture of Milan, when he assumed the title of dominus Italiae (Lord of Italy). His success also meant the collapse of Byzantine defences {{in the northern part of}} the Po plain, and large movements of refugees to Byzantine areas.|$|E
5|$|Careful to {{maintain}} the initiative against the Byzantines, by 570 Alboin had taken their last defences in northern Italy except for the coastal areas of <b>Liguria</b> and Venetia and a few isolated inland centres such as Augusta Praetoria (Aosta), Segusio (Susa), and the island of Amacina in the Larius Lucus (Lake Como). During Alboin's kingship the Lombards crossed the Apennines and plundered Tuscia, but historians are not in full agreement as to whether this took place under his guidance and if this constituted anything more than raiding. According to Herwig Wolfram, it was probably only in 578–579 that Tuscany was conquered, but Jörg Jarnut and others believe this began in some form under Alboin, {{although it was not}} completed by the time of his death.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring Manchuria. She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and <b>Liguria</b> were modified to operate an observation balloon to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from the air. In December 1910, Umbria was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
5|$|In India, {{squashes}} (ghia) {{are cooked}} with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from <b>Liguria,</b> or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a tempura dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships of}} the Regioni class {{served in a}} variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers. Their first decade in service was marked by frequent deployments abroad, interspersed between stints in the main Italian fleet, where they served as scouts for the battleships. In 1895, Etruria and much of the main fleet visited Germany for the opening ceremonies for the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Lombardia was stationed in South America in 1896, when an outbreak of yellow fever killed half of her crew while she was in Rio de Janeiro. In 1897, Umbria and <b>Liguria</b> were assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the main fleet. Lombardia was deployed to China in 1901, where she replaced Elba, and to Italian Somaliland in 1903. There, she briefly skirmished with Somali rebels.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} their careers, including scouts for the main fleet, colonial cruisers, and representatives of Italy at major foreign events. Elba observed the Russo-Japanese War, including the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in 1904, where she picked up Russian survivors. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 1906. Elba and <b>Liguria</b> were equipped with observation balloons in 19071908. In 1910, Umbria was sold to Haiti and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she quickly sank under the care of her inexperienced crew. The remaining ships, except for Lombardia, took part in the Italo-Turkish War in 191112, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops, bombarded Ottoman ports, and instituted a blockade in the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to {{take an active role in}} the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. <b>Liguria</b> was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E

25|$|Baebius {{played an}} {{important}} diplomatic and military role in the Roman-Syrian War. In carrying out the deportation of the Apuani of <b>Liguria</b> {{for the purpose of}} occupying their territory, Baebius is also a significant figure in tracing the history of Roman expansionism.|$|E
25|$|Other peoples {{living in}} {{northern}} Italy include the Ligurians (an Indo-European {{people who lived}} in what is now <b>Liguria,</b> southern Piedmont and the southern French coast), the Lepontii, Insubres, Orobii and other Celtic tribes in Piedmont and Lombardy, the Veneti of north-eastern Italy.|$|E
25|$|After he had {{established}} himself in Rhodes, Posidonius made {{one or more}} journeys traveling throughout the Roman world and even beyond its boundaries to conduct scientific research. He traveled in Greece, Hispania, Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia, Gaul, <b>Liguria,</b> North Africa, and on the eastern shores of the Adriatic.|$|E

25|$|The Ligurians, {{occupying the}} region {{known to the}} Romans (and still called today) as <b>Liguria,</b> {{southwest}} of the Gauls. It is unclear whether their language was non Indo-European (related to Iberian), Italic, or Celtic (related to Gaulish). Most likely, they spoke a Celto-Italic hybrid language.

25|$|From this {{research}} appears clearly {{that most of}} the emigration from the Italian region <b>Liguria</b> was from the areas of Genoa and Savona, and some Sicilian surnames (like Caruana) are mistakenly believed to be Maltese (while are from Sicilians emigrated to Malta during the Italian Renaissance).|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} days he landed at the Gulf of La Spezia and captured Rapallo, Pegli and Levanto. In 1546 he captured Mahdia, Sfax, Sousse and Al Munastir in Tunisia, afterwards using Mahdia {{as a base}} to assault the Knights of St. John in Malta. In April 1546 he raided the coasts of <b>Liguria.</b> In May, still in <b>Liguria,</b> he captured Laigueglia, a province of Savona, with a force of 1000 men. He later captured Andora and took the podestà of the town as a prisoner. There he and his troops rested for a brief period, before resuming their assault on the Italian Riviera and landing at San Lorenzo al Mare. He also destroyed the village of Civezza. From there he once again sailed towards Malta and laid siege to the island of Gozo.|$|E
25|$|Cesare Rossarol was a scout cruiser {{built in}} Sestri Ponente, Genoa, in 1913 and {{launched}} by S.A.I. Gio. Ansaldo & C. in <b>Liguria,</b> Italy, in 1914.

25|$|After Italy {{signed an}} {{armistice}} with the Allies, the Italian Social Republic, a fascist puppet state in northern Italy which remained {{part of the}} Axis, continued to build and use MTMs. During {{the last days of}} the war in Europe, on 16 April 1945, one MTM hit and heavily damaged the French destroyer Trombe off <b>Liguria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before them, other Lombards {{arrived in}} Sicily, with an {{expedition}} departed in 1038, {{led by the}} Byzantine commander George Maniakes, which for {{a very short time}} managed to snatch Messina and Syracuse from the Arabs. The Lombards who arrived with the Byzantines settled in Maniace, Randazzo and Troina, while a group of Genoese and other Lombards from <b>Liguria</b> settled in Caltagirone.|$|E

Turning inland, he enhanced his territory until reaching Gebel.|$|E
25|$|Genoa CFC has {{the bulk}} of its fans in <b>Liguria,</b> however they are also popular in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley. The {{seafaring}} traditions of the Genoese {{and the presence of}} Genoese communities in distant countries did much to spread the appeal of Genoa some further than just Italy, and immigrants founded fan clubs in Buenos Aires, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Toronto, New York, San Francisco, Barcelona, Iceland and other places.|$|E
25|$|Since the Late-Neolithic, Aosta Valley, Piedmont, <b>Liguria,</b> Tuscany and Sardinia in {{particular}} {{were involved in}} the pan-Western European Megalithic phenomenon. Later, in the Bronze Age, megalithic structures were built also in Latium, Puglia and Sicily. This latter region, around {{the end of the third}} millennium B.C. imported from Sardinia typical cultural aspects of Atlantic world, including the Culture of small dolmen-shaped structures that reached all over the Mediterranean basin.|$|E
25|$|Rothari reigned from 636 to 652, and led {{numerous}} military campaigns, {{which brought}} {{almost all of}} northern Italy {{under the rule of}} the Lombard kingdom.
