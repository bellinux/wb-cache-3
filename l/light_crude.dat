5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of <b>light</b> <b>crude</b> oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographic}} location {{is important because}} it affects transportation costs to the refinery. <b>Light</b> <b>crude</b> oil is more desirable than heavy oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while sweet oil commands a higher price than sour oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries.

40|$|Recent congressional {{interest}} in U. S. energy policy has focused {{in part on}} ways through which the United States could secure more economical and reliable crude oil resources both domestically and internationally. Many forecasters identify petroleum refined from Canadian oil sands as one possible solution. Increased petroleum production from Canadian oil sands, however, is not without controversy, as many have expressed concern over the potential environmental impacts. These impacts may include {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHG) during extraction and processing. A number of key studies in recent literature have expressed findings that the GHG emissions intensities of Canadian oil sands crudes may be higher than those of other crudes imported, refined, and consumed in the United States. The studies identify two main reasons for the increase: (1) oil sands are heavier and more viscous than <b>lighter</b> <b>crude</b> oil types on average, and thus require more energy- and resource-intensive activities to extract; and (2) oil sands are compositionally deficient in hydrogen, and have a higher carbon, sulfur, and heavy metal content than <b>lighter</b> <b>crude</b> oil types on average, and thus require more processing to yield consumable fuels by U.

2500|$|Synthetic crude oil, {{also known}} as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader {{facility}} used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) power shovels and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by Dr. Karl Clark of the University of Alberta during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a <b>light</b> <b>crude</b> oil equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment.

2500|$|The crude bitumen {{contained}} in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as [...] "a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow." [...] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) {{that it will not}} flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as <b>light</b> <b>crude</b> oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. [...] The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as [...] "oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10° API". [...] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. [...] Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria.
