Research in converting ocean energy to useful electricity has been ongoing for about 40 years, {{but no one has}} so far succeed to do it at sufficiently low cost. CorPower Ocean has developed a method, which in theory can achieve this. It uses a <b>light</b> <b>buoy</b> and a control strategy called Phase Control. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a mathematical model of this method - using LinearWave Theory to derive the hydrodynamic forces - and from the simulated results analyze the energy output of the method. In the process we create a program that will help realizing and improving the method further. The model is implemented and simulated in the simulation program Simulink. On the basis of the simulated results, we can concludes that the CorPower Ocean method is promising. The outcome shows that the energy output increases - up to five times- compared to conventional methods. Vågenergi är en förnyelsebar energikälla som ännu inte utnyttjas fullt ut. Forskning inom konvertering av vågenergi till användbar elektricitet har pågått i cirka 40 år, men ingen har hittills lyckas att göra det tillräckligt kostnadseffektivt. CorPower Ocean har utvecklat en metod, som i teorin kan uppnå detta. De använder en lätt boj och en kontrollstrategi kallad Phase Control. Syftet med detta examensarbete är att utveckla en matematisk modell av metoden -genom att använda Linear Wave Theory för att härleda de hydrodynamiska krafterna -och från de simulerade resultaten analysera energiutbytet. Under arbetets gång skapades också ett simuleringsprogram som hjälpmedel till att realisera och förbättra metoden. Modellen implementeras och simuleras i programmet Simulink. Utifrån de simulerade resultaten kan vi dra slutsatsen att CorPower Oceans metod är lovande. Resultatet visar att energiutbytet ökar -upp till fem gånger - jämfört med konventionella metoder...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional {{high-resolution}} maps {{of total}} surface current vectors {{obtained for the}} first time with an airborne demonstrator of the innovative Wavemill instrument concept are validated against HF radar data and compared with output from the POLCOMS high-resolution coastal ocean circulation model. Wavemill is a squinted along-track interferometric SAR system optimized for ocean surface current vector retrieval that operates at moderate incidence angles (∼ 30 °) and is compatible with spaceborne implementation. This paper represents the first comprehensive validation of the current retrieval capabilities of squinted along-track SAR interferometry in support of its development as a future European Space Agency Earth Explorer mission. Wavemill airborne data were acquired in October 2011 in Liverpool Bay off the west coast of Great Britain in light southerly wind (5. 5 m/s) and maximum tidal ebbing flow (0. 7 m/s) conditions. Contributions to the measured SAR interferometric phase by surface gravity waves, known as the Wind-wave induced Artefact Surface Velocity (WASV), were removed using our best estimate of wind conditions and the (Mouche et al., 2012) empirical correction derived from Envisat ASAR. Validation of the 1. 5 km resolution Wavemill current vectors against independent current measurements from HF radar gives very encouraging results, with Wavemill biases and precisions typically better than 0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s for surface current speed, and better than 10 ° and 7 ° for current direction. The sensitivity of the current retrieval to the wind vector used to compute the WASV is estimated. A ± 1 m/s error (bias) in wind speed has minimal impact on the quality of the retrieved currents. In contrast, the choice of wind direction is critical: a bias of ± 15 ° in the direction of the wind vector degrades the accuracy of the airborne current speed against the HF radar by about ± 0. 2 m/s. This highlights the need for future instruments to provide calibrated SAR Normalised Radar Cross Section data to support retrieval of wind and current vectors simultaneously. Comparisons of POLCOMS surface currents with HF radar data indicate that the model reproduces well the overall temporal evolution of the tidal current (correlation of spatial fields against HF radar over two tidal cycles of 0. 9) but that the model features a systematic 1 -h delay in the timing of the maximum ebbing flow in eastern parts of the domain near the Mersey Bar <b>Light</b> <b>buoy.</b> At the maximum ebb flow, the model underestimates the current speed (bias of − 0. 2 m/s) with respect to the HF radar and Wavemill data at the time of the flights. Both the HF radar and Wavemill data reflect much greater snapshot spatial variability of the ocean surface current field than is present in the model, resulting in poor correlation of instantaneous spatial fields (< 0. 5) between POLCOMS and the HF radar data. The Wavemill data reveal high spatial variability of ocean surface currents at fine scales, which are not visible in the 4 km resolution HF radar data. Wavemill detects several strong (1 – 1. 5 m/s) localized current jets associated with deeper bathymetry channels in shallow waters (< 10 m) that are too narrow or too close to land to be observed by the HF radar. The study confirms the value of synoptic wide-swath maps of high-resolution ocean surface current vectors for coastal applications and to validate and develop high-resolution ocean circulation models...|$|E
40|$|The {{training}} ship of the Nagasaki University Faculty of Fisheries, the "Nagasaki-maru" on her training voyage, {{happened to be}} overtaken by Typhoon No. 17 (Rubby), at Hongkong on September 5, 1964, and, being under the gusts of the maximum momentary velocity of 40 m/s for about 2 hours, recorded the maximum momentary wind velocity 54 m/s and the minimum atmospheric pressure 966 mb. Among the vessels at anchor there, 3 ships sank after grounding, 14 ships grounded and 120 junks sank. Owing to the operation by the angle regulation of the variable pitch propeller and the remote control of the main engine revolution, " the Nagasaki-maru" succeeded in keeping anchoring through the storm for about 8 hours without dragging the anchor. From these experiences and records, some studies were made on the anchoring in strong wind at a single ancdor of the variable propeller ship, {{and the results are}} reported here. (1) During the anchoring of 7 hours and 41 minutes, the regulations of the propeller pitch angle and the engine revolution were performed 726 times, that is, 1. 6 times per minute; and in every five minutes, 14 times were maximum and 2 times were minimum. (2) During the time, the anchoring was kept with the ship speed at 4 to 6 knots under the wind blowing at the maximum momentary velocity of 30 to 40 m/s and at 6 to 8 knots under the wind at the maximum momentary velocity of 40 to 50 m/s. However, the ship speed must be regulated properly according to the gustiness. When the gust changed its direction suddenly at the velocity of about 50 m/s, the helm was changed to head against the wind with the ship speed of about 11 knots. (3) The chief officer must be posted at the forecastle to report about the direction and the tension of the anchor chain. This is very important when the engine is operated in anchoring. And the ship is necessary to have an equipment furnished to connect the bridge with the forecastle. (4) The anchorage must be set up at a broad area of the sea without obstacles because the ship moves in a large scope using th﻿ engine, But it must not be positioned facing an open sea. It is needless to say that the type of the bottom is desirable to be good for holding the anchor. (5) The anchor chain should be slackened as long as possible. This serves not only to increase the holding power of the anchor but also to enlarge the action radius of the ship. (6) It is necessary to keep anchoring, knowing the position of the anchor by a buoy or a <b>light</b> <b>buoy</b> on the anchor. (7) When the variable pitch propeller ship tries to anchor using the engine, the engine can, of course. used easily. But it is left to a future study which is the more suitable, anchoring at a single anchor under the operation of the engine; or anchoring using another anchor as a preventive of yaw under the operation of the engine, for example, as the hammer lock moor, without letting the ship move so much﻿ 1) 7 時間 41 分の守錨の間に, 726 回のプロペラピッチ角度及び機関回転数の調整を行なった. 即ち平均 1 分間 1. 6 回の操作であり, 5 分間別に見ると 14 回が最多使用回数であり, 2 回が最少使用回数である. 2) 守錨時の船速は,最大瞬間風速 30 m/sから 40 m/sまでは, 4 ノットより 6 ノットの船速で,又 40 m/sから 50 m/sまでは, 6 ノットより 8 ノットの船速で守錨した. 然﻿し風の息を見ながら適宜調整しなければならない. 風向が,急変した 50 m/s前後の突風の場合は, 11 ノット前後の船速で転舵し,錨及び錨鎖の把駐力を利用し容易に風に立て得た. 3) 一等航海士を船首楼に配置し常に,錨鎖の方向,張力を報告させなければならない. これは守錨上の機関使用に非常に重大な事である. 又船橋と船首楼の間の連絡が,直ちにとれる装置が必要である. 4) 錨地は機関を使用し,広範囲の運動をする関係上邪魔物のない海面を選定しなければならない. 然し,外海に面して居ってはいけない. 錨かきの良好な底質である事は勿論である. 5) 錨鎖は許容限度まで伸ばす. これは錨及び錨鎖の把駐力を増す目的ばかりでなく,船の行動半径を広くするためでもある. 6) 錨に浮標又は燈浮標(漁業用) をつけ,錨の位置を知って守錨する事が必要である. 7) 可変ピッチプロペラ船の守錨の場合,容易に機関使用出来得るので,単錨泊にて機関使用し広い行動半径での守錨が,最適か,他の一錨を振れ止めに使用し,例えば,Hammer Lock Moorで余り船を行動させず機関使用して守錨するか,何れが最適であるかは,今後の問題である...|$|E
