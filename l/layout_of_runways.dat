50|$|Around {{the time}} of World War II the area now called Mira Mesa {{was used by the}} United States Army as a test area. Just west of U.S. Route 395 (now Interstate 15) was a Navy {{auxiliary}} landing field, known locally as Hourglass Field because the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runways</b> was a single piece of asphalt in the shape of an hourglass. The Navy also used the surrounding area as a bombing range.|$|R
50|$|May 1945: When World War II ended, the new {{airfield}} {{was still}} under construction. By then, the plans had already changed from tenuous wartime military use to overt development into an international airport. A photograph made in 1945 shows the first ∇ <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> three <b>runways,</b> and a perimeter road {{much smaller than the}} later airport boundary, and the former country lanes still existing, and Perry Oaks Farm and some buildings along Cain's Lane still standing among fields outside this perimeter.|$|R

5000|$|Eventually the {{airfield}} was abandoned {{and left to}} return to nature. The wattle grass soon grew into bushes and then into full size trees. This allowed {{the airfield}} site to be easily spotted from the air as late as 2006 with perfect runway layouts created by the overgrowth. Intensive sheep farming returned to the region and most traces of the base began to disappear. In the early 21st century a dairy boom took {{over most of the}} flat mid-Canterbury region including Te Pirita. By late 2010, three large rotary method dairy farms sat over the site of the airbase and most of the wattle tree-sown runways finally vanished, although the general <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runways</b> are still vaguely visible.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, an airfield (RAF Harrowbeer) was constructed at adjacent Harrowbeer as a fighter station for the air defence of Devonport Dockyard and the Western Approaches. A 19th century terrace of houses, now mostly converted into shops, had to have its upper storey removed to provide an easier approach. One tall building which was not altered was St. Paul's Church, but unfortunately the tower was hit by a plane, resulting in a warning light being fitted. The <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runways</b> is still very clear and although they are substantially grassed over, the many earth and brick protective bunkers built to protect the fighters from attack on the ground are all still in place. Some American airmen and anti-aircraft battery units were stationed here {{during the second half of}} the war. A plane carrying President Roosevelt landed here when its original destination was fogbound.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAirports expect major {{benefits}} from increasing predictability of the operation. This paper will investigate {{the use of}} forecast information to determine forecast airport capacity, which will allow airport stakeholders to optimize {{the use of their}} resources. The focus will be on forecasting runway capacity, at most airports the major factor for the overall airport capacity. The possibility to model forecast runway capacity, based on probabilistic inputs, will be investigated with a lead time up to two days. Inputs from meteorological services (wind speed, wind direction and visibility) are the major factors for determining which runways to use. Other inputs are runway availability, operational procedures and demand. The <b>runway</b> configuration <b>of</b> Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, with a complex <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> six <b>runways,</b> has been chosen for the evaluation. A large dataset, covering <b>runway</b> use <b>of</b> 2012 and half 2013, was used to evaluate the model, which forecasts runway configurations first and then calculates capacity forecasts. The paper will show that a high quality runway capacity forecast is feasible...|$|R
50|$|Hourglass {{field was}} located {{just west of}} U.S. Route 395 (now Interstate 15), about three miles north {{of what is now}} MCAS Miramar. It was {{formally}} known as Linda Vista Mesa Field and, later, Navy Outlying Field (NOLF) Miramar or Miramar Field / #01715 (OLF). From late 1931 to 1941 it was just a square clearing with an east-west runway. The popular name comes from the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the airport's <b>runway</b> system, which was a single piece of asphalt mostly in the shape of an hourglass (3 overlaping runways) which started construction in late 1941 and completed February 1, 1942. The hourglass field was primarily used for carrier landing practice during World War 2.|$|R
50|$|Because {{only one}} {{aircraft}} can land or depart from a runway {{at a given}} time, and because aircraft must be separated by a certain distance or time to avoid collisions, every airport has a finite capacity; it can safely handle only so many aircraft per hour. This capacity depends on many factors, such as the number <b>of</b> <b>runways</b> available, <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> taxi tracks, availability of air traffic control, and current or anticipated weather. The weather can cause large variations in capacity; strong winds may limit the number <b>of</b> <b>runways</b> available, and poor visibility may necessitate increases in separation between aircraft.|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure the}} safety of the {{national}} airspace system, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) oversees surveying programs with the goal of geolocating vertical features that penetrate 3 D Obstruction Identification Surfaces (OIS) around airfields. These OIS are defined mathematically and are based on the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runways,</b> the types <b>of</b> electronic navigation equipment used for each runway, and other factors. Under a series of interagency agreements, the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is tasked with supplying obstruction survey data to the FAA. Airport obstruction surveys have traditionally been conducted using a combination of photogrammetry and conventional field survey techniques. In this study, we investigate the use of airborne laser scanning technology for this application. Specifically, we examine the effects of varying the forward look angle, laser footprint, flying height, flying speed, scan angle, scan frequency, transmitted power, and receiver sensitivity, as these parameters relate to the detection and measurement of vertical obstructions. We present results of test flights over the Gainesville Regional Airport (GNV) using fourteen different configurations of an Optech ALTM 2050. The results are compared to field-surveyed obstruction data obtained by NGS. Our analysis shows that certain configurations of the airborne laser scanning system notably improve the detection of obstructions. In this study, the best results were obtained using a 20 ° forward tilt angle and a 0. 2 milliradian beam divergence from a flying height of 750 m. With this configuration, all obstructions were detected and the vertical accuracy (RMSE) was 0. 88 m when compared to the field-surveyed obstructions...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{detailed}} airport surface and terminal airspace models is growing as {{the scope and}} fidelity of air transportation system simulations expand. Currently, there are few detailed airport surface models used in air transportation system simulation and analysis, because the models are complex to develop and maintain. An improved method of generating detailed models is required to expand the set of detailed airport surface and terminal airspace models. In this paper, a means to automate the development of terminal area node-link graph models is investigated. Geographic information system data were pro-cessed through the geometric algorithms developed to capture the <b>layout</b> and connectivity <b>of</b> <b>runways</b> and taxiways, and node-link graphs were created using this information. The procedures were tested on about 80 US airports and proved to be robust and accurate.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{plan for the}} infrastructure of the Great Park was virtually identical to Newport Center, with five roads connecting into a central loop road separating the park into [...] "blocks". The design was later modified to include a large section <b>of</b> <b>runway</b> and conform more to the <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the original base, {{as a reminder of}} its history. Most prominent in the park plans is the restoration of Agua Chinon Creek, which had been channeled underground ever since the base was built in the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> Lulsgate Aerodrome {{was changed}} for 1950. The circuit was {{lengthened}} to 2.1 miles (3.4 km). The new <b>layout</b> used more <b>of</b> the perimeter {{track of the}} airfield instead <b>of</b> the <b>runways.</b> This meant that the circuit featured a longer straight between Dundry Corner and The Hairpin (the only used on the circuit). The start/finish straight was also moved to between Partridge Bend and North corner.|$|R

40|$|This report {{examines}} the current {{capacity of the}} EU’s airport infrastructure and highlights {{in a general way}} the main factors determining that capacity. In the report, the nature and the role of airport services are detailed and the multi-service networked industry that characterises airport operations is described. The determination of airport capacity is examined. Detailed discussion is given of the influence which air traffic control factors, demand characteristics, environmental conditions and the engineering design and <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway</b> system will have on that capacity. The methods used to assess capacity and delay are also detailed. Extensive data is presented from the Association of European Airlines (AEA) and EUROCONTROL’s Centre for Delay Analysis (CODA) to sketch the current state of Europe’s system of large airports. {{and the extent to which}} existing infrastructure is congested. This system of airports represents the main infrastructure of Europe’s aviation sector. The options available to policy makers to improve the management and organisation of existing capacity are set out and critically discussed. Tables giving the advantages and disadvantages of different demand management policies and procedures are presented, thus summarising the extensive literature in this area. Following on from this, several important issues arising when capacity needs to be expanded are highlighted. A number of practical difficulties are pinpointed and the tradeoffs facing policymakers are explained. For instance, where liberalisation has encouraged airlines to increase their frequency of service by, among other things, utilising smaller aircraft, this has the effect of using up available capacity at airports faster than would otherwise have been the case. Policymakers can influence the average size of aircraft in a positive way (which will have significant environmental benefits) through the pricing or airport charging policy. The balance between facilitating growth particularly of new entrant carriers on one hand, and emphasising environmental and sustainability goals on the other, will have to be addressed. The final section of the report relates these discussions to the issue of interoperability and briefly outlines some of the important policy considerations in this area.
