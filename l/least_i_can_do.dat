2500|$|In February 2001, Markhasev sent {{a letter}} to California Deputy Attorney General Kyle Brodie asking that all appeals in his case stop. Markhasev wrote to Brodie that he had killed Cosby and that he wanted {{to do the right thing}} by confessing. [...] "Although my appeal is in its {{beginning}} stages, I don't want to continue with it because it's based on falsehood and deceit," [...] wrote Markhasev, who is incarcerated at California State Prison, Corcoran. [...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right thing ... More than anything, I want to apologize to the victim's family. It is my duty as a Christian, and it's the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> after the great wickedness for which I am responsible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson {{regarding}} Alabama, that [...] "I am {{attempting to}} do the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> safely without upsetting the civil rights groups." [...] Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the [...] "high-visibility" [...] election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists. With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office. Clark later was prosecuted and convicted of drug smuggling and served a prison sentence. The US Civil Rights Commission said that the murders of activists, such as Jonathan Daniels in 1965, had been a major impediment to voter registration.|$|E

6000|$|The {{stranger}} {{glanced at}} Miss Townshead, who, though she wished to, {{could not quite}} check a smile. He was very young, and had a pleasant face. [...] "That was very kind of you," [...] he said. [...] "Now, <b>I</b> think the <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is to retire to the barn or stable.

It really made me feel welcomed. I was informed that I would have been greeted but this was not what I had in mind. I am a 100% sure I have made the right choice going to AEK.

[...] "People come to Europe in plastic boats and are being asked to show their birth certificates in order to enter a country. These people are not immigrants, they're refugees running from death.

2500|$|Gupta {{describes}} the letter written by Tagore as [...] "historic". He writes that Tagore [...] "renounced his knighthood in {{protest against the}} inhuman cruelty of the British Government {{to the people of}} Punjab", and he quotes Tagore's letter to the Viceroy [...] "The enormity of the measures taken by the Government in the Punjab for quelling some local disturbances has, with a rude shock, revealed to our minds the helplessness of our position as British subjects in India ... he very <b>least</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for my country is to take all consequences upon myself in giving voice to the protest of the millions of my countrymen, surprised into a dumb anguish of terror. The time has come when badges of honour make our shame glaring in the incongruous context of humiliation..." [...] English Writings of Rabindranath Tagore Miscellaneous Writings Vol# 8 carries a facsimile of this hand written letter.|$|R

I would like to express my great appreciation and gratefulness to Dr. Sharief Deshmukh who guided me throughout my studies and devoted much of this precious time to help me in preparing this thesis. I wish to thank King Saud University, particularly the Mathematics Department of the Faculty of Science, for giving me the opportunity for graduate study.

5000|$|Portugal's representative, Salvador Sobral drew {{attention}} to the European migrant crisis by turning up to the first semi-final winners' press conference in an [...] "S.O.S.

Later on, EBU ordered a ban so that he could not wear it {{for the remainder of the}} contest. The EBU explained that Sobral's jumper was used as a means of [...] "political message," [...] which violates the rules of the contest. However, Sobral argued in his winning press conference that it was not political, but a message of humanitarianism.|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR ROBERT,--My secret {{shall never}} be used again. I cannot [...] {{tell you how}} I thank Heaven that I did not entirely confide it to [...] you, for I should have been handing over an {{inheritance}} of misery [...] both to yourself and others. For myself I have hardly had a happy [...] moment since I discovered it. This I could have borne had I been [...] able to feel that I was doing good, but, alas! the only effect of my [...] attempts has been to turn workers into idlers, contented men into [...] greedy parasites, and, worst of all, true, pure women into [...] deceivers and hypocrites. If this {{is the effect of}} my interference [...] on a small scale, I cannot hope for anything better were I to carry [...] out the plans which we have so often discussed.

It is [...] my wish that such valuables as remain in the Hall should be sold, [...] and the proceeds divided amidst all the charities of Birmingham. [...] I shall leave tonight if I am well enough, but I have been much [...] troubled all day by a stabbing pain in my side. It is as if wealth [...] were as bad for health as it is for peace of mind. Good-bye, [...] Robert, and may you never have as sad a heart as I have to-night. [...] Yours very truly, [...] RAFFLES HAW." ...|$|R

6000|$|When {{this office}} was {{proposed}} to me, {{some of you}} know that I was not very ambitious to accept it, at first. I was taught {{to believe that there}} were more or less certain important duties which would lie in my power. This, I confess, was my chief motive in going into it--at least, in reconciling the objections felt to such things; for if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> anything to honour you and my dear old Alma Mater, why should I not do so? (Loud cheers.) Well, but on practically looking into the matter when the office actually came into my hands, I find it grows more and more uncertain and abstruse to me whether there is much real duty that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> at all. <b>I</b> live four hundred miles away from you, in an entirely different state of things; and my weak health--now for many years accumulating upon me--and a total unacquaintance with such subjects as concern your affairs here,--all this fills me with apprehension that there is really nothing worth the <b>least</b> consideration that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> on that score. You may, however, depend upon it that if any such duty does arise in any form, I will use my most faithful endeavour to do whatever is right and proper, according {{to the best of my}} judgment.

6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} of Pitsea," [...] the doctor went on, [...] "but I do know Hole Haven. When I was walking the hospital, {{three or four of}} us had a little sailing-boat, and used to go out from Saturday until Monday morning. Hole Haven was {{generally}} the limit of our excursions. It is a snug little harbor for small boats, and there is a comfortable old-fashioned little inn there, where we used to sleep. The coastguards were all sociable fellows, ready to chat with strangers and not averse to a small tip. Of course the same men will not be there now, nor would it be very safe to ask questions of them; for no doubt they are on friendly terms with the men on the barges which go up and down the creek. I might, however, learn something from them of the ways of these men, and I should think that, on giving my card to the petty officer in charge, I could safely question him. I don't suppose that he would know where this man Nibson has his headquarters. If he lives at Rochester, or Chatham, or at Limehouse, or Shadwell, he certainly would not know him; but if he lives at Pitsea he might know him. I fancy they keep a pretty sharp lookout on the barges. I know that the coastguard told me that there was still a good deal of smuggling carried on in the marshes between Leigh and Thames Haven. I fancy, from what he said, that the Leigh fishermen think it no harm to run a few pounds of tobacco or a keg of spirit from a passing ship, and, indeed, as there are so many vessels that go ashore on the sands below, and as they are generally engaged in unloading them or helping them to get off, they have considerable facilities that way. At any rate, as an old frequenter of the place and as knowing the landlord--that is to say if there has been no change there--no suspicion could fall upon me of going down there in reference to your affair. To-day is Friday. On Sunday morning, early, I will run down to Gravesend, hire a boat there, and will sail down to Hole Haven. It will be an outing for me, and a pleasant one; and at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> be <b>doing</b> no harm." ...|$|R
