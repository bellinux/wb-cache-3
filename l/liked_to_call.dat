25|$|While {{not a man}} {{of public}} life, Jost devoted himself {{to the cause of}} orphans, and to his {{initiative}} was due the establishment in Frankfort-on-the-Main of a girls' orphan asylum (1853). He was instrumental also in founding a society (Permissionistenverein, 1843) for the aid of those who, according to the law then in existence, had no claim on the Frankfort charitable institutions, not being freemen of the city; he founded the Creizenach Stiftung, for the aid of aged teachers and their families (1842), and he often assisted young students and poor authors with both advice and influence. He was {{also a member of the}} Society for the Culture and Science of the Jews alongside Joel Abraham List, Isaac Marcus Jost, Leopold Zunz, and Eduard Gans. While advanced in his views, he was indifferent to Reform, and for years never attended a religious service (Zirndorf, Isaak Markus Jost und Seine Freunde, p.130). He married in 1816 a Miss Wolf, niece of Isaac Euchel. She died in 1842. He devoted himself with paternal affection to the pupils of the orphan asylum, whom he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his children.|$|E
25|$|Papen was {{a member}} of the highly {{exclusive}} Deutscher Herrenklub (German Gentlemen's Club) of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. Papen, a man completely unknown to the general public, was well known in elite circles in Berlin for his sense of style which together with his colorful and much embellished recounting of his adventures in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Flanders, France and the Ottoman Empire in the World War and his capacity to tell a seemingly endless number of jokes all combined to make a much sought after dinner guest among the elite. Most people knew that the more fanciful exploits Papen described were exaggerations, if not fabrications, but Papen was such an entertaining raconteur who excelled at light conversation that few cared. At the Deutscher Herrenklub, Papen would spend hours drinking and talking with his best friend General Kurt von Schleicher who enjoyed his company. Schleicher and his friends <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Papen Fränzchen, a somewhat disparaging diminutive of his name Franz, but the French ambassador André François-Poncet who also a member of the Herrenklub noted:"Papen sometimes served as the butt of their jokes; they enjoyed making fun of and teasing him, without him taking the least offense".|$|E

Wyatt remained in San Francisco for about nine months until early 1883, when Josephine and he left San Francisco together for Silverton, Colorado, where silver and gold mining were flourishing. It {{was the first of}} many mining camps and boomtowns in which they lived. Josephine, or Sadie as Wyatt <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> her, was Wyatt's common-law wife until his death 46 years later.|$|E

500|$|The young Hepburn was a tomboy who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> herself Jimmy, and cut {{her hair}} short. Thomas Hepburn was eager for his {{children}} to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis. Golf became a passion of Katharine's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning {{in the belief that}} [...] "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you." [...] Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night. She would put on plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket {{to raise money for the}} Navajo people.|$|E
500|$|Wagner did not resume work on Parsifal {{for eight}} years, {{during which time}} he {{completed}} Tristan und Isolde and began Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg. Then, between 27 and 30 August 1865, he took up Parsifal again and made a prose draft of the work; this contains a fairly brief outline of the plot and {{a considerable amount of}} detailed commentary on the characters and themes of the drama. But once again the work was dropped and set aside for another eleven and a half years. During this time most of Wagner's creative energy was devoted to the Ring cycle, which was finally completed in 1874 and given its first full performance at Bayreuth in August 1876. Only when this gargantuan task had been accomplished did Wagner find the time to concentrate on Parsifal. By 23 February 1877 he had completed a second and more extensive prose draft of the work, and by 19 April of the same year he had transformed this into a verse libretto (or [...] "poem", as Wagner <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his libretti).|$|E

For the Conducător (the [...] "Leader"), as Ceaușescu <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> himself, [...] "demography was destiny" [...] and countries with rising populations were rising powers.

2500|$|Joanna Rapf, {{writing about}} the filming of The Verdict, states that Lumet gave a lot of {{personal}} attention to his actors, whether listening to them or touching them. She describes how Lumet and star Paul Newman sat on a bench secluded from the main set, where Newman had taken his shoes off, in order to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot[...] [...] [...] The actors walk through their scenes before the camera rolls. This preparation was done because Lumet likes to shoot a scene in one take, two at the most. Newman <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> him [...] "Speedy Gonzales," [...] adding that Lumet did not shoot more than he had to. [...] "He doesn't give himself any protection.

[...] Many visiting clergy in Fulham Palace found themselves unable to refuse Creighton's enthusiastic invitations to join in. [...] The Creightons were inveterate travellers, spending many vacations in Italy. [...] During their {{six years in}} Peterborough, for instance, they made nine foreign trips. [...] Creighton was also a lifelong chain smoker. [...] When author Samuel Butler, no sympathiser of churchmen, received a letter in 1893 inviting him to visit the Creighton family in Peterborough, he was immediately put at ease when he discovered some tobacco thoughtlessly left in the envelope by the Bishop of Peterborough.|$|E

2500|$|Fair Copy (Reinschrift des Textbuches) – a clean, {{carefully}} written verse libretto (or Dichtung, [...] "poem", as Wagner <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> his finished libretti), usually free {{of corrections}} and alterations. Punctuation and capitalization were regularized at this stage. The fair copies generally incorporated {{the final version}} of any passage of the corresponding verse draft for which Wagner had sketched two or more competing versions; in a few cases the fair copy has an entirely new variant. The fair copies, however, were not necessarily the final versions of the libretti, as Wagner frequently made slight – but sometimes telling – alterations to the text during the composition of the music. Furthermore, he sometimes made two, three, or even four fair copies, incorporating revisions as he did so, in which case the fair copies are called respectively Zweitschrift (des Textbuches), Drittschrift, Viertschrift, and Fünftschrift.|$|E

A native of Morganton, he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> himself a [...] "country lawyer," [...] and often told humorous stories in his Southern drawl. During his Senate career, Ervin was a legal defender of the Jim Crow laws and racial segregation, as the South's {{constitutional}} expert during the congressional debates on civil rights. Unexpectedly, he became a liberal hero for his support of civil liberties. He is remembered for his work in the investigation committees that brought down Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954 and especially for his investigation of the Watergate scandal in 1972 and 1973 that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974.|$|E

2500|$|Henrietta Maria {{had strong}} Catholic beliefs, which would heavily {{influence}} her time as queen, {{and particularly the}} initial years following her marriage.

Henrietta Maria was very open about her Catholic beliefs, {{to the point of}} it being [...] "flagrant" [...] and [...] "unapologetic"; she obstructed plans to forcibly take into care the eldest sons of all Catholic families with the aim of bringing them up as Protestants, and also facilitated Catholic marriages, committing a criminal offence under English law at the time. In July 1626, Henrietta Maria stopped to pray for Catholics who had died at the Tyburn tree, causing huge controversy– Catholics were still being executed in England during the 1620s, and Henrietta Maria felt passionately about her faith. In due course, Henrietta Maria would unsuccessfully try to convert her Calvinist nephew Prince Rupert during his stay in England.|$|E
2500|$|Despite leaving Apple as {{a day-to-day}} {{employee}} in 1985, Wozniak chose to never remove {{himself from the}} official employee list, and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews. Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role, estimated to be $120,000 per year. He is also an Apple shareholder. He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs' death in October 2011, however, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close {{as they used to}} be. In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh [...] "failed" [...] under Steve Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He called the Apple Lisa group the team that had kicked Jobs out, and that Jobs <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the Lisa group [...] "idiots for making [...] too expensive". To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was [...] "weak", [...] "lousy" [...] and [...] "still at a fairly high price". [...] "He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there", says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley [...] "who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away".|$|E
2500|$|Ironically, Sorge's {{spying for}} the Soviets in Japan during the late-1930s was {{probably}} safer for him than {{if he had}} been in Moscow. Claiming too many pressing responsibilities, he disobeyed Stalin's orders to return to the Soviet Union in 1937 during the Great Purge, as he realized the risk of arrest and execution, given Stalin's general paranoia (especially towards the intelligence community) and Sorge's German citizenship. In fact, two of Sorge's earliest GRU handlers, Yan Karlovich Berzin and his successor, Artur Khristianovich Artuzov, were shot during the purges. In 1938, the German ambassador to Britain, Joachim von Ribbentrop was promoted to foreign minister, and to replace Ribbentrop, Dirksen was sent to London. Ribbentrop promoted General Ott to be Dirksen's replacement. Ott, by now aware that Sorge was sleeping with his wife, let his friend Sorge have [...] "free run of the embassy night and day" [...] as one German diplomat later recalled. Ott tolerated Sorge's affair with his wife, on the grounds that Sorge was such a charismatic man that women were always falling in love with him, and so it was only natural that Sorge would sleep with his wife. Ott <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> Sorge Richard der Unwiderstehliche ("Richard the Irresistible") as his charm made him very attractive to women. Ott greatly valued Sorge as a source of information about the secretive world of Japanese politics and especially Japan's war with China as he could found that Sorge knew things about Japan that no other Westerner knew, {{to such an extent that}} did not care about Sorge's affair with his wife Helma.|$|E

2500|$|Born in Rusinów, he was {{an activist}} of the Polish Socialist Party who {{began his career as}} an {{attorney}} in 1894 in Warsaw, Russian partition (Congress Poland). From 1903 he became involved in legal assistance for political prisoners, and since defended many Poles accused for political dissident as well as members of Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party before the Russian courts in Russian partitioned Poland (particularly in the Warsaw Citadel). Founder and activist of Polish legal association grouping like-minded lawyers (Koło Obrońców Politycznych - The Circle of Political Defenders) as well as of other organizations dedicated to helping political prisoners (Ogólna Kasa Pomocy dla Więźniów Politycznych (General Bank for Helping Political Prisoners), Związek Pomocy dla Ofiar Politycznych (Association of Help for Political Repression Victims); those organizations would be headquartered in his legal offices. In the years 1905-1907 the lawyers of Koło took part in about 260 trials; over 20% were found innocent. During that period he met his future partner, Stefania Sempołowska, a semi-official secretary and counselor of the Koło. He was the personal defender of such high-profile defendants as Stefan Aleksander Okrzeja and Józef Montwiłł-Mirecki, and gained reputation as an excellent orator and lawyer. He gained such a reputation, and skills, that government provocateurs and agents he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> for witness commonly made mistakes in their testimonies.

2500|$|Blomstedt himself died prematurely in 1935, aged 35. The {{significant}} {{vehicle for}} the development of modernism in Finland was his contemporary, Alvar Aalto, who was a friend of Asplund as well as key Swedish architect Sven Markelius. The latter had invited Aalto to join Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), ostensibly run by Le Corbusier. Aalto's reputation as a significant contributor to modernism was endorsed by his involvement in CIAM and by the inclusion of his works in significant architectural journals worldwide as well as significant histories of architecture, notably in the second edition (1949) of Space, Time and Architecture by the secretary-general of CIAM, Sigfried Giedion. Aalto's significant buildings from the early period of Modernism, which basically corresponded to the theoretical principles and architectural aesthetic of Le Corbusier and other modernist architects such as Walter Gropius, include the Turku Sanomat newspaper offices, Turku, Paimio tuberculosis sanatorium (1932) (part of a nationwide campaign for tuberculosis sanatorium construction) and Viipuri Library (1927–35). Central to Functionalism was paying close attention to how the building is used. In the case of the Aalto's Paimio tuberculosis sanatorium, the starting point for the design, he himself claimed, was to make the building itself a contributor to the healing process. Aalto <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the building a [...] "medical instrument". For instance, particular attention was paid to the design of the patient bedrooms: these generally held two patients, each with his or her own cupboard and washbasin. Aalto designed special non-splash basins, so that the patient would not disturb the other while washing. The patients spent many hours lying down, and thus Aalto placed the lamps in the room out of the patients line of vision and painted the ceiling a relaxing dark green so as to avoid glare. Each patient had their own specially designed cupboard, fixed to the wall and off the floor so as to aid in cleaning beneath it.|$|E
