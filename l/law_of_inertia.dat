25|$|Newton founded his {{principles}} of natural philosophy on three proposed laws of motion: the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), {{and the law}} of action and reaction; and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics.

Newton also enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. In mechanics, Newton {{was also the first}} to provide the first correct scientific and mathematical formulation of gravity in Newton's law of universal gravitation. The combination of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provide the fullest and most accurate description of classical mechanics.

40|$|The contour of {{the flow}} pulse along the normal unopened aorta of human {{subjects}} and dogs was established by recording with the surgical probe type, square-wave magnetic flowmeter. The contour at a given vessel segment {{was found to be}} the result of the transforming action of the arterial system on the ventricular ejection pulse. The char-acteristics of the aorta and its branches were found to be analagous to a low-pass electric tuned circuit, which resonates at 3 to 6 c. p. s. The resonant frequency, apparent from midsystole throughout diastole, was independent of heart rate, damped to extinction during diastole and renewed with each systole. New terms for elastic hydraulics are proposed and defined. CUMULATIVE experience in measuringthe normal aortic blood flow in 85 dogs and 10 human subjects has revealed a wide variation in flow pulse contour. A reasonable explanation of the major variations is needed, not alone for the sake of knowledge, but also to help future investigators establish the nor-malcy and validity of a given flow pulse. In addition, new practical approaches to diag-nosis of heart and vascular diseases will result from an understanding of the pulsatile dynamics in the arterial system.

6000|$|As is well known, the {{fundamental}} {{law of the}} mechanics of Galilei-Newton, which {{is known as the}} <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.

The visible fixed stars are bodies for which the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> certainly holds to a high degree of approximation.

6000|$|... [2] Mr Herbert Spencer, {{who also}} distinguishes between {{abstract}} and concrete sciences, employs the terms {{in a different}} sense from that explained above. He calls a science abstract when its truths are merely ideal; when, like the truths of geometry, they are not exactly true of real things--or, like the so-called <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> (the persistence in direction and velocity of a motion once impressed) are [...] "involved" [...] in experience but never actually seen in it, being always more or less completely frustrated. Chemistry and biology he includes, on the contrary, among concrete sciences, because chemical combinations and decompositions, and the physiological action of tissues, do actually take place (as our senses testify) {{in the manner in}} which the scientific propositions state them to take place. We will not discuss the logical or philological propriety of either use of the terms abstract and concrete, in which twofold point of view very few of the numerous acceptations of these words are entirely defensible: but of the two distinctions M. Comte's answers to by far the deepest and most vital difference. Mr Spencer's is open to the radical objection, that it classifies truths not according to their subject-matter or their mutual relations, but according to an unimportant difference {{in the manner in which}} we come to know them. Of what consequence is it that the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> (considered as an exact truth) is not generalized from our direct perceptions, but inferred by combining with the movements which we see, those which we should see if it were not for the disturbing causes? In either case we are equally certain that it is an exact truth: for every dynamical law is perfectly fulfilled even when it seems to be counteracted. There must, we should think, be many truths in physiology (for example) which are only known by a similar indirect process; and Mr Spencer would hardly detach these from the body of the science, and call them abstract and the remainder concrete.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the hidden quantum {{processes that are}} responsible for Newton's <b>laws</b> <b>of</b> motion and Newton's universal <b>law</b> <b>of</b> gravity. We apply Electro-Magnetic Quantum Gravity or EMQG to investigate Newtonian classical physics. EQMG is a quantum gravity theory that is manifestly compatible with Cellular Automata (CA) theory, a new paradigm for physical reality. EMQG is also based on a theory <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> proposed by R. Haisch, A. Rueda, and H. Puthoff, which we modified and called Quantum Inertia (QI). Quantum Inertia theory states that in Newton's 2 nd <b>law</b> <b>of</b> motion (F=MA), <b>inertia</b> is caused by the strictly local electrical force interactions bewteen matter (ultimately composed of electrically charged quantum particles) and the surrounding electrically charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. When an electrically charged particle is accelerated, an electrical force results between the particle and the surrounding electrically charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum appears in a direction to oppose the acceleration. The sum of all the tiny electrical forces originating between each charged particle and the surrounding quantum vacuum, {{is the source of the}} total inertial force of a mass which opposes accelerated motion in Newton's F = MA. Quantum Inertia theory resolves the problems and paradoxes of accelerated motion introduced in Mach's principle by suggesting that the state of acceleration of the charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum with respect to a mass, serves the function of Newton's absolute space for accelerated masses only.

It supposes that nothing can be a ‚Äúsufficient reason‚Äù for a body‚Äôs moving in one particular direction, except some external force. But {{this is the very}} thing to be proved. Why not some internal force? Why not the law of the thing‚Äôs own nature? Since these philosophers think it necessary to prove the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> they of course do not suppose it to be self-evident; they must, therefore, be of opinion that previously to all proof, the supposition of a body‚Äôs moving by internal impulse is an admissible hypothesis; but if so, why is not the hypothesis also admissible, that the internal impulse acts naturally in some one particular direction, not in another? If spontaneous motion might have been the law of matter, why not spontaneous motion toward the sun, toward the earth, or toward the zenith? Why not, as the ancients supposed, toward a particular place in the universe, appropriated to each particular kind of substance? Surely it is not allowable to say that spontaneity of motion is credible in itself, but not credible if supposed to take place in any determinate direction.|$|E

But who could know, antecedently to experience, whether there was a reason or not? Might it not be the nature of bodies, or of some particular bodies, to deviate toward the right? or if the supposition is preferred, toward the east, or south? It was long thought that bodies, terrestrial ones at least, had a natural tendency to deflect downward; and there is no shadow of any thing objectionable in the supposition, except that it is not true. The pretended proof of the law of motion is even more manifestly untenable than that of the <b>law</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> for it is flagrantly inconsistent; it assumes that the continuance of motion in the direction first taken is more natural than deviation either to the right or to the left, but denies that one of these can possibly be more natural than the other. All these fancies of the possibility of knowing what is natural or not natural by any other means than experience, are, in truth, entirely futile.
