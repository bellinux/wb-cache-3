5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. These features, in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|Boeing built a final {{assembly}} line in Washington at its Renton factory, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, {{about half of the}} aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and empennage, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. Fairchild Aircraft made the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> Grumman supplied the flaps, and Rockwell International produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and {{final assembly}} of the first aircraft began in January 1981.|$|E
50|$|The {{wings of}} birds have a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> feature called the Alula which delays wing {{stalling}} at low speeds {{in a similar}} manner to the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> on an aircraft wing.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} in the Langley Low Turbulence Pressure Tunnel {{to determine the effects of}} Reynolds number and Mach number on the two-dimensional aerodynamic performance of two supercritical type airfoils, one equipped with a conventional flap system and the other with an advanced high lift flap system. The conventional flap system consisted of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and a double slotted, trailing edge flap with a small chord vane and a large chord aft flap. The advanced flap system consisted of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and a double slotted, trailing edge flap with a large chord vane and a small chord aft flap. Both models were tested with all elements nested to form the cruise airfoil and with the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and with a single or double slotted, trailing edge flap deflected to form the high lift airfoils. The experimental tests were conducted through a Reynolds number range from 2. 8 to 20. 9 x 1, 000, 000 and a Mach number range from 0. 10 to 0. 35. Lift and pitching moment data were obtained. Summaries of the test results obtained are presented and comparisons are made between the observed aerodynamic performance trends for both models. The results showing the effect of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> frost and glaze ice formation is given...|$|R
40|$|The noise sources at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> in a {{high-lift}} device configuration are {{investigated by}} means of the causality correlation method. The calculated cross-correlation between the acoustic far-field pressure and near-field fluctuations obtained via particle image velocimetry (PIV) provides information about the flow structures which are part of the sound generation process...|$|R
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.|$|E
40|$|Three {{high lift}} systems for a 9. 3 percent blunt based, {{supercritical}} airfoil were designed, fabricated, and wind tunnel tested. A method for calculating the viscous flow about two dimensional multicomponent airfoils was evaluated by comparing its predictions with test data. A comparison of high lift systems derived from supercritical airfoils with high lift systems derived from conventional airfoils is presented. The high lift {{systems for the}} supercritical airfoil were designed to achieve maximum lift and consisted of: (1) a single slotted flap, (2) a double slotted flap and a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat,</b> and (3) a triple slotted flap and a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat.</b> Aerodynamic force and moment data and surface pressure data are presented for all configurations and boundary layer and wake profiles for the single slotted flap configuration.

40|$|A {{gradient-based}} optimization is used {{in order}} to improve the shape of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> upstream of a DU 91 -W 2 - 250 airfoil. The simulations are performed by solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Gradients are computed via the adjoint approach, which is suitable to deal with many design parameters, but keeping the computational costs low. The implementation is verified by comparing the gradients from the adjoint method with gradients obtained by finite differences for a NACA 0012 airfoil. The simulations of the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> are validated against measurements from the acoustic wind tunnel of Oldenburg University at a Reynolds number of Re = 6 • 105. The shape of the slat is optimized using the adjoint approach resulting in a drag reduction of 2 %. Although the optimization is done for Re = 6 • 105, the improvements also hold for a higher Reynolds number of Re = 7. 9 • 106, which is more realistic at modern wind turbines...|$|R

25|$|A post-incident {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} the aircraft had suffered damage to the left wing's <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> ailerons and flaps. Despite the incident, CAL FIRE stated that they were happy with the aircraft. The aircraft returned to the sky for a test flight after repairs on July 30, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The wings were {{fitted with}} slotted flaps and full length <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> {{and could be}} folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a {{variable}} angle of incidence, pivoting at the front spar and actuated by an electrically driven jackscrew attached to the rear spar. This arrangement reduced stalling speed and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Handley Page {{developed}} the Handley Page Slat (or slot, see slats), an auxiliary airfoil mounted ahead {{and over the}} main wing, which formed a narrow opening running along the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing to improve airflow at high angles of attack. The <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> was simultaneously designed by the German aerodynamicist Gustav Lachmann, who was later employed by Handley Page. The design was so successful that licensing fees to other companies was their main source of income in the early 1920s.|$|R

50|$|Only {{the upper}} wing carried control surfaces, {{with a single}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> over the whole span. Apart from a small centre section with a large cut-out to improve the {{visibility}} from the pilot's cockpit, {{the whole of the}} trailing edge was filled by flaps inboard and ailerons outboard. When the slats were opened by the pilot, ailerons and flaps were depressed but retained their normal functions with unchanged angular defection ranges.|$|R
25|$|The Eurofighter Typhoon {{is unique}} in modern combat {{aircraft}} in that there are four separate assembly lines. Each partner company assembles its own national aircraft, but builds the same parts for all aircraft (including exports); Premium AEROTEC (main centre fuselage), EADS CASA (right wing, <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats),</b> BAE Systems (front fuselage (including foreplanes), canopy, dorsal spine, tail fin, inboard flaperons, rear fuselage section) and Leonardo (left wing, outboard flaperons, rear fuselage sections).|$|E
25|$|The Be-103 {{features}} include an advanced, blended wing, swept at 22°, with -long fixed <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> trailing-link main landing gear, and three-bladed MT-12 reverse pitch propellers. Fuel {{is stored in}} the wet wings. The aircraft is built from aluminum-lithium alloy with titanium used in high-stress areas. A 30-parameter, five-hour flight data recorder, engine fire-detection systems and an ice detector are also standard, as are hydraulic brakes. However, unlike most modern aircraft, the Be-103 is not equipped with wing flaps.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} sustained significant structural damage. There was major {{damage to}} the left wing's leading edge, <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> trailing edge flaps, and spoilers. The left wing fuel tank was breached near the outboard end of the outboard flaps. The front radome and weather radar were heavily damaged, and {{damage to the}} underside of the fuselage extended {{from the front of the}} aircraft all the way back to the left front passenger door. The nose landing gear well and the main electronics bay also were damaged.|$|E

Synchronously microphone measurements in the far-field of the wing's suction and pressure side are performed. By calculating the cross-correlation between the obtained near- and far-field quantities, regularities in the near-field related to the radiated sound-field are identified. Results for different angles of attack are compared and analyzed...|$|R
5|$|All {{versions}} of the Su-25 have a metal cantilever wing, of moderate sweep, high aspect ratio and equipped with high-lift devices. The wing consists of two cantilever sections attached to a central torsion box, forming a single unit with the fuselage. The air brakes are housed in fairings {{at the tip of}} each wing. Each wing has five hardpoints for weapons carriage, with the attachment points mounted on load-bearing ribs and spars. Each wing also features a five-section <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat,</b> a two-section flap and an aileron.|$|R
5000|$|The Canadair Sabre Mk.6 was {{the final}} variant and was {{considered}} to be the [...] "best" [...] production Sabre ever built. It was equipped with a two-stage Orenda engine developing 7,275 lb (3,302 kg.) of static thrust. Its altitude performance and climb rate was enhanced over the Mk 5 and the reinstatement of the wing <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> gave it excellent low-speed characteristics. The first production model was completed on 2 November 1954 and ultimately 655 were built with production terminating on 9 October 1958.|$|R
25|$|The design's {{potential}} for supersonic performance and reduced transonic drag stirred {{interest in the}} U.S. Navy. By 1953, redesigns led to a completely new aircraft bearing {{no more than a}} familial resemblance to the Cougar. The new wing had full-span <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> and trailing edge flaps with roll control achieved using spoilers rather than traditional ailerons. For storage on aircraft carriers, the F-11 Tiger's wings manually folded downwards. Anticipating supersonic performance, the tailplane was all-moving. The aircraft was designed for the Wright J65 turbojet, a license-built version of the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{horizontal}} stabilizer design was free-floating; the attached small foreplane was directly {{controlled by the}} pilot and pulled the stabilizer up or down; so, it was aerodynamically, not mechanically controlled, and this resulted in sluggish pitch control, increasingly so at low speeds where airflow over the small foreplane was lessened, and if the project had developed further, {{it probably would have}} been replaced by a conventional all-flying tailplane. The unpredictable behavior of the design often caused pilot-induced oscillations, with the sudden and erratic deployment of <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> causing the aircraft to be nearly uncontrollable much of the time.|$|E
25|$|The entire wing was redesigned, {{the most}} obvious change being the new quasi-elliptical wingtips, and the slight {{reduction}} of the aerodynamic area to 16.05m² (172.76ft²). Other features of the redesigned wings included new <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> which were slightly shorter but had a slightly increased chord; and new rounded, removable wingtips which changed the planview of the wings and increased the span slightly over that of the E-series. Frise-type ailerons replaced the plain ailerons of the previous models. The 2R1 profile was used with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 14.2% at the root reducing to 11.35% at the last rib. As before, dihedral was 6.53°.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} procedure {{for determining the}} position (horizontal location, vertical location, and deflection) of a <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> that maximizes the lift of multielement airfoils is presented. The structure of the flow field is calculated by iteratively coupling potential flow and boundary layer analysis. This aerodynamic calculation is combined with a constrained function minimization analysis to determine {{the position of a}} <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> so that the suction peak on the nose of the main airfoil is minized. The slat position is constrained by the {{numerical procedure}} to ensure an attached boundary layer on the upper surface of the slat and to ensure negligible interaction between the slat wake and the boundary layer on the upper surface of the main airfoil. The highest angle attack at which this optimized slat position can maintain attached flow on the main airfoil defines the optimum slat position for maximum lift. The design method is demonstrated for an airfoil equipped with a leading-edge slat and a trailing edge, single-slotted flap. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data, obtained in the Ames 40 by 80 Foot Wind Tunnel, to verify experimentally the predicted slat position for maximum lift. The experimentally optimized slat position is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, indicating that the theoretical procedure is a feasible design method...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is the {{experimental}} detection of noise sources at the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> in a high-lift device configuration. The noise generation mechanisms are experimentally investigated by means of pressure and velocity measurements in the near-field and microphone measurements in the far-field. The measurements were conducted in a synchronized manner so as to enable the calculation of the cross-correlation between the acoustic pressure and the near-field fluctuations. The main idea of the concept presented here was to use the coefficient matrix obtained from the aforementioned correlation to identify regularities in the near-field fluctuations {{that are related to}} the radiated sound- field...|$|R

The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit {{was part of}} an escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats</b> and double slotted flaps over its full length.

The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage F1 used a shoulder-mounted swept wing, {{instead of}} the Delta wing of the Mirage III, which {{resulted}} in a more than 50% reduction in required runway lengths and increased internal fuel tankage for 40% greater combat range. The approach speed prior to landing is 25% less than the preceding Mirage IIIE. According to Dassault, the negative performance impact associated with the increased thickness of the Mirage F1's wing over the Mirage III's counterpart had been offset by improvements made to the propulsion system. The wing is fitted with both double-slotted trailing edge flaps and full-span <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slats,</b> the latter being automatically operated to reduce the aircraft's turn radius during combat.|$|E

40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{scheduling}} the <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> <b>slat</b> and optimizing lift-to-drag ratio (LDR) are compared. One method employs wind tunnel data on pitching moment, lift force, and drag force {{to obtain the}} LDR for assumed Mach number, slat position, and AOA while using an elevator setting that is taken as the trim setting for which the pitching moment is zero. The second method uses the complete 6 -DOF simulation model and associated trim algorithm to generate the LDR for a given flight condition and aircraft configuration. The comparison shows that the second method is more realistic as well as simple. It is recommended that this technique be used to arrive at control surface schedules for optimal aircraft performance...|$|R
