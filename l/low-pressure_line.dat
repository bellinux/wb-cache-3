40|$|A micro Joule-Thomson cold {{stage was}} designed, built and tested, {{as part of}} the micro cooling {{research}} project at the University of Twente. The cold stage consists of a stack of three glass wafers. In the top wafer, the high-pressure line is etched as a rectangular channel with supporting pillars. The high-pressure line ends in a flow restriction and an evaporator volume that crosses the center wafer into the bottom wafer. The bottom wafer contains the <b>low-pressure</b> <b>line,</b> again etched as a rectangular channel containing supporting pillars, thus forming a counter-flow heat exchanger. A design aimed at a net cooling power of 10 mW at 96 K and operating with nitrogen as the working fluid was optimized based on the minimization of entropy production. The optimum cold finger measures 28 mm x 2. 2 mm x 0. 8 mm (max. dimensions). It should be able to generate a net cooling power of 10 mW at 96 K at a nitrogen flow of 1 mg/s at a high pressure of 80 bar and a low pressure of 6 bar. A batch of 14 prototype coolers were made for 8 different designs, including a design of the theoretical optimum. Liquid nitrogen is collected in the evaporator, and since the low pressure is 6 bar, the temperature should be 96 K. However, due to some thermal resistance in the thermocouple attached to the cold tip, a temperature of 105 K was achieved. A net cooling power of 5 mW was measured. In the paper, the design of the coolers will be discussed along with experimental results...|$|E
5000|$|The Alaska {{oil spill}} {{had a major}} impact on BP as it was a loss to its image as well as a {{financial}} loss. On March 15, the U.S. Transportation Department ordered BP to test its three <b>low-pressure</b> <b>lines</b> in Prudhoe Bay for corrosion using a smart pig. The western line had not been smart-pigged since 1998 and an eastern section of pipe had not been tested since 1992. [...] Instead, BP relied on imprecise spot checks of the line using methods such as ultrasound testing. On August 7, BP announced data from a smart pig run completed in late July revealed severe corrosion and 16 anomalies in 12 locations in an oil transit line on {{the eastern side of the}} oil field. They said that that information along with another small spill prompted them to shut down the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which would reduce Alaska North Slope oil production by an estimated 400,000 barrels per day. [...] Later BP decided not to shut the western side of the field, meaning Prudhoe Bay would still produce about 200,000 barrels a day, half its normal total. [...] Oil revenue accounts for 90% of Alaska's tax income.|$|R
40|$|The 328 uses a {{conventional}} expansion valve (non-accumulator) {{air conditioning system}} originally equipped with R- 12 (Freon) refrigerant. Circuit consists of: Compressor with magnetic clutch (discharge) line to condenser condenser line to filter-dryer filter-dryer with <b>low-pressure</b> switch <b>line</b> to expansion valve expansion valve evaporator core (with blower motor & ducting) return (suction) line to compressor [Electrical aspects of the system comprise: thermostat & blower motor switches, relays, & resistor, magnetic clutch engagement power lead, condenser cooling fan, and low-pressure compressor shut-off circuit] Compressor is located near firewall on top of passenger side of engine (York 206 for US version, Sankyo 507 for non-US), suction/discharge lines run along right sill, condenser & dryer are just ahead of right front wheel (visible opening hood), expansion valve is covered with gooey black insulation adjacent to brake master cylinder under fiberglass cowl cover, and evaporator core/blower is buried in underdash ducting.

50|$|Pressure {{flows from}} the {{hydraulic}} circuit to the suspension cylinders, pressurizing the bottom part of the spheres and suspension cylinders. Suspension works {{by means of a}} piston forcing LHM into the sphere, compacting the nitrogen in {{the upper part of the}} sphere; damping is provided by a two-way 'leaf valve' in the opening of the sphere. LHM has to squeeze back and forth through this valve which causes resistance and controls the suspension movements. It is the simplest damper and one of the most efficient. Ride height correction (self levelling) is achieved by height corrector valves connected to the anti-roll bar, front and rear. When the car is too low, the height corrector valve opens to allow more fluid into the suspension cylinder (e.g., the car is loaded). When the car is too high (e.g. after unloading) fluid is returned to the system reservoir via <b>low-pressure</b> return <b>lines.</b> Height correctors act with some delay in order not to correct regular suspension movements. The rear brakes are powered from the rear suspension circuit. Because the pressure there is proportional to the load, so is the braking power.|$|R
40|$|We present {{major element}} {{compositions}} of basalts and their differentiation products for some major tholeiitic series. The dry, <b>low-pressure</b> liquid <b>lines</b> of descent are shown to approach or intersect the experimentally-defined compositional space of silicate liquid immiscibility. Ferrobasalt-rhyolite unmixing along tholeiitic trends in both volcanic and plutonic environments {{is supported by}} worldwide occurrence of immiscible globules in the mesostasis of erupted basalts, unmixed melt inclusions in cumulus phases of major layered intrusions such as Skaergaard and Sept Iles, and oxide-rich ferrogabbros closely associated with plagiogranites in the lower oceanic crust. Liquid immiscibility is promoted by low-pressure, anhydrous fractional crystallization that drives the low Al 2 O 3, high FeO liquids into the two-liquid field. Kinetic controls can be important {{in the development of}} two-liquid separation. The undercooling that occurs at the slow cooling rates of plutonic environments promotes early development of liquid immiscibility at higher temperature. In contrast rapid cooling in erupted lavas leads to large undercoolings and liquid immiscibility develops at significantly lower temperatures. Unmixing leads {{to the development of a}} compositional gap characterized by the absence of intermediate compositions, a feature of many tholeiitic provinces. The compositions of experimental unmixed silica-rich melts coincide with those of natural rhyolites and plagiogranites with high FeOtot and low Al 2 O 3, suggesting the potential role of large-scale separation of immiscible Si-rich liquid in the petrogenesis of late-stage residual melts. No trace of the paired ferrobasaltic melt is found in volcanic environments because of its uneruptable characteristics. Instead, Fe-Ti±P-rich gabbros are the cumulate products of immiscible Fe-rich melts in plutonic settings. The immiscibility process may be difficult to identify because both melts crystallize the same phases with the same compositions. The two liquids might form incompletely segregated emulsions so that both liquids continue to exchange as they crystallize and remain in equilibrium. Even if segregated, both melts evolve on the binodal surface and exsolve continuously with decreasing temperature. The two liquids do not differentiate independently and keep crystallizing the same phases with differentiation. Further evolution by fractional crystallization potentially drives the bulk liquid out of the two-liquid field so that very late-stage liquids could evolve into the single melt phase stability field. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
