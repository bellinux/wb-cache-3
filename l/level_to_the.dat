5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one <b>level</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the probe}} {{absorption}} spectrum of a four-level atom in photonic crystals has been investigated. A model is used, which assumes the transitions from <b>the</b> two upper <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> one of <b>the</b> lower <b>levels</b> coupled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modes of the modied reservoir (photonic band gap) and transitions from <b>the</b> two upper <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other lower <b>level</b> coupled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> free vacuum modes. The eect of quantum interference in spontaneous emissions from <b>the</b> two upper <b>levels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>levels</b> on the absorption spectrum of an atom is investigated in detail. Most interestingly, it is {{shown that the}} atom becomes transparent to a probe laser eld coupled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> free space transition only in situations where complete quantum interference takes place in both the free space transitions and the modied reservoir transitions...|$|R

5|$|The River Parrett {{originates}} at Cheddington, Dorset, {{just over}} the border with Somerset. It enters Somerset at Haselbury Plucknett where it is joined by the Broad river. It passes {{to the east of}} South Petherton and flows north through Thorney Moor and Muchelney Level and it is then joined by the Isle and Yeo (Ivel) rivers. The Parrett flows through Langport and then through Middle Moor, Aller Moor to Burrowbridge where it is joined by the River Tone. It then passes through Earlake Moor, Hartlake Moor, Weston Level and South Moor. It continues north through Bridgwater, Horsey Level, past Pawlett Ham and Pawlett <b>Level</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coast near Burnham-on-Sea.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground <b>level</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.|$|E
5|$|On {{the western}} end of the chapel is the narthex, which has entrances on the north, west, and south walls. An {{additional}} door on the chapel's north side opens onto the Hibben Garden, named in recognition of John Grier Hibben's role in the chapel's construction and dedication. The garden of evergreens was designed by H. Russell Butler, Jr. On the chapel's south side are an additional door at ground <b>level</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and an exterior pulpit, designed after one at Magdalen College, Oxford, and named Bright Pulpit, in honor of John Bright. The chapel is connected on its eastern side to Dickinson Hall by the Rothschild arch, symbolizing a connection between religion and scholarship. Cram resigned as Princeton's supervising architect over the inclusion of the arch, which he disliked; nonetheless, he participated in the chapel's 1928 dedication ceremony. Nearby is the Mather Sundial, a replica of the Turnbull Sundial in the courtyard of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. A statue of a pelican, a religious symbol associated with Corpus Christi, sits atop the sundial, which was presented to Princeton in 1907 by William Mather, then the governor of Victoria University of Manchester.|$|E

Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon {{the request of the}} next-of-kin.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{estimated that}} oil would average $124 a barrel {{for the year}} {{but as a result}} of lower oil production, caused by maintenance of two of the three offshore oil rigs, the province would record a deficit of $258 million. Marshall stated that while he could have eliminated the deficit in one year through cuts, the government decided that they would run a deficit for two years before going back to surpluses. The government also announced that over the next 10 years they would embark on a “core mandate analysis” to restrain growth in program spending to the rate of inflation, and reduce Newfoundland and Labrador’s debt <b>level</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> all-province average. Just three months after the budget was delivered Dunderdale announced that the government would cut back on travel and leave some vacant positions unfilled due to a drop in oil prices. On the day of her news conference brent crude, a close reference point for oil produced offshore Newfoundland, stood at $103 a barrel, which was up from $90 the previous month. For every $1 drop in the price of oil below government estimates results in nearly $20 million less being funnelled into the provincial treasury, which meant the deficit for the year was expected to climb by several hundred million dollars. By the time Finance Minister Marshall released his mid-year economic update on December 13, 2012, it was estimated that the deficit would total $726 million for that fiscal year.|$|E

When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so {{in front of the other}} flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
