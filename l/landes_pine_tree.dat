30|$|Among the {{afforested}} lands, afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and deciduous afforestation {{gained more}} from the losses in other LCTs. However, there were instances where deciduous afforestation also lost to afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> (Table  4). While other LUTs were changing to afforestation (mixed forest), afforestation often lost to afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and deciduous tree afforestation. In Schlabendorf Nord, 23.81 ha and 15.69 ha of afforestation was replaced by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> in the first segment and second segments. In Schlabendorf Süd, however, replacement of afforestation by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> occurred {{in the first and}} last segments. In the first segment 97.05  ha of afforestation was replaced by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> (Figures 6 and 8) in the last segment the coverage was 49.68  ha (Table  4).|$|R

30|$|We {{formulate}} a four-dimensional mathematical model {{composed of the}} susceptible host <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> S_h at time t that {{are at risk of}} being infected by the nematode.

The common transmission of nematodes among <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and bark beetles occur during maturation feeding of infected vectors. The pine sawyers have pinewood nematode when it emerges from infected <b>pine</b> <b>trees.</b> However, the beetles may likewise get tainted directly through copulating.
