40|$|This paper {{presents}} two mobile {{location management}} algorithms for ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) networks {{based on the}} PNNI (private network-to-network interface) standard. The first solution is called the mobile PNNI scheme because it builds on the PNNI routing protocol. It uses limitedscope (characterized by a parameter S) reachability updates, forwarding pointers, and a route optimization procedure. The second solution is called the LR (<b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> scheme because it introduces <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (such as the cellular home and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers)</b> into the PNNI standards-based hierarchical networks. This scheme uses a hierarchical arrangement of <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> with the hierarchy limited to a certain level S. Analytical models are set up to compare the average move, search, and total costs per move of these two schemes for different values of the CMR (call-to-mobility ratio), and to provide guidelines for selecting parameters of the algorithms. Results show that at low CMR's (CMR ! 0. 025), the LR scheme performs better than the mobile PNNI scheme. We also observe that the two schemes show a contrasting behavior {{in terms of the}} value to be used for the parameter S to achieve the least average total cost. At low CMR's, the parameter S should be high for the mobile PNNI scheme, but low for the LR scheme, and vice versa for high CMR's. Index Terms [...] -Mobility management, PNNI, wireless ATM. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Location {{management}} {{is a key}} issue in personal communication service networks to guarantee the mobile terminals to continuously receive services when moving {{from one place to}} another. In this paper, we study two location management schemes, a dynamic movement-based scheme (DYNAMIC- 3 G) and a static scheme (STATIC- 3 G), for 3 G cellular networks where home <b>location</b> <b>registers,</b> gateway <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (GLRs), and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> form a three-level hierarchical mobility database structure. For both schemes, the cost functions are formulated analytically. We prove that there is an optimal movement threshold that minimizes the total cost function of DYNAMIC- 3 G and propose a binary search algorithm to find the optimal threshold. Furthermore, we present performance evaluation and comparison of the proposed schemes with the previous schemes in 2 G cellular networks where the GLR is not present. Our studies validate the optimality of the DYNAMIC- 3 G scheme and show that the proposed schemes outperform the previous schemes, especially when the remote-local-cost ratio is high. The comparison results between DYNAMIC- 3 G and STATIC- 3 G indicate that DYNAMIC- 3 G should be adopted when the mobility rate is low, and STATIC- 3 G should be adopted otherwise. Furthermore, DYNAMIC- 3 G tends to perform better than STATIC- 3 G when the paging cost is high or the number of cells in a location area is large.

40|$|Location {{management}} {{is a key}} issue in personal communication service (PCS) networks. Performance analysis plays important roles {{in the implementation of}} location management methods and system design in PCS networks. Existing PCS networks have the home <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (HLRs) and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs) architecture for location management. Some interesting dynamic location management methods are proposed to improve the system performance of PCS networks. However, the existing performance analysis of the dynamic location management methods are too simple and not available for PCS networks with real HLR/VLR architecture. One of the reasons is the complexity and difficulty of the problem. In this paper, we challenge the problem and successfully establish a new analytical model available for the analysis of the important dynamic movement-based location management method for PCS networks...|$|R

50|$|The {{key feature}} of a mobile phone {{is the ability}} to receive and make calls in any area where {{coverage}} is available. This is generally called roaming from a customer perspective, but also called visiting when describing the underlying technical process. Each geographic area has a database called the Visitor <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> (VLR), which contains details of all the mobiles currently in that area. Whenever a phone attaches, or visits, a new area, the Visitor <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> must contact the Home <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> to obtain the details for that phone. The current cellular location of the phone (i.e., which BTS it is at) is entered into the VLR record and will be used during a process called paging when the GSM network wishes to locate the mobile phone.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, {{the phone}} is free to roam {{anywhere}} in the operator's network or on the networks of roaming partners, including in other countries. So the first job of the Gateway MSC {{is to determine the}} current location of the mobile phone in order to connect the call.

40|$|Subscribers in {{the mobile}} {{communication}} network can move anywhere, {{and most of}} the entities in the network need to know the status of the subscribers. So it is necessary to exchange many messages between the entities in the network. A new method reducing the amount of message exchange is suggested in this paper, where the concept of active database is adopted. Reducing the message exchanges cuts cost of physical communication lines. 1 Introduction The main difference between a mobile communication network and a fixed network is the mobility of the subscribers. To setup a call, current state informations of a subscriber such as location, service and authentication are needed. Hence there should be a database for the subscribers in the mobile communication network. In the recommendations such as CCITT's [1] or GSM's [2], entities handling the subscriber database are called <b>location</b> <b>registers.</b> Two <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> are recommended, one is Home Location Register(HLR) and the other is Vis [...] ...|$|R

50|$|The Mobile Application Part (MAP) is an SS7 {{protocol}} {{that provides}} an application layer {{for the various}} nodes in GSM and UMTS mobile core networks and GPRS core networks {{to communicate with each}} other in order to provide services to users. The Mobile Application Part is the application-layer protocol used to access the Home <b>Location</b> <b>Register,</b> Visitor <b>Location</b> <b>Register,</b> Mobile Switching Center, Equipment Identity Register, Authentication Centre, Short message service center and Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).|$|E
5000|$|If {{the mobile}} phone is not {{currently}} {{associated with a}} Visited <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> (because the phone has been turned off) then the Home <b>Location</b> <b>Register</b> returns a number known as the Call Forward Not Reachable (CFNRc) number to the Gateway MSC, and the call is forwarded there. Many operators may set this value automatically to the phone's voice mail number, so that callers may leave a message. The mobile phone may sometimes override the default setting.|$|E
50|$|The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a {{customer}} is currently located. The visitor <b>location</b> <b>register</b> (VLR) {{associated with this}} MSC will have the subscriber's data in it.|$|E
40|$|GSM and IS- 41 are two {{mobility}} management standards {{widely used}} in second generation networks. These two standards lean on a centralized architecture made up of home <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (HLRs) and visitor <b>location</b> <b>registers</b> (VLRs). From these standards, the location update and search procedures always imply interrogation of the HLR, even if the two mobile terminals that want to communicate {{are in the same}} location area. Given the limited bandwidth of the radio operator channel and the new time sensitive applications of third-generation systems, such an approach of mobility management is not convenient for the next generation mobile networks. This paper proposes a method for reducing the processing load and the signalization traffic generated by update and search location procedures compared to IS- 41 standard. Taking into account the specific characteristics of the traffic in the mobile networks, it introduces a semi-dynamic approach based on a hybrid architecture using forwarding pointers without the load related to the dynamic models. Numerical results show that such a method significantly improves the efficiency of location procedures...|$|R

50|$|Outdated {{subscriber}} {{information is}} a concern if the UE does not re-enter the previous visiting network after {{an extended period of}} time.
