Carburization caused structural changes by reduction of MoO 3 and formation of minor amounts of surface carbon. The weak hydrogenation activity did not change significantly.

The mechanisms of deoxygenation and isomerization were discussed. The catalyst Ni-Mo-W (5 wt. %- 5 wt. %- 15 wt. %) /gamma-Al 2 O 3 -ZSM- 5 (85 wt. % 15 wt. %) was confirmed as the optimum one. Finally, the key reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, pressure, <b>liquid</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> and H- 2 /oil volume ratio were optimized. The hydrogenation reaction path of palm oil was also proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{production}} of pure hydrogen by steam methane reforming in a fluidized bed membrane reactor. Hydrogen is separated though palladium based dense membranes from the products of steam methane reforming reaction in a fluidized bed containing a catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) catalyst. First, a 2 weeks run test was performed assessing the reactor stability during the whole test and the membrane perm-selectivity (H 2 /other gases) remained 100 % even operating at elevated temperatures (903 K) and under bubbling fluidization regime. As the reactor demonstrated to be reliable and the membrane stable for a long period, a parametric study {{has been carried out}} highlighting the reactor performances in terms of methane conversion and hydrogen permeation. Moreover, the deviation from ideal reactor operation is outlined by studying the approach to equilibrium conversion and its connections with operating conditions. The operating conditions tested varied in the 773 – 903 K temperature range and 2. 0 – 5. 3 bar reacting pressure. The effect of weight <b>hourly</b> <b>space</b> <b>velocity,</b> steam to carbon ratio and dilution of the reacting mixture with an inert gas on the reactor performance were also investigated. Experimental results show that higher temperatures and pressures have positive effect both on approach to equilibrium conversion and on hydrogen yield, while opposite effects arise from increasing steam to carbon ratio and weight <b>hourly</b> <b>space</b> <b>velocity...</b>|$|R
30|$|For {{carrying}} out TPSR experiment, 50  mg of catalyst was {{loaded into the}} U-tube quartz reactor and was dried at 300  °C in flowing He. After treatment with He, it was cooled to room temperature (ca. 25  °C) and the reactant gases were allowed to flow over the catalysts. The temperature was then programmed to rise from 25 to 900  °C with the ramp rate of 5  °C/min and the gas <b>hourly</b> <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> (GHSV) was maintained at 48, 000  mL g cat − 1  h− 1. The MS signal for the products from the reactor was recorded.|$|R
30|$|Synthesis {{of higher}} {{alcohols}} {{was carried out}} after the reduction and sulfidation of catalysts in a fixed bed reactor at 320 °C, 70 bars, gas <b>hourly</b> <b>space</b> <b>velocity</b> of 3.6 nLit/g cat./h, and H 2 /CO = 2. The liquid products were collected at 0 °C, and the exit gas was analyzed to measure the CO conversion. The analysis of liquid products indicates that methanol and ethanol are the major products with small amounts of propanol, butanol, and other higher alcohols. The analysis of exit gas indicates that methane is the major component apart from CO, H 2, and CO 2.|$|R
