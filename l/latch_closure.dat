40|$|Safe reentry of {{the shuttle}} orbiter {{requires}} that the payload bay doors be closed and securely latched. Since a malfunction in the door drive or bulkhead latch systems could make safe reentry impossible, the requirement to provide tools to manually close and secure the doors was implemented. The tools would disconnect a disabled door or <b>latch</b> <b>closure</b> system and close and secure the doors if the normal system failed. The tools required to perform these tasks have evolved into a set that consists of a tubing cutter, a winch, a latching tool, and a bolt extractor. The design, fabrication, and performance tests of each tool are described...|$|E
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of an OMV docking mechanism, {{based on an}} adaptation of the Shuttle Flight Support System Pallet Berthing Mechanism was completed. The mechanism uses automatically actuated motorized latches to engage towel bars on the target satellite. LED sensors establish the towel bar position within the capture envelope and the latch capture commands are issued. Then, locking pawls engage the bar, locking and pre-loading the mechanism. Two series of tests were conducted to test nominal and failure mode captures and to evaluate design parameters such as LED sensor locations, automatic closure algorithms, <b>latch</b> <b>closure</b> velocity, position/velocity entry envelopes, and closure method. The first test series involved single latch testing on the Flat Floor Facility, the 6 DOF Facility, and an analytic simulation model. The intent was to compare results in order to validate the various facilities. Reasonably good agreement was achieved. The second test series repeated the single latch testing on the refurbished 6 DOF Facility to validate the facility modifications. The individual latches were tested under free-drift conditions for functionality and performance. Next, the three-latch configuration underwent parametric testing. Test results validated the improved fidelity of the 6 DOF Facility and verified successful docking at the required entry velocity. The tests determined the 'best' design parameter definitions {{and concluded that the}} locking pawls should not lock until all three latches completely close...|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is a {{ubiquitous}} {{hormone that}} regulates plant growth, development {{and responses to}} environmental stresses. Its action is mediated by the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of START proteins, but it remains unclear how these receptors bind ABA and, in turn, how hormone binding leads to inhibition of the downstream type 2 C protein phosphatase (PP 2 C) effectors. Here we report crystal structures of apo and ABA-bound receptors {{as well as a}} ternary PYL 2 -ABA-PP 2 C complex. The apo receptors contain an open ligand-binding pocket flanked by a gate that closes in response to ABA by way of conformational changes in two highly conserved ?-loops that serve as a gate and <b>latch.</b> Moreover, ABA-induced <b>closure</b> of the gate creates a surface that enables the receptor to dock into and competitively inhibit the PP 2 C active site. A conserved tryptophan in the PP 2 C inserts directly between the gate and latch, which functions to further lock the receptor in a closed conformation. Together, our results identify a conserved gate-latch-lock mechanism underlying ABA signalling. Â© 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved...|$|R
