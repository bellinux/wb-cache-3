Other N-terminal residues {{can also be}} cleaved, however. LAPs have been found across superkingdoms. Identified LAPs include human LAP, bovine lens LAP, porcine LAP, Escherichia coli (E. coli) LAP (also known as PepA or XerB), and the solanaceous-specific acidic LAP (LAP-A) in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).|$|E
40|$|Summary: A {{continuous}} {{procedure for}} {{the determination of}} leucine aminopeptidase is described. L-leucinamide is used äs Substrate and the liberated ammonia is determined with the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. The enzyme is Mn 2 +-activated and 30 / MnCl 2 is necessary for an optimal activity measurement. Influence of buffer type, buffer concentration and pH are reported together with the apparent Km values of leucine aminopeptidase for L-leucinamide and of glutamate dehydrogenase for 2 -oxoglutarate. Amastatin, a potent inhibitor, iiihibits the reaction of leucine aminopeptidase completely, whereas it has no inhibitory effect on the reaction with glutamate dehydrogenase. The normal reference interval for leucine aminopeptidase is 12 — 65 U/l at 37 °C. The properties of the enzyme are discussed.

40|$|The {{digestive}} ferments of the hepatopancreas and intestine mucosa of {{the silver}} carp - tripsine, chimotripsine, collagenase, <b>leucinaminopeptidase,</b> amylase have been obtained. For the first time, its physico-chemical properites have been studied, namely the molecular mass, the number of isoforms and osopoint, optimum of the pH stability and activity, the interaction with the inhibitors. It has been shown, that {{by the number of}} the properties the digestive ferments of the stomach free fish {{of the silver}} carp are essentially differed from the corresponding ferments of the higher vertebrates and fishes, having the stomach. A significant guantity of the ferments isoforms with the predominance of the anione ones, the acid-instability, the high molar activity are characteristic for the endopeptidases. The intestine mucosa synthesizes the proper intestine, the more highmolecular tripsine and chimotripsine as compared with the pancreatic ferments. The peculiarities of the proteinases have been directed to the compensation of the absent pepsine digestion.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{rotavirus}} and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, administered in different sequences, on alkaline and acid phosphatase, <b>leucinaminopeptidase,</b> P-galactosidase, and succinicdehydrogenase of the intestinal mucosa of cesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived calves was investigated. Decrease in enzyme activity was most prominent in dual infections; it also occurred {{in parts of}} the small intestine in monoinfected animals. Increases in enzyme activity involved totally either one or all tissue compartments (crypt, basal villus area, villus tips). Increased activity was present in enteric mucosae that were either not affected or were only slightly affected by rotavirus or enterotoxigenic E. coli. We interpret the increase in enzyme activity as an adaptation of the enteric mucosa to maintain the absorptive function. An altered absorptive capacity of the enteric mucosa {{is one of the most}} important functional derangements leading to diarrhea. This can be studied in vivo by using tracer substances like D- x y l o ~ e ~ ~ or cellobiose mannit 01. ~ ~ In vitro, however, a large number of dif-ferent enzymes can be studied b i ~ c h e m i c a l l y ~, ~ J ~, ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ or his to~hemical ly. ~~,~ ~ Decreases in mucosal enzym...|$|E
40|$|Langerhans {{cells are}} {{considered}} {{to play an important}} role in the initiation of the immune response. This study was performed in order to analyze the kinetics of the Langerhans cell population under different experimental conditions. Using tritiated thymidine, the number of labeled Langerhans cells (demonstrated by the <b>Leucinaminopeptidase</b> reaction), and of labeled basal keratinocytes was investigated by autoradiography in guinea pig skin in vivo, before and 2, 5 and 8 days after stripping and before and 2, 5 and 8 days after initiation of repeated topical exposures to a 0. 25 % solution of dinitrochioro-benzene (DNCB). In addition the total number of Langerhans cells per mm 2 was determined before and after DNCB treatment of epidermal guinea pig sheet preparations using the ATPase reaction. A total of more than 100. 000 cells was evaluated. The proliferative activity of Langerhans cells as well as of basal keratinocytes was stimulated significantly (by statistical analysis), both by stripping and by application of DNCB. After stripping, however, the increase of the Langerhans cell turnover was found to be secondary to the turnover of basal keratinocytes, whereas after DNCB application the increase in the proliferative activity of Langerhans cells appeared as the primary event in epidermal cellular kinetics...|$|E
