5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
25|$|Hypertensive {{heart disease}} {{is the result of}} {{structural}} and functional adaptations leading to <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> diastolic dysfunction, CHF, abnormalities of blood flow due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and microvascular disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. Individuals with <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> are at increased risk for, stroke, CHF, and sudden death. Aggressive control of hypertension can regress or reverse <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

Results: During the study in group (7959 observations with the terminal outcomes) 597 cases of the <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> myocardial <b>hypertrophy</b> were found and statistically analyzed.

25|$|Abnormalities of diastolic function, {{ranging from}} {{asymptomatic}} heart disease to overt heart failure, {{are common in}} hypertensive patients.

25|$|In general, a {{non-invasive}} transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) {{is performed}} in newly diagnosed AF, {{as well as}} if there is a major change in the patient's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify valvular heart disease (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke), left and right atrial size (which indicates likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure (pulmonary hypertension), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> and pericardial disease.|$|E
25|$|Recent studies {{claim that}} obesity {{is a risk}} factor for {{hypertension}} because of activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in adipose tissue, and also linked renin-angiotensin system with insulin resistance, and claims that anyone can cause the other. Local production of angiotensin II in various tissues, including the blood vessels, heart, adrenals, and brain, is controlled by ACE and other enzymes, including the serine protease chymase. The activity of local renin–angiotensin systems and alternative pathways of angiotensin II formation may make an important contribution to remodeling of resistance vessels and the development of target organ damage (i.e. <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, stroke, end-stage kidney disease, myocardial infarction, and arterial aneurysm) in hypertensive persons.|$|E
25|$|In animal {{models of}} cardiac disease, {{functions}} of beta-catenin have been unveiled. In a guinea pig model of aortic stenosis and <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> beta-catenin {{was shown to}} change subcellular localization from intercalated discs to the cytosol, despite {{no change in the}} overall cellular abundance of beta-catenin. vinculin showed a similar profile of change. N-cadherin showed no change, and there was no compensatory upregulation of plakoglobin at intercalated discs in the absence of beta-catenin. In a hamster model of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, cell-cell adhesions were irregular and disorganized, and expression levels of adherens junction/intercalated disc and nuclear pools of beta-catenin were decreased. These data suggest that a loss of beta-catenin {{may play a role in}} the diseased intercalated discs that have been associated with cardiac muscle hypertrophy and heart failure. In a rat model of myocardial infarction, adenoviral gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable, constitutively-active beta-catenin decreased MI size, activated the cell cycle, and reduced the amount of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac myofibroblasts. This finding was coordinate with enhanced expression of pro-survival proteins, survivin and Bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor while promoting the differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings suggest that beta-catenin can promote the regeneration and healing process following myocardial infarction. In a spontaneously-hypertensive heart failure rat model, investigators detected a shuttling of beta-catenin from the intercalated disc/sarcolemma to the nucleus, evidenced by a reduction of beta-catenin expression in the membrane protein fraction and an increase in the nuclear fraction. Additionally, they found a weakening in the association between glycogen synthase kinase-3β and beta-catenin, which may indicate altered protein stability. Overall, results suggest that an enhanced nuclear localization of beta-catenin may be important in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.|$|E

40|$|The hydroxypyridinium (HP) {{crosslink}} is {{the predominant}} non-reducible collagen crosslink in heart. HP concentration in left ventricle (LV) increases progressively throughout life, and this increase {{is thought to}} reflect the slower turnover of collagenous proteins seen with aging, allowing mature extracellular matrix (ECM) collagen to crosslink more heavily. There are also species differences {{with higher levels of}} crosslinking found in the hearts of larger mammals including humans, compared to smaller mammals such as the rat. Marked deviations from normal in the concentration of this crosslink are implicated in a variety of <b>left</b> <b>ventricular</b> <b>hypertrophies</b> and altered <b>ventricular</b> function. Interestingly these deviations may be bi-directional in nature, ranging from an apparent lack of the crosslink in a mouse cardiomyopathy model, to a doubling in HP concentration in viable myocardium post-infarction. This review outlines the major pathway involved in the formation of myocardial collagen crosslinks. Possible mechanisms by which rate of crosslink formation and deposition are regulated will be discussed, and functional implications of altered crosslinking patterns addressed.
