25|$|As news {{announcements}} {{spread and}} suspects were searched in surrounding counties, the fear crossed over {{to many other}} cities, including Hope, Lufkin and Magnolia, even going as far as Oklahoma City. Residents in other cities were also stocking up on guns and even axes. Every three weeks {{when there were no}} murders, the town's fear began to drop <b>little</b> <b>by</b> <b>little.</b> The hysteria lasted throughout the summer and eventually faded three months later. The Texas Rangers quietly left Texarkana <b>little</b> <b>by</b> <b>little</b> through October. This was not announced to keep the Phantom from attempting another attack.|$|E

25|$|<b>Little</b> <b>by</b> <b>little</b> as {{they were}} handed down, the strips of land {{became more and more}} narrow.

25|$|About 1715, a lodge {{similar to}} Haddington {{was founded in}} Dunfermline, {{supported}} by {{two members of the}} local aristocracy, the Earl of Moray and the Marquess of Tweeddale.

25|$|Despite {{the initial}} assault, the Ottoman {{defenders}} {{continued to hold}} very strong defensive positions, with each redoubt ideally placed to provide supporting fire for others. In most places the dismounted attackers were badly exposed to this fire. A constant stream of fire was maintained on the Ottoman parapets to suppress the defenders and prevent them from taking aim while the attack continued. <b>Little</b> <b>by</b> <b>little</b> the cordon drew tighter under intense fire over the bare, gently-sloping grasslands.

25|$|<b>Little</b> <b>by</b> <b>little,</b> a {{cycle of}} general {{instability}} sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent, that {{in the wake of}} the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas supported by most of the military, successfully led the October 1930's Coup. Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed the Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with their own supporters.|$|E

25|$|While the zarzuela {{tradition}} {{flourished in}} Madrid and other Spanish cities, Catalonia developed its own zarzuela, with librettos in Catalan. The atmosphere, the plots, {{and the music}} were {{quite different from the}} model that triumphed in Madrid; the Catalan zarzuela was looking to attract a different public, the bourgeois classes. Catalan zarzuela was turned <b>little</b> <b>by</b> <b>little</b> into what is called, in Catalan, teatre líric català ("Catalan lyric theater"), with a personality of its own, and with modernista lyricists and composers such as Enric Granados or Enric Morera.|$|E
