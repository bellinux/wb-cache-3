50|$|Manual {{hand held}} devices {{look up the}} plate that the user {{manually}} enters. This method is prone to human error for data entry and has no photographic evidence to save (without separately taking a photo). Hand held ALPR comes in two flavors: ones that take single shot pictures to run ALPR against, and ones that run the camera in video mode performing ALPR on the stream of images. The single shot method takes longer but the full resolution of the camera is at its disposal. The <b>live</b> <b>video</b> <b>mode</b> {{is limited to the}} resolution of the video stream but has the advantage of running multiple images from subtly different angles. To date there has been no study as to which method results in the best ALPR read on a handheld device but arguments could be made for and against both.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low-cost frame grabber, which was specifically designed {{as part of}} a real-time motion detection system for high-resolution images. The frame grabber is FPGA-based to minimise size of the PCB and improve reliability of the system. It also acts as a backend add-on card for an IBM-PC compatible. The experimental tests carried out on different machines show that the board implemented meets all specifications required by the system, and performs well. The captured frames are clear, well contrasted and jitter-free in both <b>live</b> and still <b>video</b> <b>modes</b> and their quality is comparable to that available from equivalent commercial systems...|$|R

50|$|<b>Video</b> <b>mode</b> is the {{standard}} DVD <b>video</b> <b>mode</b> format used by DVD movies. Because the DVD Video format was invented before DVDs were recordable it doesn't allow editing of the disc, doesn't support defect management and is therefore not as robust. Space from deleted titles may not be fully reclaimed until the disc is completely erased. It is compatible with most DVD players. It is used on DVD-RW and DVD-R discs, but has never used for DVD-RAM. Most (but not all) recorders that use DVD-RW will offer the choice of VR <b>mode</b> or <b>Video</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} reported here was to establish whether self-recognition in <b>live</b> <b>video</b> can be facilitated when <b>live</b> <b>video</b> training is provided to children aged 2 - 2. 5 years. While the majority of children failed the test of live self-recognition prior to video training, more than half exhibited <b>live</b> self-recognition post <b>video</b> training. Children who failed the <b>live</b> <b>video</b> self-recognition tasks passed the test of mirror self-recognition. The findings are discussed in light of a video deficit and the potential role of pre-test training in facilitating self-recognition in <b>live</b> <b>video</b> by young children. <br /...|$|R
