500|$|With Brosnan, the Bond writers {{knew that}} because of the changes in public attitudes, he could not be as overtly sexual and {{dominant}} over women as Connery's Bond, and was denounced by M in Goldeneye to be a [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur, a relic of the Cold War". Brosnan was seen by many as the quintessential James Bond in appearance and manner; displaying an air of coolness, elegance and a grace which made him believable as an international playboy, if not purely as an assassin. John G. Stackhouse for instance argues that it is preposterous that any man as strikingly handsome as Brosnan and Connery could be a secret agent, saying, [...] "When Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan enters a room, everyone notices. Thus it is ridiculous to suppose that James Bond, looking <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>could</b> be a secret agent for longer than about two seconds".|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{revealed}} which characters {{will appear}} on the opposing factions. They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. As you can imagine, something <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, you can also lose -- or you can just lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E

[...] At the time of the shooting, Ruby said he was taking phenmetrazine, a central nervous system stimulant. Two months after Oswald's death, Ruby broke into tears at his bond hearing, as he talked to reporters regarding the assassination of President Kennedy. His voice breaking, Ruby said that he could not understand [...] "how a great man <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be lost." [...] According to an unnamed Associated Press source, Ruby made a final statement from his hospital bed on December 19, 1966 that he alone had been responsible for the murder of Lee Harvey Oswald. [...] "There is nothing to hide… There was no one else," [...] Ruby said.|$|E

2500|$|Lenihan was hospitalised on 16 December 2009, {{complaining}} of insomnia {{and a possible}} hernia. Surgery, described as [...] "a minor procedure that was brought forward", was performed. Leader of the Opposition Enda Kenny wished him well in a speech. On 26 December 2009, TV3 reported that Lenihan {{had been diagnosed with}} pancreatic cancer. The Sunday Times then reported that [...] "a number of authoritative sources" [...] had said the claim was true. Public service broadcaster RTÉ stated that Lenihan had contracted what it described as [...] "a serious condition". The Government Press Secretary stated that the health of a politician is a private affair. The [...] "unwarranted intrusion" [...] by TV3 was met with disapproval– even by opposition politicians; Labour Party deputy leader and Finance Spokesperson Joan Burton offered her condolences: [...] "It's certainly not a departure in the media that I would welcome. I'm really shocked that a story <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be broadcast at Christmas". However the journalist in question who made the disclosure, Ursula Halligan, received support for report from many publications and journalists including the political bi-weekly Village magazine, Ger Colleran, editor of the Irish Daily Star, the Irish Times and the Phoenix magazine, who stated that [...] "If a report of the finance minister facing a serious illness while simultaneously grappling with the biggest financial crisis {{in the history of the}} state is not in the public interest, then nothing is".|$|E
