40|$|<b>Low</b> {{volatility}} <b>effect</b> or <b>low</b> volatility anomaly {{has been}} well documented in recent empirical studies. Stocks with recent high volatility have shown low future average returns across the world. These findings were not only economically but also statistically meaningful. This paper tries to find more insight on the <b>low</b> volatility <b>effect</b> focusing on the relationship between <b>low</b> volatility <b>effect</b> and volatility level of equity market. Major findings in this paper are as follows: <b>Low</b> volatility <b>effect</b> exists in the Korean stock market. However, <b>low</b> volatility <b>effect</b> is not significant when volatility level of the stock market is low. The <b>low</b> volatility <b>effect</b> exists only in period of above average market volatility and disappears in times of below average market volatility which implies "No <b>low</b> volatility <b>effect</b> in <b>low</b> volatility market". In regression analysis, we construct zero-cost portfolio which takes long position in the lowest volatility portfolio and short position in the highest volatility portfolio. Volatility level of stock market has a positive relationship with returns from zero-cost portfolio and explains abnormal returns uncaptured by 3 factor model.

Although they found that the corrective response eliminated the <b>low</b> prevalence <b>effect,</b> this result has not been replicated by other researchers (Peltier & Becker, 2016; Van Wert, Horowitz, & Wolfe, 2009) and one of the original researchers later published a paper that reported the <b>low</b> prevalence <b>effect</b> (Mitroff & Biggs, 2014).

50|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{alkalinity}} generation in the ocean. Perhaps the most well known is {{the dissolution of}} CaCO3 (calcium carbonate, which is a component of coral reefs) to form Ca2+ and CO32− (carbonate). The carbonate ion {{has the potential to}} absorb two hydrogen ions. Therefore, it causes a net increase in ocean alkalinity. Calcium carbonate dissolution is an indirect result of ocean pH lowering. It can cause great damage to coral reef ecosystems, but has a relatively <b>low</b> <b>effect</b> on the total alkalinity (AT) in the ocean. Lowering of pH due to absorption of CO2 actually raises the alkalinity by causing dissolution of carbonates.|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{best known}} {{proposed}} mechanisms for <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect</b> are fines migration, pH increase, double layer expansion and multicomponent ionic exchange (MIE). Even though many mechanisms have been proposed, {{none of them}} have been accepted as the main mechanism behind the <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect.</b> The complex oil/brine/rock interactions are still being debated in the literature. The type of clays present in the sandstone and polar components in the crude oil, are important factors for observing <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect.</b> The temperature and the amount of divalent cations in the formation water, especially Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, are also important factors for observing <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect.</b> It is assumed that the <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect</b> is a result of altering the wettability of the rock to a more water-wet condition. The rock becomes more water-wet when organic material is desorbed from the clay surface. Low initial pH is important in order for adsorption of polar components to the permanent negatively charged clay surface to occur. Desorption of Ca 2 + ions from the clay surface and desorption of organic material from the clay surface will occur as a result of acid/base reactions. This will promote a pH increase. In this work the potential of <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect</b> after flooding with seawater and diluted seawater in a Yme core has been evaluated. The oil recovery by formation water was about 65 % of the original oil in place (OOIP). No additional oil recovery was observed after flooding with sea water and 50 times diluted sea water. High temperature and a large concentration of Ca 2 + in the initial formation water, may be the main reasons for why no <b>low</b> salinity <b>effect</b> was observed...|$|R

50|$|In {{this old}} practice, the {{production}} of gas has a positive effect in oil recovery by increasing the differential pressure driving the oil movement. Anaerobically produced methane from oil degradation have a <b>low</b> <b>effect</b> on MEOR due to its high solubility at high pressures. Carbon dioxide {{is also a good}} MEOR agent. The miscible CO2 is condensed into the liquid phase when light hydrocarbons are vaporised into the gas phase. Immiscible CO2 helps to saturate oil, resulting in swelling and reduction of viscosity of the liquid phase and consequently improving mobilization by extra driving pressure. Concomitantly, other gases and solvents may dissolve carbonate rock, leading to an increase in rock permeability and porosity.|$|E
50|$|A stand density {{management}} diagram is {{a simple}} biological model relating forest yield to forest density at any stage of a particular forest stand's development. Stand density management diagrams are used in forest management and designed to use a current stand's density to project its future yield. One major reason for the effectiveness of density management diagrams is the relatively <b>low</b> <b>effect</b> of site variance on the diagram’s shape. Density management diagrams have transformed ideas long held in traditional stocking diagrams. In 1967, Samuel F. Gingrich published his idea of comparing basal area per acre, trees per acre, and quadratic mean diameter in one graph. He called this the stocking diagram. These same principles are {{used to make the}} stand density management diagram work. Basal area and density are plotted against one another and quadratic mean diameter lines are plotted through the plot.|$|E
50|$|Neurogenomic {{disorders}} {{manifest themselves}} as neurological disorders with a complex genetic architecture and a non-Mendelian-like pattern of inheritance. Some {{examples of these}} disorders include Bipolar disorder and Schizophrenia. Several genes {{may be involved in}} the manifestation of the disorder, and mutations in such disorders are generally rare and de novo. Hence it becomes extremely unlikely to observe the same (potentially causative) variant in two unrelated individuals affected with the same neurogenomic disorder. Ongoing research has implicated several de novo exonic variations and structural variations in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), for example. The allelic spectrum of the rare and common variants in neurogenomic disorders therefore necessitates a need for large cohort studies in order to effectively exclude <b>low</b> <b>effect</b> variants and identify the overarching pathways frequently mutated in the different disorders, rather than specific genes and specific high penetrance mutations.|$|E

The ERED database is specific to sediment toxicity {{and the effects of}} contaminates in dredged materials on fresh water organisms. It is intended to be used to evaluate the potential for contaminate concentrations of dredged sediment to have unacceptable adverse effects on aquatic organisms. Although the ERED database was designed as a tool for the Army Corps of Engineers to manage adverse effects of dredging it is widely applicable to sediment toxicity studies and management.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, {{a review}} of the NAAQOs {{suggested}} that many air pollutants had no effect thresholds (e.g. tropospheric ozone or very <b>low</b> <b>effect</b> thresholds). As such, scientifically defensible effect levels could not be identified. In 2000, the revised NAAQOs framework specifies a Reference Level, above which there are demonstrated effects on human health and/or the environment, and an Air Quality Objective (AQO), which is meant to be protective for the general public and environment and which also considers aspects of technical feasibility. This approach is different from how the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are set in the US, where cost is explicitly not considered in the proposal to strengthen the air quality standards to protect human health and the environment. In addition, the US NAAQS are periodically reviewed, frequently strengthened, commonly enforced and allow serious legal penalties if the standards are not met. In contrast, the Canadian NAAQOs are infrequently reviewed, rarely strengthened, not enforced, and the only penalty for not meeting the Canadian NAAQOs is shame.|$|E

The site needed to be cleaned up prior to being used for subsequent experiments. The 84,000-square foot (7,800 m2) area was covered with 6 inches of gravel in 1954, but grass, sagebrush, and other plants reseeded the area since then. The BORAX-I burial ground is located about 2730 feet m northwest of the Experimental Breeder Reactor-1, a publicly accessible national monument. Since 1987, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified the burial ground as Superfund site Operable Unit 6-01, one of two such sites (along with SL-1) at the Idaho National Laboratory. In 1995, the EPA ordered the primary remedy of the burial ground should be: [...] "Containment by capping with an engineered barrier constructed primarily of native materials."

50|$|Water is an {{essential}} part to the ecosystem of forests including the plants and animal species survival, stream, rivers and lakes habitats and also human activities. The act of deforestation can affect the quality of water, quantity of water as well as the aquatic ecosystems located in the forests. When deforestation takes place by the forest sector, the water quality can be affected by sedimentation, pollution and changes in water levels. When roads are put in to cross streams and rivers, 94% of the roads crossings have low to moderate potential to deliver sediment to a stream, When the deforestation takes place near a stream, riparian techniques are used to conserve the tree density around the stream to protect and provide many benefits to the water quality, quantity and stability of the aquatic ecosystem. With 87% of the riparian area within the deforested area being in properly functioning conditions, the forest sector has high conservation efforts to protect the water within forest. The passage of fish species to upstream and downstream habitats can be {{an essential}} part of survival and can be affected by deforestation practices, especially the building of roads by forest sector. With only 42% of the road stream crossings having a <b>low</b> <b>effect</b> on the passage of fish species, the remainder of crossings have a high to moderate risk of limiting fish passage.
