50|$|It has {{not always}} been {{possible}} to replicate these findings in crustaceans. In one study, three decapod crustacean species, <b>Louisiana</b> red swamp <b>crayfish,</b> white shrimp and grass shrimp, were tested for nociceptive behaviour by applying sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, or benzocaine to the antennae. This caused no change in behaviour in these three species compared to controls. Animals did not groom the treated antenna, and {{there was no difference in}} movement of treated individuals and controls. Extracellular recordings of antennal nerves in the <b>Louisiana</b> red swamp <b>crayfish</b> revealed continual spontaneous activity, but no neurons that were reliably excited by the application of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The authors concluded there was no behavioural or physiological evidence that the antennae contained specialized nociceptors that responded to pH. It could be argued that differences in the findings between studies may be due to responses to extreme pH being inconsistently evoked across species.|$|R

The shift from clean to turbid phase, due to grazing by crayfish on submerged vegetation, caused a gradual decrease in eco-exergy, reflecting an increase in entropy, related to breakdown of ecosystem internal equilibria.

50|$|In the United States, {{crayfish}} {{are often}} referred to as crawfish or crawdads. As of 2005, Louisiana supplied 95% of the crayfish harvested in the United States.

In 2007, the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>crayfish</b> harvest was about 54,800 tons, almost all of it from aquaculture. About 70%-80% of crayfish produced in Louisiana are Procambarus clarkii (red swamp crawfish), with the remaining 20%-30% being Procambarus zonangulus (white river crawfish). Despite the large-scale production in Louisiana, most frozen crayfish available in supermarkets in other states are Chinese imports.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{the cape}} clawless otter is not under severe {{pressure}} and its conservation status is Red List Category Near Threatened as assessed in 2014 by the IUCN.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) {{has been}} linked to global declines and extinctions of amphibians, {{making it one of the}} most devastating wildlife pathogens known. Understanding the factors that affect disease dynamics in this system is critical for mitigating infection and protecting threatened species. Crayfish are hosts of this pathogen and can transmit Bd to amphibians. Because they co-occur with susceptible amphibian communities, crayfish may be important alternative hosts for Bd. Understanding the prevalence and seasonal dynamics of crayfish infections is of agricultural and ecological interest in areas where crayfish are farmed and traded for human consumption. We conducted a survey of Bd in farmed and natural crayfish (Procambarus spp.) populations in Louisiana, USA. We found that Bd prevalence and infection intensity was low in both farmed and native populations and that prevalence varied seasonally in wild <b>Louisiana</b> <b>crayfish.</b> This seasonal pattern mirrors that seen in local amphibians.

40|$|Full text of {{this item}} is not {{currently}} {{available on the}} LRA. The final published version is available at [URL] present ecological and hydrological state of Lake Naivasha, a tropical freshwater Ramsar site, is reviewed from existing research. The ecology of the lake was formerly regulated by ecohydrological control exerted on the inflowing hydrochemistry by the continuous fringing papyrus, with a full swamp on the inflow rivers' delta. The ecology of the lake since that time has been severely disrupted by alien (or exotic) species invasions, particularly the <b>Louisiana</b> <b>crayfish</b> Procambarus clarkii. Lake-wide papyrus degradation has also been occurring since about 1980, following a lake level decline of up to 3 m through agri-industrial abstraction. The river Malewa, which previously ran through a swamp, now runs directly into the lake, bringing high silt and nutrient loads in wet seasons, making the lake eutrophic. It is suggested that sustainable management of the lake should focus upon three ecohydrological objectives - control of abstractions to achieve hydrological balance, physical restoration of the former North Swamp and the control of illegal fishing. The latter would enable the commercial fishery returns to maximum sustainable yield so that large M. salmoides (large mouthed bass) individuals once again impose a ‘top-down’ control upon P. clarkii, and the crayfish itself be commercially exploited...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Louisiana</b> red swamp <b>crayfish</b> Procambarus clarkii {{is highly}} invasive. It is now common in Europe {{where it is}} causing {{problems}} to native wildlife and structural damage to habitats. Procambarus clarkii was first recorded in Britain in 1991 and is currently found in the Hampstead Heath ponds and Regents Canal in London, {{as well as a}} small lake 15 km outside of Greater London. This paper considers how conditions in Britain affect the life cycle, breeding habits and potential range expansion of P. clarkii. Results of trapping surveys are presented in an effort to map the current distribution of P. clarkii and predict which areas it could colonise in the future. The ecological impact of potential colonisation is discussed by considering the impact P. clarkii has in mainland Europe. It is concluded that P. clarkii is likely to spread from Regents Canal into the nearby Brent, Crane, Colne, Lee and Thames catchments within 50 years. This time would be reduced significantly if further deliberate or accidental introductions by humans occur since this is deemed a far greater risk than natural expansion. P. clarkii is expected to {{have a negative impact on}} aquatic ecosystems in Britain and therefore tighter enforcement is needed to slow the spread of this species...|$|R
40|$|Introductions of {{non-native}} crayfish {{around the}} world are increasingly tied to the distribution, sale, and eventual release of pet crayfish. As part of risk assessment for the introduction of non-native crayfish in North America, I monitored the sale of crayfish on an auction website that specializes in aquatic pets and aquarium supplies for a year. Three species accounted for the majority of sales: the parthenogenetic crayfish, Marmorkrebs (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis), the Cajun dwarf crayfish (Cambarellus shufeldtii), and the orange morph of the endangered Mexican dwarf crayfish (Cambarellus patzcuarensis). Almost half of individual crayfish sold (48. 5 %) were Marmorkrebs, which is {{more than twice as many}} as C. shufeldtii, the second most commonly sold species. The <b>Louisiana</b> red swamp <b>crayfish</b> (Procambarus clarkii) was often offered for auction, but was bought much less often than the other three species. About 11 % of P. clarkii auctions were successful, while more than 45 % of auctions were successful for the other three. Four Cherax species were the only crayfish sold online whose native range was outside North America. Neither Marmorkrebs nor the orange morph of C. patzcuarensis can be collected regularly from natural habitats in North America, suggesting that most crayfish sold online in North America are obtained from existing stocks in the pet trade, rather than being collected from natural habitats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>Louisiana</b> red swamp <b>crayfish,</b> Procambarus clarkii, {{which was}} {{introduced}} into east Africa in the 1950 s or 1960 s, has since widely dispersed. Previous work by our group {{has shown that}} P. clarkii can reduce populations of the molluscan intermediate hosts of human schistosomes through predatory and competitive interac-tions. Here, we investigate whether crayfish can reduce populations of Bulinus africanus and consequently, Schisto-soma haematobium prevalence in school children. Children from 6 primary schools in the Machakos and Kitui Districts of Kenya were selected for study. Schools were divided into 3 experimental-control pairs. At experimental schools, crayfish were introduced into nearby aquatic habitats harboring Bulinus africanus snails and serving as S. haematobium transmission sites. Snail habitats near control schools did not receive crayfish. Six months after crayfish introduction, all infected children were treated with praziquantel. Children were then monitored quarterly for 2 years, at which time infection and reinfection rates were compared statistically between the paired schools. In one such pair, crayfish failed to establish, resulting in neither snail control nor a reduction in transmission. At the second pair of schools, the numbers of snails were decreased {{by the presence of}} crayfish, but a clear difference in infection rates in children could not be detected, primarily because drought conditions kept overall transmission rates low. At the third school pair, crayfish established well in experimental habitats, snail numbers decreased precipitously, and children a...|$|R

Burrowing behavior of P. clarkii, was investigated in irrigation canal of three different sites (Abou-Kabir, Abou-hammad and Belbies) at Sharkia Governorate from January 2014 to December 2015. Most burrows were simple in their morphology and few of them had two types of chimney (plugged and open). Open chimney was present at 100 cm of the edge side of irrigation canal, while plugged cap chimney was located inside the agriculture soil. Result indicated that {{a great number of}} P. clarkii were observed migrating across roadways to find the main irrigation canal, during their crossing many of them were killed by cars. The highest mean numbers of burrows and population density of P. clarkii were recorded at Abou-Kabir followed by Abou-hammad while Belbies was the lowest one in this respect during two successive years of 2014 and 2015.
