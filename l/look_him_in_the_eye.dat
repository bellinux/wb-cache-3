500|$|New York {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making {{headlines}} off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, Hank Bauer and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management's patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the Kansas City Athletics. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel could not <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.|$|E

After collecting his winner's medal, Pardew embraced both Liebherr and Cortese.

5000|$|Director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi wanted Bill Pullman for {{the lead}} {{character}} of Harry. [...] "When we started casting, I knew right away that Bill was our man to play Harry ... He's an absolute natural for the part—intelligent, wry, and charmingly good looking." [...] Producer Kerry Rock saw Bill in more practical terms: [...] "Bill was {{the cornerstone of the}} casting process. We needed someone the right age, who was enough of a name, who could do the humor as well as being scary and believably violent at the tough spots of the story." [...] Co-star Bruno Kirby also found Bill to be the perfect match: [...] "The great thing about Bill is that he looks very straight, but if you <b>look</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> there's a real crazy sense of humor there." ...|$|E
