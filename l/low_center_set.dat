40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} the main results {{with respect to}} the discovery of <b>low</b> <b>center</b> of total column ozone (TCO) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in summer, and its formation mechanism. Some important advances are summarized as follows: The fact is discovered that there is a TCO <b>low</b> <b>center</b> over the TP in summer, and the features of the background circulation over the TP are analyzed; it is conrmed that the TP is a pathway of mass exchange between the troposphere and stratosphere, and it in uences the TCO <b>low</b> <b>center</b> over the TP in summer; models reproduce the TCO <b>low</b> <b>center</b> over the TP in summer, and the formation mechanism is explored; in addition, the analyses and diagnoses of the observation data indicate that not only there is the TCO <b>low</b> <b>center</b> over the TP in summer, but also TCO decrease trend over the TP is one of the strong centers of TCO decrease trend in the same latitude; nally, the model predicts the future TCO change over the TP.
