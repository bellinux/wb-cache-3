We have placed policy and practice before politics and thus have encouraged the birth of CBNRM (in its "modern" version) into a politico-legal environment which, if not hostile, is hardly a nurturing one. In so doing we have put an ironic twist on the conventional approach to planned change.

40|$|The {{paper is}} dealing with the {{application}} of spray drying in, and in the relation to the cheese industry. In the introduction the technology of producing the cheese powder is briefly described and also the production of the skim milk powder suitable for later production of cheese. Also the technology of whey processing to various dry products is briefly discussed. The main subject of the paper is the description of a new process, called TIXOTHERM™, developed recently by Niro, for the processing of permeate, produced as a by-product from the ultrafiltration of whey, into a non-hygroscopic powder. After evaporation to 60 % TS the permeate concentrate is subjected to a three step process consisting of concentration to 86 % in the Rosinaire ™ paddle dryer, holding, stabilization and curing in a screw conveyor with two augers, and finally drying and cooling in a combined back-mix/plug-flow fluid bed. In comparison with the traditional processes the TIXOTHERM ™ provides great savings of energy (about 30 %) and building costs (up to 75 %). The main subject of my paper will be to inform you about a new process for production of permeate powder. However, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> just <b>start</b> <b>with</b> a general survey of the application of spray drying in the cheese industry. You can find spray dryers in almost every cheese factory, however, these dryers are mostly used for the processing of the by-product, i. e. whey and only very few for making cheese powder.

40|$|What effect does {{managerial}} structure have on technological style? In {{this paper}} I {{will examine the}} textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, to investigate that question. Two aspects of management at the mills are of particular interest: the managerial hierarchy and the accounting systems. Did {{the management of the}} mills encourage or discourage technological change? Who was responsible for invention, who for innovation, and how did their hackground, training, and interests affect the speed and direction of technological change? How did their knowledge about the operations of the machinery of the mill, gained by means of formal and informal accounting, influence their decisions? I hope to show that managerial style was an important determinant of technological style. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> off <b>with</b> a brief description of what I call technological style. Technology, I believe, has a style, just as does painting or writing. Technological style reflects many of the same cultural and social influences that affect style in the arts. A piece of machinery is, after all, the end result of a series of design decisions. While physical law is central in many of these decisions, cultural influences make their presence known as well. Engineering reflects regional and national tendencies and artistic and economic desires as well as physics. Technological style is closely related to, but goes beyond, the eeonomist's notion of factor endowments. While factor endowments help to aeeoant for economic influences on technical style, in my definition technological style includes more complicated, less easily measured cultural phenomena. In this paper I examine the effect on technological decisions of one of these cultural phenomena: managerial hierarchies [17; 27]. I shall not argue that management is the only determinant of technological style. Other contexts of technology are undeniably important and {{play a critical role in}} teelmologieal decisions. 1 I believe, though, that in nineteenth-century America, the business context of technology was of utmost importance. In fact, I would argue that the defining characteristic 1 For mote on the tale of other contexts of technology /n the textge and textae machine /ndustty oi Lowell [...] geographical, legal, political, social, and personal contexts m see my dissertation, itom wh/ch th • paper /a drawn [22]...|$|R
40|$|We {{have three}} reviews here, one respectful and insightful, one amused and silly, and one angry and foolish. Professor Graafland, an {{economist}} and theologian {{who holds a}} chair in philosophy at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, is the one among the three who has troubled to understand the book. You know someone has understood your position when you can agree with his characterization of it. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start,</b> then, <b>with</b> Professor Graafland’s thoughtful and thought-provoking review. I leave my attempts {{to make sense of}} the silly and angry reviews to the end, so that you can more easily truncate your reading. You will see, I think, that cooperative games are better than non-cooperative games, and better advance our science. Graafland makes a good point in objecting that I view the virtue of humility rather differently from the way Jesus did in the Sermon on the Mount. I speak of humility as attending to what others say – rather than being modest. 1 Graafland himself exercises my attending-to definition. And my definition is not so far from that of St Thomas, or of C. S. Lewis. I can also agree with Graafland that I did not in the book succeed ‘in showing that the inverse impact of capitalism on virtues is as positive’, as I wanted to claim. I offered a few arguments, some of them at length, but I do not expect my revival of the doux commerce thesis of Voltaire and Hume and Smith to convert everyone so easily. I have almost finished a second volume in the five I plan of an apology for the bourgeois life, Bourgeois Deeds: How Values Made the Modern World. It contains more arguments for and against the claim that the impact of capitalism on virtues in positive. It’s available on my website (deirdremccloskey. org). And I have in hand a good deal of Volume 3, Bourgeois Rhetorics: How Language Works in Capitalism, which will be up on the website soon.

In this commentary I reflect on the place of materiality—that quality of material phenomena—and materialization—the processes by which such qualities are actualized in social life—in Matthew Hull’s brilliant book, Government of paper (GoP). The analytic materiality is central to Hull’s ethnography, both theoretically (it informs his engagements with James Scott, Bruno Latour, and contemporary linguistic anthropology, among others) and methodologically (it guides his ethnography and analysis). And yet, while Hull demonstrates the term’s pragmatic purchase, he never quite tackles what is “meant ” by it head on. 1 Bracketing whether this {{is in fact the}} point, in what follows I comment on what I think materiality and materialization do in Hull’s analysis, motioning to some issues this raises for linguistic anthropology. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>start</b> <b>with</b> the beginning of the end: the first endnote (Hull 2012 : 259; als...|$|E
