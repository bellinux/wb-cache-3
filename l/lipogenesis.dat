5|$|In animals, {{when there}} is an {{oversupply}} of dietary carbohydrate, the excess carbohydrate is converted to triglycerides. This involves the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and the esterification of fatty acids in the production of triglycerides, a process called <b>lipogenesis.</b> Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl-CoA units. The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acetyl group, reduce it to an alcohol, dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group. The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups, in animals and fungi all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional protein, while in plant plastids and bacteria separate enzymes perform each step in the pathway. The fatty acids may be subsequently converted to triglycerides that are packaged in lipoproteins and secreted from the liver.|$|E
25|$|High plasma {{levels of}} insulin {{in the blood}} plasma (e.g. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus {{promoting}} the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while epinephrine and glucagon (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting <b>lipogenesis</b> in favor of fatty acid oxidation via beta-oxidation.|$|E
2500|$|... 5' AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} or AMPK or 5' {{adenosine}} monophosphate-activated protein kinase is an enzyme (EC 2.7.11.31) that {{plays a role}} in cellular energy homeostasis. It belongs to a highly conserved eukaryotic protein family and its orthologues are SNF1 and SnRK1 in yeast and plants, respectively. It consists of three proteins (subunits) that together make a functional enzyme, conserved from yeast to humans. It is expressed in a number of tissues, including the liver, brain, and skeletal muscle. The net effect of AMPK activation is stimulation of hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, <b>lipogenesis,</b> and triglyceride synthesis, inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis and <b>lipogenesis,</b> and modulation of insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells.|$|E
2500|$|Insulin (from the Latin, insula meaning island) is a {{peptide hormone}} {{produced}} by beta {{cells of the}} pancreatic islets, and it {{is considered to be}} the main anabolic hormone of the body. It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and protein by promoting the absorption of, especially, glucose from the blood into fat, liver and skeletal muscle cells. [...] In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats (triglycerides) via <b>lipogenesis,</b> or, {{in the case of the}} liver, into both. [...] Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood. Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is therefore an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells. Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism.|$|E
50|$|Another {{hormone that}} may affects <b>lipogenesis</b> through the SREBP-1 pathway is leptin. It is {{involved}} in the process by limiting fat storage through inhibition of glucose intake and interfering with other adipose metabolic pathways. The inhibition of <b>lipogenesis</b> occurs through the down regulation of fatty acid and triglyceride gene expression. Through the promotion of fatty acid oxidation and <b>lipogenesis</b> inhibition, leptin was found to control the release of stored glucose from adipose tissues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lipogenesis</b> is {{the process}} by which acetyl-CoA is {{converted}} to fatty acids. The former is an intermediate stage in metabolism of simple sugars, such as glucose, a source of energy of living organisms. Through <b>lipogenesis</b> and subsequent triglyceride synthesis, the energy can be efficiently stored in the form of fats.|$|E

50|$|Co-culturing 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes in 3D with murine endothelial bEND.3 cells {{creates a}} vascular-like network {{assembly}} with concomitant <b>lipogenesis</b> in perivascular cells. See figure below.|$|E
50|$|They {{are also}} found {{in other parts of}} the body. For instance, in the liver, {{activation}} of the CB1 receptor is known to increase de novo <b>lipogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Adrenaline and {{glucagon}} {{affect the}} activity of protein kinase A by changing the levels of cAMP in a cell via the G-protein mechanism, using adenylate cyclase. Protein kinase A acts to phosphorylate many enzymes important in metabolism. For example, protein kinase A phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. Such covalent modification has an inhibitory effect on these enzymes, thus inhibiting <b>lipogenesis</b> and promoting net gluconeogenesis. Insulin, on the other hand, decreases the level of phosphorylation of these enzymes, which instead promotes <b>lipogenesis.</b> Recall that gluconeogenesis does not occur in myocytes.|$|E
50|$|The liver plays several {{roles in}} lipid metabolism: it {{performs}} cholesterol synthesis, <b>lipogenesis,</b> {{the production of}} triglycerides, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.|$|E
50|$|G6PD {{activity}} is also post-translationally regulated by cytoplasmic deacetylase SIRT2. SIRT2-mediated deacetylation and activation of G6PD stimulates oxidative branch of PPP to supply cytosolic NADPH to counteract oxidative damage or support de novo <b>lipogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Insulin is a {{peptide hormone}} that is {{critical}} for managing the body's metabolism. Insulin is released by the pancreas when blood sugar levels rise, and it has many effects that broadly promote the absorption and storage of sugars, including <b>lipogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Insulin stimulates <b>lipogenesis</b> {{primarily}} by activating two enzymatic pathways. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), converts acetyl-CoA produced by PDH into malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA provides the two-carbon building blocks {{that are used}} to create larger fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|In the liver, {{activation}} of the CB1 receptor is known to increase de novo <b>lipogenesis,</b> Activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors is also known to inhibit sympathetic innervation of blood vessels and contributes to {{the suppression of the}} neurogenic vasopressor response in septic shock.|$|E
50|$|Fat {{production}} in adipocytes is strongly stimulated by insulin. By controlling {{the activity of}} the pyruvate dehydrogenase and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes, insulin promotes unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. It also promotes glucose uptake and induces SREBF1, which activates the transcription of genes that stimulate <b>lipogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Zugunruhe {{has been}} artificially induced in {{experiments}} by simulating long days. Some studies on White-crowned Sparrows {{have suggested that}} prolactin {{is involved in the}} pre-migratory hyperphagia (feeding), fattening and Zugunruhe however others have found that prolactin may merely be associated with <b>lipogenesis</b> (fat accumulation).|$|E

5000|$|SREBP-1 {{expression}} produces {{two different}} isoforms, SREBP-1a and -1c. These isoforms {{differ in their}} first exons owing {{to the use of}} different transcriptional start sites for the SREBP-1 gene. SREBP-1c was also identified in rats as ADD-1. SREBP-1c is responsible for regulating the genes required for de novo <b>lipogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Palmitoleic acid {{also serves}} as a {{biomarker}} for metabolic status. More specifically, a low concentration in the free acid component of the serum indicates a risk of metabolic disease, and that de novo <b>lipogenesis</b> should be stimulated. Additionally, administering palmitoleic acid to a subject (via nutraceutical or other means), positively impacts lipid metabolism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lipogenesis</b> {{encompasses}} {{both the}} process of fatty acid synthesis and triglyceride synthesis (where fatty acids are esterified to glycerol). The products are secreted from the liver {{in the form of}} very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). VLDL particles are secreted directly into blood, where they mature and function to deliver the endogenously derived lipids to peripheral tissues.|$|E
50|$|Recently, CIDEB {{knockout}} mice {{have been}} generated by homolog recombination technique. The CIDE null mice show decreased <b>lipogenesis.</b> The CIDEB knockout mice {{are resistant to}} high fat diet induced obesity and liver steatosis. In addition, the CIDEB null mice also have improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and whole body metabolism.|$|E
50|$|High plasma {{levels of}} insulin {{in the blood}} plasma (e.g. after meals) cause the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thus {{promoting}} the formation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, and consequently the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids, while epinephrine and glucagon (released into the blood during starvation and exercise) cause the phosphorylation of this enzyme, inhibiting <b>lipogenesis</b> in favor of fatty acid oxidation via beta-oxidation.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{indicated}} that SREBP-2 promote {{the expression of}} genes involved in cholesterol metabolism in liver cells. It has been indicated that SREBP-1 {{plays a role in}} the activation of genes connected with <b>lipogenesis</b> in liver. Studies have found that an over expression of SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c in mouse liver cells results in the build-up of hepatic triglycerides and higher expression levels of lipogenic genes.|$|E
50|$|Insulin has an {{antagonistic}} {{effect to}} epinephrine signaling via the beta-adrenergic receptor (G-Protein coupled receptor). When insulin binds to its receptor (insulin receptor), {{it results in}} the activation (phosphorylation) of Akt which in turn activates Phosphodiesterase (PDE). PDE then will inhibit cyclic AMP (cAMP) action and cause inactivation of PKA which will cause Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) to be dephosphorylated and inactive so that lipolysis and <b>lipogenesis</b> is not occurring simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|In {{an effort}} to explain obesity-related {{reductions}} in SHBG, recent evidence suggests sugar or monosaccharide-induced hepatic <b>lipogenesis,</b> hepatic lipids in general, and cytokines like TNF-alpha and Interleukin reduce SHBG, whereas insulin does not. As an example anti-psoriatic drugs that inhibit TNF-alpha cause an increase in SHBG. The common downstream mechanism for all of these, including the effect of thyroid hormones was downregulation of HNF4, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{expression}} and maturation of SREBP-1c is controlled by OSBP. SREBP-1c is a major transcription factor for hepatic <b>lipogenesis</b> (fatty acids and triglycerides biosynthesis). OSBP expression levels in transgenic mice affect liver and serum TG levels. OSBP is thought to be an essential scaffolding compound of the protein complex that regulates the activation state of the ERK protein. OSBP also acts as a sterol-dependant scaffold for the JAK2 and STAT3 proteins.|$|E
50|$|ChREBP is {{translocated}} to {{the nucleus}} and binds to DNA after dephosphorylation of a p-Ser and a p-Thr residue by PP2A, which itself is activated by Xylulose-5-phosphate. Xu5p {{is produced in}} the pentose phosphate pathway when levels of Glucose-6-phosphate are high (the cell has ample glucose). In the liver, ChREBP mediates activation of several regulatory enzymes of glycolysis and <b>lipogenesis</b> including L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), acetyl CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase.|$|E
50|$|Functionally, zone I hepatocytes are {{specialized}} for oxidative liver {{functions such as}} gluconeogenesis, β-oxidation of {{fatty acids}} and cholesterol synthesis, while zone III cells are more important for glycolysis, <b>lipogenesis</b> and cytochrome P-450-based drug detoxification. This specialization is reflected histologically; the detoxifying zone III cells have the highest concentration of CYP2E1 and thus are most sensitive to NAPQI production in acetaminophen toxicity. Other zonal injury patterns include zone I deposition of hemosiderin in hemochromatosis and zone II necrosis in yellow fever.|$|E
50|$|Insulin binds to the insulin {{receptor}} at {{the cell}} surface and activates its tyrosine kinase activity, leading to autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of several receptor substrates. Phosphorylation of selected tyrosine sites on receptor substrates {{is known to}} activate different pathways leading to increased glucose uptake, <b>lipogenesis,</b> and glycogen and protein synthesis, {{as well as to}} the stimulation of cell growth. In addition to the activation of these pathways by tyrosine phosphorylation, several mechanisms of downregulating the response to insulin stimulation have also been identified.|$|E
50|$|Insulin, {{cholesterol}} derivatives, T3 {{and other}} endogenous molecules {{have been demonstrated}} to regulate the SREBP1c expression, particularly in rodents. Serial deletion and mutation assays reveal that both SREBP (SRE) and LXR (LXRE) response elements are involved in SREBP-1c transcription regulation mediated by insulin and cholesterol derivatives. Peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) agonists enhance {{the activity of the}} SREBP-1c promoter via a DR1 element at -453 in the human promoter. PPARα agonists act in cooperation with LXR or insulin to induce <b>lipogenesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{hormones that}} prevent the {{stimulation}} of <b>lipogenesis</b> in adipose cells are growth hormones (GH). Growth hormones result in {{loss of fat}} but stimulates muscle gain. One proposed mechanism for how the hormone works is that growth hormones affects insulin signaling thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity and in turn down regulating fatty acid synthase expression. Another proposed mechanism suggests that growth hormones may phosphorylate with STAT5A and STAT5B, transcription factors that {{are a part of}} the Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription (STAT) family.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory Quotient {{can be used}} as an {{indicator}} of over or underfeeding. Underfeeding, which forces the body to utilize fat stores, will lower the respiratory quotient while overfeeding, which causes <b>lipogenesis,</b> will increase it. Underfeeding is marked by a respiratory quotient below 0.85, while a respiratory quotient greater than 1.0 indicates overfeeding. This is particularly important in patients with compromised respiratory systems, as an increased respiratory quotient significantly corresponds to increased respiratory rate and decreased tidal volume, placing compromised patients at a significant risk.|$|E
50|$|Orexin-A (OXA) {{has been}} {{recently}} demonstrated {{to have a}} direct effect on an aspect of lipid metabolism. OXA stimulates glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and that increased energy uptake is stored as lipids (triacylglycerol). OXA thus increases <b>lipogenesis.</b> It also inhibits lipolysis and stimulates the secretion of adiponectin. These effects {{are thought to be}} mostly conferred via the PI3K pathway because this pathway inhibitor (LY294002) completely blocks OXA effects in adipocytes. The link between OXA and the lipid metabolism is new and currently under more research.|$|E
