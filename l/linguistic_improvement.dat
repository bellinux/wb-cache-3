40|$|We {{address the}} issue of the {{relation}} between the canonical functional Schrödinger representation in quantum field theory and the approach of precanonical field quantization proposed by the author, which requires neither a distinguished time variable nor infinite-dimensional spaces of field configurations. We argue that the standard functional derivative Schrödinger equation can be derived from the precanonical Dirac-like covariant generalization of the Schrödinger equation under the formal limiting transition γ^ 0 →δ(0), where the constant naturally appears within the precanonical quantization as the inverse of a small "elementary volume" of space. We obtain a formal explicit expression of the Schrödinger wave functional as a continuous product of the Dirac algebra valued precanonical wave functions, which are defined on the finite-dimensional covariant configuration space of the field variables and space-time variables.

The first example is {{an application of}} the Ważewski principle to the problem of the existence of a solution without falling in the case of a arbitrary prescribed law of motion of the pivot point. The second example is a proof of the existence of periodic solution in the same system when the law of motion is periodic as well. Moreover, in the second case it is also shown that along the obtained periodic solution the pendulum never becomes horizontal (falls).

40|$|We are {{suggesting}} an electronic method for Cooper pair mass spectroscopy of thin superconducting films. The method can be applied, for example, for 100 nm thin high-T_c films grown on insulator substrate 10 mm X 10 mm. In Corbino geometry two Ohmic contacts {{have to be}} made on the film evaporating Ag or using silver paste: one circle with radius r_a (1) and a ring electrode with internal radius r_b (2). In the in-between space (r_a,r_b) a ring electrode from mylar assures a capacitive connection between the superconducting layer and the metallized surface (3) of the mylar. In such a way we have an field effect transistor (FET) type structure with a circular gate. When at low enough temperatures T << T_c an AC current with frequency omega is applied between the circle source (1) and the ring-shaped drain (2) an AC Bernoulli voltage with double frequency 2 f appears between the gate (3) and the source (1). The 2 f signal depends on Cooper pair effective mass and its systematic investigation gives a Cooper pair mass spectroscopy. In the normal phase 2 f gives logarithmic derivative of the density of states (DOS) with respect of Fermi energy. Applying a gate voltage in the same structure gives the mobility of the normal phase.

Critical ‘deviant’ sentence stimuli where either well-formed and meaningful, or syntactically, or lexico-semantically incorrect. After 4 weeks of speech-language therapy (SLT) delivered with high intensity (10. 5 h per week), clinical language assessment with the Aachen Aphasia Test battery demonstrated significant <b>linguistic</b> <b>improvements,</b> which were accompanied by enhanced MMN responses. More specifically, MMN amplitudes to grammatically correct and meaningful mini-constructions and to ‘jabberwocky’ sentences containing a pseudoword significantly increased after therapy. However, no therapy-related changes in MMN responses to syntactically incorrect strings including agreement violations were observed. While MMN increases to well-formed meaningful strings can be explained both at the word and construction levels, the neuroplastic change seen for ‘jabberwocky’ sentences suggests an explanation in terms of constructions. The results confirm previous reports that intensive SLT leads to <b>improvements</b> of <b>linguistic</b> skills in chronic aphasia patients and now demonstrate that this clinical improvement is associated with enhanced automatic brain indexes of construction processing, although no comparable change is present for ungrammatical strings.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the policy of teaching Science and Mathematics in English was introduced to Year One, Form One and Form Six pupils in all schools in Malaysia beginning 2003. This move was expected to provide opportunities for pupils to use English language and {{it was intended to}} increase their proficiency in the language. In view of this, the purpose of this research was to assess pupils’ readiness of learning Science and Mathematics in English after five years of its implementation from the perspective of pupils. A total of 507 pupils, from the levels of Form One and Form Two, ages ranging from 13 to 14 years, participated in this study. The methodology used was quantitative in nature where a set of questionnaire and two sets of diagnostics tests for Form One and Form Two pupils respectively were used in measuring pupils’ readiness in the learning of Science and Mathematics in English. The results in term of pupils’ perceptions from the'questionnaire indicate that both Form One and Form Two pupils have a positive perception toward the learning of Science and Mathematics in English. Approximately two-third of the pupils indicated their desire to continue on this policy that consists of a higher percentage of Form Two pupils than Form One pupils. Similarly, a higher percentage of pupils enjoy learning Mathematics than learning Science in English. The second part of the questionnaire was to measure pupils’ linguistic competency which was based on their understanding on spoken understanding of English texts, writing in English, speaking in English and confidence in speaking in English. The data suggests that the highest increment in Form One pupils and Form Two pupils’ <b>linguistic</b> <b>improvement</b> is in understanding spoken English. Form Two pupils rated higher confidence ability on the linguistic areas of competencies as compared to Form One pupils and significant difference was found only in the area of listening skills and reading skills. In the second part of this study, two separate diagnostic tests for each Form were used to diagnose pupils understanding of Science and Mathematics learning. Pupils’ achievements were based on the ten constructs and through the diagnostic tests pupils level of proficiency and understanding were assessed. The overall achievement score obtained for both tests was statistically significant. Form One pupils was found to have a higher level of difficulty in Science learning as compared to Mathematics learning in the English Language. For both diagnostic tests, the highest level of difficulty was in the construct of Expressing Scicence and Mathematical idea or information in English. The results from the diagnostic study reveals that pupils in schools are actually still facing language problems as well as content problems in learning Science and Mathematics and to overcome these problems they need help and guidance from the teachers. The result of this study indicates most pupils perceive the learning of Science and Mathematics in English has brought positive effects especially in terms of language skills based on pupils’ perception on their linguistic performance in terms of their linguistic competencies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Quality of life (QoL) is {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important outcome measure in clinical trials. The Canadian Hemophilia Outcomes-Kids Life Assessment Tool (CHO-KLAT) shows promise for use in China. Objective To adapt the CHO-KLAT version 2. 0 for use in clinical trials in China. Methods Forward and back translations of the CHO-KLAT 2. 0 were completed in 2008. Between October 2009 and June 2010, a series of 3 focus groups were held with 20 boys and 31 parents in rural and urban China to elicit additional concepts, important to their QoL, for the Chinese CHO-KLAT 2. 0. All of the items identified by boys and parents were reviewed {{by a group of}} experts, resulting in a Chinese version of the CHO-KLAT 2. 0. This version underwent a detailed cognitive debriefing process between October 2010 and June 2011. Thirteen patient-parent pairs participated in this cognitive debriefing process until a stable and clearly understood Chinese version of the CHO-KLAT 2. 0 was obtained. Results The initial back translation of the Chinese CHO-KLAT 2. 0 was slightly discrepant from the original English version on 12 items. These were all successfully adjudicated. The focus groups identified 9 new items that formed an add-on Socio-Economic Context (SEC) module for China. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>improvements</b> were made after the 2 nd, 5 th, 7 th and 13 th cognitive debriefings pairs and affected a total of 18 items. The result was a 35 item CHO-KLAT 2. 0 and a SEC module in Simplified Chinese, both of which have good content validity. Conclusion This detailed process proved to be extremely valuable in ensuring the items were accurately interpreted by Chinese boys with hemophilia ages ≤ 18 years. The need for the additional SEC module highlighted the different context that currently exists in China with regard to hemophilia care as compared to many Western countries, and will be important in tracking progress within both rural and urban China over time. Changes based on the cognitive debriefings suggest that expert verbatim translation alone is not sufficient. The Chinese version of the CHO-KLAT 2. 0 is well understood by boys with hemophilia in China. Next steps will be to test its construct validity and reliability in boys with hemophilia in China. </p...|$|R

40|$|As English is now {{promoted}} {{as an academic}} subject in primary and secondary schools in China, creating an enormous demand for qualified English teachers, {{there is a need}} to understand English teachers' motivation and commitment to the teaching career. In this paper, the author reports on a biographical study of 12 teachers who taught in schools in Chinese hinterland areas so as to understand why they first joined and then left the teaching profession for postgraduate studies. Through interpreting their professional experiences, the author came to understand their ambiguous attitudes towards the teaching profession and their fascination with the English language. Initially, many of them were unwilling to become teachers but were attracted by the teacher education programmes to learn more English. Many of them became more committed to teaching after they had positive professional experiences. However, their sense of satisfaction and achievement were undermined by the challenges that they had to cope with as well as an awareness that they were unable to sustain their professional competence.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of the WEXICOM project at the Hans-Ertel-Centre for Weather Research of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), a survey was {{conducted}} in autumn 2012 to question how weather warnings are communicated to professional end-users in the emergency community and how the warnings are converted into mitigation measures. 161 members of emergency services (e. g. fire fighters, police officers and civil servants) across Germany answered an online questionnaire. Questions included user's confidence in forecasts, their understanding of probabilistic information and their perception and use of uncertainty in forecasts and warnings. A large number of open questions were selected to identify new topics of interest, unknown problems, and research gaps in the field of communicating weather information in Germany. Results show that the emergency service personnel who participated in this survey generally have a good appreciation of the uncertainty of weather forecasts. Although no single probability threshold could be identified for organisations to start with preparatory mitigation measures, it became clear that emergency services tend to avoid forecast based on low probabilities as basis for their decisions. This paper suggests that when trying to enhance weather communication by reducing the uncertainty in forecasts, the focus should not only be on improving computer models and observation tools, but also on the communication aspect, as uncertainty also arises from <b>linguistic</b> origins.

40|$|Just before summer, {{when the}} air around {{university}} is filled with students' adrenalin due to numerous tests, we are pleased to announce our summer ALA issue. It was compiled bearing {{in mind that the}} outcome of such efforts is mainly students' of course, however, ours also; the outcome of teachers and researchers. In a very broad sense, this issue places importance on a successful second language pedagogical process, be it readability, pronunciation, generalization and application of grammatical rules, or their methodological issues. It supports the idea that reciprocal improvements on students' as well as teachers' and researchers' sides undoubtedly deliver best results in the language pedagogy as well as in <b>linguistic</b> research. <b>Improvements</b> that build upon expertise and considerable amount of real-life data. Improvements aspired to. Kristina HMELJAK SANGAWA in her article analized a collection of Japanese texts which had been linguistically simplified for learners of Japanese as a foreign language, and compared them to their original versions. The main aim of such analysis was to uncover different strategies that are used to make texts more accessible to learners. The author, however, makes some further steps and discusses the application of such strategies to assessing, selecting, and devising texts in a language classroom.   Zuzana POSPĚCHOVÁ offers a detailed introduction to the method of prosodic transcription (PTR) for Standard Chinese established by phonetician Oldřich Švarný. The PTR method has taken several decades to form and it is nowadays a well established way of teaching Chinese prosody in the language courses around the Czech Republic. The article offers a short sample text, students' opinion on PTR, and an outline of the use of PTR in academic research. It concludes with the suggestion that PTR could be an international system of transcription capturing prosodic features worldwide.   The idea in Mateja PETROVČIČ’s article also emerged from her experience with students of Chinese as a second language and their problems in the learning process. She highlights the so called liheci, a special type of Chinese polymorphemic verbs. Such verbs are known to sometimes accept one or more elements to infuse in between their morphemes, however, the author points out that word sketches such as Sketch Engine hardly offer any information on the behaviour of such words. She gives suggestions on how to include them. Liulin ZHANG offers a discussion on the two commonly recognized imperfective aspect markers in Mandarin Chinese zai and着zhe, and argues their qualifications as imperfective aspect markers based on the differences in their origins, historical evolutions, and corpus data. Alexander AKULOV is critical towards the methods in comparative linguistics that base on the characteristics of lexems of the compared languages. He points out that such methods do not suppose verification and therefore allow different, even opposing conclusions. In his article he suggests the comparison of grammars of the languages involved, and by using Prefixation Ability Index (PAI) and Verbal Grammar Correlation Index (VGCI) tackles the problem of Buyeo language group. His findings prove that Japanese and Korean belong to the same language group, and not just to the same language family.      Finally, Pankaj DWIVEDI and Somdev KAR contributed a survey article on a Hindi dialect called Kanauji.

Nesse contexto adverso, os Kokama reflexivamente vêm procurando conhecer, "resgatar" e valorizar sua cultura "tradicional", como uma forma de conquistar visibilidade étnica, diante de uma sociedade que os discrimina e de um Estado que os excluí das políticas indigenistas oficiais. Nesse processo surgem conflitos e alianças com setores da sociedade não indígena, das demais etnias da região e dentro do próprio movimento social kokama, em virtude da competição por reconhecimento étnico e jurídico em termos associativos, direitos territoriais e intelectuais, bens culturais, patrimônio linguístico, educação e saúde diferenciadas, religiosidades, controle de recursos naturais, entre outras demandas e projetos com financiamento escassos. Nesta pesquisa mapeamos algumas redes indígenas de parentesco, de intercâmbio político, religioso, {{cultural}} e econômico que atravessam e interligam essa fronteira geográfica entre distintos Estados nacionais e suas políticas, abrangendo uma vasta região da Amazônia, que vai de Iquitos no Peru até Manaus no Brasil, passando pela Colômbia. Os Kokama contemporâneos, por meio do recurso as suas memórias e história, lutam pelo seu reconhecimento enquanto indígena kokama perante outras etnias indígenas, os não índios e as organizações indígenas e indigenistas. A cultura kokama é pensada, resgatada e inventada em meio às dinâmicas relações sociais que mantêm: intraétnicas e interétnicas; com o meio urbano; com os novos movimentos religiosos e com a política partidária. Projetada em direção ao passado, essa "cultura" pretende legitimar o presente e vislumbrar um futuro mais favorável aqueles que a agenciam.;;Abstract:The Kokama tribe {{today is}} divided {{in terms of}} nationality; they are Brazilians, Peruvians and Colombians. On the Brazilian {{side of the border}} in the Upper Solimões River region in the state of Amazonas, whereas they have historically been marginalized by Brazil, the Kokama in the last few decades have been organizing themselves politically in an effort to benefit from national public policy. In order to do this the Kokama have been working toward being legally recognized as possessing the rights of an ethnically distinct group, nothwithstanding their continuing position as part of the collective indigenous whole. The Kokama react to this adverse context by seeking knowledge of their "traditional" tribal culture, "rediscovering" and valuing it, as a way to win ethnic visibility before a society that discriminates them and national indigenous politics that exclude them. In this process there arise both conflicts and alliances ¿with non-indian sectors of Brazilian society, with other tribes in the region and even within the Kokama social movement ¿ as part of the competitions for ethnic and legal recognition in relation to associations, territorial and intellectual rights, physical cultural heritage, <b>linguistic</b> heritage, <b>improvements</b> in education and healthcare, religious influences, the control of natural resources, and other needs and projects with scarse funding. In the present research we have mapped several tribal parentage networks, political alliances, religious networks as well as cultural and economic networks that interconnect across these national borders that separate distinct national policies but that include the vast Amazon region extending from Iquitos in Peru through Colombia all the way to Manaus in Brazil. The contemporary Kokama, relying on their cultural memory and history, struggle to be recognized as a distinct tribe by other indigenous tribes, by non-Indians, tribal organizations and specialists in tribal affairs. The Kokama culture is rethought, rediscovered and formulated {{in the midst of the}} dynamic of maintaining their various social relationships: intra-and intertribal; with their urban environment; with new religious movements and with party politics. While looking back toward their past, this "culture" aims to legitimize their present reality and to envision being agents of a better future...|$|R
40|$|Eating {{disorders}} are often characterized by multiple illness episodes and chronic courses. Despite well established and effective treatment options, {{a considerable number}} of patients fail to respond to these treatments or drop-out prematurely. Even after successful treatment, patients experience a high risk of relapse that is particularly pronounced in the first months following treatment termination. Maintenance of treatment gains and promotion of continued recovery is highly relevant to improve outcome and ultimately reduce the burden of illness. Interventions based on new technologies have the potential to extend the reach of treatment providers and to provide such maintenance support at reasonable cost and effort. Acknowledging the widespread use of communication technologies in today’s world and the increasing evidence to support the potential of e-health interventions in prevention, self-help, treatment and maintenance treatment of patients with eating disorders, the three studies presented in this dissertation were concerned with developing and evaluating an Internet-based support program as a step-down strategy for patients with bulimic symptomatology following discharge from treatment. Thus far, no study has addressed patients with BN and related EDNOS using the Internet at post-treatment. The program was developed within a European collaboration and followed an individually tailored intervention strategy which incorporated several modules of differing intensity. In the first study, the feasibility of the program was investigated among 22 participants who utilized the online program for four months. The results indicated the viability of an individually tailored intervention strategy in a heterogeneous sample with high satisfaction and acceptance ratings. In the second study, the efficacy of the intervention in maintaining and/or enhancing treatment gains was studied among 105 women who had received treatment for an eating disorder with bulimic symptomatology in routine care against a wait-list TAU control condition. It was hypothesized that intervention group participants would improve more compared to the control group participants {{at the end of the}} four-month intervention period on eating disorder related outcomes. In addition, the feasibility of the program was investigated within a larger sample. The program proved feasible and well-accepted. In tendency, participants of the aftercare intervention showed better results on all outcome measures, but the efficacy could not be demonstrated. Further research and larger trials are needed to determine the optimum intensity and duration of the intervention as well as patient characteristics associated with outcome. The third study was concerned with the text analyses of the moderated group chat sessions of the program to study relevant online themes of the chat interactions following treatment termination. In addition, the linguistic predictors of eating disorder related and general psychological well-being were investigated. The results indicate that using a higher ratio of words related to family of origin was significantly associated with improvements in eating disorder related attitudes, emotional distress, and a reduction in the frequency of binge eating episodes. This is the first study to show the importance of family level variables through sufferers’ own words after the end of treatment and may speak to the use of family-based treatment beyond treatment termination. In sum, the Internet-based intervention to address patients with bulimic symptomatology after discharge was feasible, well-accepted and associated with accelerated improvements on eating disorder related attitudes and general psychological well-being compared to a TAU condition although its efficacy could not be demonstrated in terms of statistical significance. A higher ratio of using family of origin words emerged as a <b>linguistic</b> predictor of <b>improvement.</b> Overall, the three studies discussed here add to the limited knowledge in the field of technology-enhanced interventions for eating disorders and may stimulate further research activities. ...|$|R
