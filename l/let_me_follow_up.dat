5000|$|... "Greetings to the Romans! Though I am unworthy, I long to see you. Pray for me. And when I {{arrive in}} chains, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> die a martyrâ€™s death - eaten by wild beasts! I long for this proof that I am a true disciple of Christ. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> in the {{footsteps}} of the Lord. I no longer take pleasure in life. Pray for the church in Syria." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on, please, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> alone. I want {{to think}} over my {{pleasant}} day, and finish it with waking dreams, as I go through this enchanted wood," [...] said Rose, whose mind was full of sweet yet sober thoughts; for she had gathered herbs of grace while carelessly pulling wayside flowers, and from the simple adventures of the day had unconsciously received lessons that never were forgotten.|$|R
5000|$|The song is an {{arrangement}} of Eric Von Schmidt's rendering of [...] "Baby, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down" [...] as covered by Bob Dylan, on his first, self-titled, album. The Animals' version opens with striking unaccompanied guitar arpeggios, inserts a middle section with spoken words over an organ riff and closes with a frantic double-time coda. The result was a key influence on Dylan's change to electric music and to the folk-rock genre.|$|R
5000|$|Dylan {{would leave}} {{most of these}} songs behind {{when he moved to}} the concert stage in 1963, but he {{performed}} [...] "Man of Constant Sorrow" [...] during his first national television appearance in mid-1963 (a performance included on the 2005 retrospective No Direction Home). [...] "Baby <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down" [...] would later return in a driving electric arrangement during his 1965 and 1966 tours with the Hawks; a live recording was included on Live 1966.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1981 {{review for}} Rolling Stone, Charles M. Young praised the album {{and said it}} [...] "is pretty accessible, as Fahey records go. Uninitiated {{listeners}} {{ought to be able}} to appreciate his strong stroke and profound sense of rhythm quite easily. A legendary character in concert, Fahey was apparently in one of his unpredictable good moods so far from home. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> suit and chide my own audience for not buying enough of his albums." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me strange afterwards, that of the {{immediate}} future neither of us spoke. I did not even ask her how long {{she was going to}} stay with Lady Dennisford; she did not speak to me of my plans. As she had come, so she went, silently and unexpectedly. She would not even <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> her out onto the terrace; from the window I watched her mount her horse and ride away. Only just before she went she had looked back.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Lorry did so, {{and they}} went down-stairs and out in the streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, {{and turned back to}} the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. [...] "She came out here," [...] he said, looking about him, [...] "turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> in her steps." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Answer {{for your}} own serfs," [...] {{retorted}} Leonard, who had nearly succeeded in working himself into a passion. [...] "My father {{might be willing to}} grace Sir Reginald by <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>follow</b> him, but by his death I am my own man, and not to move at your beck and call, because the Prince laid his sword on your shoulder. Knave Jasper," [...] he called to one of the men-at-arms, [...] "bring my sword and cloak from the tent; I enter it no more." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Scorsese, Dylan {{made the}} {{stipulation}} that {{only two of}} his songs could be filmed: [...] "Baby <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down" [...] and [...] "Forever Young". [...] "When Dylan got on stage, the sound was so loud, I didn't know what to shoot," [...] Scorsese later recalled. [...] "Bill Graham was next to me shouting, 'Shoot him! Shoot him! He comes from the same streets as you. Don't let him push you around.' Fortunately, we got our cues right and we shot the two songs {{that were used in}} the film." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, {{the club}} (when known as Club 47) {{played a role}} in the rise of folk-rock music, when it began to book folk/rock bands whose music was {{unrelated}} to traditional folk, such as the Lovin' Spoonful. The club's importance to the 1960s Cambridge folk scene is documented extensively in Eric Von Schmidt's Baby, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down: The Illustrated Story of the Cambridge Folk Years. Scott Alarik described Club 47 as being [...] "the hangout of choice for the new folkies" [...] during that time.|$|R
5000|$|Seventeen {{songs were}} recorded, {{and five of}} the album's chosen tracks were {{actually}} cut in single takes ("Baby <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down", [...] "In My Time of Dyin'", [...] "Gospel Plow", [...] "Highway 51 Blues", and [...] "Freight Train Blues") while the master take of [...] "Song to Woody" [...] was recorded after one false start. The album's four outtakes were also cut in single takes. During the sessions, Dylan refused requests to do second takes. [...] "I said no. I can't see myself singing the same song twice in a row. That's terrible." ...|$|R
5000|$|All tracks {{written by}} Bob Dylan except [...] "Baby <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down" [...] by Gary Davis, Dave Van Ronk, and Eric von Schmidt, and both [...] "Isis" [...] and [...] "Romance in Durango" [...] by Dylan and Jacques Levy. The compact disc running order is the same, except disc two ends with [...] "Jet Pilot" [...] {{inserted}} after [...] "Isis." [...] Disc one ends with [...] "I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)," [...] and disc two begins with [...] "Visions of Johanna." [...] Disc three begins with [...] "Caribbean Wind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eric Von Schmidt (May 28, 1931 [...] - [...] February 2, 2007) was an American {{singer and}} guitarist, songwriter, painter and illustrator, and Grammy Award recipient. He was {{associated}} with the folk boom of the late 1950s and early 1960s and {{a key part of the}} Cambridge folk music scene. As a singer and guitarist, he was considered to be the leading Cambridge specialist in country blues at the time, thus the Cambridge analogue of Greenwich Village's Dave Van Ronk. Von Schmidt co-authored with Jim Rooney Baby, <b>Let</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Follow</b> You Down: The Illustrated Story of the Cambridge Folk Years.|$|R
