5|$|During {{construction}} of the dam, it was anticipated that the large size and scenic location of the reservoir, coupled with its proximity to urban centers, {{would make it a}} large tourist draw. A $40,000 plan was put forth to develop the reservoir for recreational activities. This entailed the {{construction of}} campsites, picnic areas, boat ramps, a <b>landing</b> <b>strip,</b> and hiking trails, including on 14 of the 33 islands in the lake. Don Pedro has become a popular summer destination in Central California, attracting 360,000–400,000 visitors each year.|$|E
5000|$|The US {{government}} estimated {{there were}} 27 airports and/or <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> in Niger as of 2007. Nine (9) of these had paved runways, 18 with unpaved <b>landing</b> <b>strips.</b> ICAO Codes for Niger are prefixed [...] "DR".|$|R
50|$|It {{was decided}} that three grass <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> would be marked out at HMS Vulture II (between Tregonnick Tail and Treligga village, each around 580 metres long) so that if an {{aircraft}} sustained engine failure or ricochet damage whilst firing on the range, {{it would be possible}} to land. This involved a lot of earth moving and heavy machinery was brought in to complete the work. To the north of the tower, the head of a valley was filled and levelled. The ground on the <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> was considered too rough for normal take offs and landings. The <b>landing</b> <b>strips</b> were intended only for belly landings (wheels-up), in an emergency. Later however the surface was improved and some traffic did use the <b>landing</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R

He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Asháninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a <b>landing</b> <b>strip.</b> The Asháninka hunted, and farmed manioc other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop.|$|E

In 1993, the city's jurisdiction was , still many times larger than the urban area. The historical site of Tel Arad and the Arad Park (also known as Ran Grove) can also be found within its municipal area, west of the urban core. Arad also has a commercial <b>landing</b> <b>strip</b> located slightly to the south of its urban core. It borders the Tamar and Abu Basma regional councils, and the closest local municipality to Arad is the Bedouin local council Kuseife.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass <b>landing</b> <b>strip,</b> unloading ammunition and other supplies while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{examination}} for {{the construction}} of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1949 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency <b>landing</b> <b>strip</b> until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945for an operation of 24hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.|$|E
5|$|Mining in Mine 1b was {{terminated}} in 1958, but operation in Mine 5 started the following year. Preliminary work on Mine 4 started in 1954, and from 1960 {{it was used}} as a reserve mine. The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s. In 1959, a man fell seriously ill, so a <b>landing</b> <b>strip</b> was prepared in Adventdalen. From the same year, Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular winter flights. In 1957, a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958. From 1961, the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school. A branch of Tromsø Sparebank opened in 1959.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to Italy the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{was sent to}} Rome on 3 September, and moved again on 8 September to a camp near Taranto {{to prepare for a}} {{possible}} mission in Greece, Operation Manna. The Russian advance in the east had forced the Germans to withdraw from Greece or be cut off from support and reinforcements. Over the night of 12/13 October 1944 'C' Company of the 4th Parachute Battalion, were parachuted onto Megara airfield near Athens to prepare a <b>landing</b> <b>strip</b> for the follow-up waves {{from the rest of the}} brigade. The company sustained several casualties while landing in adverse weather conditions that forced the remainder of the brigade to delay their arrival for another two days.|$|E

5|$|Sabotage {{operations}} were ordered from Berlin {{in the late}} autumn of 1940, but actual work did not start until early 1941. The first {{operations were}} unsuccessful. A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was aborted, as the timing device was faulty. In February {{there was a large}} explosion in the North Tunnel, and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield. In June 1941, however, the British intelligence foiled a new attempt, by a German agent, to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship. Another attempt failed when Plazas placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive. It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed. In January 1942, two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front <b>landing</b> <b>strip.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{carried out}} its own day-to-day maintenance in Malaya; the Lincolns were rotated back to Australia for major work. Its original complement of six aircraft was increased to eight after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent {{withdrawal of the}} RAF's Lincolns to Bomber Command in Europe. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency in 1950–51 and 1954–55. It suffered no casualties during the campaign but two of its aircraft were written off: one that overshot the <b>landing</b> <b>strip</b> at Tengah in November 1951, and another that crashed into the sea off Johore after striking trees on takeoff in January 1957.|$|E

5|$|Steege {{undertook}} a fighter sector course in January 1943, {{and was given}} command of No.8 Fighter Sector Headquarters in Brisbane. As a result, he later contended, of his petitioning Eastern Area Command for reassignment to combat duties and complaining to Group Officer Clare Stevenson that {{there were too many}} WAAAFs in the sector for an unmarried man to supervise, he was posted to command No.14 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters at Camden, New South Wales, on 23May. The following month, the unit deployed to Goodenough Island in New Guinea as part of No.71 (Fighter) Wing, becoming operational on 27June. In August it moved to Kiriwina, under the aegis of No.73 (Fighter) Wing. Steege relinquished command on 1October to take charge of No.73 Wing. The wing's combat units consisted of two P-40 Kittyhawk squadrons and a Supermarine Spitfire squadron. As part of the build-up to the Battle of Arawe in December, the Kittyhawks launched a series of assaults on Gasmata; three days before the Allied landings, Steege personally led a force of thirty-four aircraft in a bombing and strafing attack on the town's <b>landing</b> <b>strip.</b> In January 1944, the wing took part in the two largest raids mounted by the RAAF to that time, each involving over seventy aircraft attacking enemy camps and depots at Lindenhafen, New Britain. Steege was promoted acting group captain the following month; the rank was made temporary in July.|$|E
