These constructs were selected by virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> empirical research regarding the assumed relationship between them. <b>The</b> Locus <b>of</b> control Scale of Schepers (1995) was used for measuring locus of control. Work performance {{was measured by the}} commission earned per month by the marketer, <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> generated by <b>the</b> marketer, as well as <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>lapsed</b> <b>policies.</b> <b>The</b> relevant measurements were obtained in respect of a sample o 149 black marketing personnel. The results indicated a modest but statistically significant relationship between external locus <b>of</b> control and <b>the</b> work performance <b>of</b> black marketers...|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to acts <b>of</b> {{corporations}} as <b>the</b> main factor in <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> participation in corporations.

The changes affected not only <b>the</b> Civil code <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Federation (hereinafter- the CC), but <b>the</b> Federal law <b>of</b> 08. 02. 1998 No. 14 -FL “On limited liability companies", the Federal law dated 26. 12. 1995 No. 208 -FL "On joint stock companies". <b>The</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> participation is associated primarily with <b>the</b> disappearance <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membership relationship. It is either a liquidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation, <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation, or conclusion of disposing civil transactions.

2500|$|Predicting the end-time (Daniel 8:14 and 12:7–12): Biblical eschatology {{does not}} {{generally}} give precise {{information as to}} when the end will come, and Daniel's attempts to specify <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> days remaining is a rare exception. Daniel asks the angel how long the [...] "little horn" [...] will be triumphant, and the angel replies that the Temple will be reconsecrated after 2,300 [...] "evenings and mornings" [...] have passed (Daniel 8:14). The angel is counting the two daily sacrifices, so the period is 1,150 days from the desecration in December 167. In chapter 12 the angel gives three more dates: the desolation will last [...] "for a time, times and half a time", or a year, two years, and a half a year (Daniel 12:8); then that the [...] "desolation" [...] will last for 1,290 days (12:11); and finally, 1,335 days (12:12). Verse 12:11 was presumably added after <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1,150 days <b>of</b> chapter 8, and 12:12 after <b>the</b> <b>lapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number in 12:11.|$|R
