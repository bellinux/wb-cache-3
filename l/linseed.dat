In the current experiment, the potential to enhance milk n- 3 content in two breeds with inherent genetic differences in mammary lipogenesis and de novo fatty acid synthesis was examined using extruded <b>linseeds.</b> Six lactating cows (three Holstein and three Jersey) were used in a two-treatment switchback design with 3 ? 21 -day experimental periods to evaluate the effect of iso-energetic replacement of calcium salts of palm oil distillate (CPO) in the diet (34 g/kg dry matter (DM)) with 100 g/kg DM extruded <b>linseeds</b> (LIN). For both breeds, replacing CPO with LIN had no effect (P > 0. 05) on DM intake or milk yield, but reduced (P < 0. 05) milk fat and protein yield (on average, from 760 to 706 and 573 to 552 g/day, respectively). Relative to CPO, the LIN treatment reduced (P < 0. 01) total saturated fatty acid content and enhanced (P < 0. 001) 18 : 3 n- 3 in milk, whereas breed by diet interactions were significant for milk fat 16 : 0, total trans fatty acid and conjugated linoleic acid concentrations. Increases in 18 : 3 n- 3 intake derived from LIN in the diet were transferred into milk with a mean marginal transfer efficiency of 1. 8 %.

Effect of {{extruded}} <b>linseeds</b> {{alone or}} in combination with fish oil on intake, milk production, plasma metabolite concentrations and milk fatty acid composition in lactating goats. Animal, 9 (5), 810 - 82 Based on the potential benefits for long-term human health, there is interest in developing sustainable nutritional strategies for lowering medium-chain saturated fatty acids (FA) and increasing specific unsaturated FA in ruminant milk. Dietary supplements of extruded <b>linseeds</b> (EL), fish oil (FO) or a mixture of EL and FO increase cis- 9,trans- 11 CLA and long-chain n- 3 polyunsaturated FA in bovine milk. Supplements of FO cause milk fat depression in lactating cows, but information for dairy goats is limited. A total of 14 Alpine goats were used in a replicated 3 ? 3 Latin square with 28 -days experimental periods {{to examine the effects}} of EL {{alone or in}} combination with FO on animal performance, milk fat synthesis and milk FA composition. Treatments comprised diets based on natural grassland hay supplemented with no additional oil (control), 530 of EL or 340 g/day of EL and 39 g/day of FO (ELFO). Compared with the control, ELFO tended (P= 0. 08) to lower milk fat yield, whereas EL increased (P< 0. 01) milk fat content and yield (15 % and 10 %, respectively). Relative to EL, ELFO decreased (P< 0. 01) milk fat content and yield (19 % and 17 %, respectively). Relative to the control and ELFO, EL decreased (P< 0. 05) milk 10 : 0 to 16 : 0 and odd- and branched-chain FA content and increased 18 : 0, cis- 18 : 1, trans- 13 18 : 1 (and their corresponding ?- 9 (desaturase products), trans- 12,cis- 14 CLA, cis- 13,trans- 15 CLA, cis- 12,trans- 14 CLA and trans- 11,cis- 13 CLA and 18 : 3 n- 3 concentrations. ELFO was more effective for enriching (P< 0. 05) milk cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA and trans- 11 18 : 1 concentrations (up to 5. 4 - and 7. 1 -fold compared with the control) than EL (up to 1. 7 - and 2. 5 -fold increases). Furthermore, ELFO resulted in a substantial increase in milk trans- 10 18 : 1 concentration (5. 4 % total FA), with considerable variation between individual animals. Relative to the control and EL, milk fat responses to ELFO were characterized by increases (P< 0. 05) in milk trans- 16 : 1 (? 9 to 11), trans- 18 : 1 (? 6 to 11), trans- 18 : 2, CLA (cis- 9,trans- 11, trans- 9,cis- 11, trans- 8,trans- 10 and trans- 7,trans- 9) and 20 - and 22 -carbon FA concentrations. Overall, EL resulted in a relatively high cis- 9 18 : 1 concentration and an increase in the 18 : 3 n- 3 / 18 : 2 n- 6 ratio, whereas combining EL and FO resulted in substantial increases in trans-FA, marginal enrichment in 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3 and lower 16 : 0 concentration changes associated with a decrease in milk fat content.

Samples of muesli with seeds (<b>linseeds,</b> pumpkins seeds, almond slices) were packaged in 3 different packages –paper bag, paper tubes and Doypack (standup pouches) and stored for 6 months (at 20 ± 2 °C temperature and air humidity – 50 ± 5 %). During the storage moisture content, water activity, and microbiological safety were evaluated. After 6 months storage of muesli with seeds, the moisture content in samples packaged in the paper tube decreases by 14. 3 %, in Doypack– 20. 5 % and in paper bag by 34. 9 %. The lowest moisture content was determined for muesli samples storage in the paper package – 6. 00 %. Water activity compared to the fresh prepared muesli (aw= 0. 56) decreased, in paper tube it was 0. 33, in paper bag – 0. 16 and in Doypack – 0. 47.

Young women in both groups had similar values of body mass index, concentrations of vitamin C, vitamin B 9 and -carotene. In vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian group was found the significantly increased daily intake of fiber, whole grain products, pulses, seeds and nuts. These finding suggest that both nutritional groups had the similar nutritional regimen from view of fruit and vegetables and different from view of other key vegetarian food commodities. Vitamin B 12, vitamin D and long-chain n- 3 fatty acids are not contained in plant food. Bioavailability of iron from food can be lower in presence of phytic acid from whole grain products and pulses and fiber pulses, seeds, nuts, whole grains. In group of lacto ovo vegetarians narrow range of animal food consumption vs. non vegetarian or semi vegetarian groups were found the significantly reduced concentrations of vitamin B 12, vitamin D and iron with a greater incidence of deficient values 49 per cent vs. 13 and 15 per cent for vitamin B 12, 67 vs. 46 and 50 for vitamin D, 44 vs. 20 and 30 for iron.
