At 7:00am, his advance guard under General-Major Franz <b>Löpper</b> collided with Colonel Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet's 108th Line Infantry Demi-Brigade of Grouchy's division. Defending {{deep in the}} forest, the 108th held their ground at first. But, General-Major Lelio Spannochi sent a grenadier battalion in a flank attack and drove the French back. Kollowrat committed General-Major Bernhard Erasmus von Deroy's Bavarian brigade and a second grenadier battalion to keep the attack rolling.|$|E

At Neumarkt am Wallersee on 16 December, while leading the 48th Line Infantry and the 1st Chasseurs, Sahuc inflicted 500 casualties on the Austrians. At Frankenmarkt on the 17th, the Austrians suffered 2,650 casualties, mostly prisoners. At Schwanenstadt on the 18th, 700 enemy cuirassiers were trapped against a river and taken. That same day at Vöcklabruck, with Sahuc commanding the 48th Line and 14th Light Infantry plus the 1st and 20th Chasseurs, the French captured Austrian general Franz <b>Löpper,</b> two cannons, and many foot soldiers. On the 19th at Lambach, 1,450 troops of the Manfreddini Infantry Regiment No. 12 surrendered and 500 wagons were seized. At Lambach, Sahuc and Jacques Sarrut led the 14th Light and 27th Line Infantry, the 5th Hussars, and the 1st and 20th Chasseurs.|$|E

At the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800, the 2,234-strong 108th Line served in Emmanuel Grouchy's division of Moreau's army. As {{the head of}} Johann Kollowrat's Left Center Column advanced along the main highway from the east, they bumped into Marcognet's 108th Line at about 7:00 AM. He deployed his troops in line {{along the edge of}} a forest. Franz <b>Löpper,</b> who led the Austro-Bavarian advance guard, immediately ordered his 5,341 foot soldiers and 1,319 cavalrymen to attack. Showing tactical finesse, Marcognet repulsed the first attack by the Benjowski Infantry Regiment Nr. 31 {{with the help of the}} 4th Hussars and three cannons. Outnumbered two-to-one, he was holding his ground when enemy reinforcements arrived. Using a forest trail, Lelio Spannochi secretly posted the Sebottendorf Grenadier Battalion on the flank of the 108th Line and charged. Surprised, the French rapidly retreated leaving the wounded Marcognet to be captured.|$|E
50|$|The main {{distinction}} among <b>loppers</b> {{is between}} bypass and anvil types.

Pneumatic hand tools {{have been used}} for many decades. These tools help users accomplish tasks with much less effort than is required with manual tools. However, one significant drawback of pneumatic tools compared with manual hand tools is that the user is disconnected from the output forces the tool is creating. This has various safety and functionality issues. A pair of pneumatic powered <b>loppers</b> was developed to demonstrate the potential of force-multiplying, pneumatically powered hand tools with haptic control. A purely mechanical control system was tested and found to provide proportional feedback over the range of operating conditions. The work required to cut through different sizes of dowels and branches was also calculated and tested against the prototype to determine the amount of compressed air needed to operate the <b>loppers.</b> It was determined that the <b>loppers</b> could have an onboard, high pressure tank that could provide enough energy for average homeowner use. For commercial use a larger external tank would be required...|$|R

40|$|Pruning {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crop techniques that influences the longevity of the tree, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of crop production. Nowadays though, this crop technique results to be the main costs, second only to the harvesting of the fruits. Nowadays the tools that are used for pruning of olive trees are <b>loppers</b> (traditionally made out of wood, but currently made out of aluminum). For the cutting hand saws or pneumatic chainsaws are used. The pruning done in this matter results to be tiresome, due to the ladders transport up and down, together with various tools, and because of the problems related to the workers’ safety who have to work holding themselves in balance on unsteady ladders. In this paper the fine tuning of a movable platform specifically for agriculture is studied, to thereby facilitate the pruning of olive trees and harvesting of the fruits. The research had been realized in three different phases, the first regards the planning of the machine’s fine tuning, the second regards its certification according to the European laws CEE 89 / 392, in compliance with the decrees 91 / 368, 93 / 44 and 93 / 68 and finally the third phase regards the experimental tests that will be carried out, comparing the system with the traditional pruning system using <b>loppers...</b>|$|R

50|$|Arborists, orchardists, and gardeners use various {{garden tools}} and tree cutting tools {{designed}} for the purpose, such as hand pruners, <b>loppers,</b> or chainsaws. Additionally in forestry bush saws are commonly used and these are often attached to poles that reach up to 5-6m, {{this is a more}} efficient way of pruning than with ladders. These bush saws on polls have also been motorized as chainsaws which is even more efficient. Older technology used Billhooks, Kaiser blades and pruning knives. Although still used in some coppicing they are not used so much in commercial forestry due to the difficulty of cutting flush with the stem. Flush cuts lead to good wood, non-flush or bark damaging cuts (which are more likely with a swung blade than a sawed one) put the tree at risk of entry cords from forest pathogens.|$|R

25|$|After the {{armistice}} lapsed, the 596-strong 5th Hussars fought at the Battle of Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 {{as part of}} Richepanse's division. As the division made its flank march into the Austrian left-rear, a force of Austrian grenadiers attacked {{the center of the}} column, breaking it in two. General of Brigade Jean-Baptiste Drouet, leading the trailing half, sent the 5th Hussars supported by some infantry to push back the Austrians. While Drouet, General of Brigade Louis Michel Antoine Sahuc, and the 5th Hussars became embroiled in a struggle with the grenadiers, Richepanse directed his two leading regiments to swing left directly into the rear of Archduke John of Austria's army. This decisive blow demolished the Austro-Bavarian left-center column, winning the battle. Between 16 and 19 December, Richepanse led his division in several actions against the Austrian rear guards. The 5th Hussars fought at Neumarkt am Wallersee on the 16th where 7,000 French inflicted 500 casualties on Franz <b>Löpper's</b> 3,700 Austrians, at Frankenmarkt on the 17th where 6,000 French captured 2,650 out of 4,000 troops in Michael von Kienmayer's column, at Schwanenstadt on the 18th where 2,000 French cavalry attacked Johann Sigismund Riesch's Austrians and forced the surrender of 700 horsemen from the Lothringen Cuirassier Regiment Nr. 7, and at Lambach on the 19th where 5,000 French overran Daniel Meczery's 3,000-strong force and captured 1,450 men of the Manfredini Infantry Regiment Nr. 12.|$|R
40|$|For generations, {{the harvest}} of native flora and fauna by Māori was guided by tikanga. In the art of weaving, the {{sustainability}} of the culture was greatly dependant on the careful practice of harvest to ensure the maintenance of resources for future generations – also known as kaitiakitanga. One {{of the most important}} weaving materials was the kiekie (Freycinetia banksii). Under tikanga, the traditional method of harvest was to use a hand wrench. This method, it was argued, encouraged vigorous replenishment of the harvested stem, thus mediating human impacts on the resource. However, over the last decade it has arisen that a minority of harvesters may be adopting non-traditional techniques which involve the removal of the entire leaf head. Consequently, patches are slow to recover, and in some cases, the affected stems perish. Despite these observations, there is {{little in the way of}} quantitative data. As a result, Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa instigated this research to investigate harvesting practices and their impacts on kiekie. Over 1. 5 years, I tested whether traditional harvest was the most appropriate method by measuring how different harvesting techniques affected the recovery of harvested stems at two sites – one at Te Kotuku Whakaoka (Lake Brunner) on the west coast of the South Island, and the second in the Kaimai Ranges, west of Rotorua, in the North Island. Sixty stems at each site were treated with one of three different harvest regimes – a traditional hand wrench that removed approx. one-third of the stem tip biomass and was conducted over two different seasons ((1) spring and (2) autumn), and (3) a non-traditional harvest technique removing 100 % of the stem tip biomass with <b>loppers.</b> An additional investigation was conducted to evaluate the recovery of kiekie after goat browse. To simulate herbivory, 50 % of the total leaf area of the stem tip was removed from twenty of the sixty treatment stems. Results showed that the herbivory treatments significantly slowed new leaf production on the stems, when compared to controls. Overall, costs of harvest were higher for the non-traditional method than the traditional techniques. Nontraditionally harvested stems had a poorer recovery, with 20 % dying, and only 27 % of the remaining stems regenerating with an average of 1. 73 side shoots. In comparison, the two traditionally hand wrenched stems produced an average of 2. 35 (Spring Wrench) and 2. 55 (Autumn Wrench) side shoots. Findings also showed that traditionally hand wrenched stems are recovering back lost resources. One and a half years after harvest, the Spring Wrench shoots had recovered 70 % of the removed biomass (dry weight). Average leaf lengths of the three longest shoot leaves on all side shoots per wrench stem were at ~ 38 % of mature leaf size. One year after harvest Autumn Wrench shoots had recovered 2. 7 % of the removed biomass (dry weight) and shoot leaves were at ~ 19 % of mature leaf size. Consequently, both are capable of photosynthate synthesis and supply. Measurements did indicate however, that recovery may be sped up in the Autumn Wrench stems which produced more new shoot leaves on all side shoots than the Spring Wrench stems one year after harvest (32. 1 and 26. 9 shoot leaves respectively); although these results apply to a short research period and could be enhanced by a longer-term study. The findings validate the concerns of weavers regarding the negative impacts of non-traditional harvest on the sustainability of kiekie resources. Furthermore, there is support for tikanga regarding kiekie harvest. The regeneration of stocks shows that of all the harvest techniques investigated, the traditional modes of harvest are the most effective means of mediating the impacts of human harvest on kiekie...|$|R
