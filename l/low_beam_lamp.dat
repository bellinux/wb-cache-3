30|$|The use of {{daytime running}} lights (DRLs) {{increases}} fuel consumption which, in turn, increases emissions (e.g., [54]). However, DRL power consumption {{is affected by the}} actual DRL implementation. There is a large difference between using full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> and dedicated <b>lamps</b> (and especially so if the light sources for the dedicated lamps are LEDs). In addition, automatic switches can be used to turn off unnecessary lighting (e.g., rear lamps) when DRLs are energized.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that current low-beam headlamps do not provide adequate seeing distance for safety. One approach for remedying this situation might be to provide more total light from low-beam headlamps, leaving the relative distribution of light unchanged. Increasing the light output of low-beam lamps, in addition to providing more light for seeing, would also cause an increase in glare light for oncoming drivers. This {{raises the question of whether}} there would be a net benefit in seeing distance for all drivers if the light output of <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> was generally increased. We addressed this question in an empirical study in which we varied the intensity of headlamps between a value typical of current U. S. <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> and a level about 3. 8 times higher. We measured seeing distance as a function of headlamp intensity, always varying the intensity of the seeing light and glare light by the same proportion. Increasing intensity by a factor of about 3. 8 increased seeing distance by 17 %. This result is qualitatively consistent with earlier findings that seeing distance in a glare situation is longer when high beams oppose high <b>beams</b> than when <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> oppose <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b> It is also consistent with predictions from quantitative vision modeling using veiling luminance to represent the disabling effects of glare. The present findings suggest that, if objective visual performance is the only criterion, there is no clear upper limit to how intense low-beam headlamps should be. However, there may be a level at which people simply will not tolerate the subjectively discomforting effects of glare, or at which glare indirectly affects objective performance through its effects on subjective comfort. Because subjective discomfort, rather than objective visual performance, may be the limiting consideration for setting maximum glare levels, more research should be done to understand the nature and consequences of discomfort glare, including possible effects of subjective comfort on objective visual behavior...|$|R
40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} the effects of mounting height on discomfort glare from reduced-power high-beam headlamps used as automotive daytime running lamps. Of interest were the effects for mounting heights between 0. 864 m (34 in) and 1. 372 m (54 in) - the range in which full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> are currently allowed, but reduced-power high beams are not. Three analyses were performed. The first analysis involved estimating the illuminance reaching a preceding driver via rearview mirrors. The second analysis compared glare illuminance from reduced-power high beams with that from full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams.</b> The third analysis evaluated the expected changes in discomfort-glare ratings from reduced-power high beams as a function of increased mounting height. The analyses were based on photometric information from five high <b>beams</b> and 43 <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> from <b>lamps</b> manufactured for the United States market. They were performed for five following distances and three lateral offsets of the vehicles. The results indicate that allowing reduced-power high beams with mounting heights between 0. 864 m and 1. 372 m would not appreciably increase discomfort glare for preceding drivers as compared with (a) glare from reduced-power high beams at a mounting height of 0. 864 m, or with (b) glare from currently allowed full-power <b>low</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{report is}} an attempt to {{describe}} the effects on accidents of compulsory use of running lights - <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> or special <b>lamps</b> - during daylight in Sweden. The study is carried out on police reported traffic accidents with personal injury in Sweden. The before and after periods are two years before and two years after the operative day of the law, October 1 st 1977. The use of running lights in the before-period was roughly speaking 50 % and in the after-period over 95 %. The basic assumption is that the use of running lights in daylight influences multiple accidents in daylight and only those. The method used is to study the relation of daylight to darkness numbers of multiple accidents. The corresponding relation for single vehicle accidents is taken as control. The estimated total effect depends both on the subdivision of accident data and the method used for accidents with unprotected road users. The estimates vary from 6 to 13 % reduction - from the before-period to the after period - of multiple accidents during daylight or 450 to 1100 less police reported accidents with personal injury per year. The estimated effects are not significant on a 5 % level...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} daylight with 32 participants to determine whether left turning drivers’ gap acceptance in front of approaching motorcycles depends on the motorcycle’s forward lighting treatment. Five experimental lighting treatments including a modulated high beam headlamp, or the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> headlamp plus pairs of low-mounted auxiliary lamps, high-mounted auxiliary lamps, both high- and low-mounted auxiliary lamps, or low-mounted LED lamps were compared to a baseline treatment with only the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> headlamp illuminated. Participants viewed the approaching traffic stream (including the motorcycle) on an active roadway and indicated {{when it would be}} safe (and not safe) to initiate a left turn across the opposing lanes. Participants also shared their attention with a secondary visual distraction task that took their eyes off the forward roadway. Participants did not know {{that the purpose of the}} study was to measure their responses to approaching motorcycles. Based on participants’ indications of the last safe moment to turn, the mean temporal safety margin provided to the approaching motorcycle did not differ significantly between any of the experimental lighting treatments and the baseline treatment. However, having either low-mounted auxiliary lamps or modulated high <b>beam</b> <b>lamps</b> on the motorcycle significantly reduced the probability of obtaining a potentially unsafe short safety margin as compared to the baseline lighting treatment. Overall, the results suggest that enhancing the frontal conspicuity of motorcycles with lighting treatments beyond an illuminated <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> headlamp may be an effective countermeasure for daytime crashes involving right-of-way violations...|$|R

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the <b>low</b> <b>beam,</b> since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different <b>low</b> and high <b>beam</b> light distributions. The high beam is usually a rough copy of the <b>low</b> <b>beam,</b> shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the <b>low</b> <b>beam.</b> However, <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for high beam formation, which facilitates the optimization of both <b>low</b> and high <b>beams.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study had}} two {{objective}}s. The first, more general {{objective was to}} provide background information about the maximum rise time that should be allowed for highintensity discharge headlamps. The second, more specific objective was to evaluate whether SAE’s current, rather stringent, recommendations should be relaxed or retained. To achieve these objectives, we considered several scenarios in which having early illumination is potentially of consequence. The scenarios included turning on the headlamps when starting to drive, turning on the headlamps when entering a dark tunnel, and switching between beams. New empirical data collected for this study included actual delays between turning on headlamps at night and starting to drive, and rise and falloff functions of tungsten-halogen <b>low</b> <b>beams</b> and high beams.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} European {{method of}} achieving <b>low</b> and high <b>beam</b> {{from a single}} bulb involves two filaments along the axis of the reflector. The high beam filament is on the focal point, while the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> filament is approximately 1cm forward of the focal point and 3mm above the axis. Below the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> filament is a cup-shaped shield (called a [...] "Graves Shield") spanning an arc of 165°. When the <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> filament is illuminated, this shield casts a shadow on the corresponding lower area of the reflector, blocking downward light rays that would otherwise strike the reflector and be cast above the horizon. The bulb is rotated (or [...] "clocked") within the headlamp to position the Graves Shield so as to allow light to strike a 15° wedge of {{the lower half of}} the reflector. This is used to create the upsweep or upstep characteristic of ECE <b>low</b> <b>beam</b> light distributions. The bulb's rotative position within the reflector depends on the type of beam pattern to be produced and the traffic directionality of the market for which the headlamp is intended.|$|R
