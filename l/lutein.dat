25|$|In AREDS2, {{participants}} {{took one}} of four AREDS formulations: the original AREDS formulation, AREDS formulation with no beta-carotene, AREDS with low zinc, AREDS with no beta-carotene and low zinc. In addition, they {{took one of}} four additional supplement or combinations including <b>lutein</b> and zeaxanthin (10mg and 2mg), omega-3 fatty acids (1,000mg), lutein/zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids, or placebo. The study reported {{that there was no}} overall additional benefit from adding omega-3 fatty acids or <b>lutein</b> and zeaxanthin to the formulation. However, the study did find benefits in two subgroups of participants: those not given beta-carotene, and those who had little <b>lutein</b> and zeaxanthin in their diets. Removing beta-carotene did not curb the formulation's protective effect against developing advanced AMD, which was important given that high doses of beta-carotene had been linked to higher risk of lung cancers in smokers. It was recommended to replace beta-carotene with <b>lutein</b> and zeaxanthin in future formulations for these reasons.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the major}} light {{harvesting}} complexes of diatoms, called FCPs (fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c binding proteins), {{are related to}} the cab proteins of higher plants, the structures of these light harvesting protein complexes are much less characterized. Here, a structural/functional model for the “core” of FCP, based on the sequence homology with LHCII, in which two fucoxanthins replace the central <b>luteins</b> and act as quenchers of the Chl a triplet states, is proposed. Combining the information obtained by time-resolved EPR spectroscopy on the triplet states populated under illumination, with quantum mechanical calculations, we discuss the chlorophyll triplet quenching in terms of the geometry of the chlorophyll–carotenoid pairs participating to the process. The results show that local structural rearrangements occur in FCP, with respect to LHCII, in the photoprotective site...|$|R
40|$|Singlet energy {{transfer}} between the carotenoids (Cars) and chlorophylls (Chls) in the light-harvesting complex II (LHC II) from higher plants {{has been studied}} using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy by exciting the Cars directly in the 475 - 515 nm wavelength range. LHC II trimers from Arabidopsis thaliana with well-defined Car compositions have been used. From HPLC, the wild type (WT) monomer contains two <b>luteins</b> (Ls), one neoxanthin (N), and a trace of violaxanthin (V) per 12 Chls. The ABA- 3 mutant contains 1. 4 Ls and 0. 6 zeaxanthin (Z) per monomer. Though exploitation {{of the difference in}} Car constitution and exciting the WT at 475 and 490 nm, and the ABA- 3 mutant at 490 and 515 nm, the different Car contributions to {{energy transfer}} have been probed. Evidence for energy transfer mainly from the Car to Chl b is observed in the WT. In the mutant, additional transfer from Car to Chl a correlates with the presence of Z. The results imply predominant energy transfer from the central Ls to Chl b which requires a modification of the currently accepted arrangement of Chl pigments in LHC II...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{optically}} detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) and {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) spectroscopic study on the quenching of photo-induced chlorophyll triplet states by carotenoids, in the intrinsic light-harvesting complex (LHC) from the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae. Two carotenoid triplet states, differing in terms of optical and magnetic spectroscopic properties, have been identified and assigned to peridinins located in different protein environment. The results reveal a parallelism with the triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET) process involving chlorophyll a and <b>luteins</b> observed in the LHC-II complex of higher plants. Starting from the hypothesis of a conserved alignment of the amino acid sequences at the cores of the LHC and LHC-II proteins, the spin-polarized time-resolved EPR spectra of the carotenoid triplet states of LHC have been calculated by a method which exploits the conservation of the spin momentum during the TTET process. The analysis of the spectra shows that the data are compatible with a structural model of the core of LHC which assigns the photo-protective function to two central carotenoids surrounded {{by the majority of}} Chl a molecules present in the protein, as found in LHC-II. However, the lack of structural data, and the uncertainty in the pigment composition of LHC, leaves open the possibility that this complex posses a different arrangement of the pigments with specific centers of Chl triplet quenching. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLinear optical {{spectra of}} solubilized trimers and small {{lamellar}} aggregates {{of the major}} light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) of higher plants are simulated employing excitonic couplings and site energies of chlorophylls (Chls) computed {{on the basis of}} the two crystal structures by a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic approach. A good agreement between simulation and experiment is achieved (except for the circular dichroism in the Chl b region), if vibronic transitions of Chls are taken into account. Site energies are further optimized by refinement fits of optical spectra. The differences between refined and directly calculated values are not significant enough to decide, whether the crystal structures are closer to trimers or aggregates. Changes in the linear dichroism spectrum upon aggregation are related to site energy shifts of Chls b 601, b 607, a 603, a 610, and a 613, and are interpreted in terms of conformational changes of violaxanthin and the two <b>luteins</b> involving their ionone rings. Chl a 610 is the energy sink at 77 K in both conformations. An analysis of absorption spectra of trimers perpendicular and parallel to the C 3 -axis (van Amerongen et al. Biophys. J. 67 (1994) 837 – 847) shows that only Chl a 604 close to neoxanthin is significantly reoriented in trimers compared to the crystal structures. Whether this pigment is orientated in aggregates as in the crystal structures, can presently not be determined faithfully. To finally decide about pigment reorientations that could be of relevance for non-photochemical quenching, further polarized absorption and fluorescence measurements of aggregates or detergent-depleted LHCII would be helpful.
