40|$|Abstract: Lubrication {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the wear and friction of metal-on-metal bear-ings for artificial hip joints. It is generally known that both load and speed can influence the lubrication mechanism. This is particularly important in hip implants, which experience many intermittent start-ups and stops, which may adversely affect the lubrication and increase wear inmetal-on-metal hip implants. The effect of start-up and gait initiation upon elastohydro-dynamic lubrication (EHL) in a typical metal-on-metal hip implant has been investigated in the present study. A simple ball-on-plane model was used for a full transient EHL analysis under assumed start-up conditions represented by linear variations in both load and speed, but with different development time periods. It was shown that the duration of the start-up period had little effect on the predicted <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> during either the start-up or the steady cyclic conditions. It was found that only two to three steps were required to estab-lish a continuous steady cyclic variation of the predicted lubricant film thickness.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} motion of {{droplets}} in a confined, micrometric geometry, {{by focusing on the}} lubrication film between droplet and wall. When capillary forces dominate, the <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> evolves non linearly with the capillary number due to viscous dissipation between meniscus and wall. However, this film may become thin enough (tens of nanometers) that intermolecular forces come into play and affect classical scalings. Our experiments yield highly resolved topographies of the shape of the interface and allow us to bring new insights into droplet dynamics in microfluidics. We report the novel characterization of two dynamical regimes as the capillary number increases: (i) at low capillary numbers, the film thickness is constant and set by the disjoinging pressure, while (ii) above a critical capillary number, the interface behavior is well described by a viscous scenario. At a high surfactant concentration, structural effects lead to the formation of patterns on the interface, which can be used to trace the interface velocity that yield direct confirmation of boundary condition in viscous regime. The dynamics of a droplet confined between solid walls and pushed by a surrounding liquid is an old problem, however recent theories are still being developed to describe unexplored regimes and experimental characterizations are still lacking to shed light on these novel developments. A complete understanding of the droplet velocity calls for accurate knowledge of the dissipation mechanisms involved, particularly in the lubrication film. Our understanding of the lubrication properties of menisci travelling in confined geometries has been steadily refined since the pioneering work of Taylor & Saffman [1]. Notably, the influence of the lubrication film left along the wall by the moving meniscus was first taken into account by Bretherton, who investigated {{the motion of}} an inviscid bubble in a cylindrical tube [2]. Far from the meniscus, this dynamical film reaches a uniform thickness h ∞, related to the bubble velocity through the capillary number Ca = µ f U d /γ, where U d is the bubble velocity, µ f the viscosity of the continuous phase, and γ the surface tension. When the capillary pressure dominates over the viscous stress, i. e. in the regime where Ca 1, the thickness of the film follows h Breth = 1. 34 r Ca 2 / 3, where r is the radius of the capillary tube. Besides bubbles, the case of viscous droplets remains however largely unexplored. A recent theoretical advance in the field by Hodges et al. [3] shows by numerical calculations of the whole flow pattern that significant corrections in the thickness of lubrication films can arise at very low Ca. Furthermore, the regime of the Bretherton theory is only valid for lubrication films thicker than the molecular sizes or than the range of interfacial interactions. The typical velocities and lengthscales involved in droplet-based microfluidics would lead to lubrication films h ∞ ∼...|$|E

Their sensory perception during use is dependent on their behaviour in very thin film conditions at high shear rates. In order to better understand their behaviour in thin films, we have formulated two kinds of solution which are typically present in real systems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the physical processes which determine friction and lubrication in metal rolling in the mixed lubrication regime, with particular attention paid to the conditions encountered when rolling aluminium foil. Two areas of relevance to the analysis of the rolling process are initially investigated. Firstly, the rheological properties of a typical aluminium foil rolling oil at high pressures and shear rates have been measured using a disc machine. The behaviour of the oil was found to be well described by the Eyring viscous model, at the shear rates and pressure likely to be found in metal rolling. Secondly, the deformation of asperities when the bulk material is deforming has been examined. The theory developed here was found to agree reasonably with experiments. The results of these investigations are used in the analysis of lubrication in metal rolling, considering the hydrodynamic buildup of oil pressure in the entry region and the crushing of the asperities both in the entry region and {{at the beginning of the}} work zone. The contact between roll and strip is divided into two regions, that under the asperities and that in the intervening valleys. Calculations for conditions appropriate to strip and foil rolling give the proportion of the two types of contact and the <b>film</b> <b>thicknesses</b> in each region. Measurements of <b>film</b> <b>thicknesses</b> with an experimental mill in a regime where roughness is unimportant were not found to agree well with an existing simple theory of lubrication. This was ascribed to uneven lubrication in the experiments. After taking this into account, the experiments in a regime where roughness was important were found to agree reasonably with the theory developed here. The effect of roughness on traction is measured in a disc machine with elastic contacts. Its behaviour is found to be determined by the bulk properties of the lubricant at the pressures and strain rates under the asperities. Theory and experiments presented in this dissertation lead to a greater understanding of the physical processes determining friction in metal rolling in the mixed <b>lubrication</b> regime. <b>Film</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and friction coefficients (in metal rolling) may now be estimated with more confidence...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decades, many {{technological}} breakthroughs {{have been made}} by both automobile and lubricant manufacturers to reduce friction and wear in engines in order to decrease pollution, extend the lifetime of engines and improve their performance. One of the key parameters controlling the <b>lubrication</b> is the <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> which must be optimal to fulfil its role. Indeed, the fluid film must not be too thick to avoid viscous friction and not too thin to ensure a sufficient thickness to separate the moving surfaces. The prediction of the <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> in EHD contacts is thus of main interest. The objective of this research is to provide an accurate knowledge of the thickness of the lubricant film under severe conditions of temperature, pressure and shear stress. <b>Film</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are measured and compared with both analytical and numerical solutions in which rheological models are implemented. The present work focuses on the tribological study of simplified automotive lubricants. A base oil and three polymers (with different physico-chemistries and conformations) mixed in solutions are characterized. Central and minimal <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> measurements are run on a ball-on-disc tribometer. The principle of the method is based on white light optical interferometry. Then, experiments are compared with Hamrock-Dowson analytical models and a finite element numerical solver that features, in a full-system approach, the coupled resolution of the EHL equations and the physical characteristics of the fluid (compressibility and rheology). The Newtonian predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data for the base oil and one of the polymer solutions. However, the comparisons witness a deviation between the Newtonian solution and the non-Newtonian case for the two others polymer solutions. The overestimation of the real <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> considering a Newtonian fluid reveals the importance of using a reliable rheological characterization under extreme conditions. The rheology is thereby, sharply influencing the film-forming capacity. Since the physico-chemistry of lubricants is strongly correlated to rheology, by extension the tribology is thus linked to the molecular scale.

The ring samples were machined to achieve an elliptic contact in order to increase the contact pressure and achieve fast results. The contact pressure was calculated according to the Hertzian formula taking in account the shape parameters of the rings. The tests were performed with higher or lower amount of cycles depending on the previous results (cracks found or not) and for different contact pressures. The contact area was SEM inspected after each test. Friction and wear plots were used as fatigue criteria complementarily to the SEM analysis. The tests conditions (shape, roughness, friction coefficient) were studied and appeared to cause a scatter in the results because of their variation from one sample to another affecting the stress distribution, type of damage and the <b>lubrication</b> regime (<b>film</b> <b>thickness).</b> Therefore, the stress distribution was simulated under the elliptic contact surface taking in account, these parameters (shape parameters, roughness, friction coefficient). The tests showed that the twin disk testing method was useful for pitting detection in RCF under lubrication.

That is, the thinner the lubricating film is, the more obvious the effect of couple stress is. For larger characteristic length, materials parameter, and load, the central pressure, central <b>film</b> <b>thickness,</b> and rigid separation are larger than those of smaller characteristic length under the same load. The time needed to achieve maximum central pressure and the Hertzian pressure increases with increasing characteristic length...|$|R

It {{is very hard to}} obtain transient elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) solution of spur gears. In this study, a transient EHL model of involute spur gear tooth contacts is proposed. A full transient EHL solution of involute spur gear under impact load is obtained by utilizing the multigrid technique. The influences of impact load on the EHL of spur gear are analyzed in the paper. The numerical results show that the approach impact load has strong transient influence on the oil <b>film</b> <b>thickness</b> and pressure distribution between contact zones. The impact load may lead to instantaneous <b>lubrication</b> <b>film</b> deterioration between contact teeth of involute spur gears...|$|R
