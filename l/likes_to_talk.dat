25|$|Faustine: One {{could say}} she is the most {{ambiguous}} character in the novel or that the fugitive misjudged her the most. She looks like a Gypsy, speaks French like a South American and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Canada. She is inspired by silent film star Louise Brooks.|$|E
25|$|Bessie Busybody (played by Julie Westwood) is {{an adult}} resident. Although patronizing, she tries {{her best to}} be motherly with the children. She is aware of every new trend and is pompous but fashionable. She <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{on her cell phone}} and is {{sometimes}} so engaged in a phone call that she is oblivious to the events occurring around her.|$|E
2500|$|Yale's Michael Coe <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about what}} he calls [...] "the fallacy of {{misplaced}} concreteness," [...] the tendency among Mormon theorists like Sorenson to keep the discussion trained on all sorts of extraneous subtopics ... while avoiding what is most obvious: that Joseph Smith probably meant [...] "horse" [...] when he wrote down the word [...] "horse".|$|E
30|$|I can {{understand}} why students don’t {{want to be called}} on personally, and I'm pretty uncomfortable calling students by name in a class environment. But I think it’s important because unless I am calling on everyone, the conversation usually degrades to two or three people who <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me or <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the class. So getting multiple people talking in the class is an essential goal for me and right now that's one of my best tools to accomplish that.|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTA. Asher, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with Minnie, if {{you don't}} mind.|$|R
60|$|Of course. There are one or {{two things}} I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about.|$|R
2500|$|In series 2, Ullman {{portrays a}} very bitter Germaine Greer. Greer, who {{in recent years}} has come under fire for her {{controversial}} transgender views, complains about being silenced by the media to anyone who will listen in the series. [...] "I think Germaine Greer has become intellectually homeless, so I play her at a bus stop looking homeless. [...] she was this great sex symbol and she <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about s****ing Martin Amis in the 60s, but what's she done recently? She's constantly blaming old age: 'You try being old! It's the biggest sin of all.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the final}} presidential debate, McCain and {{his running mate}} Sarah Palin {{frequently}} repeated the charge in campaign speeches that [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] would pay higher taxes under Obama and Biden's plan, although according to tax analysts neither Wurzelbacher nor the company he works for would actually be subject to higher taxes under Obama's tax plan. Obama's [...] "spread the wealth around" [...] quote was later used by the McCain campaign, comparing the Democratic policies to socialism. McCain said, [...] " [...] wants government to take Joe's money {{and give it to}} somebody else." [...] Obama said in a campaign rally on October 24 that McCain was [...] "not fighting for Joe the Plumber. He's fighting for Joe the Hedge Fund Manager... He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Joe the Plumber but he's in cahoots with Joe the CEO." [...] Obama then promoted a plan for middle-class tax cuts and [...] "asked for a show of hands at the rally in the Richmond Coliseum from those making less than $250,000. Nearly all of the 13,000 people raised their hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I couldn't induce him," [...] said Mrs. Miller very gently. [...] "He {{wants to}} talk to the waiter. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to that waiter." ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE (gazing at him; after a moment). Sure! I guess I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.|$|R
6000|$|On {{returning}} to the waiting-room, he addressed a characteristic question to the assembled visitors. [...] "More humbug?" [...] asked the gentleman who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a pretty woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{be able to}} {{ride and}} take care of myself in a day or two," [...] went on Duane. [...] "Then I'll go--I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about Jennie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A grim, ugly-looking old wretch as ever I saw," [...] muttered Aunt Keziah. [...] "Well, {{he shall}} have his dinner; {{and if he}} <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about yarb-dishes, I'm with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{just one}} of those {{thoughtful}} chaps with plenty of gas, that Elisabeth <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to," [...] he complained. [...] "Never mind, it's got to be put up with, I suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{ask him to}} tell {{me about}} his detective work, an' you can bet he won't lose such a chance, 'cause there's nothin' in this world he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about as well as himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They drink, {{and they}} don't mind as they should." [...] Captain Marshall turned to Phil. [...] "After breakfast, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you on {{business}} in the cabin," [...] he added.|$|R
50|$|He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{about other}} things: {{community}} values, {{taking care of}} kids, what democracy needs to work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes when I hain't busy, I {{drop into}} the state library at the capital and enjoy myself. It's <b>like</b> goin' <b>to</b> another world without any folks to bother you. Er--er--there's books I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about--sometime." ...|$|R
60|$|Finch is a leathern, sallow, slow-footed man, between {{twenty and}} forty. You {{would say he}} had been brought up a bushelman in Essex Street. When {{business}} is slack he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> so I had my hat cleaned even oftener than it deserved, hoping Finch might let me {{into some of the}} secrets of the sweatshops.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I {{thought you}} knew it," [...] he {{explained}} easily. [...] "She likes to read, and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> but it bores her to write. I don't suppose I get {{more than two or}} three pencil scratches from her in the course of a year. She makes the girls write. But you needn't mind her not writing. You may be sure she's glad of your letters." ...|$|E
6000|$|If he {{says that}} things cannot degrade, that is, change {{downwards}} into lower forms, ask him, who told him that water-babies were lower than land-babies? But even if they were, does he know about the strange degradation of the common goose-barnacles, which one finds sticking on ships' bottoms; or the still stranger degradation of some cousins of theirs, of which one hardly <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> so shocking and ugly it is? ...|$|E

60|$|HILLMAN (glancing at DR. JONATHAN). There's {{a matter}} we'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> over with you, Mr. Pindar, {{as soon as}} convenient.|$|R
6000|$|... "A little amateurish," [...] {{said the}} Curate from Iping Hanger to Mr Rathbone-Slater. [...] "A great gift, undoubtedly, but a certain lack of {{sustained}} training. There were {{one or two}} little things ... I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
60|$|That evening, when I {{was quite}} cooled down, and we {{was talking to}} Mr. Poplington about the hay-making and the free-and-easy way in which {{everybody}} came together, {{he was a good}} deal surprised that we should think that there was anything uncommon in that, coming from a country where everybody was free and equal. Jone was smoking his pipe, and when it draws well and he's had a good dinner and I haven't anything particular to say, he often <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> slow and preach little sermons.|$|E
6000|$|... "You use {{the proper}} term, sir. Mr. Hall thinks Mike has no {{personal}} hatred of Moore. Mike says he even <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to him and}} run after him, {{but he has a}} hankering that Moore should be made an example of. He was extolling him to Mr. Hall the other day as the mill-owner with the most brains in Yorkshire, and for that reason he affirms Moore should be chosen as a sacrifice, an oblation of a sweet savour. Is Mike Hartley in his right mind, do you think, sir?" [...] inquired Sweeting simply.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I {{can talk}} with him on matters which of course have special {{interest}} for me, for somehow I find that I scarcely ever read or think on any points which do not concern directly my work as clergyman or language-monger. It is very seldom that I touch a book {{which is not a}} commentary on the Bible or a theological treatise, scarcely ever, and of course one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about those things of which one's mind is full. That made the talks with the Judge so delightful. Now young people, of course, have their heads full (as I used to have mine) of other things, and so my talk would be dull and heavy to them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you don't}} mind, Mrs Clinton, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your doctor alone about the case. You can {{wait in the}} next room.' ...|$|R
60|$|Foster <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{strangers and}} as the girl had not rebuffed him, he took her cloak, which looked very wet, from the rack.|$|R
6000|$|Kipps {{spoke of}} his respect for Miss Walshingham and her {{freckled}} friend. He contrived not to look too self-conscious. [...] "You know, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> people <b>like</b> that, but I can't. A chap's afraid of giving himself away." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never learned}} {{the truth of}} the cause of the Pleasant Valley War, or if I did hear it I had no means of {{recognizing}} it. All the given causes were plausible and convincing. Strange to state, there is still secrecy and reticence all over the Tonto Basin as to the facts of this feud. Many descendents of those killed are living there now. But no one <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it. Assuredly many of the incidents told me really occurred, as, for example, the terrible one of the two women, in the face of relentless enemies, saving the bodies of their dead husbands from being devoured by wild hogs. Suffice it to say that this romance is true to my conception of the war, and I base it upon the setting I learned to know and love so well, upon the strange passions of primitive people, and upon my instinctive reaction to the facts and rumors that I gathered.|$|E
6000|$|The {{landlord}} {{rolled his}} cigar round in his tubed lips. [...] "I guess he's used to ridin' {{after a good}} hoss." [...] He added gravely to the clerk, [...] "You don't want to make very free with that man, Mr. Pane. He won't stan' it, and he's a class of custom {{that you want to}} cata to when it comes in your way. I suspicioned what he was when they came here and took the highest cost rooms without tu'nin' a haia. They're a class of custom that you won't get outside the big hotels in the big reso'ts. Yes, sir," [...] said the landlord taking a fresh start, [...] "they're them kind of folks that live the whole yea' round in hotels; no'th in summa, south in winta, and city hotels between times. They want the best their money can buy, and they got plenty of it. She"--he meant Mrs. Lander--"has been tellin' my wife how they do; she <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> a little betta than he doos; and I guess when it comes to society, they're away up, and they won't stun' any nonsense." ...|$|E
60|$|To the {{employment}} thus secured {{for the poor}} in the mines and fisheries is to be added, as an advantage, the cheapness of rent and living in Cornwall. Good cottages are let at from fifty shillings, to between three and four pounds a-year--turf for firing grows in plenty on the vast tracts of common land overspreading the country--all sorts of vegetables are abundant and cheap, {{with the exception of}} potatoes, which so decreased in 1849, in consequence of the disease, that the winter stock was imported from France, Belgium, and Holland. The early potatoes, however, grown in May and June, are cultivated in large quantities, and realize on exportation a very high price. Corn generally sells a little above the average. Fish is always within the reach of the poorest people. In a good season, a dozen pilchards are sold for one penny. Happily for themselves, the poor in Cornwall do not partake the senseless prejudice against fish, so obstinately adhered to by the poor in many other parts of England. A Cornishman's national pride is in his pilchards--he <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of them, and boast about them to strangers; and with reason, for he depends for the main support of life on the tribute of these little fish which the sea yields annually in almost countless shoals.|$|E
6000|$|The {{tears came}} to the girl's eyes. [...] "I do believe you know best, Mary," [...] she said, in a distressed voice. [...] "Oh, please don't think that I am cross. I am so glad you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wouldn't you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{him some}} more?" [...] I suggested; [...] "I {{can see you}} any time about this little {{business}} of ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{you for a}} few moments," [...] {{she said}} quietly. [...] "Afterwards will you come on to the terrace?" ...|$|R
