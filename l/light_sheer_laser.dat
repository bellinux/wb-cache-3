6000|$|I WONDER, can {{the night}} go by; Can this shot arrow of travel fly Shaft-golden with <b>light,</b> <b>sheer</b> {{into the sky}} [...] Of a dawned to-morrow, Without ever sleep {{delivering}} us From each other, or loosing the dolorous [...] Unfruitful sorrow! ...|$|R
50|$|In the foreground, {{there is}} a boat, {{floating}} down the Avon River, right outside Bristol. There is a second boat, further down the river, nearer to {{the action of the}} painting. The dark, rocky cliffs on the left are juxtaposed with the <b>light,</b> <b>sheer</b> cliffs on the right, creating a deep contrast for the center, where the river runs through. The subject of the painting, not in the foreground, is a chunk of limestone being blown off the cliff face, in preparation for the construction of the Clifton Suspension Bridge.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2009 he curated a mini festival called Fresh Air which {{profiled}} [...] "his {{selection of}} the most exciting and experimental sound makers working today. The aim is to bring to <b>light</b> the <b>sheer</b> diversity and calibre of music being made on these shores, and to bring new music, live or recorded, to air".|$|R
60|$|But Thimble, {{though he}} had worsted the leopards, hadn't much liking or stomach for nights as wild as this. Thumb's nightmares were sweet peace to it. All {{the next day he}} wandered about, not heeding whither his {{footsteps}} led him. And so it came about that just before evening he stumbled upon the very same valley he had left in his sulks the morning before. There, indeed, sat Nod, fast asleep in the evening <b>light</b> for <b>sheer</b> weariness of watching for his brothers, who, some faint hope had told him, would return.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Light</b> {{penetrable}} <b>sheer</b> fabrics include voile, muslin, and lace. These can be broadly {{divided into}} two groups based on method of production. [...] The first are the natural fibers such as cotton and silk. The second group is prepared from a man-made fiber. This kind of synthetic sheer is extracted from raw material such as wood pulp or petroleum. They are robust and sturdy yet still delicate looking and tend to take dye well. They are often used as window dressing as they fall into soft folds that are appropriate for scarf swags.|$|R
5000|$|Lovell-Smith can be {{understood}} as part of a movement of New Zealand artists in the 1930s, including Olivia Spencer-Bower, Rita Angus, and Alfred Cook, whom art writers A.R.D Fiarburn, James Shelley and '"Conrad" [...] recognised as providing a [...] "new manner" [...] of painting better representing New Zealand and its light. This included the removal of romantic or golden mist and soft warm colour, and a move towards clear hard <b>light,</b> and displaying <b>sheer,</b> sharp, more linear forms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tour was}} praised by music critics and concertgoers. Katherine Feeny (Brisbane Times) gave the pop singer's {{concert at the}} QPAC Concert Hall {{four out of five}} stars. She says, [...] "It's just one of example of her ability to endear herself to the room, an ability {{testament}} to her skill and experience. So too is Lauper's lack of need for showy stage and <b>lighting.</b> The <b>sheer</b> scale and gutsy thrust of her vocal range coupled with a dynamic presence more than fills the stage". Michael Dwyer (The Sydney Morning Herald) gave the singer three and a half out of five stars. He writes, [...] "Maybe the subtleties between thought and expression are redundant when a Broadway dynamo in a leather pantsuit is prowling the theatre, standing on chairs and bellowing that 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun'. But when she hit the right blend of power and soul - such as with Robert Johnson's Cross Roads Blues - Lauper channelled something more profound".|$|R
5000|$|This leg {{incorporated}} a very elaborate visual display, incorporating a screen behind the stage, light columns, geometric light monitors, {{a grid of}} overhead <b>lights,</b> and a <b>sheer</b> silver screen that would drop {{in front of the}} stage. Each show began with the screen dropped {{down in front of the}} stage and would be raised as the second song in the set began. It would drop down again halfway through the set for [...] "Eraser", [...] "Right Where It Belongs", and [...] "Beside You in Time", with film footage projected onto the screen for the former two songs.|$|R
30|$|The cloud {{resource}} {{providers are}} not the only parties that experience detrimental economic effects from CCS downtime. CCS resource consumers lose money each minute that their website or IT infrastructure is down. According to InformationWeek, IT downtime costs $ 26.5 billion in lost revenue per year [48]. Thus, there is a mutual interest in making CCS availability and resilience approach 100 %. This is in addition to other cloud computing consequences that could arise including data loss and data security. In order to retain its customer base, CCS providers must be highly aware of the consequences of downtime as well as pro-actively pursuing increased reliability by continually re-evaluating their infrastructure to provide highly available and reliable service. This is especially important in <b>light</b> of the <b>sheer</b> number of CCS failures and issues showcased on the IWGCR website [1].|$|R
6000|$|... "Cads! Do not thus take {{advantage}} of your numbers. Cads!" [...] Having thus defended what in his calmer moments he would have known to be the wrong, he awaited his own fate calmly. But in the hubbub his words had passed unnoticed. [...] "It is in moments like these," [...] he thought, [...] "that the great speaker asserts his supremacy, quells the storm, and secures himself a hearing." [...] And he began to rack his brains to remember how they did it. [...] "It must require the voice of an ox," [...] he thought, [...] "and the skin of an alligator. Alas! How deficient I am in public qualities!" [...] But his self-depreciation was here cut off with the electric <b>light.</b> At this <b>sheer</b> intervention of Providence Mr. Lavender, listening to the disentangling sounds which rose in the black room, became aware {{that he had a}} chance such as he had not yet had of being heard.|$|R
40|$|Our group {{conducted}} {{work during}} the Summer of 2012 assembling and developing JPL's Starshades Project under the Technology Development for Exoplanet Missions(TDEM) initiative created by NASA, specifically TDEM stage 2. The goal of the work conducted at JPL by our group was to construct four occultor petals, the main optical components of the Starshade, {{for the analysis of}} joint deployment characteristics and of mechanical strain. A Starshade is an optical structure measuring approximately 30 meters in diameter that uses the effects of <b>light</b> diffraction off <b>sheer</b> edges, <b>light</b> scattering, and negative interference between waves to negate all on-axis light in a telescope's image, providing very high contrast that allows planets orbiting a target star to be observed. We completed our engineering goals in the time span of 10 weeks, during which the assembly processes of manufacture, alignment, and structural bonding took place. The Starshade technology and construction process is further discussed in the body of this paper...|$|R
60|$|The gondola {{continued}} its noiseless course, with the sprite-like movement peculiar to that description of boat. Gino, who, as superior over his fellow, stood {{perched on the}} little arched deck in the stern, pushed his oar with accustomed readiness and skill, now causing the <b>light</b> vessel to <b>sheer</b> to the right, and now to the left, as it glided among the multitude of craft, of all sizes and uses, which it met in its passage. Palace after palace had been passed, {{and more than one}} of the principal canals, which diverged towards the different spectacles, or the other places of resort frequented by his master, was left behind, without Don Camillo giving any new direction. At length the boat arrived opposite to a building which seemed to excite more than common expectation. Giorgio worked his oar with a single hand, looking over his shoulder at Gino, and Gino permitted his blade fairly to trail on the water. Both seemed to await new orders, manifesting something like that species of instinctive sympathy with him they served, which a long practised horse is apt to show when he draws near a gate that is seldom passed unvisited by his driver.|$|R
5000|$|Daxiushan (大袖衫), {{translated}} as [...] "Large Sleeve Gown", {{is a traditional}} Chinese attire for women and was most popular during the Tang Dynasty amongst the Royals. After {{the golden age of}} the Tang Dynasty ended, the influence of Hufu (胡服), or clothing styles from Central and Western Asia, gradually weakened and Tang royal women's clothing styles begin to take its transformation. It was not until the Mid-Late Tang period (中晚唐时期) that the distinctions between Royal women's clothing and other styles became increasingly obvious. The width increased more than four feet and its sleeves are often wider than 1.3 metres. It features distinctive gown that covers the body from the ground to just above the chest with a knot wrapped around the waist, a <b>light</b> and sometimes <b>sheer</b> outer coat that ties together at the bottom and often goes along with a long scarf draped around the arms. The clothing often only covers half of women's breast and so it is restricted to women of a certain status, such as princesses or gējī. It {{has come to be known}} as Da-Xiu-Shan but has also been called Dian-Chai-Li-Yi (钿钗礼衣) at various times. The clothing was mainly worn for special ceremonial occasions and have different variations, mainly the result of different collar formations (e.g., parallel or cross collar or those with no collar).|$|R
40|$|Sea-finding {{behavior}} in sea turtle hatchlings is modified by the visual cues provided by artificial beach front lighting. The consequent landward movement of hatchlings {{in response to}} coastal electric lighting reduces their survival rates. We assessed {{the potential impact of}} coastal lighting at Rushikulya, an important mass nesting site of the olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) in the Indian Ocean region. We examined the response of hatchlings to light characteristics in an experimental setup, {{as well as to the}} existing lighting regimes along the beach, using arena trials. Previous studies on other species indicate preferential orientation towards low wavelength and high intensity light. Our study confirms these preferences among hatchlings from the Indian Ocean population of olive ridleys. In addition we also found that wavelength and intensity could have an interactive effect upon hatchling orientation. Hatchlings at the study site respond both to visible point sources of <b>light</b> and to <b>sheer</b> glows of <b>light.</b> Though beach plantations of introduced Casuarina equisetifolia are generally considered to have negative impacts on sea turtle nesting beaches, we found that they acted as an effective light barrier when planted about 50 m away from the high tide line. We developed a model of the expected impact of artificial lighting on hatchling orientation during mass hatching events of previous years, and predict as much as 50 % misorientation in some years. We also developed a map representing the misorientation of hatchlings due to artificial lighting based on arena trials in different regions of the beach. The results of the study helped identify focal areas for light management on the beach, which could be critical for the survival of this population...|$|R
40|$|Land use {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the climate system (Feddema et al., 2005). Many ecosystem processes are directly or indirectly climate driven, and together with human driven land use changes, they determine how the land surface will evolve through time. To assess the effects of land cover changes on the climate system, models are required which are capable of simulating interactions between the involved components of the Earth system (land, atmosphere, ocean, and carbon cycle). Since driving forces for global environmental change differ among regions, a geographically (spatially) explicit modeling approach is called for, so that it can be incorporated in global and regional (climate and/or biophysical) change models in order to enhance our understanding of the underlying processes and thus improving future projections. Integrated records of the co-evolving human-environment system over millennia are needed to provide a basis for a deeper understanding of the present and for forecasting the future. This requires the major task of assembling and integrating regional and global historical, archaeological, and paleo-environmental records. Humans cannot predict the future. But, if we can adequately understand the past, we can use that understanding to influence our decisions and to create a better, more sustainable and desirable future. Some researchers suggest that mankind has shifted from living in the Holocene (~emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (~humans capable of changing the Earth’ atmosphere) since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But in the <b>light</b> of the <b>sheer</b> size and magnitude of some historical land use changes (e. g. collapse of the Roman Empire in the 4 th century, the depopulation of Europe due to the Black Plague in the 14 th century and the aftermath of the colonization of the Americas in the 16 th century), some believe that this point might have occurred earlier in time (Ruddiman, 2003; Kaplan et al., 2010). Many uncertainties still remain today and gaps in our knowledge of the Antiquity and its aftermath can only be improved by interdisciplinary research. HYDE presents (gridded) time series of population and land use for the last 12, 000 years.
