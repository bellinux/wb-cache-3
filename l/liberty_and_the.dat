5|$|During the war, Machias men {{refitted}} {{and armed}} {{a variety of}} ships—including the Margaretta—and sailed off looking for battle with the British. The Machias <b>Liberty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Diligent were used to intercept merchant ships that were supplying the British in the Siege of Boston. Jeremiah O'Brien and John Lambert built a twenty-gun ship and began privateering under an American letter of marque. Both men were commissioned into the Continental Navy for their work. O'Brien was captured {{off the coast of}} New York in late 1777, but was able to escape from prison in Britain to continue privateering throughout the war.|$|E

5|$|The Machias {{community}} expected retaliation by the British Empire, {{and immediately}} petitioned to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for guidance, supplies, and assistance. The Provincial Congress organized {{the defense of}} Machias and remained vigilant. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted {{one of the three}} captured vessels with breastwork, and armed it with guns and swivels that were taken from the Margaretta, and changed its name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, the Diligent and the Tatamagouche. The ships' officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbor. The Provincial Congress formally recognized O'Brien and Foster's efforts by commissioning both the Machias <b>Liberty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy with O'Brien as their commander in August 1775. Retaliation from the British did not occur until October 18, 1775, with the Burning of Falmouth.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} liberty races (semeai) in {{the game}} of Go. A rigorous treatment of positions with approach moves but no ko revealed a class of positions not described in the literature before. The complete presented classification is simpler and more compact than the one used so far. This was achieved through a classification by <b>the</b> types of <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> order they are to be filled instead of a classification by group status. A principal difference to semeai without approach moves is that in the presence of approach moves <b>and</b> shared <b>liberties</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> absence of eyes, two different strategies are possible because the un-orthodox filling of shared liberties instead of outer liberties may be a better strategy.
