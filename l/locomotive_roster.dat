50|$|Harris had {{a series}} of private owner wagons built by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, which {{considerably}} reduced transport costs. In later years, British Railways Class 37 <b>locomotives</b> <b>rostered</b> from Cardiff Canton and Barry depots, were placed in charge of coal hoppers on a Merry-go-round train, to transport coal to Aberthaw power station.|$|R

50|$|The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&S) <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> was a {{combination}} of new and used locomotives. This is not a comprehensive roster.|$|E
50|$|The railroad's <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> is on {{loan from}} parent Progressive Rail Inc. and {{includes}} one SW1500 and two GP15-1 units operating along the system.|$|E
5000|$|The Texas type on the Santa Fe is {{by design}} a Berkshire with an {{additional}} driving axle, as it was ordered by most railroads. [...] Although Santa Fe 3829 was the first steam locomotive with the 2-10-4 wheel arrangement, Santa Fe 5000 served as the prototype for all further 2-10-4 <b>locomotives</b> <b>rostered</b> by the road.|$|R
50|$|After {{nationalization}} in 1948, {{all these}} <b>locomotives</b> were <b>rostered</b> on the Ferrocarril General Urquiza (FCGU).|$|R
5000|$|The Santa Fe Northerns were {{rostered}} to {{haul the}} Chief and Fast Mail trains between La Junta, Colorado and Los Angeles across 1255 mi, and also handled the Grand Canyon Limited between Los Angeles and Wellington, Kansas, across 1534 mi. From 1942, they ran through from Los Angeles to Kansas City via the Belen Cutoff and Amarillo, Texas, {{a distance of}} 1789 mi, setting a new record for through steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>rosters.</b>|$|R
50|$|MMT uses {{a variety}} of {{equipment}} formerly used on other Watco shortlines. Some of the equipment has been repainted for MMT; other units remain in their original Union Pacific and Milwaukee road paint. A <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> is hosted by TrainWeb.|$|E
5000|$|The WT <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> {{included}} two Climax and three Shay geared steam locomotives. WT rolling stock included 20 flat cars; two log loaders; a steam ditcher; a steel flat car; {{and at least}} one caboose (seen behind the log loader {{and at the end of}} the train in the photo to the left.) ...|$|E
50|$|In 1905, {{a single}} 0-4-2 tank {{locomotive}} named Britannia was acquired {{as an additional}} shunting locomotive from Dick, Kerr & Company of Kilmarnock in Scotland. Apart from being named, it was also numbered 13 on the Cape Copper Company <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster.</b> The locomotive was landed at Port Nolloth in May 1905 and was placed in shunting service at the port.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, at the railroad's one-year anniversary, DM&E owned 39 {{locomotives}} and leased {{five more}} {{for a total of}} 44 <b>locomotives</b> <b>rostered.</b> By the railroad's tenth anniversary in 1996, DM&E owned 69 locomotives and owned or leased over 1,500 cars including over 600 covered hoppers for grain and cement shipments. In 2001, the number of locomotives owned stayed about the same, while the number of cars increased to about 5,000 with 52% of them in dedicated grain service.|$|R
25|$|PRR's {{competitors}} managed {{this period}} better with their diesel <b>locomotive</b> <b>rosters.</b> PRR voluntarily preserved a roundhouse full of representative steam locomotives at Northumberland, Pennsylvania in 1957 and kept them there for several decades. These locomotives, {{with the exception}} of I1sa #4483 which is on display at Hamburg, New York, are now at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. In sharp contrast, NYC's Alfred E. Perlman deliberately scrapped all but two large steam locomotives, and these survived only by accident.|$|R

50|$|In 1904, {{a single}} 0-4-2 {{inverted}} saddle-tank locomotive named Caledonia was acquired from Dick, Kerr & Company of Kilmarnock in Scotland. On a saddle-tank locomotive the water tank is mounted astride the locomotive's boiler, {{while on the}} much less common inverted saddle-tank locomotive, the boiler is nested in the water tank. The locomotive was an oil-burner and used outside mounted Morton's valve gear. Apart from being named, it was also numbered 11 on the Cape Copper Company <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over {{its three}} decade history, the Crab Orchard and Egyptian's <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> {{has seen a}} large {{transition}} between steam power back in the 1970s and the present-day diesel power currently running; overall they have owned a total of seven different engines from four different locomotive builders {{over the course of}} its time. The modern roster comprises only two EMD SW1200's, all of which are fully painted into CO&E's present scheme; however their individual colors correspond to their own district's local high school colors.|$|E
50|$|On May 7, 2003, Microsoft {{announced}} that it would be developing a sequel called Microsoft Train Simulator 2 and it was first demoed to the public at E3 on May 15. Seemingly its main improvements were the addition of people to the game (e.g. passengers waiting at the stations, people operating the new <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster,</b> etc.), more realistic crashes and other accidents, and turntables. It was being developed by Kuju Entertainment, the original MSTS creators. Despite restructuring efforts at Kuju, the project was however handed over to Microsoft Game Studios on August 18, 2003.|$|E

50|$|Two {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in 1883, built by Stephenson with works numbers 2519 and 2520. Their known numbers also indicate renumbering and gap-filling on the <b>locomotive</b> numbering <b>roster.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1960s, {{passenger}} services were worked by Broadmeadow-based 30-class locomotives, normally hauling {{up to three}} end-platform suburban carriages. The <b>locomotives</b> were <b>rostered</b> to work bunker first on the outward journey.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{rail system}} {{consisted}} of an eight-track railroad yard, a railroad ferry terminal, and two diesel switcher locomotives. The two engines, an EMD SW1 and EMD SW9, {{made up the}} primary <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> to assist in most of its switching activities and the loading of rail cars onto barges. About twice each month from the Port of Mobile, the railroad ferry service transported an average of 24 tank cars throughout each voyage, delivering and receiving both loaded and unloaded cars from the terminal {{to the rest of}} the national U.S. rail network.|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{converted the}} Starrucca House to offices and staff housing c. 1903. A new roundhouse complex was constructed between 1904 and 1911, and other shop buildings were added through the 1920s. In 1928 the railroad relocated its locomotive shops to Hornell, New York, and moved other shops out of Susquehanna in 1929, but retained a coach shop with reduced staffing through the 1950s. In 1952 Erie closed the roundhouse, as it converted its steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> to diesel locomotives. By {{the end of}} the decade, Erie had moved all of its remaining shop operations to Meadville.|$|E
5000|$|The six new red {{carriages}} {{were used}} on the Albury Express, replacing E type carriages which had been fitted with airconditioning. This train was effectively a second-division run of the Spirit of Progress, further proven by the <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> for this train also being an S class locomotive. (Note that the locomotives were all painted in blue with gold leaf by 1938, and the two red locomotives were the first repainted to that scheme, in 1937. So {{there was never any}} plan to have red S Class locomotives on the front of an all-steel, red Albury Express.) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{misprint}} {{in one of}} the Southerns early <b>locomotive</b> <b>rosters</b> had confused {{the engine}} with number 1101, a Baldwin 4-6-0. As a result, many believed the engine was originally built as a 4-6-0 for the Washington City, Virginia Midland, and Great Southern Railway (presumably 1101s original owner). Such mistakes were quite common from the Southern Railways formation to the 1903 renumbering, with much of the locomotive records during that time being either incomplete or containing conflicting information. Thus very little of the 1509s early career is known, however, most railroad historians have concluded that the 1509 had most likely been built either as a 0-4-4T or possibly as a 0-4-0, as opposed to the larger 4-6-0 design.|$|R
5000|$|The French-owned Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia, with 784 km of [...] trackage, {{had four}} Pacific type <b>locomotives</b> on its <b>roster.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 4 June 1938, {{the service}} was relaunched and renamed The Westlander with Pr class <b>locomotives</b> <b>rostered.</b> It {{included}} sitting and sleeping cars (both first and second class). A dining car was attached between Perth and Northam where it was detached having served dinner on the eastbound service. It was then attached to the westbound service for breakfast. Refreshment rooms were also provided at major stations for passengers wishing to purchase cheaper snacks and drinks. World War II austerity measures saw the lounge cars removed until March 1946. On 28 March 1948, it was again relaunched with new AH class steel sleeping carriages with the other carriages refurbished. This {{was to be the}} last improvement to the train, although the introduction of the X class diesel-electric locomotives in 1954 marginally reduced traveling time.|$|R
50|$|The railway officially {{opened on}} 28 May 1971 {{but because of}} the need to {{redesign}} the carriage stock, the first public trains did not run until 19 July 1971. By {{the end of the first}} season, more than 30,000 passengers had been carried. In the winter of 1971 the railway was extended to its current terminus at Penllyn. For the beginning of the 1972 season, a second steam locomotive Red Damsel was returned to service with a new name: Elidir. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster</b> was expanded that year to include Maid Marian (now operating on the Bala Lake Railway) and an 0-4-0 tank locomotive built by Jung in Germany.|$|E
50|$|The EMD DDM45 is {{a narrow}} gauge {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by EMD. The DD {{in the name}} means that it has eight axles in two trucks, giving it a D-D wheel arrangement, while the M stands for the meter gauge track it was to operate on, and the 45 represents the EMD's SD45 that the engine was derived from. They were built for service on the Estrada de Ferro Vitória a Minas (EFVM) in Brazil. In the early 1970s, the EFVM needed not only to expand its <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster,</b> but to use the most powerful single-engined locomotives available, and the SD45 represented the highest-rated model that EMD had to offer at the time.|$|E
50|$|The EMD GT22CUM1 is {{a narrow}} gauge {{diesel-electric}} locomotive built by EMD. It has six axles in two trucks, {{giving it a}} C-C wheel arrangement. The name means a C-C locomotive, U for metre gauge (the rails are a metre apart), 12-cylinder 645 series. They were built for service in South America by the Villares with license of EMD. The Rede Ferroviaria Federal Sociedade Anonima (RFFSA) a state railroad in Brazil bought about 55 in the early 1980s in order to expand their <b>locomotive</b> <b>roster.</b> The RFFSA needed a powerful single-engined locomotive with light weight per axle for their metric system, and the GT22 represented the highest-rated model that EMD had to offer at the time.|$|E
50|$|The Alexander Railroad {{currently}} has five operating diesel-electric <b>locomotives.</b> The <b>roster</b> includes: #3 - GE 44 tonner, and four EMD SW1500's, #9 and #10 wearing an all over black livery. #11 and #12 wear a more eye catching black and green livery. ARC #11 was photographed working in Taylorsville in March 2013.|$|R
50|$|This was the railroad's {{first true}} diesel locomotive. Built as a dual-cab (bidirectional) engine, {{this was the}} only <b>locomotive</b> on the <b>roster</b> that didn't require turning on the turntable.|$|R
40|$|A multi-class single {{locomotive}} (MCSL) {{problem is}} defined in this paper as one involving the allocation of a single locomotive to each {{of a number of}} pre-timetabled trains, some of which can be pulled by more than one type (or class) of locomotive. This is typical of problems arising in many passenger train networks and an exact solution method exists for the general form of this problem (Forbes et al(1)) This paper describes the analysis of a particular type of MCSL problem, as faced by the Public Transport Corporation (PTC) in the Australian State of Victoria, where all journeys either start or end at one location (Melbourne). Because of this feature, the problem can be solved in two separate stages. The first stage (an integer programming model) determines the type of locomotive that will hall each trip. The second stage, which can either be solved by the LP assignment algorithm or by computerised inspection, determines the <b>locomotive</b> <b>rosters,</b> (the sequence of round trips that each locomotive hauls) ...|$|R
