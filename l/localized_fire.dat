40|$|AbstractBased on {{the fire}} {{development}} model for {{the whole process of}} <b>localized</b> <b>fires</b> in large-space buildings and assisted by the technology of FDS large eddy simulation, the temperature fields of <b>fire</b> smoke of <b>localized</b> <b>fires</b> in large spaces were investigated with different building heights, building areas and fire powers. It has been found that for large-space buildings with a height greater than 6 m and a building area more than 1500 m 2, factors like building height and building area can slightly affect the curve trend of fire smoke, while such factor like fire power has more significant influence on the curve trend of fire smoke. Through the analysis of temperature rise curves of fire smoke in various fire scenarios, the paper proposed a whole-process prediction model for the temperature fields of <b>fire</b> smoke of <b>localized</b> <b>fires</b> in large-space buildings. As long as the model uses the appropriate shape coefficient, the prediction model can accurately predict the temperature fields of <b>fire</b> smoke of <b>localized</b> <b>fires</b> in large-space buildings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith the {{worldwide}} popularization of {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) vehicles, the use of composite cylinders has been growing at a high rate. Due to the flammable composite layers, safety performance of composite CNG cylinders under <b>localized</b> <b>fire</b> exposure caused by accidental vehicle fires has drawn extensive attention. Composite CNG cylinders would be degraded by the fire and even burst before the activation of pressure relief device. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed for predicting heat and mechanical response of the cylinder subjected to <b>localized</b> <b>fire.</b> Firstly, a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) sub-model is developed for simulating <b>localized</b> <b>fire</b> impingement on the cylinder to obtain heat response data. Secondly, thermophysical and mechanical property degradation of cylinder's aluminum liner and carbon fiber/epoxy composite layers caused by fire is described in detail. Thirdly, a non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) sub-model is developed for predicting mechanical response of the cylinder exposed to fire. Heat response data coupling transfer between CFD sub-model and FEA sub-model is realized to accurately transfer thermo-mechanical boundary condition. Finally, heat and mechanical response of the cylinder subjected to <b>localized</b> <b>fire</b> is studied based on the modeling of a typical composite CNG cylinder. Pressure and temperature of internal CNG slowly rise, and temperature distribution of internal CNG and cylinder's outside surface is uneven during the <b>localized</b> <b>fire.</b> Stress distribution of the cylinder wall is also uneven, and maximum stress {{is located at the}} cylindrical shell near the rear head exposed to fire...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{full-scale}} bookcase fire experiment, a fire development model is {{proposed for the}} whole process of localized fires in large-space buildings. We found that for localized fires in large-space buildings full of wooden combustible materials the fire growing phases can be simplified into a t 2 fire with a 0. 0346 [*]kW/s 2 fire growth coefficient. FDS technology is applied to study the smoke temperature curve for a 2 [*]MW to 25 [*]MW fire occurring within a large space with a height of 6 [*]m to 12 [*]m and a building area of 1 [*] 500 [*]m 2 to 10 [*] 000 [*]m 2 based on the proposed fire development model.

30|$|The {{establishment}} of Spanish pastoralism {{at the turn}} of the eighteenth century and subsequent congregation of Native Americans into areas near Spanish missions may have concentrated fire use in the lower foothills of the coastal ranges and thereby eliminated or reduced the human component of the fire regime in the chaparral dominated interior of the coastal ranges by the mid- 1800 s (Keeley 2002).

30|$|The tree-ring record does, in fact, show an {{abundance}} of pre-historic <b>localized</b> <b>fire</b> events, which may have produced a relatively fine-grain mosaic of chaparral age classes.

Following a 30 yr absence of much fire evidence of any kind, 1894 marks {{the first of four}} widespread fire events that dominate the late nineteenth and twentieth century fire history record. Also evident during this transitional period is an increase in scarring rates amongst trees during the widespread events. Beginning with the 1894 fire and continuing into the modern period, the number of fire scars detected per fire increased, on average, from 2.5 (1600 to 1893) to 7.0 (1894 to 2005). The sample depth of individual trees remained relatively constant over this time, which indicates that the observed increase is not an artifact of numbers of fire scarred trees included in the sample set (Figure 5).|$|E

40|$|Fire {{promotes}} {{an abundance}} of nest sites for the stem nesting bee Exoneura nigrescens, which remain viable for approximately 10 years. The finite duration of nesting substrate and <b>localized</b> <b>fire</b> events suggest that migration should minimize genetic structure among suitable habitat patches. Exoneura nigrescens was sampled from 7 localities with a known fire history in southwestern Victoria, Australia. Individual bees were genotyped at 8 microsatellite loci and genic and genotypic analyses applied to examine genetic structure among burn patch localities, within burn patches, and within colonies. Despite relatively short-term availability of nesting substrates, remarkably fine-scale genetic structure was observed both among burn patches and within burn patches. The spatial distribution of relatedness shows a strong pattern of isolation-by-distance at geographic distances to 35 km, suggesting that genetic partitioning among burn patches is, at least in part, a result of dispersal ability. Genetic structure within burn patches includes colonies consisting of close kin with genic partitioning among nests.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{spatially}} <b>localized</b> <b>firing</b> of hippocampal place {{cells is}} thought to underlie the navigational function of the hippocampus. Per-formance on a spatial task learned using a particular place cell map should therefore deteriorate if the map is disrupted. To test this prediction, we trained rats on a hippocampal-dependent spatial task in a black box and tested them in a white box. Although the change from black to white induced remapping of most place cells, navigational performance re-mained essentially intact. Furthermore, place cell activity was also unre-lated to specific aspects of the task such as tone onset, response, or goal location. Together, these results imply that the spatial information needed to solve this navigation task is represented outside the hippocampus and suggest that the place cells encode some other aspect, such as the spatial context.

A total of 168 tests on hinged bars were performed. Four different slenderness values, two eccentricities of the compression load and six levels of restraint to the axial elongation were tested.

30|$|The Lombardo et al. {{study is}} both {{surprising}} and unusual. Who {{would have guessed}} that a 400 + yr fire history of interior chaparral in southern California might be reconstructed from a conifer tree, the bigcone Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga macrocarpa [Vasey] Mayr)? These remarkable, fire adapted trees exist in small islands of forest within a sea of chaparral. Strictly speaking, this fire-scar based study is most directly a reconstruction of fire history in bigcone Douglas-fir stands. But in comparisons of the dates and locations of tree-ring based fire events with twentieth century mapped fire perimeters from documents, Lombardo et al. build a case that the bigcone tree-ring record also provides a reasonable estimate of past fire occurrences and relative extent within the surrounding chaparral. More studies of this type are needed to test this novel approach and {{the findings of this}} case study. For now, the results suggest that large (extensive) fires have been a common feature of bigcone stands and the surrounding chaparral on the Los Padres National Forest for at least four centuries. The twentieth century, however, was somewhat different, with fewer small (<b>localized)</b> <b>fire</b> events than earlier centuries. We expect that these and future findings will be of considerable interest in this region where “megafires” and very active debates about fire ecology and management have raged in recent years.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} the theoretical background and main hypotheses at {{the basis of}} SAFIR®, a nonlinear finite element software for modeling structures in fire. The paper also explains {{how to use the}} software at its full extent. The discussed numerical modeling principles can be applied with other similar software. Approach: Following a general overview of the organization of the software, the thermal analysis part is explained, with the basic equations and the different possibilities to apply thermal boundary conditions (compartment fire, <b>localized</b> <b>fire,</b> etc.). Next, the mechanical analysis part is detailed, including the time integration procedures and the different types of finite elements: beam, truss, shell, spring and solid. Finally, the material laws are described. The software capabilities and limitations are discussed throughout the paper. Findings: By accommodating multiple types of finite elements and materials, by allowing the user to consider virtually any section type and to input the fire attack in multiple forms, the software SAFIR® is a comprehensive tool for investigating the behavior of structures in the fire situation. Meanwhile, being developed exclusively for its well-defined field of application, it remains relatively easy to use. Value: The paper will improve the knowledge of readers (researchers, designers and authorities) about numerical modeling used in structural fire engineering in general and the capabilities of a particular software largely used in the fire engineering community.

40|$|SummaryHippocampal CA 1 and CA 3 {{pyramidal}} neuron place cells encode the spatial location {{of an animal}} through <b>localized</b> <b>firing</b> patterns called “place fields. ” To explore the mechanisms that control place cell firing {{and their relationship to}} spatial memory, we studied mice with enhanced spatial memory resulting from forebrain-specific knockout of the HCN 1 hyperpolarization-activated cation channel. HCN 1 is strongly expressed in CA 1 neurons and in entorhinal cortex grid cells, which provide spatial information to the hippocampus. Both CA 1 and CA 3 place fields were larger but more stable in the knockout mice, with the effect greater in CA 1 than CA 3. As HCN 1 is only weakly expressed in CA 3 place cells, their altered activity likely reflects loss of HCN 1 in grid cells. The more pronounced changes in CA 1 likely reflect the intrinsic contribution of HCN 1. The enhanced place field stability may underlie the effect of HCN 1 deletion to facilitate spatial learning and memory...|$|R

However, while place cells have adult-like firing fields from the outset, grid cells have irregular and variable fields until the fourth week, raising doubts about their contribution to place cell firing at young age. Recording in MEC of juvenile rats, we show that, unlike grid cells, border cells express adult-like firing fields from the first days of exposure to an open environment, at postnatal days 16 – 18.
