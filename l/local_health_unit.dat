40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{national}} {{guidelines in}} 2003 aimed at limiting the recourse to tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (A/T), {{the latter are}} among the most frequent pediatric surgeries performed in Italy. Aim of the study is to investigate variability of A/T rates among children of the Veneto Region, Italy. Methods All discharges of Veneto residents with Diagnosis-Related Groups 57 – 60 and ICD 9 -CM intervention codes 28. 2 (tonsillectomy), 28. 3 (adenotonsillectomy), 28. 6 (adenoidectomy) were selected in the period 2000 – 2006 for a descriptive analysis. A multilevel Poisson regression model was applied to estimate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR) with 95 % Confidence Intervals (CI) for A/T surgery among children aged 2 – 9 years in 2004 – 2006, while taking into account clustering of interventions within the 21 Local Health Units. Results Through 2000 – 2006, the overall number of A/T surgeries decreased (- 8 %); there was a decline of adenoidectomies (- 20 %) and tonsillectomies (- 8 %), whereas adenotonsillectomies raised (+ 18 %). Analyses on children aged 2 – 9 resulted in an overall rate of 14. 4 surgeries per 1000 person-years (16. 1 among males and 12. 5 among females), with a wide heterogeneity across Local Health Units (range 8. 1 – 27. 6). At random intercept Poisson regression, while adjusting for sex and age, intervention rates were markedly lower among foreign than among Italian children (IRR = 0. 57, CI 0. 53 – 0. 61). A/T rates in the 10 – 40 age group (mainly tonsillectomies) computed for each <b>Local</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> and introduced in the regression model accounted for 40 % of the variance at <b>Local</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> level of pediatric rates (mainly adenoidectomies and adenotonsillectomies). Conclusion A/T rates in the Veneto Region, especially adenoidectomies among children aged 2 – 9 years, remain high notwithstanding a decrease through 2000 – 2006. A wide heterogeneity according to nationality and Local Health Units is evident. The propensity to A/T surgery of each <b>Local</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> is similar in different age groups and for different surgical indications. </p...|$|E

This empirical study has been made on a sample of 10 Regions, basically homogeneous with regard to health care demand, as to the quality of services provided, as to the expenditure pro capite value, and the consolidated balance sheet (regional surplus – loss). As for the surveyed Regions, a fare system comparison has been made, relatively to three stages of analyses: The investment grade in the fare list from the single Regions, the usage grade of the reimbursement based on fees for services, and the position of each Region as to the global fare average calculated on the whole sample.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Legionella {{bacterium}} {{manifests itself}} in Legionnaire's disease and Pontiac fever, it is mainly found and transmitted by aerosol produced in cooling towers, water distribution plants and medical equipment, and it affects mainly elder persons in poor health. METHODS: The population of Venice <b>Local</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> was divided in two areas of study and the incidence of legionellosis in residents of Venice historical centre (Distretto Sanitario 1) and in residents of the mainland and coastal areas (Distretti Sanitari 2, 3, 4) was calculated. The cases were those notified to the Public Health Unit by law, and the population of residents {{was that of the}} eligible for health care in the archives of the <b>Local</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Unit.</b> Only cases of legionellosis in residents who had not travelled in the 10 days previous of the onset of disease, and not related to nosocomial clusters were considered. The standardized incidence ratio was then calculated and confidence interval were defined by Poisson distribution. RESULTS: Given the population of the two areas, 59801 in Distretto Sanitario 1 and 237555 in Distretti 2, 3, 4, the raw incidence of disease is respectively 87 per 100000 and 20 per 100000 in time 2002 - 2010. The standardized incidence ratio for the population of Distretto Sanitario 1 vs the remaining population is 4. 3. DISCUSSION: The difference in risk of getting the disease in this two residential areas geographically very close, is probably related to the different buildings' characteristics, old and difficult to maintain in Venice historical centre...|$|E
