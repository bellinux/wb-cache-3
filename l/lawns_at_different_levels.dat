To identify image structures <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>levels,</b> it is desirable {{to be able to}} achieve multiple views of an image <b>at</b> <b>different</b> scales and then extract perceptually-relevant shapes from the different views. The three aims of this work are: to generate multiple views of each image in a principled manner, to identify structures and shapes <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>levels</b> within images and to emulate the Gestalt principles to guide shape finding. The proposed integrated approach is able to meet all three aims...|$|R
