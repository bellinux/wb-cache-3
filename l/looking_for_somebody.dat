25|$|In June 1990 {{the police}} {{received}} a tip about Pintarić having {{been seen in}} Prosenik Začretski, near Zabok. They talked to Rudolf Belina, owner of a nearby cottage. A couple of days later, he was visited and shot dead by Pintarić, who thought Belina had betrayed him to the authorities. Shortly after that, Pintarić murdered Barbara Šipek's neighbor for having killed one of her chickens. His fifth and final victim was Božo Habek, shot dead on 2 August 1990 simply for asking the already paranoid Pintarić if he was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody.</b>|$|E
500|$|Melish engaged Constance Ortmayer {{to design}} the coin. Ortmayer later remembered, [...] "I was {{recommended}} by them, someone came through Cincinnati... they were just <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> so they recommended me". Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly on April 4, 1936 that the original [...] "lacked distinction and artistic merit" [...] and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, withholding approval.|$|E
500|$|While {{campaign}}ing in Des Moines {{during the first}} week of July, Bayh commented that he would campaign for embattled Senator Joe Lieberman in his Connecticut primary fight against Ned Lamont if asked to do so, but stopped short of proclaiming support for the candidate if he lost the primary and decided to run as an Independent. As he completed his fifth trip to Iowa, party officials in the state remarked that he was [...] "making inroads" [...] in the state, commenting that [...] "Democrats are <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who is new and fresh." [...] The candidate revealed his economic goals during a speech, stating [...] "that creating opportunity for middle-class Americans will be a centerpiece of my campaign." [...] He then listed his objectives including: tax credits to pay for college tuition of low to mid-level income Americans, covering insurance costs of small businesses for its sickest employees, and incentives for saving and buying automobiles with [...] "good gas mileage." [...] However, in order to pay for these proposals, Bayh stated that raising taxes would be [...] "a decision worth making".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you can <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else, then," [...] said Miss Evans with temper. [...] "You won’t marry me. How {{much would}} you get if you did make the skipper put back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came down}} ’ere to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> like you," [...] he ses, [...] "but I never dreamt I should have such luck as this. I’m an actor, and I’ve {{got to play}} {{the part of a}} sailor, and I’ve been worried some time ’ow {{to make up for the}} part. D’ye understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you should}} <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> somewhere else. That's all. I'll {{tell you what}} now, Mr. Amedroz, I'll do it myself." [...] By this time he had helped himself to two large slices of cold mutton, and was eating his breakfast and talking with {{an equal amount of}} energy for either occupation.|$|R
60|$|A pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn {{looking at}} the law-stationer. Mr. Krook, with his mouth open, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to speak next.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must see, mother, {{that this}} gentleman is <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else," [...] said the girl; [...] "you are {{hindering}} him from finding Captain Jackson." ...|$|E
60|$|While Andy {{still kept}} out of sight, Chet sauntered slowly across the depot platform, as if <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody.</b> Josiah Graham stared at him and leaped to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|Tony stood up, with a {{dampness}} on {{his face}} and his hands trembling. “Good Lord, sir, you can’t believe that!” he said. “Bernard never had any failings of the kind. It must”—and Tony gasped and stared round the room—“have been poachers. You will remember Evans said Davidson had gone out to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> who had been laying snares.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall scrape on, I suppose. I must <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else.' The Marquis showed very plainly by his {{demeanour}} {{that he did}} {{not give}} his son much credit either for diligence or for ingenuity in making such a search. 'At any rate, sir, I can't marry the daughter of a man who is to be put upon his trial for forgery.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{man with}} the glazed hat {{examined}} the point of his cue, and then <b>looked</b> around <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to enjoy the joke with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were looking}} so comfortable," [...] said Fisher, [...] "that I thought {{you must be}} one of the servants. I'm <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to take this bag of mine; I haven't brought a man down, as I came away in a hurry." ...|$|E
60|$|On and on sped {{the train}} until Hyde Park was reached. Here a brief stop was made, and several persons {{including}} a sailor got on board. The sailor {{came through the}} car as if <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> and finally found Caleb Walton and shook hands.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{whenever}} {{he gets to}} the top of the steps at t'other end of the Yard,' said Mrs Plornish, 'he'll peep out in the curiousest way! So that some of us thinks he's peeping out towards where his own country is, and some of us thinks he's <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> he don't want to see, and some of us don't know what to think.' ...|$|E
60|$|Tom's countenance fell; for {{he thought}} this {{equivalent}} to telling him that his appearance did not answer; and that Fips must <b>look</b> out <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't find them, Anne, I can't find them. If {{you don't}} believe me, come and <b>look</b> <b>for</b> yourself. <b>Somebody</b> {{must have taken}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I look as at {{a picture}} merely. But," [...] she went on, turning pleasantly to him, [...] "I may do so now--I may <b>look</b> <b>for</b> you. You are always there, are you not? Ah--I don't mean it seriously! But it is amusing to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> one knows in a crowd, even if one does not want him. It takes off the terrible oppressiveness of being {{surrounded}} by a throng, and having no point of junction with it through a single individual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems odd, I suppose, that I didn't," [...] Guy answered, [...] "but do {{you know}} there was an air of secrecy {{about the whole thing}} which rather frightened me. And those {{soldiers}} had exactly the air of <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to shoot. Anyhow, while I was hesitating what to do, there was a whistle and another train came from the opposite direction. Then, of course, I waited {{to see what was going}} to happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen!' he said. 'Sit {{down and}} I {{will tell you}} the story of my life. We'll skip the first twenty-eight years and three months, merely {{mentioning}} that for the greater part of that time I was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> just like you. A month and nine days ago I found you. You were crossing the Embankment. I was also on the Embankment. In a taxi. I stopped the taxi, got out, and observed you just stepping into the Charing Cross Underground. I sprang--' ...|$|E
60|$|The thud of hoofs grew louder, and the dim {{figure of}} a mounted man {{grew out of the}} prairie. A little thrill ran through her as she watched him swing past at a canter and draw rein between the house and the stables. He waited a moment as though <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> in whose care to leave the horse, and Carrie {{could see that he was}} weary and dusty. Though his face was dimly visible, she fancied it was drawn and grey. Slanting over his shoulder, the barrel of his Marlin rifle glinted in the moon.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Good Morning America, Nancy Grace said in reaction to events that [...] "If anything, I would suggest that guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing." [...] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience {{as a victim of}} crime that such people <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else to blame.|$|R
60|$|The {{captain was}} an {{eccentric}} {{individual and the}} Rovers did not like him much, so they were perfectly willing to let him go. They decided to <b>look</b> around <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else to manage the houseboat {{and in the meantime}} run the craft themselves.|$|R
60|$|At a {{cry from}} Dick and Max the freshmen {{commenced}} to gather on the campus, and Tom quickly handed around {{the sections of}} hose. Other first-year lads procured sticks, boxing gloves, and other things, and <b>looked</b> around <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to lead them.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} behind the bracken felt himself in {{somewhat}} of a dilemma. There was a delightful smell of fresh coffee from the waiting coach, and {{there seemed to be}} not the slightest reason why he should not emerge from his hiding-place and claim the hospitality of these people. He was a quite harmless person, with proper credentials, and an adequate explanation of his presence there. On the other hand, the spirit of adventure natural to his years strongly prompted him to remain where he was and watch. He felt certain that something was going to happen. Besides, those soldiers had exactly the air of <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to shoot! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be SORRY for me," [...] she said. [...] "That {{only makes}} me see the--the {{difference}} {{between you and}} me. And don't {{pay any attention to}} what these outlaws say about me. They're ignorant. They couldn't understand me. You'll hear that Bland killed men who ran after me. But that's a lie. Bland, like all the other outlaws along this river, is always <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to kill. He SWEARS not, but I don't believe him. He explains that gunplay gravitates to men who are the real thing--that it is provoked by the four-flushes, the bad men. I don't know. All I know is that somebody is being killed every other day. He hated Spence before Spence ever saw me." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not easy}} to find Mrs. Crayford in the crowd. Searching here, and searching there, Frank became {{conscious}} of a stranger, who appeared to be <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody,</b> on his side. He was a dark, heavy-browed, strongly-built man, dressed in a shabby old naval officer's uniform. His manner--strikingly resolute and self-contained--was unmistakably the manner of a gentleman. He wound his way slowly through the crowd; stopping to look at every lady whom he passed, and then looking away again with a frown. Little by little he approached the conservatory--entered it, after a moment's reflection--detected the glimmer of a white dress in the distance, through the shrubs and flowers--advanced to get a nearer view of the lady--and burst into Clara's presence with a cry of delight.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969 Wilkins and O'Brien sold Cove Haven to Caesars World of Las Vegas. Wilkins said, [...] "We {{had more}} {{business}} than {{we knew what}} to do with but had no money for expansion. We had to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> with deep pockets; that's why we sold to Caesars." [...] He became the {{president and chief operating officer}} of Caesars Pocono Resorts and opened three other resorts in the Poconos: Paradise Stream, Pocono Palace, and Brookdale. In 1997 Ski Magazine stated that the Caesars Pocono chain captured about one-third of the local couples market. Some of Wilkins's ideas, including mirrors on the ceilings, circular beds, and heart-shaped bathtubs, would appear at other Caesars resorts in Las Vegas and Tahoe.|$|R
5000|$|When {{these men}} found Jesus, they said: [...] "John the Baptist has sent us {{to you to}} ask — ‘Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else?’" [...] At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the {{question}} was: [...] "Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard — the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see I have {{surprised}} you," [...] he said. [...] "You are <b>looking,</b> I suppose, <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else? Have {{you heard from}} Allan? Is he {{on his way home}} again already?" ...|$|R
60|$|And it is supremely so in {{the case}} of religion. As long as you have a creed, which every one in a certain group {{believes}} or is supposed to believe, then that group will consist of the old recurring figures of religious history, who can be appealed to by the creed and judged by it; the saint, the hypocrite, the brawler, the weak brother. These people do each other good; or they all join together to do the hypocrite good, with heavy and repeated blows. But once break the bond of doctrine which alone holds these people together and each will gravitate to his own kind outside the group. The hypocrites will all get together and call each other saints; the saints will get lost in a desert and call themselves weak brethren; the weak brethren will get weaker and weaker in a general atmosphere of imbecility; and the brawler will go off <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else with whom to brawl.|$|E
60|$|But {{even that}} did not help her. It seemed in some mysterious way to be no longer her room, but the room of someone she had known and half forgotten: who would never come back. It gave her the same feeling she had {{experienced}} on returning {{to the house in}} London: that the place was haunted. The high cheval glass from her mother's dressing-room had been brought there for her use. The picture of an absurdly small child--the child to whom this room had once belonged--standing before it naked, rose before her eyes. She had wanted to see herself. She had thought that only her clothes stood in the way. If we could but see ourselves, as in some magic mirror? All the garments usage and education has dressed us up in laid aside. What was she underneath her artificial niceties, her prim moralities, her laboriously acquired restraints, her unconscious pretences and hypocrisies? She changed her clothes for a loose robe, and putting out the light drew back the curtains. The moon peeped in {{over the top of the}} tall pines, but it only stared at her, indifferent. It seemed to be <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I'm not. You must {{understand}} Schultz's psychology. He's neither a loafer nor a cadger. He's {{not likely to}} wander about <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> to stand him drinks. But suppose he goes on shore with five dollars, or fifty for that matter, in his pocket? After {{the third or fourth}} glass he becomes fuddled and charitable. He either drops his money all over the place, or else distributes the lot around; gives it to any one who will take it. Then it occurs to him that the night is young yet, and that he may require a good many more drinks for himself and his friends before morning. So he starts off cheerfully for his ship. His legs never get affected nor his head either in the usual way. He gets aboard and simply grabs the first thing that seems to him suitable--the cabin lamp, a coil of rope, a bag of biscuits, a drum of oil--and converts it into money without thinking twice about it. This is the process and no other. You have only to look out that he doesn't get a start. That's all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{said that}} if he were to die I--I--should be <b>looking</b> out <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> with fair hair and grey eyes, just--just to spite him in his grave, because he's dark, and he's quite sure I don't like dark people! And then he said--But I won't be so treacherous as to tell any more about him! I wish--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't help it, Miss Knag,' {{said the}} charwoman, {{bridling}} {{up on the}} shortest notice. 'There's been a deal o'cleaning {{to do in this}} house, and if you don't like it, I must trouble you to <b>look</b> out <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> else, <b>for</b> it don't hardly pay me, and that's the truth, if I was to be hung this minute.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I presume {{the tide}} is going down," [...] said Forester; [...] "and if so, we must wait here until it rises again." [...] So saying, he began to <b>look</b> about <b>for</b> <b>somebody</b> of whom he could inquire. He soon heard a gentleman say to another that the tide was falling, {{and that they should}} have to stay here three hours.|$|R
