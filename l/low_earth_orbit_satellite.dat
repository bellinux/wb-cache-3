5000|$|Spacecraft are {{beginning}} to use GNSS as a navigational tool. The addition of a GNSS receiver to a spacecraft allows precise orbit determination without ground tracking. This, in turn, enables autonomous spacecraft navigation, formation flying, and autonomous rendezvous. The use of GNSS in MEO, GEO, HEO, and highly elliptical orbits is feasible only if the receiver can acquire and track the much weaker (15 - 20 dB) GNSS side-lobe signals. This design constraint, and the radiation environment found in space, prevents the use of COTS receivers. <b>Low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite</b> constellations {{such as the one}} operated by Orbcomm uses GPS receivers on all satellites ...|$|E

50|$|LEO {{telephones}} utilize LEO (<b>low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit)</b> <b>satellite</b> technology. The advantages include providing worldwide {{wireless coverage}} with no gaps. LEO satellites orbit the Earth in high speed, low altitude orbits with an orbital time of 70-100 minutes, {{an altitude of}} 640 to 1120 kilometers (400 to 700 miles), and provide coverage cells of about (at a 100-minute orbital period) 2800 km in radius (about 1740 mi). Since the satellites are not geostationary, they move {{with respect to the}} ground. At least one satellite must have line-of-sight to every coverage area at all times to guarantee coverage. Depending on the positions of both the satellite and terminal, a usable pass of an individual LEO satellite will typically last 4-15 minutes on average; thus, a constellation of satellites is required to maintain coverage (as is done with Iridium, Globalstar, and others).|$|E
50|$|Beal Aerospace {{initially}} {{considered a}} rocket that used kerosene and liquid oxygen, but soon switched to kerosene fuel {{in combination with}} high concentration hydrogen peroxide oxidizer. This combination was selected {{in order to avoid}} the expense and complexity of cryogenic storage, and to reduce development costs. Kerosene was injected into the hot steam and oxygen exhaust products of catalytically decomposed hydrogen peroxide, resulting in spontaneous ignition. The original BA-1 launch vehicle design was intended to service the LEO (<b>Low</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit)</b> <b>satellite</b> constellation launch market, but was replaced by the much larger BA-2 design when it was decided to concentrate on the more stable Geostationary satellite launch market as the LEO constellations became financially unsound. All three stages of the BA-2 vehicle were to be pressure-fed using high-pressure helium storage to replace the expense and complexity of turbopumps. All of the BA-2 propellant tanks and primary structures were to be manufactured from lightweight composite materials. The engines were self-cooled with ablative materials.|$|E
50|$|On 16 July 1990, the Badr-I was {{launched}} as a secondary payload on a Long March 2E rocket from Area No. 2 at XSLC. Badr-1, a <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite,</b> circled the Earth's orbit every 96 minutes, passing over Pakistan for 15 minutes {{three to four}} times a day. Scientists, engineers, technicians, and designers who developed the satellite watched the launch from range. They waited about 93 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting, before dr. M. Shafi Ahmad called Prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The downlink telemetry included data on temperatures inside and {{on the surface of the}} sphere. The satellite itself, a small but highly polished polyhedron, was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus more difficult to follow optically. The satellite completed its designated life successfully. On the first orbit, the Suparco globally announced the launch of the satellite, and the Science ministry confirmed the launch of the satellite. As the satellite completed its life, a new project {{was launched}}, more ambitious, advanced, and difficult than Badr-I. However even after the Badr-II was completed, the satellite could not be able to launch until 2001.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new channel {{estimation}} algorithm for <b>low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite</b> digital communications. <b>Low</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite</b> channels impart severe spreading in delay and Doppler on the transmitted signal.
