60|$|She {{turned to}} Gurwood, but that youth {{did not hear}} her remark, having been forced from her side by a {{noiseless}} <b>luggage</b> <b>truck</b> on India-rubber wheels. Turning, then, towards the captain she found {{that he and his}} daughter had hastily run to recapture a small valise which was being borne off to the luggage van instead of going into the carriage along with them. At the same moment the guard intervened, and the captain and his daughter were lost in the crowd.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>luggage</b> <b>truck</b> (2) comprising a loading space for luggage and {{provided with a}} conveyor belt (14) disposed in the loading space for the supply and removal of luggage, which conveyor belt {{is at the same}} time a storage unit for the luggage, wherein the conveyor belts (4) disposed in the loading space can be repositioned in height and sideways, and wherein the loading space is provided with several conveyor belts disposed next to and/or above each other.

2500|$|Riders are {{permitted}} to pack up to [...] of luggage to be carried on the <b>luggage</b> <b>trucks,</b> including their tents and camping equipment, and can also carry whatever equipment they wish on their bikes. Ride organisers provide approximately one semi-trailer truck to carry the luggage for each 500 riders, so the ride is typically accompanied by at least six to eight <b>luggage</b> <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bicycle Network {{staff and}} volunteers have {{developed}} the facilities and the logistics plans for catering {{for the needs of}} several thousand cyclists and volunteers on the move each day of the ride. This includes provision of three meals a day, toilets, showers, washing up facilities, and the transport of many tons of luggage and other equipment. Between the <b>luggage</b> <b>trucks</b> and trucks carrying the ride organisation equipment, portable toilets, showers, and other requirements, typically between fourteen and forty semi-trailer trucks accompany the ride each day. A number of buses are also used to transport volunteers and other workers around the route, with about 180 other vehicles in total supporting the ride.|$|R
50|$|Because of the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, the Hoover Dam Bypass {{project was}} expedited and traffic across the dam was restricted. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi-trailer <b>trucks,</b> buses carrying <b>luggage,</b> and enclosed-box <b>trucks</b> over 40 ft long {{were not allowed}} on the dam at all. That traffic was diverted south to a Colorado River bridge at Laughlin, Nevada. Once the bypass opened on October 19, 2010, all through traffic was rerouted on it; the roadway on the dam is now open only to employees and dam visitors.|$|R
6000|$|The {{scene is}} changed {{now to the}} railway station at Wreckumoft, where there is the usual amount of bustle and noise. The engines are shrieking and {{snorting}} as if nothing on earth could relieve their feelings but bursting. Bells are ringing; porters are hurrying to and fro with <b>luggage</b> on <b>trucks,</b> {{to the risk of}} passengers' shins and toes; men, women, and children, young and old, high and low, rich and poor, are mixed in confusion on the platform, some insanely attempting to force their way into a train that is moving off, under the impression that it is their train, and they are too late [...] "after all!" [...] Others are wildly searching for lost luggage. Many are endeavouring to calm their own spirits, some are attempting to calm the spirits of others. Timid old ladies, who cannot get reconciled to railways at all, are convinced that [...] "something is going to happen," [...] and testy old gentlemen are stumping about in search of wives and daughters, wishing that railways had never been invented, while a good many self-possessed individuals of both sexes are regarding the scene with serene composure.|$|R
500|$|There are two lanes for {{automobile}} traffic {{across the top}} of the dam, which formerly served as the Colorado River crossing for U.S. Route 93. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, authorities expressed security concerns and the Hoover Dam Bypass project was expedited. Pending the completion of the bypass, restricted traffic was permitted over Hoover Dam. Some types of vehicles were inspected prior to crossing the dam while semi-trailer <b>trucks,</b> buses carrying <b>luggage,</b> and enclosed-box <b>trucks</b> over [...] long were not allowed on the dam at all, and were diverted to U.S. Route 95 or Nevada State Routes 163/68. The four-lane Hoover Dam Bypass opened on October 19, 2010. It includes a composite steel and concrete arch bridge, the Mike O'Callaghanâ€“Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, [...] downstream from the dam.|$|R
50|$|Abeer sees Leher {{when she}} is moving her <b>luggage</b> from the <b>truck</b> {{into the house and}} is {{attracted}} towards her. He even helps her unload the truck without her taking any notice and while helping her, he picks up her payal which falls to the ground in the rush and keeps it with him. He is really smitten by her and tries to talk to her so that he can know her name but she only brushes him away whenever he tries to even attempt to talk to her. She even doesn't tell him her name, until he knows it from Bittan. Abeer helps Leher's family with a lot of things much to the dislike of his family thereby creating a rift between him and his family. After a lot of drama, Abeer and Leher get married to each other and the show progresses.|$|R
