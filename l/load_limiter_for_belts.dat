40|$|Objective: Investigate the {{combined}} effects of belt geometry, seat substructure, and seat belt pretensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> on rear seat occupant injury risk. Methods: An instrumented Hybrid III 5 th percentile adult female dummy {{was subjected to}} simulated frontal impacts (Δv = 45. 8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27. 1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, {{and the use of}} seat belt pretensioners with <b>load</b> <b>limiters.</b> Results: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on submarining. Seat belt pretensioners with <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent submarining. The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented submarining in one case but could not prevent submarining with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and submarining. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash belt fit, antisubmarining seat pans, belt buckles positioned near the seat bight, and seat belts with pretensioners and <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> <b>for</b> rear seat occupants. These data can be used to inform the design of a system of restraints to reduce injuries to rear seat occupants. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

This reference governor determines an optimal setpoint in terms of injury reduction andconstraint satisfaction by solving a constrained optimization problem. Prediction of the vehicle motion, required to predict future constraint violation, is included in the design and is based on past crash data using linear regression techniques.

40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of rear seat occupants through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of rear seat occupants, new safety technologies intended for the rear seat, studies of rear seat belt and seat geometry, and methods <b>for</b> assessing <b>belt</b> fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of rear seat occupants, built-in booster seats with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the rear seat should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the rear seat should have higher priority. <b>Load</b> <b>limiters,</b> seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for rear seat occupants. If <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> are installed in rear seats, the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the rear seat than in the front seat.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In Europe, the deployment characteristics of frontal crash restraints are generally optimised to best protect an average young male, since a 50 th percentile male dummy is used in a stylised frontal impact scenario. These single point restraint systems may not provide similar levels of effectiveness when the crash scenarios vary {{with respect to the}} regulatory and consumer crash test procedures. Previous research has demonstrated that varying restraint deployment characteristics according to occupant and crash variation can provide further injury reduction in frontal impacts. This thesis reports the investigation conducted to assess the potential real world injury reduction benefit of smart restraint systems in frontal impacts. The intelligent capability of the restraint was achieved by varying the seat belt <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> (SBL) threshold, according to the frontal crash scenario. Real world accident data (CCIS) were analysed to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and frontal impact scenarios where employing smart <b>load</b> <b>limiters</b> could be most beneficial, particularly in reducing chest injury risk. From the accident sample, the chest was the most frequently injured body region at an AIS 2 + level in frontal impacts (7...|$|R

Since then, they have become world leading in automotive safety and cooperates with several major automotive companies.   The aim {{of the project was}} to evaluate a concept that Adrian Bud for Global Development Seatbelt department in Vårgårda had come up with. The concept aims to simplify the design and reduce the number of parts in an adaptive <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> (LLA). With a {{reduction in the number of}} parts, the price for the LLA would decrease and also make assembly easier.   An LLA adjusts the chest compression from the seatbelt in a crash sequence. This helps reducing the injury that might result from such chest compressions in a crash. The <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> ensures that the slowdown of the body is done in a smooth manner by adjusting the amount of belt released.   Our concept evaluation has included conceptual design, primary design, visualization of design in Catia V 5 and FEM analysis. Finally prototypes were built with the help of Autolivs central workshop and tests were performed at Autoliv.

The article was published as part a Special Issue of the 59 th Annual Scientific Conference of the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine (AAAM), October 2015. Objective: To determine whether varying the seat belt <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> (SBL) according to crash and occupant characteristics could have real-world injury reduction benefits in frontal impacts and, if so, to quantify those benefits. Methods: Real-world UK accident data were used to identify the target population of vehicle occupants and frontal crash scenarios where improved chest protection could be most beneficial. Generic baseline driver and front passenger numerical models using a 50 th percentile dummy were developed with MADYMO software. Simulations were performed where the <b>load</b> <b>limiter</b> threshold was varied in selected frontal impact scenarios. For each SBL setting, restraint performance, dummy kinematics, and injury outcome were studied in 5 different frontal impact types. Thoracic injury predictions were converted into injury probability values using Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2 + age-dependent thoracic risk curves developed and validated based on a methodology proposed by Laituri et al. (2005). Real-world benefit was quantified using the predicted AIS 2 + risk and assuming that an appropriate adaptive system was fitted to all the cars in a real-world sample of recent frontal crashes involving European passenger cars. Results: From the accident data sample the chest was the most frequently injured body region at an AIS 2 + level in frontal impacts (7...|$|R
