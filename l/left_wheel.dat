5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the pit lane {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. A swift stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado {{was able to get}} out ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when he came into the pit lane on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30, due to an issue with his front <b>left</b> <b>wheel.</b> His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E
25|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. The sun gears (which drive the axle half-shafts) will rotate at different speeds relative to the ring gear (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|E

25|$|The {{second session}} was also red flagged {{this time with}} Red Bull's Mark Webber. A big {{accident}} on the pit straight as the nose, front <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> and the wing took the impact {{as a lot of}} debris was put onto the track. However the other Red Bull of Vettel finished the session top 0.2s ahead of Alonso. Kovalainen took third, Heidfeld fourth and championship leader Button finished the days final session in fifth. Jenson's teammate Barrichello struggled to take eleventh almost one second slower than Vettel. Although Webber crashed out with one hour remaining in the session he managed to sixth.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> well fire when the overheated brake and wheel assembly was retracted into the enclosed wheel well. The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended on short final and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage pivoted {{to the left and}} struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|E
25|$|On 12 October, Napoleon {{ordered his}} army {{to make a}} <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> to the west. The Prussian generals decided to retreat, using the Saale River to protect their flank. Brunswick marched the main army north from Weimar, while Hohenlohe stood on the {{defensive}} near Jena as a flank guard. Rüchel's orders were to stay at Weimar until Saxe-Weimar returned with his division. The double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt occurred on 14 October as Napoleon attacked Hohenlohe while Brunswick ran into Marshal Louis Davout's III Corps. The troops of Brunswick, Hohenlohe, and Rüchel were driven in rout from the two battlefields. Brunswick's army lost 13,000 men and its commander was mortally wounded. Hohenlohe and Rüchel suffered as many as 25,000 casualties.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon became {{convinced}} that his enemies lay near Erfurt, so he ordered his batallion carré to make a <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> on 12 October. The Prussian generals opted to fall back. Brunswick {{was to take the}} main army north from Weimar to Merseburg, while Hohenlohe protected the move by standing on the defensive near Jena. Rüchel's orders were to hold Weimar until Saxe-Weimar returned with his division. On 14 October, the double Battle of Jena-Auerstedt occurred as Napoleon attacked Hohenlohe while Brunswick ran head-on into the III Corps of Marshal Louis Davout. Both Prussian armies as well as Rüchel's corps were driven in rout from the two battlefields. Brunswick's army suffered 13,000 casualties and its commander was mortally wounded, while the combined forces of Hohenlohe and Rüchel lost as many as 25,000.|$|E
25|$|The West was by some {{measures}} {{the most important}} theater of the war. Capture of the Mississippi River {{has been one of}} the key tenets of Union General-in-Chief Winfield Scott's Anaconda Plan. Military historian J. F. C. Fuller has described the Union invasion as an immense turning movement, a <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> that started in Kentucky, headed south down the Mississippi River, and then east through Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas. With the exception of the Battle of Chickamauga and some daring raids by cavalry or guerrilla forces, the four years in the West marked a string of almost continuous defeats for the Confederates; or, at best, tactical draws that eventually turned out to be strategic reversals. Union generals consistently outclassed most of their Confederate opponents, with the exception of cavalry commander Nathan Bedford Forrest. Lacking the proximity to the opposing capitals and population centers (and the accompanying concentration of newspapers) of the East, the astounding Confederate victories, and the fame of Eastern generals such as Robert E. Lee, George B. McClellan, and Stonewall Jackson, the Western theater received considerably less attention than the Eastern, both at the time and in subsequent historical accounts. The near-steady progress that Union forces made in defeating Confederate armies in the West and overtaking Confederate territory went nearly unnoticed.|$|E
25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings, increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E

2500|$|Chevrolet {{released}} the Grand Sport (GS) version in 1996 {{to mark the}} end of production of the C4 Corvette. The Grand Sport moniker was a nod to the original Grand Sport model produced in 1963. A total of 1,000 GS Corvettes were produced, 810 as coupes and 190 as convertibles. The 1996 GS came with the high-performance LT4 V8 engine, producing [...] and [...] The Grand Sport came only in Admiral Blue with a white stripe down the middle, and black wheels and two red stripes on the front <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> arch.|$|E
2500|$|Neither Castrol car {{finished}} at Bathurst, {{the first time}} since 1988 at least one Perkins car had failed to finish. Dumbrell had hit the wall leading out of the cutting just after he had taken over the car from Richards who started the race, when apparent suspension damage caused him to strike the tyres at Griffin's Bend. [...] Returning to the pits, the team found nothing more than cosmetic damage, but upon returning to the circuit, the front <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> came loose, throwing the car against the outside wall at Griffin's Bend, and then across {{to the other side of}} the circuit against the wall.|$|E
2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, [...] {{there was a great deal}} of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240hp (119, 142, 164, or 179kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty suspension, four speed transmission, quicker steering ratio, [...] "positraction" [...] limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual brake master cylinders (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the <b>left</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... 1988, {{the last}} ever Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh {{race of the}} season from McLaren {{teammate}} and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson Piquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo's all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win and 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Honda, a domination not seen before or since in Formula One. 1989 {{was hit by a}} deluge of rain and the drivers, notably Prost, {{who did not want to}} start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event came after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost crashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished 1st on the road but after a lot of political ramifications, he was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren decided to appeal Senna's disqualification; so Senna still had a chance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about whether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the race. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including Prost relented and they started. But an unconvinced Prost came in after one lap and withdrew; and Senna- who was in an awful mental state, immediately began driving as fast as he could. By the end of the first lap, due to Pierluigi Martini's slow Minardi holding up the two faster Williams cars of Belgian Thierry Boutsen and Italian Riccardo Patrese, Senna was an astonishing nine seconds ahead of Martini; the Williams cars soon passed Martini but by the end of the third lap, Senna was 23 seconds ahead of second-placed Boutsen. But even with such a huge lead which extended even further, Senna continued to push very hard- taking very daring chances even for himself; the psychological dominance F1 had exuded over the Brazilian meant that he was known to take chances that most other drivers would not. But going down the Brabham straight on lap 13, Senna came up behind Briton Martin Brundle's Brabham-Judd, and Brundle decided to move over to let Senna pass. But Senna was blinded by thick spray; and the Brazilian did not let up and then he hit the back of Brundle's car and it tore off his front <b>left</b> <b>wheel</b> and suspension, so the Brazilian had to retire; effectively handing Prost his third Drivers' Championship; McLaren's appeal had not been decided yet; and it was not only overturned but Senna received a $100,000 fine and a six-month ban, both of which were rescinded. Boutsen won the race in the unimproved conditions, the race was called after it reached the two-hour time limit.|$|E
