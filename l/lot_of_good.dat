25|$|During {{the time}} the Tullahassee Mission was broken up, in 1861 Loughridge moved his family East into the Cherokee Nation, and preached to the churches there for one year, which had been left by other missionaries, who {{returned}} to {{their homes in the}} North because of the dangers during the Civil War. The Indians themselves, both Creek and Cherokee, were divided on the war question; some joined the South and others the North. It also became useless and very dangerous for Loughridge and his family to remain in the territory any longer. So, on July 17, 1862, Loughridge packed up his belongings, along with his family, in two small wagons, and went south to Texas, where most of his relatives were living. In Texas during the war, and afterwards for eighteen years, Loughridge was regularly employed in preaching to churches {{in different parts of the}} state. His wife was also employed as a teacher and taught in several different schools. During this time while Loughridge accomplished a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> for others, and also was able to provide his children with an education.|$|E
25|$|Less Than {{a minute}} {{into the game}} Brady Quinn proved just why he's {{one of the top}} QBs in College Football today and he didn't stop there going 14 of 19 for 207 yards passing and 4 TDs. At :54 seconds Quinn hit Jeff Samardzija for a 51-yd TD pass and a 7-0 lead. Less than five minutes later he threw a 1-yd pass to John Carlson to put Notre Dame up 14-0. At 8:40 into the game Air Force got on the board when Zach Sasser kicked a 32-yd field goal to shrink the deficit to 14-3. But Quinn would respond with a 24-yd pass to Rhema McKnight. Air Force was able to block the Extra Point Attempt and Notre Dame was now up 20-3 to finish up the 1st quarter. The second quarter showed off a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> defense {{including}} a blocked FG attempt that saw Terrail Lambert return the blocked kick 76-yds for a TD to put Notre Dame up 27-3 at the half.|$|E

25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured her. A few months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare. (On 4 July 1897, she confided to Pauline, 'Father Pichon treated me too much like a child; nonetheless he did me a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> too by saying that I never committed a mortal sin.') During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'. Thérèse was in fact the tallest in the family, 1.62 metres (approx. 5'3"). Pauline, the shortest, was no more than 1.54m tall (approx.5').|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

He appeared in an ITV2 celebrity football quiz called [...] "Taking the Pitch" [...] in 1998, alongside singer Fish. Gunn's autobiography—In Where it Hurts—was published in 2006, {{and includes a}} foreword by his former manager Alex Ferguson. He said of writing the book, [...] "it brought up a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> memories {{and a lot of}} awkward memories". The book was described by The Times as [...] "shot through with sharp humour and astute observation". The publishers agreed to donate £1 to Gunn's Leukaemia appeal fund for every book sold.|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but still we made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E
500|$|Cannon {{injured his}} back in the third game of the 1962 season, which {{affected}} his performances, but he still finished second on the team in scoring behind Blanda. The Oilers reached the championship game for a third time, but lost to the Dallas Texans in the first ever double-overtime game in professional football history. New leg injuries and lingering back problems caused Cannon to miss most of the 1963 season. The Oilers also replaced Lemm as head coach. Because of this and his injury problems, Cannon successfully requested that the team let him leave. He later recalled: [...] "I left the team with good feelings and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> friends. It was just time to go." ...|$|E

Believing the novel's language to be [...] "far more arcane than in [...] later books," [...] Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the [...] "elegance and wit of the original." [...] She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> stuff in it" [...] but needed to be edited, and second drafts would [...] "almost certainly be rubbish... because {{you get into a}} panic."

500|$|Waugh had {{welcomed the}} {{accession}} in 1958 of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963. However, he became increasingly {{concerned by the}} decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Paul VI until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by {{the replacement of the}} universal Latin Mass with the vernacular. In a Spectator article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as [...] "sharp-edged reasonableness". He wrote to Nancy Mitford that [...] "the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to me.... We write letters to the paper. A fat <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> that does." ...|$|E

He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel {{it in front of}} you and you want to grab it."

500|$|Doyle was {{preferred}} to Taylor for {{the visit to}} Colchester United in February 2007; according to the Birmingham Mail, [...] "Doyle was unruffled and did himself a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good.</b> His handling was sound, he got the game moving quickly and {{even though some of}} his kicks were skewed wide, he whacked the ball long and hard." [...] Assistant manager Eric Black said that Doyle had [...] "shown that he's more than capable and he's ready to have a go now and challenge Maik Taylor" [...] for the starting position. He kept his place in the team {{for the remainder of the}} season as Birmingham were promoted back to the Premier League. At the club's end of season awards, Doyle picked up both the [...] "Breakthrough Award" [...] and the award for [...] "Magic Moment of the Season", for his penalty save from Wolverhampton Wanderers' Michael McIndoe at Molineux that gained Birmingham a crucial three points. Doyle finished the season with eight clean sheets from 22 appearances.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the fifth episode {{of the season and}} the seventh of the entire series {{directed}} by Ken Kwapis. During the editing of the episode, executive producer Greg Daniels publicly addressed NBC in an interview, stating, [...] "I'd like to get a supersized episode, because it’s a really long script with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> stuff." [...] In response, fans of the show set up an online petition to [...] "supersize" [...] the season finale. The website generated over 2,800 signatures. On April 20, NBC announced it would be extending the season finale by ten minutes. Although other NBC shows Will & Grace and My Name Is Earl that aired on the same night had extended episodes, cast members David Denman and John Krasinski credited in interviews the petition for the extended time. Denman and Krasinski both believed that the petition was partially responsible for the other two shows getting extended times as well.|$|E
500|$|Indiewire's Max O'Connell criticised the church's {{approach}} for being counterproductive. He predicted that [...] "their {{campaign against the}} film {{is going to be}} the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for, if also a hassle for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> for your image." [...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|E
