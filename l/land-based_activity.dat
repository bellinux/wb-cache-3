Nelson et al. have a vector-based algorithm to solve this problem, but their approach cannot guarantee that each watershed is a single polygon because of the modeling assumptions. We propose a vector-based algorithm that is provably consistent with its modeling assumptions and that guarantees one polygon per watershed. Our algorithm finds the watershed boundaries for local minima in the terrain in Θ(n 3) worst-case time. 1 Introduction The watershed of a river, the region of land that is drained by the river, is a natural management unit for land preservation or development.

40|$|This paper {{recognizes the}} fact {{some of the}} {{problems}} encountered in the coral reefs and marine environment of the Pacific are actually due to <b>land-based</b> <b>activities.</b> This message needs to be clearly {{brought to the attention of}} farmers and others who work the land - as well as to fishermen and others whose activities focus on coral reefs and the marine environment. The paper discusses the Pacific environment and some relevant key issues. The paper goes on to discuss <b>land-based</b> <b>activities</b> that harm the coral reef environment - with some emphasis on agricultural activities and soil erosion; however, the impacts of other <b>land-based</b> <b>activities</b> are also discussed. Strategies for reducing the harmful effects ofland-based activities are then discussed with reference to worldviews, various strategies, integrated approach and technical considerations. The paper recognizes the Vetiver System as an appropriate mechanism for combating the effect of soil erosion and discusses this system to some detail- before ending with some conclusions and recommendations. However, the main message ofthis paper is that there is an urgent need to clarify the impacts of the various <b>land-based</b> <b>activities</b> on coral reefs and the marine environment, and to devise ways of minimizing or eliminating the negative effects of <b>land-based</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R

40|$|The dual {{relationship}} existing between <b>land-based</b> <b>activities</b> {{and climate}} change has long been established. <b>Land-based</b> <b>activities</b> are responsible for about 30 % (IPCC) of global GHG emissions and are {{at the same time}} particularly impacted by climate change as they are strongly dependent on weather patterns. Although physical and technical considerations may help to investigate these two kinds of issues, economic considerations are crucial to understand how agricultural producers react to climate change and to climate policies. Quantitative economic models are appropriate tools to examine these interactions and to understand how they influence human activities and ecosystems. However, there are many different economic models with different characteristics regarding the way economies are modelled, the way climate change is considered in the models and the way GHG emissions are accounted for. All these specificities determine the type of uses that each model can be employed for.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of REDD+, and the {{national}} action plan on emission reduction under the context of NAMA, {{as well as the}} potential for increased financial flows into rich carbon landscapes, {{the question of how to}} relate national commitment to the local context and implementation is more important than ever. Rather than focusing on short-term emission reduction strategies, the debate has shifted to a new form of ‘clean development ’ strategies that focus on the combination of maintaining high carbon stocks, involving low carbon flows and yet achieving development goals. LUWES is a platform for multiple stakeholder process to decide on a land use plan for sustainable development purposes that can reduce green house gas emission from <b>land-based</b> <b>activity</b> while at the same time maintaining economic growth. It also recognizes the impact of land use allocation policies and distributions to tenure and livelihood. LUWES offers a set of principles, steps and tools (including a Java-based software, ABACUS SP) to help multi-stakeholders to negotiate the land use plans by entertaining scenarios that can be developed together. Tools such as RaTA (Rapid Land Tenure Assessment), RaCSA (Rapid Carbon Stock Appraisal) and RESFA (REDD/REALU Site Feasibility Appraisal) are being included during multiple stakeholder process. This booklet draws on examples from sites in Indonesia where LUWES has been applied. LUWES is designed as a generic tool for rural land use planning in tropical countries...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSurface {{seawater}} and surficial sediment {{samples were}} collected from the Egyptian Mediterranean beach during May 2010 to study the impact of <b>land-based</b> <b>activity</b> {{on the distribution of}} mercury and tin. Hg and Sn were analyzed by using Hydride system MH 10 coupled with atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The obtained data indicated that Nile Delta, Port Said and Alexandria beaches, which are the most industrialized areas in the Egyptian Mediterranean Sea, showed high levels of mercury in water compared to other studied sites. These areas receive huge amounts of wastes from many sources. Sinai side and north coast beaches could be used as reference sites, as they are almost uncontaminated without harmful outfalls. In the same context, Alexandria beach showed the absolute high level of tin in water (1. 225 μg/l), while the minimum level was recorded at Port Said area (0. 226 μg/l). On the other hand, the highest mean value of Hg in sediments (14. 938 ng/g) was found in Sinai Beach and Sn (1. 414 μg/g) was at Alexandria beach. ANOVA analysis was used to show the difference in the concentration of Hg and Sn in water and sediments throughout the different studied Parts.

Here, we quantify the global cumulative impact of four of the most pervasive land-based impacts on coastal ecosystems—nutrient input, organic and inorganic pollution, and the direct impact of coastal populations (e. g., coastal engineering and trampling) —and identify hotspots of land-based impact {{using a variety of}} metrics. These threat hotspots were primarily in Europe and Asia, with the top three adjacent to the Mississippi, Ganges, and Mekong rivers. We found that 95 % of coastal and shelf areas (< 200 m depth) and 40 % of the global coastline experience little to no impact from <b>land-based</b> human <b>activities,</b> suggesting that marine conservation and resource management in these areas can focus on managing current ocean activities and preventing future spread of land-based stressors.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of global land management alternatives in determining potential greenhouse gas mitigation by <b>land-based</b> <b>activities</b> in agriculture and forestry. <b>Land-based</b> <b>activities</b> are responsible for {{over a third of}} global greenhouse gas emissions, yet the economics of land-use decisions have not been explicitly modeled in global mitigation studies. In this paper, we develop a new, general equilibrium framework which effectively captures the opportunity costs of land-use decisions in agriculture and forestry, thereby allowing us to analyse competition for heterogeneous land types across and within sectors, as well as input substitution between land and other factors of production. When land-using sectors are confronted with a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, we find significant changes in the global pattern of comparative advantage across sectors, regions, and land types. Globally, we find that forest carbon sequestration is the dominant strategy for GHG emissions mitigation, while agricultural-related mitigation comes predominantly from reduced methane emissions in the ruminant livestock sector, followed by fertilizer and methane emissions from paddy rice. Regionally, agricultural mitigation is a larger share of total land-use emissions abatement in the USA and China, compared {{to the rest of the}} world, and, within agriculture, disproportionately from reductions in fertilizer-related emissions. The results also show how analyses that only consider regional mitigation, may bias mitigation potential by ignoring global market interactions. For example, USA-specific analyses likely over-estimate the potential for abatement in agriculture. Finally, we note that this general equilibrium framework provides the research community with a practical methodology for explicit modeling of global land competition and land-based mitigation in comprehensive assessments of greenhouse gas mitigation options.
