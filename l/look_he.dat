5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Hack, Starflight and the Ultima series were Adams' main influences. The roguelike Hack (1985) {{because of}} its {{randomly}} generated levels, deceased character persistence and detailed mechanics. Adams cited Ultima series as the inspiration for his generated worlds. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. He said midpoint displacement generates the elevation {{of the world and}} its initial basic elements use fractals, which give it an overall natural <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> further explained that he made an algorithm to simulate rain shadows which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from NEO PI-R test of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of carps eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. A part of the game he felt tough, was implementing an A* search algorithm for pathfinding in any in-game character which, depending on their numbers and complexity of the path, can cause a heavy load on a computer. Adams composed the game's flamenco-inspired music.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} Mortal Kombat gave Anderson free rein to choose his next project, the science fiction action film Soldier, written by Blade Runner screenwriter David Peoples. Peoples' script - and {{eventually}} the film itself - contains references to his work on Blade Runner, and can {{be considered to be}} taking place in the same universe, as a sidequel or standalone sequel of sorts. Kurt Russell became attached to star, but decided to take some time off to build up his body, as required by the role, which delayed the production. In the meantime, Anderson directed the 1997 science fiction horror film Event Horizon, which was written by Philip Eisner and stars Laurence Fishburne and Sam Neill. Despite attaining praise about its visuals and production design, the film wasn't received well by critics, or audiences (D+ on a Cinemascore poll), and failed to break even, which Anderson blamed on a tight post-production schedule and studio-enforced cuts. Event Horizon later sold well on home video and gained a small cult following. Plans to complete a director's cut that would restore the deleted footage came to a stop when it was discovered most of it had been lost or degraded. Soldier was eventually completed and released in 1998, but was an exceptionally big critical and commercial disaster, making below $15 million in the US, on a budget of $60 million, and releasing straight-to-video in several other markets. Anderson has expressed his regret about the planned shoot on locations being changed to studio soundstages when the El Ni√±o hurricane swooped in, which ended up compromising the film's <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> also verbalized his disappointment with Warner Bros., who, he believes, tried to market the film to the same male teen audience as Mortal Kombat, rather than grown-up audiences, which would include women.|$|E
500|$|David Self, {{who created}} the Maguire character, explained, [...] "He gets so jaded from {{exposure}} to this world, he steps over the line from being the storyteller to being the story maker." [...] To capture the [...] "seedy countenance" [...] of the character, Jude Law was given a sallow skin tone that reflected the wear from working in a darkroom. Law's teeth also received a lower gumline and had a rotted <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> was also given a weak, thinning hairline. Maguire's apartment also displays a collection of photographs of dead bodies, some of them actual police stills from the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Deakins {{described}} {{the look of}} the fantasy scenes as being very crisp, monochromatic, and highly lit in order to afford greater depth of focus. However, with the Dude's apartment, Deakins said, [...] "it's kind of seedy and the light's pretty nasty" [...] with a grittier look. The visual bridge between these two different looks was how he photographed the night scenes. Instead of adopting the usual blue moonlight or blue street lamp <b>look,</b> <b>he</b> used an orange sodium-light effect. The Coen brothers shot a lot of the film with wide-angle lens because, according to Joel, it made it easier to hold focus for a greater depth and it made camera movements more dynamic.|$|E

500|$|Manish Malhotra and Aki Narula {{designed}} Dostana costumes (Malhotra for Chopra and Narula for {{the rest}} of the cast). It was Malhotra's second time working with Chopra; the first was for Andaaz (2003). Since the film was set in Miami, he decided on a holiday look; Chopra's character, a fashion editor, would wear stylish, chic clothes. The actress had [...] "a lot of shorts, tank tops, tees, formal jackets and bikini tops", and her wardrobe had a [...] "beach vibe." [...] Malhotra gave her a very young, [...] "girlie" [...] <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> designed clean lines with lots of colours, toning down Chopra's accessories: [...] "You will notice that none of her dresses have any embroidery or designs either. All her outfits are mainly in satin, chiffon and georgette." ...|$|E
500|$|Corbie Dillard at Nintendo Life {{criticized the}} Wii version for using resized {{graphics}} from the Nintendo DS version without doing any [...] "touch-ups", {{resulting in a}} pixelated <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> also disliked the Wii Remote-based gameplay changes, {{saying that they were}} annoying for people who have already played the portable versions of the game. Lucas M. Thomas at IGN also found it disappointing how the graphics, audio and content had not been changed at all compared to the Nintendo DS release, saying that the visuals did not look attractive when resized to fit a larger screen; he concluded that it did not seem like the Wii version had been given [...] "any extra love and attention at all". Marissa Meli at GameZone called it a [...] "3/10 interpretation of a 9/10 title", saying that the pixelated graphics made the game look ugly and shoddy.|$|E
500|$|Alaina Huffman {{auditioned for}} Smallville without {{being aware of}} which role was being cast, and was offered the part of Dinah Lance/Black Canary. When the {{producers}} informed her of how major this character is to the DC mythology, Huffman used various comic books and online sources {{to learn more about}} her character. Approached by the producers, Phil Morris auditioned twice for the role of John Jones/Martian Manhunter, and then waited three weeks before receiving confirmation of the role. Morris relished the new design of the character, stepping away from the cape and tights, and going with a more contemporary <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> classified John Jones as Jor-El's [...] "tool, security force, his guardian, and his protector". The actor has stated that he would like his character to lead the future Justice League on the show, as he sees John Jones as a natural leader.|$|E

500|$|Arthur Max {{designed}} the sets {{such as the}} alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the Prometheus and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and {{to know where the}} CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the Prometheus, Max researched NASA and European Space Agency spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> said that he wanted [...] "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy." ...|$|E
500|$|Alfredson has {{described}} the casting process as {{the most difficult part}} of making the film. He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads, and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were supposed to <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be [...] "mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like two sides of the same coin." [...] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that [...] "asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the right people to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together." [...] In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being [...] "extremely intelligent", [...] "incredibly wise", and [...] "unprecedentedly fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitu√© John Lydon {{wearing a}} Pink Floyd T-shirt {{with the words}} I Hate {{handwritten}} above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon {{to come to a}} nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, [...] "He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole‚Äîbut smart." [...] When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon. Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: ...|$|E

500|$|After {{featuring}} opposite Vidya Balan in {{the romantic}} comedy Kismat Konnection (2008), Kapoor played twin brothers, {{one with a}} lisp {{and the other with}} a stutter, in Vishal Bhardwaj's critically acclaimed caper thriller Kaminey (2009). In preparation, Kapoor met speech specialists and researched on the medical and mental aspects of the two conditions. To create a lean physique for one of the brothers, a <b>look</b> <b>he</b> considered to be [...] "radically different" [...] from his personal appearance, Kapoor practiced functional training and followed a rigorous diet. Writing for Variety, critic Joe Leydon reviewed that Kapoor [...] "impressively displays sufficiently variegated degrees of emotional intensity to sustain the illusion of two distinct characters. Just as important, he provides each sibling an appropriately elevated hunkiness quotient." [...] Rediff.com listed Kapoor's performance as the best by a Bollywood actor in 2009 and he received a second Best Actor nomination at Filmfare. Kaminey earned over [...] worldwide. Kapoor's final release of 2009 was as a cricketer in Dil Bole Hadippa!, a romantic comedy co-starring Rani Mukerji. It was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, but was a financial failure.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} episode, the Eleventh Doctor still wears his {{previous}} incarnation's costume, but costume designer Ray Holman {{stated that the}} costume was broken down and distressed. Over {{the course of the}} first episode, he would find his own identity and pick out his defining costume. Smith tried {{on a wide variety of}} things to find a <b>look</b> <b>he</b> would feel comfortable and confident in and would identify his Doctor. Smith brought in braces and a tweed jacket; Holman believed that the tweed jacket was [...] "a bit old for him" [...] but showed that he was a [...] "professor and student at the same time" [...] and gave him [...] "that quality that the Doctor's still learning, but also has some authority". Smith suggested a bow tie, which Holman and others did not approve of, but once he had put it on they decided they had the costume. Smith stated he was inspired by the Second Doctor's costume after watching The Tomb of the Cybermen. Other influences included the [...] "element of a professor" [...] and [...] "big, dusty boots like Indiana Jones". The men's clothing store Topman reported that their bow tie sales had risen 94% for the month of April 2010, connected to when the series began airing.|$|E
500|$|Vaughn said he {{shot the}} film {{in a way it}} resembled the {{productions}} of the 1960s, with [...] "very traditional framing, and camera movement when it needs to move, not just throwing it around and whizz-bang", and using the anamorphic format [...] "to create a widescreen experience, which is emblematic of '60s movies, such as the James Bond films". The director had to hire five cinematographers - with sole credit being given to John Mathieson, who came halfway through the shoot and did [...] "forty-five percent, fifty-five percent" [...] of the film - and four assistant directors to successfully convey the <b>look</b> <b>he</b> wanted for the film. Visual effects supervisor Matt Johnson added that for the lighting of the digital interior of Cerebro, [...] "keeping with the '60s vibe, we put in some old school elements such as lens flare and chromatic aberration and edge fringing." [...] The aesthetics of the decade were also invoked by designers Simon Clowes and Kyle Cooper of Prologue Films, who were responsible for the end credits and tried to do something that [...] "could be done with traditional optical". The credits animation depicts DNA strands through simple geometric shapes, drawing inspiration from both Saul Bass and Maurice Binder's work in the Bond films.|$|E

500|$|Critics also praised Avatar: The Last Airbender {{character}} development, art, animation, and choreography, with Eric Amaya {{enjoying the}} expressive animation which complemented the writing. According to Amaya, the elements {{were influenced by}} Hayao Miyazaki. Todd Douglass, Jr. called the character development interesting. Jenifer Rosenburg praised the series' portrayal of females as [...] "strong, responsible, [...] intelligent". According to Joshua Miller, the bender characters' use of bending for everyday activities brings [...] "depth and believability" [...] to the avatar world. Miller called the series' designs [...] "rich and immersive", with each nation having its own, detailed <b>look.</b> <b>He</b> praised the action scenes as [...] "well rendered" [...] (comparing {{the development of the}} avatar world to The Lord of the Rings) and the fight choreography as [...] "wonderful in its most minor details". D. F. Smith enjoyed the series' painstaking backgrounds. [...] "Cricket" [...] Te praised each episode's color palette and the choreography's combination of martial arts and magic. Nick Hartel criticized the animation, although he found it an improvement over previous Nickelodeon shows. Chris Mitchell called the animation fluid. [...] "Cricket" [...] Te agreed, noting its manga influence. According to Brittany Lovely, non-bender characters in battle are [...] "overshadowed" [...] by their bender counterparts. Joe Corey called the animation's action and environments a [...] "great achievement", and Rob Keyes praised the series' fight choreography.|$|E
