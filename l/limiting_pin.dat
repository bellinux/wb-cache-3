40|$|The {{computing}} {{landscape is}} undergoing a major change, primarily enabled by ubiquitous wireless networks and the rapid increase {{in the use of}} mobile devices which access a web-based information infrastructure. It is expected that most intensive computing may either happen in servers housed in large datacenters (warehousescale computers), e. g., cloud computing and other web services, or in many-core high-performance computing (HPC) platforms in scientific labs. It is clear that the primary challenge to scaling such computing systems into the exascale realm is the efficient supply of large amounts of data to hundreds or thousands of compute cores, i. e., building an efficient memory system. Main memory systems are at an inflection point, due to the convergence of several major application and technology trends. Examples include the increasing importance of energy consumption, reduced access stream locality, increasing failure rates, <b>limited</b> <b>pin</b> counts, increasing heterogeneity and complexity, and the diminished importance of cost-per-bit.

40|$|The {{conventional}} exposed pad low-profile quad {{flat pack}} (E-pad LQFP) package {{is a low}} cost solution for multimedia chips, but its disadvantages are <b>limited</b> <b>pin</b> count and worse electrical characteristics. In order to increase their pin utilization rate and electrical characteristics for high-speed applications, an innovative leadframe package, named multiple exposed pads (M-pad) LQFP package, is proposed. By bonding all power and ground wires to their dedicated exposed pads, the leads originally bonded to the corresponding power and ground wires {{can be used as}} the spared leads for the other signals, or they can be just removed to reduce the lead numbers, and thus the size and cost of the M-pad leadframe package. The M-pad LQFP package was evaluated for manufacturing processes and electrical characteristics. The parasitics of power nets and S-parameters of high-speed differential signals were extracted using 3 D electromagnetic field solvers. The simulated power parasitics of M-pad LQFP are much lower than those of E-pad LQFP and BGA packages. The simulated differential S-parameters of M-pad LQFP also indicate less signal loss compared with those of E-pad LQFP. The co-simulation of chip-(M-pad) package-board with multi-Gbps serial link was performed with well-behaved eye-diagrams that conform to high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) specification...|$|R

40|$|The field-angular {{dependence}} and anisotropy {{of the critical}} current density in iron-based superconductors is evaluated using a phenomenological approach featuring distinct anisotropy factors for the penetration depth and the coherence length. Both the weak collective <b>pinning</b> <b>limit,</b> and the strong <b>pinning</b> <b>limit</b> relevant for iron-based superconductors at low magnetic fields are considered. It is found that in the more anisotropic materials, such as SmFeAsO and NdFeAsO, the field-angular dependence is completely dominated by the coherence-length (upper-critical field) anisotropy, thereby explaining recent results on the critical current in these materials. In less anisotropic superconductors, strong pinning can lead to an apparent inversion of the anisotropy. Finally, it is shown that, under all circumstances, the ratio of c-axis and ab-plane critical current densities for magnetic field along the ab-plane directly yields the coherence length anisotropy factor ϵξ.

40|$|Free space optical {{communication}} is gaining interest {{because of its}} various advantages like high data rate, high power efficiency, no license regulation etc. However, one has to overcome the challenge of distortion and fading caused by atmospheric turbulences and bad weather conditions. Free space {{optical communication}} channel is a time variant channel. Sometimes, the channel {{has a very good}} condition and sometimes atmospheric condition gets very bad. Variable data rate is an efficient solution to cope with such situations. The system would run at maximum data rate in good conditions and can be adapted to work at lower data rate in worse situations. This paper discusses about one of the techniques to lower the data rate called Delayed Frame Repetition (DFR) for fading channels. It reduces the user data rate while maintaining the same channel data rate. The basic idea is to retransmit the data after a delay which is greater than fading length of the channel. Similar to spatial diversity systems, different combining techniques like Selective Combining (SC), Maximum-Ratio Combining (MRC) and Equal-Gain Combining (EGC) are studied. Numerous simulations are presented for MRC technique considering thermal <b>limited</b> <b>PIN</b> detector as a receiver, and for channel modelling artificially generated power vectors that are based on real measurements are used. Overall results show that DFR can be very useful for fading channel. MRC being the most efficient combining technique, it is used for evaluating the performance of DFR for different channel conditions with good, medium, bad scintillation indices, and different delays between retransmitted frames...|$|R

Relaxation times, inertial moments, and <b>limits</b> on superfluid <b>pinning</b> parameters are extracted for three distinct regions of vortex pinning in the star, with results which are consistent with microscopic theories of its internal structure.
