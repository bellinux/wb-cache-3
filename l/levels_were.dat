50|$|One of {{her famous}} aphorisms compares the occidental {{economic}} model to a cake with four levels, with {{glass on the}} top: the first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> nature, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the subsistence economy, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> {{the public and private}} economy, and the last <b>level</b> <b>is</b> finance.|$|R
50|$|C4 <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> low and C3 <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> normal.|$|R
50|$|DDSN uses a {{capability}} {{model that}} consist of four levels. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Reacting, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Anticipating, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Collaborating {{and the last}} <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Orchestrating. The first two levels focus on the internal supply chain while the last two levels concentrate on external relations throughout the Extended Enterprise.|$|R
5|$|Pollution is a {{major concern}} in Kolkata. , sulphur dioxide and {{nitrogen}} dioxide annual concentration were within the national ambient air quality standards of India, but respirable suspended particulate matter <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> high, and on an increasing trend for five consecutive years, causing smog and haze. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-30 {{like all}} {{other parts of the}} state trunkline highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). MDOT calculates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. For 2009, the highest traffic <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> observed on the section north of US10 at 7,579vehicles per day. The lowest AADT <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> the 2,952vehicles between the M-61 junction and the Gladwin–Ogemaw county line. The survey did not include the section south of US10. No segment has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|Tom Horral, a Boston-based acoustician, blames {{complaints}} about modern movies being too loud on subwoofers. He says that before subwoofers {{made it possible}} to have loud, relatively undistorted bass, movie sound <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1473 in Cracow (Kraków), the {{printing}} business kept growing. By {{the turn of}} the 16th/17th century there were about 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in Cracow, the rest mostly in Danzig (Gdańsk), Thorn (Toruń) and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> falling, as {{by the end of the}} 16th century almost every parish ran a school.|$|E
50|$|The {{terminal}} has six stories, {{three of}} which are allocated for passenger processing. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for arrivals, the sixth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for departures, and the fourth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine <b>level</b> (which <b>is</b> the uppermost <b>level).</b>|$|R
30|$|Different <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} for centers and eventually one capacity <b>level</b> <b>is</b> selected for each center.|$|R
50|$|Points are tallied {{up at the}} end of each level, {{successful}} completion of which will unlock additional <b>levels.</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> rated in difficulty using a star system; one star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> relatively easy, while five star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> the most difficult.|$|R
5|$|Between December 2013 and November 2014, 1,289 {{criminal}} acts {{were reported in}} the policing neighbourhood of Sleaford Town (which includes Quarrington), of which 43.9% were classed as anti-social behaviour, making it the largest portion of reported crimes. In 2010, recorded crime <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> amongst {{the lowest in the}} country and, for the year ending June 2014, the crime rate in the North Kesteven district is the lowest in Lincolnshire at 24.38 crimes per thousand residents.|$|E

5|$|During Pointman I, {{commission}} researchers devised ways {{to determine}} small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels {{could only be}} found in the adipose (fat) tissue. The project studied dioxin (TCDD) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> found to be higher in the former group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> square mazes {{that grow}} larger as the player descends, {{simulating}} {{the design of}} a pyramid. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 3x3, totalling 9 squares. Each succeeding <b>level</b> <b>is</b> one step larger in each dimension (so the next <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 4x4 steps, for a total of 16 squares, and so on). A key on each must be found to unlock the next <b>level.</b> Ascension <b>is</b> impossible, which can strand players if an important item is left behind.|$|R
5000|$|Estradiol and LH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{dramatically}} elevated due to loss {{of negative}} feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. FSH <b>levels,</b> in contrast, <b>are</b> normal. Testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> also substantially elevated. Prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> decreased by 5-fold, which {{is due to}} a loss of its estradiol-induced secretion from the anterior pituitary.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 2009, the {{basement}} <b>level</b> <b>was</b> flooded when Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) battered the capital.

The basement <b>level</b> <b>was</b> temporarily closed for several days.|$|R
5|$|During {{the winter}} and spring, when the water <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> higher, otters had a greater {{tendency}} to prey upon crayfish (73% of scats had crayfish remains) rather than fish. However, when water levels are lower, crayfish will seek out shelter while fish become more highly concentrated and susceptible to predation. Therefore, fish are more vulnerable to being preyed upon by otters because the crayfish have become more difficult to obtain.|$|E
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> much lower. The present range of Tapanuli orangutans {{is thought to be}} close to the point where ancestral orangutans first entered what is now Indonesia from mainland Asia.|$|E

The Lost Levels was released for Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console digital platform in 2007 (partially in support of Nintendo's Hanabi Festival), and the 3DS version followed in 2012. The Wii U Virtual Console release came to Japan in 2013, and to Europe and North America the next year. The Lost <b>Levels</b> <b>were</b> also included in Nintendo classic game compilations including the 2014 NES Remix 2 (Wii U) and Ultimate NES Remix (3DS).|$|E
50|$|Zimbabwe's {{public health}} care is {{delivered}} at four <b>levels,</b> which <b>are</b> meant {{to function as a}} referral chain.

The station building burned down in 1983, but the MBTA built replacement platforms and ramps in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{impacting}} the Philippines, Public Storm Warning Signals #3 and #4, the two highest <b>levels,</b> <b>were</b> {{raised for}} several provinces in Luzon. Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services for quick recovery efforts. With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam, officials planned to evacuate 218,000people; however, Cimaron's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended. Officials in Thailand and southern China also advised residents of possible {{effects from the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the Games, the International Olympic Committee was keen to play down the risk that athletes faced from pollution; however, the {{organizing}} body considered rescheduling of endurance events (such as the cycling road race) if the pollution <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> too high. Athletes partaking in these events can consume 20 times the amount of oxygen as a sedentary person. A higher level of pollution in the air could adversely affect performance, damage or irritate an athlete's lungs, or exacerbate respiratory conditions, such as asthma.|$|E
50|$|The upper <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 254 ft above mean {{sea level}} (AMSL) and the lower <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 173 feet AMSL.|$|R
