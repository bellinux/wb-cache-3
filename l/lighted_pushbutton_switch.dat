5000|$|In most wired systems, {{a button}} on the outside next to the door, located around the height of the doorknob, {{activates}} a signaling device (usually a chime, bell, or buzzer) inside the building. Pressing the doorbell button, a single-pole, single-throw (SPST) <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch</b> momentarily closes the doorbell circuit. One terminal of this button is wired to a terminal on a transformer. A doorbell transformer steps down the 120 or 240-volt AC electrical power to a lower voltage, typically 10 to 20 volts. The transformer's other terminal connects to one of three terminals on the signaling device. Another terminal is connected to a wire that travels to the other terminal on the button. Some signaling devices have a third terminal, which produces a different sound. If there is another doorbell button (typically near a back door), it is connected between the transformer and the third terminal. The transformer primary winding, being energized continuously, does consume a small amount (about 1 to 2 W) of standby power constantly; systems with <b>lighted</b> <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switches</b> may consume a similar amount of power per switch. [...] The tradeoff is that the wiring to the button carries only safe, low voltage isolated from earth ground.|$|R

40|$|A human's {{ability to}} perform {{physical}} tasks is limited, not only by his intelligence, but by his physical strength. If, in an appropriate environment, a machine's mechanical power is closely integrated with a human arm's mechanical power {{under the control of}} the human intellect, the resulting system will be superior to a loosely integrated combination of a human and a fully automated robot. Therefore, we must develop a fundamental solution to the problem of 'extending' human mechanical power. The work presented here defines 'extenders' as a class of robot manipulators worn by humans to increase human mechanical strength, while the wearer's intellect remains the central control system for manipulating the extender. The human, in physical contact with the extender, exchanges power and information signals with the extender. The aim is to determine the fundamental building blocks of an intelligent controller, a controller which allows interaction between humans and a broad class of computer-controlled machines via simultaneous exchange of both power and information signals. The prevalent trend in automation has been to physically separate the human from the machine so the human must always send information signals via an intermediary device (e. g., joystick, <b>pushbutton,</b> <b>light</b> <b>switch).</b> Extenders, however are perfect examples of self-powered machines that are built and controlled for the optimal exchange of power and information signals with humans. The human wearing the extender is in physical contact with the machine, so power transfer is unavoidable and information signals from the human help to control the machine. Commands are transferred to the extender via the contact forces and the EMG signals between the wearer and the extender. The extender augments human motor ability without accepting any explicit commands: it accepts the EMG signals and the contact force between the person's arm and the extender, and the extender 'translates' them into a desired position. In this unique configuration, mechanical power transfer between the human and the extender occurs because the human is pushing against the extender. The extender transfers to the human's hand, in feedback fashion, a scaled-down version of the actual external load which the extender is manipulating. This natural feedback force on the human's hand allows him to 'feel' a modified version of the external forces on the extender. The information signals from the human (e. g., EMG signals) to the computer reflect human cognitive ability, and the power transfer between the human and the machine (e. g., physical interaction) reflects human physical ability. Thus the information transfer to the machine augments cognitive ability, and the power transfer augments motor ability. These two actions are coupled through the human cognitive/motor dynamic behavior. The goal is to derive the control rules for a class of computer-controlled machines that augment human physical and cognitive abilities in certain manipulative tasks...|$|R

40|$|Apparatus for {{multiplexing}} switch state signals comprises {{a plurality}} of switches and parallel weighted resistors connected in series between circuit ground and a node at a utilization device. The resistors are weighted {{as a function of}} a power of the same base, such as the power of the base 2, for coding the multiplexed switch state signals. A constant current source connected between the node and circuit ground drives current over a single cable conductor through the resistor. Each switch may be independently closed to change the switch state voltage signals multiplexed to the node. An analog-to-digital converter connected between the node and circuit ground demultiplexes the switch state signals received at the node and provides a switch state signal at each analog-to-digital output corresponding to the state of the switches at the moment. A potentiometer may replace a resistor and bypass switch combination in a position where the potentiometer has a maximum value of the lowest power of the base in order to multiplex a true analog voltage signal while switch state signals are unambiguously coded and multiplexed. The potentiometer in the least significant position permits the analog value to be in the range from 0 to a maximum corresponding to the least significant position of the switch state encoding.

The device generates pressure pulses of known amplitude. A pressure pulse (in contradistinction to a steady pressure) is needed because {{in the presence of}} a steady pressure, the electrical output of a piezoelectric pressure transducer decays rapidly with time. The device includes a stainless- steel compressed-air-storage cylinder of 500 cu cm volume. A manual hand pump with check valves and a pressure gauge are located at one end of the cylinder. A three-way solenoid valve that controls the release of pressurized air is located at the other end of the cylinder. Power for the device is provided by a 3. 7 -V cordless-telephone battery. The valve is controlled by means of a <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch,</b> which activates a 5 V to +/- 15 V DC-to-DC converter that powers the solenoid. The outlet of the solenoid valve is connected to the pressure transducer to be tested. Before the solenoid is energized, the transducer to be tested is at atmospheric pressure. When the solenoid is actuated by the push button, pressurized air from inside the cylinder is applied to the transducer. Once the pushbutton is released, the cylinder pressure is removed from the transducer and the pressurized air applied to the transducer is vented, bringing the transducer back to atmospheric pressure.

40|$|Abstract: For {{applications}} that require {{less than a}} keyboard or numeric keypad, this simple circuit monitors multiple <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switches</b> using a single multi-channel 1 -wire addressable switch (DS 2408), and a few external components. A similar {{version of this article}} appeared in the September 9, 2010 issue of EDN magazine. Keyboards and numeric keypads often provide the user interface for electronic equipment, but many applications require {{only a small number of}} pushbuttons. For those, you can monitor multiple pushbuttons over a single pair of wires (Figure 1). Figure 1. Connected to a microcontroller, this circuit can monitor 8 pushbuttons using only two wires. The multichannel, 1 -Wire ® addressable switch (U 1, DS 2408) provides input/output ports P 0 –P 7, which in this application serve as inputs. The high-valued resistors (R PD) connect these ports to ground to ensure a defined logic state (0), and D 1 –C 1 forms a local power supply that steals energy from the 1 -Wire communication line. When you press a pushbutton, it connects the corresponding port to the local supply voltage, which is equivalent to logic 1. This change of state sets the port's activity latch (see data sheet). Conditional Search Polling As a 1 -Wire slave device, U 1 does not initiate communications. Instead, the master (typically a microcontroller) polls the 1 -Wire line. To minimize overhead, U 1 supports a 1 -Wire network function called "conditional search. " Before using that function, however, you must configure U 1 according to the needs of the application. That includes defining the qualifying input ports (channel selection), specifying the polarity of the qualifying ports (channel polarity selection), choosing between pin or activity latch for the port, an...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This note {{discusses}} {{the effects on}} switches when used to connect loads. High currents through a switch degrade its quality when used as a power switch. Both mechanical switches and relays exhibit switch bounce during operation. The MAX 6816 /MAX 6817 /MAX 6818 provide switch debouncing and ± 15 kV ESD protection. Designing the external interface to an industrial or automotive application can be challenging for an uninitiated systems engineer. The bouncing of switch and relay contacts can produce arcs that threaten system reliability. Electrostatic discharge (ESD) can also threaten reliability and uptime. The purpose of this discussion is to ease the task of designing an interface between the inputs of a microcontroller and a hostile industrial or automotive environment. Switch Bounce The ideal switch operation depicted in most textbooks—a single transition that occurs instantly on actuation, followed by zero on-resistance—has never existed! Real switches exhibit a finite resistance called "contact resistance, " that increases over time {{with the number of}} switch actuations. Contact resistance for a new switch ranges from less than 50 mΩ to 100 mΩ, depending on the contact material, power loading, environmental conditions, and switch usage. As a switch changes state, its contacts travel through several open-close cycles called "contact bounce " before coming to rest in the final state. In some cases, this rapid contact bounce produces a changing resistance as the moving contact wipes across the stationary contact. In Figure 1, a <b>pushbutton</b> <b>switch</b> supplies 24 V (a typical industrial-control voltage) to the resistor. Notice that at least four major switching transitions occur before the output comes to rest at 24 V. To a digital control system, these transitions could be interpreted as four separate contact closures. Figure 1. Switch contact bounce and test circuit. Contact bounce is not acceptable, because automotive- and industrial-control systems require accurate, realtime data in the form of definite state changes.
