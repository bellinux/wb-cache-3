5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two Polaris nuclear ballistic missile <b>launchers</b> with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM <b>launchers</b> with eighty missiles per launcher and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM <b>launchers</b> with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942 heavy Guards mortar battalions {{were formed}} around the new M-30 static rocket launch frames, {{consisting}} of 96 <b>launchers</b> in three batteries. In July, {{a battalion of}} BM-13s {{was added to the}} establishment of a tank corps. In 1944, the BM-31 was used in motorized heavy Guards mortar battalions of 48 <b>launchers.</b> In 1943, Guards mortar brigades, and later divisions, were formed equipped with static <b>launchers.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1942, 57 regiments were in service—together {{with the}} smaller {{independent}} battalions, this {{was the equivalent of}} 216 batteries: 21% BM-8 light <b>launchers,</b> 56% BM-13, and 23% M-30 heavy <b>launchers.</b> By the end of the war, the equivalent of 518 batteries were in service.|$|E
50|$|The {{launching}} station contains {{four major}} equipment subsystems: the <b>launcher</b> generator set, the <b>launcher</b> electronics module (LEM), the <b>launcher</b> mechanics assembly (LMA), and the <b>launcher</b> interconnection group (LIG). The generator set {{consists of a}} 15 kW, 400 Hz generator that powers the <b>launcher.</b> The LEM {{is used for the}} real-time implementation of <b>launcher</b> operations requested via data link from the ECS. The LMA physically erects and rotates the <b>launcher's</b> platform and its missiles. The LIG connects the missiles themselves to the <b>launcher</b> via the <b>Launcher</b> Missile Round Distributor (LMRD).|$|R
5000|$|In New START:----The term [...] "deployed <b>launcher</b> of ICBMs" [...] {{means an}} ICBM <b>launcher</b> that {{contains}} an ICBM {{and is not}} an ICBM testlauncher, an ICBM training <b>launcher,</b> or an ICBM <b>launcher</b> located at a space launch facility.|$|R
50|$|There {{also is a}} soda/beer can <b>launcher.</b> Unlike {{the golf}} ball <b>launcher</b> that screws onto {{the end of the}} barrel, where the AR-15/m16 family of rifles' flash hider attaches, the can <b>launcher</b> tube is fitted {{directly}} to the AR-15 upper receiver and is the entire barrel assembly. Both the golf ball <b>launcher</b> and can <b>launcher</b> require use of blank ammunition.|$|R
5|$|Multiple rocket launcher: The first {{multiple}} rocket <b>launchers</b> {{were made}} during the medieval Chinese Song dynasty. It was designed to launch multiple rocket arrows from a gunpowder box. These also appeared later, in an expanded version, in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea, where they were used with great effectiveness against the Japanese invasions of 1592–98, most notably the Battle of Haengju. Multiple rocket <b>launchers</b> evolved from Chinese fire lances when the Song military favored multiple rocket <b>launchers</b> that fired simultaneously up to 100 small fire-arrow rockets after the Mongol siege of Kaifeng. The typical powder section of such an arrow-rocket was 1/3 and 1/2 ft (10 to 15 cm) long. Bamboo arrow shafts varied from 1.5 ft (45 cm) to 2.5 ft (75 cm) long and the striking distance reached 300 to 400 paces. The Chinese also enhanced rocket tips with poison and made sure that the <b>launchers</b> were also mobile. Song Chinese rocket designers designed multiple rocket <b>launchers</b> that could be carried and operated by a single soldier.|$|E
5|$|The Mogador-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} for anti-surface warfare rather than anti-submarine work and {{they were given a}} large torpedo battery in consequence. Two triple Modèle 1928T torpedo <b>launchers</b> were fitted on each beam between the funnels and two twin Modèle 1928D <b>launchers</b> were located on the beam, abaft the second funnel. The placement of each launcher on the beam significantly increased each launcher's arc of fire (25° to 150°) in comparison to the Le Fantastaques centerline mount (60°-100°). However this was not without cost as her torpedo broadside was weaker by one tube than the older class, but the extra <b>launchers</b> positioned close to the ship's side imposed, more importantly, a weight and stability penalty.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} rocket <b>launchers</b> were {{top secret}} {{in the beginning}} of World War II. A special unit of the NKVD troops was raised to operate them. On July 14, 1941, an experimental artillery battery of seven <b>launchers</b> was first used in battle at Orsha in Vitebsk Province of Belarus, under the command of Captain Ivan Flyorov, destroying a concentration of German troops with tanks, armored vehicles and trucks at the marketplace, causing massive German Army casualties and its retreat from the town in panic. Following the success, the Red Army organized new Guards mortar batteries for the support of infantry divisions. A battery's complement was standardized at four <b>launchers.</b> They remained under NKVD control until German Nebelwerfer rocket <b>launchers</b> became common later in the war.|$|E

50|$|A {{version of}} ADW.Launcher, an {{alternative}} <b>launcher</b> (home screen) for the Android operating system, became the default <b>launcher</b> on CyanogenMod 5.0.8. The <b>launcher</b> provides additional features not {{provided by the}} default Android <b>launcher,</b> including more customization abilities (including icon themes, effects, and behavior), the ability to backup and restore configuration settings, and other features. As of version 9, CyanogenMod's own <b>launcher,</b> Trebuchet, is included with the firmware.|$|R
5|$|The {{success and}} economy of {{multiple}} rocket <b>launchers</b> (MRL) have {{led them to}} continue to be developed. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union fielded several models of Katyusha-like MRL, notably the BM-21 <b>launchers</b> somewhat inspired by the earlier weapon, and the larger BM-27. Advances in artillery munitions have been applied to some Katyusha-type multiple launch rocket systems, including bomblet submunitions, remotely deployed land mines, and chemical warheads.|$|E

5|$|During the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah fired between 3,970 and 4,228 rockets, {{from light}} truck-mounts and single-rail man-portable <b>launchers.</b> About 95% {{of these were}} 122mm (4.8in) Syrian-manufactured M-21OF type {{artillery}} rockets which carried warheads up to 30kg (66lb) and had a range of 20km, perhaps up to 30km (19mi). Hamas has launched 122-mm Grad-type Katyusha rockets from the Gaza Strip against several cities in Israel, although they are not reported to have truck-mounted <b>launchers.</b> Although Katyusha originally referred to the mobile launcher, today the rockets are {{often referred to as}} Katyushas.|$|E

5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{testing of}} the rocket <b>launchers</b> {{took place at the}} end of 1938, when 233 rounds of various types were used. A salvo of rockets could completely straddle a target at a range of 5,500 metres (3.4mi). But the artillery branch was not fond of the Katyusha, because it took up to 50 minutes to load and fire 24 rounds, while a conventional howitzer could fire 95 to 150 rounds in the same time. Testing with various rockets was conducted through 1940, and the BM-13-16 with launch rails for sixteen rockets was authorized for production. Only forty <b>launchers</b> were built before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.|$|E

5000|$|... 9P110 - Tank {{destroyer}} {{equipped with}} 9К14М <b>launcher</b> for 6×9M14 [...] "Malyutka" [...] (AT-3 Sagger) ATGM. Production started in 1963. This vehicle, just like 2P27 and 2P32, has superstructure {{in the rear}} where the missile <b>launcher</b> is hidden. However, as the <b>launcher's</b> compartment is smaller the vehicle retains the characteristic rear of the BRDM-1. The mechanism of deploying the <b>launcher</b> was also simplified. Now {{it is just a}} matter of finding a suitable site and elevating the <b>launcher.</b> One of the visually distinguishing features between this tank destroyer from 2P27 and 2P32 after the <b>launcher</b> has been deployed is the fact that the latter ones don't have the overhead protection for the <b>launcher</b> once it's in firing position.|$|R

For primary air defence, a pair of two 3S-90 <b>launchers</b> (one forward of the bridge and the other atop the dual helicopter hangar) are fitted with the Shtil SAM system. The system consists of 24 Russian Shtil missiles in a below-deck magazine. The <b>launchers</b> elevate up to 70°, with a firing arc of 30° within the centreline. The launcher groups, which require a 20-man crew, weigh about 50 tons.|$|E

If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the decontamination units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket <b>launchers</b> in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 <b>launchers</b> and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly decontamination units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Missouri was {{outfitted}} with 40mm grenade <b>launchers</b> and 25mm chain guns {{and sent to}} take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the Persian Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment– a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile <b>launchers.</b>|$|E
