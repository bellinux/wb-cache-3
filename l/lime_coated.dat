40|$|We {{investigated}} the efficacy and the residual effect of fipronil ® against {{two species of}} triatomine bugs, Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius neglectus, in laboratory conditions measuring concentration-response and residual activ-ity on different surfaces (dried mud and <b>lime</b> <b>coated</b> mud). Lethal concentrations (LC 50, 90) were determined on filter paper. The higher insecticide efficacy against R. neglectus when compared to T. infestans may be partially attrib-uted to the differences in their biological cycles and genetic structures. Comparison with lambdacyhalothrin wet-table powder showed that fipronil mortality rates (above 50 %) were observed on mud blocks and lime-coated mud blocks up to 3 months when fipronil was sprayed at 100 and 200 mg a. i. /m 2. Residual effect deeply decayed after 3 months; and at 6 months post treatment mortality was not observed. In contrast, lambdacyhalothrin showed a long lasting residual effect on both surfaces up to 6 months. Also, it should be mentioned that fipronil had a slow, but lethal activity on the triatomine bugs when wettable formulations were used on porous surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Chlorine gas is {{traditionally}} used for fluxing of aluminum melt for removal of alkali and alkaline earth elements. However {{this results in}} undesirable emissions of particulate matter and gases such as HCl and chlorine, which are often at unacceptable levels. Additionally, chlorine gas is highly toxic and its handling, storage, and use pose risks to employees and the local community. Holding of even minimal amounts of chlorine necessitates extensive training for all plant employees. Fugitive emissions from chlorine usage within the plant cause accelerated corrosion of plant equipment. The Secondary Aluminum Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) under the Clean Air Act, finalized in March 2000 has set very tough new limits on particulate matter (PM) and total hydrogen chloride emissions from aluminum melting and holding furnaces. These limits are 0. 4 and 0. 1 lbs per ton of aluminum for hydrogen chloride and particulate emissions, respectively. Assuming new technologies for meeting these limits can be found, additional requirements under the Clean Air Act (Prevention of Significant Deterioration and New Source Review) trigger Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for new sources with annual emissions (net emissions not expressed per ton of production) over specified amounts. BACT currently is <b>lime</b> <b>coated</b> bag-houses for control of particulate and HCl emissions. These controls are expensive, difficult to operate and maintain, and result in reduced American competitiveness in the global economy. Solid salt fluxing is emerging as a viable option for the replacement of chlorine gas fluxing, provided emissions can be consistently maintained below the required levels. This project was a cooperative effort between the Ohio State University and Alcoa to investigate and optimize the effects of solid chloride flux addition in molten metal for alkali impurity and non-metallic inclusion removal minimizing dust and toxic emissions and maximizing energy conservation. In this program, the salt metal interactions were studies and the emissions at laboratory scale at OSU were monitored. The goal {{of the project was}} to obtain a fundamental understanding, based on first principles, of the pollutant formation that occurs when the salts are used in furnaces. This information will be used to control process parameters so that emissions are consistently below the required levels. The information obtained in these experiments will be used in industrial furnaces at aluminum plants and which will help in optimizing the process...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} set in the mixed farming area of {{north-eastern}} Victoria and south-eastern New South Wales in the 500 mm to 650 mm average annual rainfall zone, where farming rotations comprise crop production with a ley phase of subterranean pastures used to produce prime lambs. As a result of natural processes taking place in the ecosystem, soils in this area were mature and acidic prior to the commencement of agriculture. The attributes of those processes are explained as too are the processes which occurred during 150 years of agriculture that increased the rates of soil acidification, namely, nitrification leading to the production on NO 3 " and H+ ions then loss of NO 3 " ions by leaching along with the leaching of associated basic cations, accumulation of organic matter, and export of organic anions in plant and animal products. The problem presented by acid soils is two-fold. First, farm profitability can be reduced as a result of acid soils causing lower levels of plant production. Second, once soil acidity falls to pH 4, increasing concentrations of H+ ions are buffered by exchangeable monomeric aluminium ions. The source of aluminium is their release from alumino-silicate lattices on the dissolution of clay colloid soil particles. Thus, apart from leading to losses in agricultural profitability, increasing soil acidity is implicated in problems related to soil degradation. Aspects relating to those two problems are discussed at length in this thesis. Even though it has long been known that problems arising from increasing rates of soil acidification can be solved by spreading lime, many farmers have not used lime on acidifying soils, partly because in their judgement, the marginal costs of this simple remedy would outweigh its marginal benefits in the current situation. Instead, the symptoms of soil acidification are treated by alternative means such as using other management systems like growing acid tolerant crops and establishing subterranean clover pastures by sowing <b>lime</b> <b>coated</b> seed inoculated with rhizobia bacteria with fertiliser containing molybdenum. Thus the problem of increasing soil acidification continues and farmers do not have the choice of including acid-sensitive crops in their farm plans. In this study, the approach used to analyse these problems was to first explore scientific and technological aspects of using lime to halt continuing rates of soil acidity. The practical aspects of farmers introducing various liming options into their existing farm plans were examined. Farm management budgets were then used to analyse the economic and financial merit of various liming options. These budgets used break-even analyses and were performed over a period of twenty years to capture the full implications of liming on the management of the whole farm business. The base scientific data used in this thesis, came from an experiment performed by Slattery and Coventry (1993) where they conducted field trials on four soils commonly used for mixed farming in the study area, to confirm the theoretical lime requirement model developed by Hochman et al. (1989). Of the four soils tested by Slattery and Coventry (1993), three proved to have a high correlation with lime requirements predicted by Hochman et al. (1989). These were a Chromosol (red brown earth), a Sodosol (red podsolic solodic) and a Kurosol (red podsolic earth) and their characteristics with respect to change in pH in response to various amounts of applied lime and grain yields at different soil pH values were used in this study. The economic analyses of scientific data translated to solving a practical farm management problem revealed that under certain circumstances, there can be net benefits from liming acid soils used to produce acid-tolerant crops grown in rotation with subterranean clover pasture for prime lamb production, and greater net benefits become possible when acid-sensitive crops such as canola and faba beans are substituted for acid-tolerant crops of wheat and triticale. Finally, the recommendation was made that relatively simple farm management budgets, like those used for the analyses in this thesis, which capture the full effect on management of the whole farm from introducing new management strategies, would have a useful role in programs to provide farmers with information about net benefits, in both a business and environmental sense, which may flow from liming acid soils.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this {{investigation}} is the development and testing of {{a new type of}} greenhouse with an integrated linear Fresnel lens, receiver module and an innovative system for tracking to exploit all direct radiation in a solar energy system. The basic idea of this horticultural application is to develop a greenhouse for pot plants (typical shadow plants) that do not like direct radiation. Removing all direct radiation will drastically reduce the need for cooling under summer conditions and the need for screens or <b>lime</b> <b>coating</b> of the glass to reflect or block {{a large part of the}} radiation. The removal of all direct radiation will block up to 81 % of the solar energy, which will reduce the needed cooling capacity. The second measure is the integration of a solar energy system. When the (linear) Fresnel lenses are designed between double glass coverings and integrated in the greenhouse, the focused solar energy on the Thermal Photovoltaic (TPV) cell in the focus point delivers electric and thermal energy. The TPV module mounted in the focal point requires cooling due to the high heat load of the concentrated radiation (concentration factor of 50 ×). All parts are integrated in a greenhouse structure with a size of about 36 m 2 and the electrical and thermal yield is determined for Dutch climate circumstances...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} methodology {{to physically}} and numerically model upsetting in cold heading was developed. The physical model was a Drop Weight Test with a guided pocket-die set capable of approximating industrial cold heading conditions. The {{results show that}} the test is sensitive to the critical parameters for cold heading. These include surface quality, residual element level, nitrogen content, microstructure, decarburization, and specimen geometry. The test is capable of assessing the fracture behavior of cold heading materials. One goal {{of the study was to}} reveal differences in fracture behavior with varying steel sources. Accordingly, the matrix of test materials consisted of grade 1038 steels from three different steel sources. Material preparation and conditioning of test materials approximated industrial procedures for cold heading materials. These procedures included hot rolling, controlled rod cooling, descaling, straightening, <b>lime</b> <b>coating</b> and lubricating, and wire drawing. Spheroidization of test specimens was performed in an industrial batch furnace using an industrial heat treatment cycle. A finite element program (FEM) enabled the simulation of upsetting in cold heading. The inputs required to model the cold heading process include flow stress behavior and friction conditions representative of cold heading. These inputs were obtained using the CANMET Cam Plastometer and the Friction Ring Test. The Cockcroft and Latham fracture constants for an as-rolled and a spheroidize annealed 1038 material were computed by FEM modeling and the critical values were calibrated using the Drop Weight Test. The fracture criterion constant was found to be independent of strain path for upsetting in cold heading and thus is material-related...|$|R
40|$|The thermal and {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} innovative insulating systems used as building coatings were investigated: Granular silica aerogel was mixed with natural plaster in different percentages. This coating solution is transpiring and insulating, {{thanks to the}} use of a natural <b>lime</b> <b>coat</b> and aerogel, a highly porous light material with very low thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of the proposed solution was evaluated by means of a Heat Flow meter apparatus (EN ISO 12667), considering different percentages of aerogel. The natural plaster without aerogel has a thermal conductivity of about 0. 50 W/m K; considering a percentage of granular aerogel of about 90 % in volume, the thermal conductivity of the insulating natural coating falls to 0. 050 W/m K. Increasing the percentage of granular aerogel, a value of about 0. 018 – 0. 020 W/m K can be reached. The acoustic properties were also evaluated in terms of the acoustic absorption coefficient, measured by means of a Kundt’s Tube (ISO 10534 - 2). Two samples composed by a plasterboard support, an insulation plaster with aerogel (thicknesses 10 mm and 30 mm respectively) and a final coat were assembled. The results showed that the absorption coefficient strongly depends on the final coat, so the aerogel-based plaster layer moderately influences the final value. The application of this innovative solution can be a useful tool for new buildings, but also for the refurbishment of existing ones. This material is in development: until now, the best value of the thermal conductivity obtained from manufacturers is about 0. 015 W/m K...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{greenhouse}} with linear Fresnel lenses in the cover performing as a concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) system is presented. The CPV system retains all direct solar radiation, while diffuse solar radiation passes through and enters into the greenhouse cultivation system. The removal of all direct radiation will block up to 77 % of the solar energy from entering the greenhouse in summer, reducing the required cooling capacity by about a factor 4. This drastically {{reduce the need for}} cooling in the summer and reduce the use of screens or <b>lime</b> <b>coating</b> to reflect or block radiation. All of the direct radiation is concentrated by a factor of 25 on a photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) module and converted to electrical and thermal (hot water) energy. The PV/T module is kept in position by a tracking system based on two electric motors and steel cables. The energy consumption of the tracking system, ca. 0. 51 W m- 2, is less than 2 % of the generated electric power yield. A peak power of 38 W m- 2 electrical output was measured at 792 W m- 2 incoming radiation and a peak power of 170 W m- 2 thermal output was measured at 630 W m- 2 incoming radiation of. Incoming direct radiation resulted in a thermal yield of 56 % and an electric yield of 11 %: a combined efficiency of 67 %. The annual electrical energy production of the prototype system is estimated to be 29 kW h m- 2 and the thermal yield at 518 MJ m- 2. The collected thermal energy can be stored and used for winter heating. The generated electrical energy can be supplied to the grid, extra cooling with a pad and fan system and/or a desalination system. The obtained results show a promising system for the lighting and temperature control of a greenhouse system and building roofs, providing simultaneous electricity and heat. It is shown that the energy contribution is sufficient for the heating demand of well-isolated greenhouses located in north European countries...|$|R
50|$|The major {{work began}} at the {{beginning}} of the 15th century. The town council celebrated the Easter of 1402 in the old building. The construction started right after the holidays. The leading master of the building was probably stonemason Ghercke. It is possible, that the leading masters, including Ghercke, came from downtown Toompea, where extensive works had ended in the last quarter of the 14th century in the fortress, the circular wall of Great Toompea and in the Cathedral (toomkirik). 600 logs, 581 balks, 46 pairs of girders and 107 burdens of stone were brought to the construction site. The stones were brought from Lasnamäe, where a stonemasons village was located. The names of the carriers have been documented. Crude stones were brought for the bricklaying, but some of the details had to be made out of cut stones. The main constructions - foundations, walls and vaults - were built out of limestone, that was brought from the limestone plateau, limestone brought from stone-pits near the city and all put together using lime mortar. In 1403, the stones were cut and an arcade, pillars supporting the vaults, window jams etc. were built. The pillars of the arcade and the main portal in the western section, that had an important role in the development of the building style of Tallinn, were built by Ghercke himself and his helpers. Eeskujuks oli portaalimeistrile toomkiriku väiksem lõunaportaal. The smaller southern portal of the cathedral (Tallinna Toomkirik) was used as an example. It is known that the stonemason Yckmele built the pillors for the winecellar and 200 blocks for the outer corners of the building. The windows were built by master Keyzner, one of the large family of stonemasons. Master Ghercke and his two helpers were paid 5 Rigan marks (1 Rigan mark weighed 207,8 g of silver).The construction works were finished at the end of 1404. The masters, who had placed the tiles, glazed the windows and cleaned up the debris, got their salaries. The town council celebrated Christmas holidays in a new building.

Also, electrical and optical properties of the TCO typically did not deteriorate strongly during absorber preparation. Our best result so far is a cell with an efficiency of about 8 on indium tin oxide ITO. At an absorber band gap of 1. 64 eV this cell exhibited an open circuit voltage of 775 mV, a fill factor of 55 and a short circuit current density of 18. 6 mA cm 2. To our knowledge, this is currently the best wide gap chalcopyrite based cell on a glass TCO substrate. The cell was slightly shunted but there were no indications for a non ohmic behavior of the ITO CIGS contact Keywords CuInS 2, Thin Film, TCO Transparent Conducting Oxide...|$|R

[...] . et al, 2016. Effect of the cadmium chloride treatment on RF sputtered Cd 0. 6 Zn 0. 4 Te films for application in multijunction solar cells. Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A, 34 (5), 051202 and may be found at [URL] phase Cd 0. 6 Zn 0. 4 Te (CdZnTe) films of 1 μm thickness were deposited by radio frequency planar magnetron sputter deposition on commercial soda <b>lime</b> glass samples <b>coated</b> with fluorine-doped tin oxide and cadmium sulphide (CdS). The stack was then treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) at different temperatures using a constant treatment time. The effect of the CdCl 2 treatment was studied using optical, materials, and electrical characterization of the samples and compared with the as-deposited CdZnTe film with the same stack configuration. The band gap deduced from Tauc plots on the as-deposited CdZnTe thin film was 1. 72 [*]eV. The deposited film had good crystalline quality with a preferred orientation along the { 111 } plane. After the CdCl 2 treatment, the absorption edge shifted toward longer wavelength region and new peaks corresponding to cadmium telluride (CdTe) emerged in the x-ray diffraction pattern. This suggested loss of zinc after the CdCl 2 treatment. The cross sectional transmission electron microscope images of the sample treated at 400 [*]°C and the energy dispersive elemental maps revealed the absence of chlorine along the grain boundaries of CdZnTe and residual CdTe. The presence of chlorine in the CdTe devices plays {{a vital role in}} drastically improving the device performance which was not observed in CdZnTe samples treated with CdCl 2. The loss of zinc from the surface and incomplete recrystallization of the grains together with the presence of high densities of stacking faults were observed. The surface images using scanning electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the grains changed from small spherical shape to large grains formed due to the fusion of small grains with distinct grain boundaries visible at the higher CdCl 2 treatment temperatures. The absence of chlorine along the grain boundaries, incomplete recrystallization and distinct grain boundaries is understood to cause the poor performance of the fabricated devices...|$|R
