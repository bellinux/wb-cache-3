5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> the right of defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly {{in his ability to}} present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both the prosecution and the defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (minimum of two players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook. Votes could also be cast via text messages from mobile devices and Smartphone users could vote by way of a mobile ballot feature. The NHL put no <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 million votes had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game. The six top vote recipients were from only two teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (4) and Chicago Blackhawks (2). Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by the fans are listed below with their vote totals.|$|E

5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval arms {{limitation}} and disarmament treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E
5|$|The four N3 battleships {{were never}} ordered because the Washington Naval Treaty, an arms {{limitation}} treaty under negotiation at the time, forbade construction of any ship larger than 35,000 tons. Many of {{the aspects of}} their design ultimately were incorporated into the two s, and they are often described as being a cut-down N3. Indeed, the Nelsons received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence, although they used the guns intended for the G3 battlecruisers for cost reasons and {{to comply with the}} Treaty's 16-inch <b>limitation</b> <b>on</b> main armament. Though far from receiving names, the four vessels of the N3 design have since been associated, albeit speculatively, with the names of the four patron saints of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales, those being HMS St. Andrew, HMS St. George, HMS St. Patrick and HMS St. David respectively.|$|E
