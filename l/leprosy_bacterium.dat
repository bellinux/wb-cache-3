5000|$|Armadillos {{are often}} {{used in the study}} of leprosy, since they, along with mangabey monkeys, rabbits, and mice (on their footpads), are among the few known species that can {{contract}} the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the <b>leprosy</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Mycobacterium leprae. (The <b>leprosy</b> <b>bacterium</b> is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of 34 C, similar to human skin.) [...] Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat. Armadillos are a presumed vector and natural reservoir for the disease in Texas and Louisiana and Florida. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century, leprosy was unknown in the New World. Given that armadillos are native to the New World, at some point they must have acquired the disease from old-world humans.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} leprosy control on the occurrence of leprosy and its associated impairments. Chapter 1 introduces leprosy, an infectious disease. Its manifestations vary widely: from mild self-healing forms to chronic and destructive disease. Knowledge regarding transmission of the <b>leprosy</b> <b>bacterium</b> Mycobacterium leprae is limited. For instance, it is unknown to what extent individuals incubating for disease contribute to transmission. Leprosy is a public health problem because it may cause nerve function impairment, leading to secondary complications of eyes, hands and feet. Disability, handicap and social stigma are ultimate consequences. Activities to prevent impairment and disability are very important. Early detection of patients followed by chemotherapy is the mainstay of leprosy control. The introduction of highly bactericidal multidrug therapy (MDT) in the 1980 s was a strong impetus for control programmes. However, evidence for an impact of MDT on transmission and incidence is still lacking...|$|E
40|$|SummaryDifferentiated cells {{possess a}} {{remarkable}} genomic plasticity {{that can be}} manipulated to reverse or change developmental commitments. Here, we show that the <b>leprosy</b> <b>bacterium</b> hijacks this property to reprogram adult Schwann cells, its preferred host niche, to a stage of progenitor/stem-like cells (pSLC) of mesenchymal trait by downregulating Schwann cell lineage/differentiation-associated genes and upregulating genes mostly of mesoderm development. Reprogramming accompanies epigenetic changes and renders infected cells highly plastic, migratory, and immunomodulatory. We provide evidence that acquisition of these properties by pSLC promotes bacterial spread by two distinct mechanisms: direct differentiation to mesenchymal tissues, including skeletal and smooth muscles, and formation of granuloma-like structures and subsequent release of bacteria-laden macrophages. These findings support a model of host cell reprogramming in which a bacterial pathogen uses the plasticity of its cellular niche for promoting dissemination of infection and provide an unexpected link between cellular reprogramming and host-pathogen interaction...|$|E

Nevertheless, a few persisting viable M leprae were detected as long as five years after the start of treatment with rifampicin either by itself or in combination with the bacteriostatic drug thiambutosine. Treatment with rifampicin and dapsone for six months reduced the number of persisting <b>leprosy</b> <b>bacteria</b> more than treatment with dapsone alone.

40|$|ABSTRACT Leprosy {{is one of}} 17 {{tropical}} disease which are still ignored {{tropical disease}}s that ignored with incidence rates that are still high. The disease generally will attack skin and nervous system. The involvement and nerve damage can cause disability and paralysis of the hands, feet and eyes. Patients should understand that the treatment of MDT can kill <b>leprosy</b> <b>bacteria,</b> but defects eye, hand or feet which already occurred will remain there {{for the rest of}} life, so it would take care of themselves diligently so that his disability did not get worse. The principle of self-care are essentially in 3 steps, step 1 is checking eyes, hands, and feet regularly, step 2 is protect the eyes, hands, and feet from physical trauma, and step 3 is taking care of themselves. The purpose of this research are to determine the relationship between the level of knowledge about leprosy with self-care in patients with leprosy in Sukoharjo district. Type of this research is quantitative. The method used is analytic with cross sectional approach.

40|$|We have {{previously}} described the posttranslational modification of pore-forming small proteins of Corynebacterium bymycolic acid, a very-long-chain -alkyl and-hydroxy fatty acid. Using {{a combination of}} chemical analyses andmass spectrometry, we identified the mycoloyl transferase (Myt) that catalyzes {{the transfer of the}} fatty acid residue to yieldO-acylated polypeptides. Inactivation of corynomycoloyl transferase C (cg 0413 [Corynebacterium glutamicum mytC {CgmytC}]), one of the six Cgmyt genes of C. glutamicum, specifically abolished theO-modification of the pore-forming proteins PorA and PorH, which is critical for their biological activity. Expectedly, complementation of the cg 0413 mutant with either the wild-type gene or its orthologues from Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Rhodococcus, but notNocardia, fully restored theO-acylation of the porins. Consis-tently, the three-dimensional structure of CgMytC showed the presence of a unique loop that is absent from enzymes that trans-fer mycoloyl residues onto both trehalose and the cell wall arabinogalactan.

40|$|What are the {{neglected}} tropical diseases? Seventeen neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) {{have been}} identified by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is estimated that over 1 billion people are infected with NTDs, with a further 1 billion at risk. The majority of NTDs occur in the tropics and sub-tropics and have particular characteristics in common: â¢ They afflict the poorest people â those without access to the safe water, sanitation, and basic health services {{required in order to}} protect themselves against infection by bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. High-income groups are rarely affected. â¢ Many are chronic, slowly developing conditions that become progressively worse if undetected and untreated. The damage they cause can be irreversible. â¢ They can cause severe pain and life-long disabilities, with long-term consequences for the person and also for family members who have to care for the person. â¢ People with NTDs are often stigmatised and excluded from society, and this can affect their mental health. The individual diseases are very different, and one person can be affected by more than one disease at the same time. The infectious agents responsible include: â¢ viruses (rabies and dengue) â¢ <b>bacteria</b> (<b>leprosy,</b> yaws, trachoma and Buruli ulcer) â¢ protozoa (leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis) â¢ helminth parasites (schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, intestinal worms and Guinea worm).
