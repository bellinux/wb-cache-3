5|$|Living almost {{exclusively}} in the aphotic zone where little to no sunlight penetrates, the Portuguese dogfish is relatively common and the dominant shark species in deeper waters. The large, squalene-rich liver of this shark allows it to maintain neutral buoyancy and hover with minimal effort; males contain more squalene in their livers than females. A tracking study in the Porcupine Seabight {{has found that the}} Portuguese dogfish has an average swimming speed of , and does not remain in any particular area for <b>long.</b> <b>This</b> species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and sharks. Known parasites of this species include monogeneans in the genus Erpocotyle, and the tapeworms Sphyriocephalus viridis, S. richardi, and Anthobothrium sp.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} (Triakis semifasciata) is {{a species of}} houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatlán in Mexico. Typically {{measuring}} 1.2–1.5 m (3.9–4.9ft) <b>long,</b> <b>this</b> slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name. Large schools of leopard sharks are a common sight in bays and estuaries, swimming over sandy or muddy flats or rock-strewn areas near kelp beds and reefs. They are most common near the coast, in water less than 4m (13ft) deep.|$|E
5|$|The {{total biomass}} of wild trout in Scotch Run in its upper reaches is 2.98 {{kilograms}} per hectare. 2.93 kilograms per hectare come from brook trout (2.42 kilograms per hectare {{of which are}} less than 175 millimeters long and 0.51 kilograms per hectare of which are more than 175 millimeters long). The remaining 0.05 kilograms per hectare come from brown trout, {{all of which are}} less than 175 millimeters <b>long.</b> <b>This</b> segment of the stream contains 66 brook trout less than 175 millimeters long and 3 brook trout more than 175 millimeters long per kilometer. It contains only three brown trout per kilometer, all less than 175 millimeters long. There are 174 brook trout per hectare, 166 of which are less than 175 millimeters long and eight brown trout per hectare, all of which are less than 175 millimeters long.|$|E
