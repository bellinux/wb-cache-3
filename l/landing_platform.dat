5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depictionâ€”one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the <b>landing</b> <b>platform</b> of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E

25|$|Before {{he became}} the Under Secretary of the Navy, Robert O. Work also brought into {{question}} the usefulness of an amphibious warfare ship without a well deck. The concept of the <b>Landing</b> <b>Platform</b> Helicopter (LPH) had failed when their helicopters met enemy anti-aircraft systems {{off the coast of}} Lebanon during the late 1970s. In that case, Marines first had to be moved onto ships that had well decks.|$|E

25|$|In May 2011, reports {{surfaced}} on {{the possible}} acquisition of three <b>landing</b> <b>platform</b> docks from Indonesian shipbuilder PT PAL.

25|$|Within {{a year of}} Operation Morris Dance, the Army {{determined}} that a capability to move at least a company group from ship to shore in a single helicopter lift was needed. To meet this requirement the Navy {{would need to be}} able to launch six helicopters, each carrying 20 soldiers, simultaneously from one or more ships. In the mid-1990s, two Kanimbla-class <b>landing</b> <b>platform</b> amphibious were acquired, but each of these ships can only move a platoon per lift. In June 2007, the Australian Government approved the purchase of two Canberra-class landing helicopter docks, each of which will be able to simultaneously operate six helicopters.|$|E

25|$|Although {{hummingbirds}} are {{the most}} familiar nectar-feeding birds for North Americans, there are analogous species {{in other parts of}} the world: sunbirds, honeyeaters, flowerpeckers, honeycreepers, bananaquits, flowerpiercers, lories and lorikeets. Hummingbirds are the oldest group, with the greatest degree of specialization on nectar. Flowers attractive to hummingbirds that can hover in front of the flower tend to be large red or orange tubes with a lot of dilute nectar, secreted during the day. Since birds do not have a strong response to scent, they tend to be odorless. Perching birds need a substantial <b>landing</b> <b>platform,</b> so sunbirds, honeyeaters, and the like are less associated with tubular flowers.|$|E

A ruined AT-AT appears in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as the makeshift home of the scavenger Rey on the planet Jakku.|$|E

25|$|Defence Minister Hishammuddin Tun Hussein {{said in a}} {{statement}} on 10 October 2013, Malaysia is planning on establishing a marines corps for amphibious operation. The marine will be drawn from all three services and the bulk of it is from one of the three parachute battalions of the 10 Paratrooper Brigade which will be re-designated as a marine battalion. The 9th Royal Malay Regiment (para) and 8th Royal Ranger Regiment (para) have both conducted amphibious warfare training as a secondary mission and most recently in June 2013 during the CARAT exercise with the US Marine Corps (USMC) and subsequently in an amphibious landing exercise with French troops and the <b>landing</b> <b>platform</b> dock FNS Tonnerre. Malaysian government has yet to decide whether the marines will fall under Malaysian Army or Royal Malaysian Navy.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the Australian Government {{approved}} {{a project to}} build six amphibious watercraft to operate from the Royal Australian Navy's two Kanimbla class <b>landing</b> <b>platform</b> amphibious (LPA). These craft were to be operated by the Australian Army and would replace its LCM-8s. In October 2001 ADI {{was selected as the}} preferred tenderer to build the six watercraft; at this time it was intended that the first of the class would enter service in 2003. A contract for the craft was signed in July 2002 and construction work began at ADI's facilities at Carrington, New South Wales in February 2003. The sixth LCM2000 was completed in August 2005, though at the time there were plans to order further craft. The six LCMs were named AB 2000, AB 2001, AB 2002, AB 2003, AB 2004 and AB 2005.|$|E

This lander platform will be built 80% by the Russian company Lavochkin, and 20% by ESA. Lavochkin will produce most of the landing system's hardware, while ESA will handle elements such as the guidance, radar and navigation systems. Lavochkin's current landing strategy is to use two parachutes; one will open while the module is still moving at supersonic speed, and another will deploy once the probe has been slowed down to subsonic velocity. The heat shield will eventually fall away from the entry capsule to allow the ExoMars rover, riding its retro-rocket-equipped lander, to come for a soft landing on legs or struts. The surface platform lander will then deploy ramps for the rover to drive down.|$|E
