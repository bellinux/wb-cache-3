6000|$|... [26] I find it {{incredible}} {{that there}} will not be a sweeping revolution in the methods of building during the next century. The erection of a house-wall, come to think of it, is an astonishingly tedious and complex business; the final result exceedingly unsatisfactory. It has been my lot recently to follow in detail the process of building a private dwelling-house, and the solemn succession of deliberate, respectable, perfectly satisfied men, who have contributed each so many days of his life to this accumulation of weak compromises, has enormously intensified my constitutional amazement at my fellow-creatures. The chief ingredient in this particular house-wall is the common brick, burnt earth, and but one step from the handfuls of clay of the ancestral mud hut, small in size and permeable to damp. Slowly, day by day, the walls grew tediously up, to a melody of tinkling trowels. These bricks are joined by mortar, which is mixed in small quantities, and must vary very greatly in its quality and properties throughout the house. In order to prevent the obvious evils of a wall of porous and irregular baked clay and <b>lime</b> <b>mud,</b> a damp course of tarred felt, which cannot possibly last more than a few years, was inserted about a foot from the ground. Then the wall, being quite insufficient to stand the heavy drift of weather to which it is exposed, was dabbled over with two coatings of plaster on the outside, the outermost being given a primitive picturesqueness by means of a sham surface of rough-cast pebbles and white-wash, while within, to conceal the rough discomfort of the surface, successive coatings of plaster, and finally, paper, were added, with a wood-skirting at the foot thrice painted. Everything in this was hand work, the laying of the bricks, the dabbing of the plaster, the smoothing of the paper; it is a house built of hands--and some I saw were bleeding hands--just as in the days of the pyramids, when the only engines were living men. The whole confection is now undergoing incalculable chemical reactions between its several parts. Lime, mortar, and microscopical organisms are producing undesigned chromatic effects in the paper and plaster; the plaster, having methods of expansion and contraction of its own, crinkles and cracks; the skirting, having absorbed moisture and now drying again, opens its joints; the rough-cast coquettes with the frost and opens chinks and crannies for the humbler creation. I fail to see the necessity of (and, accordingly, I resent bitterly) all these coral-reef methods. Better walls than this, and better and less life-wasting ways of making them, are surely possible. In the wall in question, concrete would have been cheaper and better than bricks if only [...] "the men" [...] had understood it. But I can dream at last of much more revolutionary affairs, of a thing running to and fro along a temporary rail, that will squeeze out wall as one squeezes paint from a tube, and form its surface with a pat or two as it sets. Moreover, I do not see at all why the walls of small dwelling-houses should be so solid as they are. There still hangs about us the monumental traditions of the pyramids. It ought to be possible to build sound, portable, and habitable houses of felted wire-netting and weather-proofed paper upon a light framework. This sort of thing is, no doubt, abominably ugly at present, but that is because architects and designers, being for the most part inordinately cultured and quite uneducated, are unable to cope with its fundamentally novel problems. A few energetic men might at any time set out to alter all this. And with the inevitable revolutions that must come about in domestic fittings, and which I hope to discuss more fully in the next paper, it is open to question whether many ground landlords may not find they have work for the house-breakers rather than wealth unlimited falling into their hands when the building leases their solicitors so ingeniously draw up do at last expire.|$|E

40|$|Acidic mining {{drainage}} (AMD) {{production is}} known {{to be one of the}} most serious problems facing the mining industry. The work presented here deals with the use of alkaline residue of pulp and paper industry, consisting mainly of calcite (<b>mud</b> <b>lime)</b> to control AMD. First, an exhaustive characterisation of the tailing of Ascot mine site (Eastern Townships, Québec) and <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> (sludge) from the pulp and paper factory of Cascade East Angus (Eastern Townships) was conducted. Four columns were used to test the effect of using <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> in reducing AMD, in addition to a reference column. <b>Mud</b> <b>lime</b> in mine residues leads to an immediate increase in pH and precipitation of metals. The <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> superimposed on mine residues produces an alkaline front which, migrating along the columns, leads to an increasing pH and an improvement of the leachate quality. In order to verify in situ the laboratory results, a field application of this method was undertaken on five demonstration cells (12 m x 12 m) among which one is a reference cell. The four adopted variants allowed us to test the effect of incorporating the <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> and/or covering mine residues with the <b>mud</b> <b>lime.</b> The principal parameters monorited are: (1) Oxygen concentration through cross-section of the soil; (2) Temperature variations; (3) Electrical conductivity of mine residues using probes entirely conceived and manufactured by our laboratory; (4) Chemistry of leachate recovered by the drainage system. The effect of the <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> on the bacterial catalytic activity was also studied. The main conclusions of the field study can be summarized as follows: (1) Infiltration of precipitation water is significantly reduced by application of the sludge coat at the top; (2) Reduction of atmospheric oxygen diffusion, is achieved especially with a high water content of the <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> cover; (3) Migration of the alkaline front generated by the <b>mud</b> <b>lime</b> cover improves interstitial water quality; (4) Increasing the pH, due to calcite dissolution, leads to an almost complete inhibition of the bacterial catalytic activity whose role in producing AMD is a well known fact; (5) Geochemical calculations using a computer software (FREEQC) allowed us to carry out speciation of different elements. Determination of secondary minerals susceptible to precipitate has been possible by calculating the saturation indexes; (6) Compilation of experimental results and economical data allows the development of a design, suitable for a reclamation plan of the site. This plan can also be used for other sites having similar problems. " [...] Résumé abrégé par UM...|$|R
