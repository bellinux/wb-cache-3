Lift-off from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, occurred at 04:03:04 UTC on 9 March 2008. The spacecraft separated from its carrier rocket one hour, six minutes and 41 seconds after lift-off, and navigation systems were subsequently activated. Two days later, on 11 March, the four main engines of the ATV were fired for the first time, marking the beginning of several orbital insertion boosts.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} deck {{construction}} of a highway bridge. Deck construction is designed as continued box girder with constant height. The deck construction is built by incremental <b>launching.</b> In <b>launching</b> <b>phase</b> <b>launch</b> prestressing with permanent internal straight tendons is applied in {{the upper and lower}} plate of the box girder for reducing stresses. On completion of launch, the service prestressing with internal parabolic tendons is used. In the beginning bridge launching and its advantages are described. In continuing work focuses on European standard prEN 1991 – 2 for traffic loads on bridges, where different load model and its application on structure are defined. There are also given characteristic values of traffic loads. In the next capture the usage of tree different computational models are explained. First model was used for calculating the internal forces in the deck construction during <b>launching</b> <b>phases.</b> It was designed using plane frame finite elements. Second model was used for the determination of internal forces in transverse direction of the bridge box girder. In this model shell finite elements were used. Third model is intended for determination of internal forces in longitudinal direction and it was designed as space frame construction. The analysis of deck construction consists of two parts. In the first part the analysis of deck construction in <b>launching</b> <b>phase</b> is made. Moment envelopes were calculated and the prestressing force for internal straight tendons was defined. Second part analyses the deck construction under service loads. There are given loads on deck construction and the internal forces for transverse and longitudinal direction of the bridge box girder are analysed. In continuing of the work the reinforcement and construction planes are designed. I...|$|R
