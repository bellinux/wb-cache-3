50|$|The first dialogue, titled, “Philo <b>and</b> Sophia on <b>Love</b> <b>and</b> Desire” is a contemplation on {{the distinctions}} between <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire, or the types of <b>love</b> <b>and</b> {{the true nature of}} love. In Sophia’s opinion, <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire are exclusive; however, Philo argues that <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire mix in things we find pleasurable, and that desire assumes {{knowledge}} of its object and, thus, its existence. Philo defines desire as that which seeks to become united with its object <b>and</b> <b>love</b> as that which, in union with its object, is enjoyed. When <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire intersect, there are three different qualities of objects: useful, pleasant and good. Useful objects are not <b>loved</b> <b>and</b> desired together. Useful objects are those that are possessed. Meanwhile, <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire of pleasant objects grows and perishes at the same time; pleasant objects exist because of privation. Good objects, on the other hand, exist when <b>love</b> <b>and</b> desire have no limit.|$|R
