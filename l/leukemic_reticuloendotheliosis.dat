40|$|Studies with {{transmission}} and {{scanning electron microscopes}} (TEM and SEM) were performed on specimens from patients suspected of <b>leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis</b> (LRE), irrespective of the final diagnoses. The blood samples were fixed immediately {{in order to avoid}} in vitro changes of leukocytes. <b>Leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis</b> cells demonstrated numerous long microvilli and pseudopods, whereas the immediately fixed lymphocytes demonstrated fewer, shorter microvilli and no pseudopods. These surface features distinguishing LRE cells from lymphocytes and monocytes were appreciated by both SEM and TEM. In addition, TEM revealed significant differences in the incidence of certain ultrastructural alterations. Whereas nuclear pockets were rare in lre cells, they were relatively frequent in lymphocytes of other hematologic disorders.

Since then, acid phosphatase assay has been widely used in the study of prostatic disorders. Sensitivity to tartrate has been used to distinguish the enzyme originating from that tissue. However, acid phosphatase activity in a variety of diseases has also been measured, as reviewed by Yam (2). Therefore, specificity of assay methods for each acid phosphatase is currently a problem in clinical chemistry. The various methods proposed for the prostatic enzymes have been recently reviewed by Townsend (3). Much less attention has been given to the quantitative measurement of tartrate-insensitive acid phosphatase. Our earlier {{studies have shown that the}} tartrate-insensitive acid phosphatase (band 5 on acrylamide-gel electrophoresis) has a unique substrate specificity, different from that of the other acid phos-phatases (4, 5), and is clearly separated from several tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatases (6). The clinical significance of the tartrate-insensitive enzyme is most obvious in the remarkably high activity of this enzyme in the reticulum cells of <b>leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis,</b> as detected histochemically (6).

40|$|The ultrastructural {{cellular}} inclusions {{referred to}} as ribosome-lamella complexes were observed in the neoplastic cell population of 4 patients with three types of hematopoietic malignancy, monoblastic leukemia. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and chronic lymphatic leukemia. The ultrastructural characteristics of the inclusions were similar in the 4 cases. The percentage of cells affected ranged from approximately 90 % in 1 patient with monoblastic leukemia to approximately 10 % in a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The complexes appeared to originate from the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Observations suggested a developmental sequence beginning with aggregate strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum, subsequent alignment of the strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum in a concentric configuration, followed by maturation to fully developed ribosome-lamella complexes. Although the ribosome-lamella complex {{has been found in}} the neoplastic cells of several patients with <b>leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis</b> ("hairy cell leukemia"), its occurrence in these three different hematopoietic disorders indicates a lack of diagnostic specificity of this structure...|$|E

40|$|The cell {{surfaces}} under pathological {{states were}} observed by a {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). Three cases of CLL were T-cell type, e. g. SRBC rosette forming cells, and 3 cases of ALL were null cell type. The surface structure of leukemic cells in CLL was smooth type, or intermediate type, although it was smooth type or {{a part of the}} cells had many blebs and ridge-like processes in ALL. A part of peripheral lymphocytes in patients with SLE showed abnormal, irregular shape and had blebs, ridge-like processes. Such abnormal cells were frequently detected in the cases which T-cells were decreased. Leukemic cells in one case of <b>leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis</b> (acute type) had very short ridge-like projections. Monocytic leukimic cells had the similar surface structure as normal peripheral monocytes which had ruffled membranes, but their processes were larger or broader. Plasmoid cells in patient with IgG(k) type multiple myeloma had villous surface structure, however that in IgD (λ) type were bullous.

40|$|Immunologic {{membrane}} markers {{have been}} utilized for the in situ identification of lymphoreticular cells within lymphoreticular tissues and in inflammatory and neoplastic lymphoreticular infiltrates of the skin. Frozen sections were layered with untreated sheep {{red blood cells}} (SRBC) {{for the detection of}} the E receptor on T cells, SRBC coated with 7 S antibody for the detection of the Fc receptor (IgGEA) and SRBC coated with 19 S antibody and complement (IgMEAC) for the detection of the C 3 receptor. In normal lymphoreticular tissue, IgGEA selectively bound to areas colonized by macrophages, IgMEAC to B-dependent areas, whereas E showed no adherence. In chronic lymphatic leukemia, a predominant and selective adherence of IgMEAC was found in lymphoreticular organs which supports the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells; in <b>leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis</b> a selective IgGEA adherence was observed and this favors a monocytoid origin of the hairy cell. Adherence of any indicator cell was practically absent from skin infiltrates of mycosis fungoides, which represents an additional piece of evidence for the T-cell nature of this disease process. In psoriasis, a considerable binding of IgGEA was observed, whereas IgMEAC did not adhere at all.

To detect enzymatic deficiencies, the cells were analyzed quantitatively for six leukocytic enzymes on three occasions: 1) before splenectomy, 2) 5 days after splenectomy, and 3) 6 weeks after splenectomy. Before splenectomy, the patient's cells showed moderate deficiency of β-glucuronidase in lymphocytes and monocytes; server to modorate deficiency of lysozyme and myeloperoxidase in monocytes and granulocytes; and complete absence of neutral protease and alkaline phosphates in neutrophils. Full restoration of neutral protease and a three-fold rise in alkaline phosphatase activities occurred in the patient's neutrophils 5 days after splenectomy. Lysozyme and myeloperoxidase returned to normal in both monocytes and neutrophils of the patient. Six weeks following splenectomy, the alkaline phosphatase activity again disappeared from patient's neutrophils, although neutral protease remained normal. The patient's lymphocytes were unresponsive to PHA and PW mitogen before splenectomy but became responsive 6 weeks postoperatively. Monocytic transfomation into macrophges was supressed before and after splenectomy.

40|$|The author {{employed}} securely laparoscopy {{in performing}} direct vision splenic biopsy, cultured the biopsied human splenic tissue using the clinical tissue culture method of spleen, and obtained the following conclusions. 1) In the lighting observation of spleen using laparoscopy, {{about half the}} number of both leukemia and Banti's disease showed change {{in the character of}} surface, namely, color, hardness, enlargement, atrophie, unevenness and adhesion. In the histological observations of biopsied splenic tissue, although all cases of lekemia showed the infiltration of leukemic cells, the determination of infiltrated cells in an acute lymphocytic leukemia and two cases of monocytic leukemia was difficult. In adout 70 per cents of Banti's disease the histological observations which suspected this disease were shown. In the splenogram of all cases of leukemia, the infiltration of various leukemic cells was seen respectively, and the determination of infiltrated cells was possible. While in the splenogram of Banti's disease no significant pathological findings were obtained. 2) In the splenic tissue culture of acute leukemia including monocytic leukemia, the boundaries of the growrh zone were well-defined and clear-cut, the cell density increased markedly and cells in the growth zone were mostly lymphoblasts and young lymphocytes in the case of acute lymphocytic leukemia, myeloblasts and immature granulocytic cells in the case of myelogenous leukemia, and monoblasts and promonocytes in the case of monocytic leukemia. 3) In chronic myelogenous leukemia double growth zone was not shown but the similar pattern to that of acute leukemia was seen. 4) In leukemoid reaction the pattern of splenic tissue growth was similar to that of normal human spleen, however in the growth zone numerous myelogenous cells, many of which were immature, were seen. 5) In Banti's disease the growth was somewhat reduced. In the terminal stage, splenic reticulum cells and fibroblasts tended to increase. 6) In aplastic anemia the growth pattern was similar to that of normal spleen, howevrer a few immature myelogenous cells were always found in the rowth zone. 7) In chronic Werlhof's disease the growth pattern gshowed that of normal spleen, except that many megakaryocytes with diminished function appeared in the growth zone. 8) In <b>leukemic</b> <b>reticuloendotheliosis</b> the growth pattern resembled that of acute lekemia. The growth zone was composed of the same lymphoblastoid cells as found in the peripheral blood and larger young cells. 9) In infection the growth pattern resembled the normal but its growth was remarkable and mature neutrophils were increased markedly. From these results the author thought that the clinical tissue culture method of spleen, when it was performed in company with the clinical tissue culture method of bone marrow, had important clinical significance for making clear various blood diseases and other diseases mit splenomegaly...|$|E
