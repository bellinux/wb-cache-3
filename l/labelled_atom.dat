30|$|Since NER {{have to be}} {{quantified}} by radio isotope labeling (14 C) of a chemical at the most stable part of the molecule [32], the detection can only {{be related to the}} <b>labelled</b> <b>atom</b> and not to molecular speciation. Thus, the structural identity of NER remains unknown. Studies under identical experimental conditions, in which the xenobiotic is isotope labeled at different positions, lead to different results regarding mineralization, degradation half-lives and NER formation depending on the stability of the labelled molecular moiety. Only by specific spectroscopic techniques after labeling the molecule with suitable stable isotopes, e.g., 13 C or 15 N for corresponding NMR analysis [33 – 36] or high-resolution MS [37 – 43] or 14 C-labeling combined with LC–MS [44], structural features of NER have been elucidated, however, often at elevated concentrations of the test substances.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Metabolic flux {{analysis}} (MFA) has so {{far been}} restricted to lumped networks lacking many important pathways, partly due to the difficulty in automatically gen-erating isotope mapping matrices for genome-scale meta-bolic networks. Here we introduce a procedure that uses a compound matching algorithm based on the graph theore-tical concept of pattern recognition along with relevant reaction information to automatically generate genome-scale atom mappings which trace the path of atoms from reactants to products for every reaction. The procedure is applied to the iAF 1260 metabolic reconstruction of Escher-ichia coli yielding the genome-scale isotope mapping model imPR 90068. This model maps 90, 068 non-hydrogen atoms that span all 2, 077 reactions present in iAF 1260 (previous largest mapping model included 238 reactions).

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach that work without the human label. In the off-line stage, our method trains a dictionary covering different levels of image quality patch atoms across the training samples without knowing the human score, where each atom is associated with a quality score induced from the reference image; at the on-line stage, given each image patch, our method performs group sparse coding to encode the sample, such that the sample quality can be estimated from the few <b>labeled</b> <b>atoms</b> whose encoding coefficients are nonzero.

40|$|A {{strategy}} for resolution and assignment of single proton resonances in proteins of molecular mass up {{to at least}} 40 kDa is presented. This approach is based on 15 N (or 13 C) labeling of selected residues in a protein. The resonances from protons directly bonded to <b>labeled</b> <b>atoms</b> are detected in a two-dimensional 1 H- 15 N (or 13 C) spectrum. The nuclear Overhauser effects from isotopically tagged protons are selectively observed in one-dimensional isotope-directed measurements.

In addition, for quantitative calculations of the exchange, the physical property which distinguishes the atom must be a function of the concentration of the <b>labelled</b> <b>atoms.</b> The discovery of isotopes of the elements provided the necessary condition of chemically identical atoms which are physically distinguishable. If B represents the natural mixture of isotopes of an element and B* represents a mixture containing an excess of one particular isotope the difference in mass will serve to distinguish B and B*.
