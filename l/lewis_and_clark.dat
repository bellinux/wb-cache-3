5|$|Floyd {{was born}} at Floyds Station, Virginia, near what is now Louisville, Kentucky. His parents were pioneer John Floyd, who was killed by Native Americans twelve days before his son's birth, and Jane Buchanan. His first cousin was Charles Floyd, {{the only member of}} the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition to die. In a letter dated 15 December 1830, Sam Houston stated that Floyd was the first cousin of another <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Explorer, Nathaniel Pryor.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It {{was to be a}} companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson {{first recorded}} the Native American {{name of the}} Snake River as Shawpatin {{when he arrived at}} its mouth by boat in 1800. When the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition crossed westwards into the Snake River watershed in 1805, they first gave it the name Lewis River, Lewis Fork or Lewis's Fork, as Meriwether Lewis was the first of their group to sight the river.|$|E
5|$|Commerce {{after the}} Louisiana Purchase {{remained}} {{focused on the}} fur trade; operations in St. Louis were led by the Chouteau family and its alliance with the Osages and by Manuel Lisa and his Missouri Fur Company.

5|$|In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson {{commissioned}} the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> expedition {{to explore the}} Louisiana Territory and beyond. Although the expedition passed only near the Gladstone – Oregon City locality {{on their way to}} and from the Pacific Ocean, via the Columbia River, natives such as the Kalapuya and the Clackamas people told them about the area.|$|E

5|$|In late 1805 {{and early}} 1806, {{members of the}} <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing {{eruption}} or recent evidence of one. They did however report the presence of quicksand and clogged channel conditions {{at the mouth of}} the Sandy River near Portland, suggesting an eruption by Mount Hood sometime in the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|Later American explorers {{traveled}} {{throughout the}} Snake River area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806, just after <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> had returned. The first was John Ordway in 1806, who also explored the lower Salmon River. John Colter in 1808 {{was the first}} to sight the upper headwaters of the Snake River, including the Jackson Hole area.|$|E
5|$|The Missouri River is {{the largest}} and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, James, Big Sioux, and White Rivers. Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly created by periods of glaciation. Additionally, dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Lake.|$|E

5|$|The coin {{was first}} {{suggested}} {{as a replacement}} for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The Statue of Liberty was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition, was eventually chosen.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, {{fifty years}} before the city of Omaha was founded, the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition first arrived via the Missouri River. The 1806 Fort Lisa and 1820 Cabanne's Trading Post were {{important}} fur trading outposts located in proximity to the river, along with earlier Fontenelle's Post in Bellevue. The Engineer Cantonment was built by Captain Stephen Watts Kearny's Yellowstone Expedition in 1819. The Expedition's craft, the Western Engineer, was the first steamboat to successfully venture up the Missouri River to the Omaha-Council Bluffs area.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, on {{the journey}} westward down the Columbia, the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition {{recorded}} seeing the mountain; noting that it was “a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow” and thought it “perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.” They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it “a very high humped mountain”. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Spain and the United States both sought allies {{among the}} Native Americans of the disputed territory. In June 1806, Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and 600 men were {{dispatched}} from the Spanish provincial capital of Santa Fe down the Red River and then northward into present-day Nebraska. Although no Spanish {{records of the}} Melgares expedition are known to exist, {{it is believed that}} its purpose was to find and arrest the <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> party, and to establish alliances with the Native Americans of the region, including the Pawnees.|$|E
5|$|The Missouri River is {{the largest}} and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, the James, the Big Sioux, and the White. Essentially all of South Dakota's rivers {{are part of the}} Missouri River Valley. Dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Lake. Hydroelectricity {{generated}} from power plants at the dams provides approximately half of the electricity used by South Dakotans.|$|E
