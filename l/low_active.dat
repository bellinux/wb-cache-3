50|$|The {{important}} {{advantage of}} the EFM32 MCU portfolio is energy efficiency. The energy efficiency stems from autonomous operations in deep sleep modes, <b>low</b> <b>active</b> and sleep currents, and fast wakeup times. Together, these characteristics reduce the integrated energy (power over time) over the lifetime of an application. EFM32 devices are also constructed to reduce development cycles {{for a variety of}} products, from smart metering to industrial applications and more. They are pin/software compatible, scalable across wide application requirements, and are compatible with multiple development platforms. Additionally, because the MCU architecture is the common fundamental piece of the wireless Gecko portfolio (EFR32) with both software and hardware (pin/package) compatibility, the EFM32 products offer a simplified pathway to wireless applications.|$|E

50|$|Aside from use {{in sports}} {{medicine}} and by orthopedists, elastic bandages are {{popular in the}} treatment of lymphedema and other venous conditions. However, ACE compression wraps are inadequate for the treatment of lymphedema or chronic venous insuffiency. They provide a high resting compression and <b>low</b> <b>active</b> compression. A more appropriate use for compression in treating lymphedema or other edema conditions would be TG shapes, tensoshapes, compression socks or compression wraps for acute conditions or exacerbation. Physical therapists and occupational therapists have special training and certifications to apply appropriate compression wraps for edema and lymphedema. ACE are also used for weight loss when applied as a body wrap, and rehabilitating injured animals through veterinary medicine. These bandages are often used as a method to compress breasts by transgender people (although this method of binding can cause rib damage and bruising), for general cross dressing, acting and men with abnormally large or shaped chests to help create a more masculine body shape.|$|E

One hundred twenty-seven African-American college freshmen (57 males and 70 females) completed the Lipid Research Clinic's Physical Activity questionnaire. Using a four-point scoring method (ie, very <b>low</b> <b>active,</b> <b>low</b> <b>active,</b> moderately active, and high active), approximately 71 % of females compared with 49 % of males were classified as very <b>low</b> <b>active</b> or <b>low</b> <b>active.</b> Statistical analysis revealed significant gender differences between groups. Post hoc analysis revealed that the difference existed in the high-activity category for females, with few females being categorized as high active.

40|$|There {{are large}} {{individual}} differences in cancer progression {{and it has been}} suggested that behavioral and psychological characteristics of cancer patients may contribute to the course of the disease. To get more insight in the contribution of behavioral characteristics to cancer progression, we investigated in rats, whether a stable behavioral trait characteristic is associated with NK cell activity, tumor angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis formation. Lewis rats were characterized based on locomotor activity in an open field. Rats in the upper and lower quartile were designated as high and <b>low</b> <b>active</b> rats. <b>Low</b> <b>active</b> animals had higher NK cell activity compared to their high active counterparts. In addition, we examined tumor angiogenesis by using a subcutaneous Matrigel implant containing MADB 106 adenocarcinoma cells. Tumor Matrigel implants from <b>low</b> <b>active</b> animals contained significantly more hemoglobin compared to implants from high active animals, indicating a more pronounced angiogenic response in the <b>low</b> <b>active</b> animals. Finally, experimental lung metastasis formation was investigated by injecting MADB 106 cells into the tail vein. <b>Low</b> <b>active</b> animals tended to develop more metastases. Moreover, <b>low</b> <b>active</b> animals developed significantly more tumors with a diameter larger than 2 mm, which is in line with higher angiogenic capacity. In conclusion, we demonstrated that {{individual differences in}} a stable behavioral trait are linked to individual differences in angiogenic capacity and tumor progression...|$|E
