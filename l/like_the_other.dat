5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> neuroacanthocytosis {{syndrome}}s, McLeod syndrome causes movement disorder, {{cognitive impairment}} and psychiatric symptoms. The particular features of McLeod syndrome are heart {{problems such as}} arrhythmia and dilated cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart).|$|E
5|$|All {{specimens}} {{from the}} NKMNP were caught {{above the ground}} in vegetation, suggesting that the species is arboreal <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of its genus. The chigger Eutrombicula batatas has been found on O.sydandersoni. Nothing else is known about ecology, behavior, diet, reproduction, or conservation status.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on January 9, 1788. Before it declared its independence, Connecticut was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Like most early states, Connecticut had claims to western areas, but did not cede all of its claims during the formation of the country <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> states. It maintained its Western Reserve until 1800, at which time it was reassigned to the Northwest Territory.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems {{turn out to be}} equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|It {{is presumed}} that Peter {{was a native}} of Italy, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> members of the Gregorian mission. This mission was {{dispatched}} by Pope Gregory the Great in 596 to Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. It landed in Kent in 597, and soon converted King Æthelberht of Kent, who gave Augustine the land on which he founded the abbey that later became St Augustine's, Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|James was presumably an Italian, <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{members of}} the Gregorian mission. The dates of his birth and of his arrival in Britain are unknown. He went with Paulinus to Northumbria {{accompanying}} Æthelburh, sister of King Eadbald of Kent, who went to Northumbria to marry King Edwin. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the mission to Northumbria probably happened before 619.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> BSD kernels (and {{those of}} most modern {{operating}} systems), DragonFly employs a built-in kernel debugger {{to help the}} developers find kernel bugs. Furthermore, , a debug kernel, which makes bug reports more useful for tracking down kernel-related problems, is installed by default, {{at the expense of}} a relatively small quantity of disk space. When a new kernel is installed, the backup copy of the previous kernel and its modules are stripped of their debugging symbols to further minimize disk space usage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Francophone musics of the Lesser Antilles, Dominican {{folk music}} is a hybrid of African and European elements. The quadrille is an {{important}} symbol of French Antillean culture, and is, on Dominica, typically accompanied {{by a kind of}} ensemble called a jing ping band. In addition, Dominica's folk tradition includes folk songs called bélé, traditional storytelling called kont, masquerade, children's and work songs, and Carnival music.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> New River settlers, Cooley did not buy land; {{he simply}} {{occupied}} {{the land in}} hope that the United States would eventually survey the area and grant ownership to the present settlers. The settlement was primarily populated by Bahamians, who survived by turtling, fishing, shipbuilding and wrecking.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{members of}} its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body {{is long and}} streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, its front three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> noble gases, krypton {{is highly}} {{chemically}} unreactive. The rather restricted chemistry of krypton in its only known nonzero oxidation state of +2 parallels {{that of the}} neighboring element bromine in the +1 oxidation state; due to the scandide contraction {{it is difficult to}} oxidize the 4p elements to their group oxidation states. Before the 1960s, no noble gas compounds had been synthesized.|$|E

5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> services, the Congolese Air Force is {{not capable}} of {{carrying}} out its responsibilities. Few of the Air Force's aircraft are currently flyable or capable of being restored to service and {{it is unclear whether}} the Air Force is capable of maintaining even unsophisticated aircraft. Moreover, Jane's states that the Air Force's Ecole de Pilotage is 'in near total disarray' though Belgium has offered to restart the Air Force's pilot training program.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{titles in}} the series, the player {{controls}} space-faring bounty hunter Samus Aran, who travels to planet Zebes after learning that Space Pirates are experimenting with Metroids {{in an attempt to}} duplicate them and use them for their own gain. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. The remake also features new items, additional areas, mini-bosses, difficulty levels, and a rewritten story which explores Samus's past.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{units of}} the 1st Training Wing, No.6 Squadron {{continued}} to train pilots {{after the end of}} the war. This was undertaken to keep personnel occupied while they awaited transport back to Australia as well as to strengthen the AFC. No.6 Squadron was disbanded in March 1919, and its personnel left Minchinhampton to return to Australia on 6 May that year.|$|E

5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing it around the recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of quilting.|$|E
5|$|Nandanar (also spelt as Nantanar), {{also known}} as Tirunalaippovar (Thirunaalaippovar) and Tiru Nalai Povar Nayanar, was a Nayanar saint, who is venerated in the Hindu sect of Shaivism. He is the only Dalit ("untouchable") saint in the Nayanars. He is {{generally}} counted as the eighteenth {{in the list of}} 63 Nayanars. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Nayanars, he was a devout devotee of the god Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Outside the Final Fantasy VII series, Vincent {{appears in}} the {{fighting}} game Ehrgeiz as an unlockable character, with his Turk uniform as an alternate costume. <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Final Fantasy VII characters in the game, Vincent does not serve {{a role in the}} main storyline. Although he was meant to appear in Kingdom Hearts, his design was instead used as the basis for Cloud's redesign. Vincent's popularity has seen merchandise related to the character, including the release of action figures.|$|E
