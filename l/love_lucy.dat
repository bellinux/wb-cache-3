5|$|Fate {{intervenes}} {{one night}} at a club, where the Castillo brothers have a part-time job. Nestor's love ballad captures the interest {{of one of the}} customers, who {{turns out to be the}} Cuban bandleader and American television star Desi Arnaz (played by his son, Desi Arnaz, Jr.).

5|$|A Nielsen study {{conducted}} during the show's final season (196768) indicated the show ranked number one among blue collar workers followed by The Lucy Show and Gunsmoke. Among white collar workers, the show ranked number three following Saturday Movies and The Dean Martin Show. The Andy Griffith Show {{is one of only}} three shows to have its final season be the number one ranked show on television, the other two being I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy</b> and Seinfeld. In 1998, more than five million people a day watched the show's reruns on 120 stations.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated {{character}} traits and mannerisms, {{it was impossible for}} him to create his own problems and troubles in the manner of other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy</b> or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E
5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York.

Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy,</b> which made him want to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings would put on plays.|$|E

50|$|After {{plans for}} a {{theatrical}} release were scuttled by MGM, the film was largely forgotten and the twelve minutes of new footage shot for the film {{were considered to be}} lost forever. However, in 2001, the film was found and clips of it were featured in I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy's</b> 50th Anniversary Special. A screening was held in August 2001 at the fifth <b>Loving</b> <b>Lucy</b> fan convention in Burbank, California.|$|R

5|$|Some Hispanics in the {{entertainment}} business served in the United Service Organizations (USO), which provided entertainment to help troop morale. One notable USO entertainer was Desi Arnaz, the Cuban bandleader who starred opposite Lucille Ball in the television show I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy.</b> When he was drafted into the army in 1943, he was classified for limited service because of a prior knee injury. As a result, he was assigned to direct the U.S.O. programs at a military hospital in the San Fernando Valley, California, where he served until 1945.|$|E
5|$|Created by comedian Bill Cosby, Clair {{is based}} on Cosby's own wife, Camille. Cosby {{originally}} intended for the character to be a plumber, but the producers and Camille ultimately convinced him to rewrite her into a lawyer to reflect a family that closer resembled their own. At one point, Clair had also been envisioned as a Dominican housewife who speaks Spanish when frustrated, inspired by Ricky Ricardo from the sitcom I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy,</b> but this idea was also abandoned. Rashad, originally credited as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, won the role by exhibiting a subtlety in her audition that other candidates lacked. After marrying husband Ahmad Rashad and adopting his surname, Rashad became pregnant with their child during the show's third season, thus requiring her to conceal her pregnancy during episode tapings.|$|E
5|$|Various studios {{rejected}} the project, until Glimcher persuaded Tom Pollock, chairman of Universal Studios, to financially back the film {{on a low}} budget. Before production could begin however, Pollock insisted that footage from the television series I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy</b> be {{a key part of}} the film. Following Lucille Ball's death in 1989, Glimcher was unable to secure the rights to use footage for the film. After Universal cancelled production of The Mambo Kings, the project moved to Warner Bros. Glimcher met with the studio's president Terry Semel, who introduced him to producer Arnon Milchan. Milchan agreed to co-finance the film through his production company Regency Enterprises and the French-based film studio Le Studio Canal+. The film was allocated a budget of $15.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I <b>Love</b> <b>Lucy</b> show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what he might say.|$|E
