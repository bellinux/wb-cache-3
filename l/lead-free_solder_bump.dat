40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{processing}} of tin-based <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> for flip-chip application. Some of the processes, electroplated, stencil printed, evaporated, injection moulded and solder spheres shall be highlighted, while the technology on electroplating technique shall be reviewed. In general, the obstacle in the usage of tin-based lead-free solder alloy {{is due to the}} toxicity of lead. This has led to a legislation and control in the usage of lead as an alloying element. The solder bumping methods were compared relatively in terms of cost, quality, bump pitch, applicability and lead-free challenge. Electroplated process produces high quality, fine pitch bumps and has, however, low flexibility in handling with lead-free alloys and has relatively high production cost. On the contrary, the stencil printing method is a low-cost, producing coarse bump pitch and handles easily with lead-free alloys. Evaporation process provides high quality bumps at medium to high cost but is poorly suited for larger wafers and most lead-free alloys. Among the two processes, the electroplating method is the most suitable process to fabricate tin-based lead-free solder bumps, and ha...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion of {{electronic}} systems {{has been a}} significant issue in electronic industry nowadays. One of the most common corrosion type is the atmospheric corrosion. Therefore, even a small environmental impact can cause huge damages if the components are not well protected. When the device is in use, the large voltage gradients between points on a printed circuit board (PCBs) will accelerate the corrosion problems dramatically. The complexity of the atmosphere, as corrosion environment, results from atmosphere composition and from presence of some factors as pollutants, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. So, the objective of the study is to identify the effect of corrosion on solder joint and copper substrate in 0. 5 M Sulphuric acid (H 2 S 0) {{in order to determine the}} corrosion rate of the substrate in duration time by using weight loss measurement method. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> were used to form solder joint between lead-free solder Sn- 3 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 305) solders with the plated copper substrate. The copper substrate surface finish was deposited by the electroless nickel. The result of study shows the corrosion on the substrate after immersed in 0. 5 M Sulphuric acid at 168 hours, 336 hours, and 504 hours. The effect of corrosion was increased with the time duration increased. The weight loss data indicated that the thickness of the substrate decreased with the time duration.

40|$|The {{electronics}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{was quick to}} adopt and use the Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly technique on realization of its huge potentials in achieving smaller, lighter and low cost product implementations. Increasing global customer demand for miniaturized electronic products is a key driver in the design, development and wide application of high-density area array package format. Electronic components and their associated solder joints have reduced in size as the miniaturization trend in packaging continues to be challenged by printing through very small stencil apertures required for fine pitch flip-chip applications. At very narrow aperture sizes, solder paste rheology becomes crucial for consistent paste withdrawal. The deposition of consistent volume of solder from pad-to-pad is fundamental to minimizing surface mount assembly defects. This study investigates the relationship between volume of solder paste deposit (VSPD) and the volume of solder bump formed (VSBF) after reflow, {{and the effect of}} reflow profile parameters on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> formation and the associated solder joint integrity. The study uses a fractional factorial design (FFD) of 24 − 1 Ramp-Soak-Spike reflow profile, with all main effects and two-way interactions estimable to determine the optimal factorial combination. The results from the study show that the percentage change in the VSPD depends on the combination of the process parameters and reliability issues could become critical as the size of solder joints soldered on the same board assembly vary greatly. Mathematical models describe the relationships among VSPD, VSBF and theoretical volume of solder paste. Some factors have main effects across the volumes and a number of interactions exist among them. These results would be useful for R&D personnel in designing and implementing newer applications with finer-pitch interconnect...|$|E

Bumped wafers/dice as key elements become very {{important in terms of}} general availability at low cost, high yield and quality level. Today, different materials, e. g. Au, Ni, AuSn, SnAg, SnAgCu, SnCu, etc., are used for flip chip interconnects and different bumping approaches are available. Electroplating is the technology of choice for high-yield wafer bumping for small bump sizes and pitches. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> require an increase in knowledge in the field of under bump metallization (UBM) and the interaction of bump and substrate metallization, the formation and growth of intermetallic compounds (IMCs) during liquid- and solid-phase reactions.

40|$|The high-intensity, {{high-resolution}} x-ray source at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) {{has been}} used in x-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments to detect intermetallic compounds (IMCs) in <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps.</b> The IMCs found in 95. 5 Sn 3. 8 Ag 0. 7 Cu <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> on Cu pads with electroplated-nickel immersion-gold (ENIG) surface finish are consistent with results based on traditional destructive methods. Moreover, after positive identification of the IMCs from the diffraction data, spatial distribution plots over the entire bump were obtained. These spatial distributions for selected intermetallic phases display the layer thickness and confirm the locations of the IMCs. For isothermally aged solder samples, results have shown that much thicker layers of IMCs have grown from the pad interface into the bulk of the solder. Additionally, the XRD technique has also been used in a temperature-resolved mode to observe the formation of IMCs, in situ, during the solidification of the solder joint. The results demonstrate that the XRD technique is very attractive as it allows for nondestructive investigations to be performed on expensive state-of-the-art electronic components, thereby allowing new, lead-free materials to be fully characterized...|$|R
40|$|The under bump {{metallurgy}} (UBM) {{structure is}} {{a critical component of}} any solder interconnect system. The UBM typically provides three functions: adhesion to underlying dielectric and metal, barrier to protect the silicon circuitry, and a solder wettable surface. For <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps,</b> the barrier layer is key to reliability due to their higher Sn content. A common barrier layer used in the industry is electroplated nickel. This layer provides good protection from degradation of the silicon metallurgy by tin rich lead free solders. Controlled Collapse Chip Connection - New Process (C 4 NP) provides an opportunity to eliminate electroplating, and its associated costs for plating chemistry, analysis, supply and waste treatment. This paper analyzes electroless Ni/immersion Au (ENIG), with and without Pd, as an alternative UBM structure. Wafers were fabricated with these UBM structures, solder applied with C 4 NP, and chip level stressing performed to determine the robustne ss of these alternative stack-ups. Analysis of these structures following multiple reflows and thermal cycling is presented. In addition, the paper also reviews production cost analysis for various UBM stackups and <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> processes, based on a specifically developed cost model. The ENIG UBM structures in combination with C 4 NP <b>solder</b> <b>bumping</b> provide a significant cost reduction over alternative structures. C 4 NP is a unique <b>solder</b> <b>bumping</b> technology developed by IBM which addresses the limitations of existing bumping technologies by enabling low-cost, fine pitch bumping using a variety of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloys. It is a solder transfer technology where molten solder is injected into pre-fabricated and reusable glass molds. The glass mold contains etched cavities which mirror the bump pattern on the wafer.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Conventional tin-lead solder alloys {{have been widely used}} in electronics interconnection owing to their properties such as low melting temperature, good ductility and excellent wettability on copper and other substrates. However, due to the worldwide legislation addressing the concern over the toxicity of lead, the usage of lead-containing solders has been phased out, thus stimulating substantial efforts on lead-free alternatives, amongst which eutectic Sn-Ag and Sn-Cu, and particularly Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, are promising candidates as recommended by international parties. To meet the increasing demands of advanced electronic products, high levels of integration of electronic devices are being developed and employed, which is leading to a reduction in package size, but with more and more input/output connections. Flip chip technology is therefore seen as a promising technique for chip interconnection compared with wire bonding, enabling higher density, better heat dissipation and a smaller footprint. This thesis is intended to investigate lead-free (eutectic Sn-Ag, Sn-Cu and Sn-Ag-Cu) wafer level <b>solder</b> <b>bumping</b> through electrodeposition for flip chip interconnection, as well as electroplating lead-free solderable finishes on electronic components. The existing knowledge gap in the electrochemical processes as well as the fundamental understanding of the resultant tin-based lead-free alloys electrodeposits are also addressed. For the electrodeposition of the Sn-Cu solder alloys, a methanesulphonate based electrolyte was established, from which near-eutectic Sn-Cu alloys were achieved over a relatively wide process window of current density. The effects of methanesulphonic acid, thiourea and OPPE (iso-octyl phenoxy polyethoxy ethanol) as additives were investigated respectively by cathodic potentiodynamic polarisation curves, which illustrated the resultant electrochemical changes to the electrolyte. Phase identification by X-ray diffraction showed the electrodeposits had a biphasic structure (β-Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5). Microstructures of the Sn-Cu electrodeposits were comprehensively characterised, which revealed a compact and crystalline surface morphology under the effects of additives, with cross-sectional observations showing a uniform distribution of Cu 6 Sn 5 particles predominantly along β-Sn grain boundaries. The electrodeposition of Sn-Ag solder alloys was explored in another pyrophosphate based system, which was further extended to the application for Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys. Cathodic potentiodynamic polarisation demonstrated the deposition of noble metals, Ag or Ag-Cu, commenced before the deposition potential of tin was reached. The co-deposition of Sn-Ag or Sn-Ag-Cu alloy was achieved with the noble metals electrodepositing at their limiting current densities. The synergetic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 600 and formaldehyde, dependent on reaching the cathodic potential required, helped to achieve a bright surface, which consisted of fine tin grains (200 nm) and uniformly distributed Ag 3 Sn particles for Sn-Ag alloys and Ag 3 Sn and Cu 6 Sn 5 for Sn-Ag-Cu alloys, as characterised by microstructural observations. Near-eutectic Sn-Ag and Sn-Ag-Cu alloys were realised as confirmed by compositional analysis and thermal measurements. Near-eutectic <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> of 25 μm in diameter and 50 μm in pitch, consisting of Sn-Ag, Sn-Cu or Sn-Ag-Cu solder alloys depending on the process and electrolyte employed, were demonstrated on wafers through the electrolytic systems developed. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> were further characterised by material analytical techniques to justify the feasibility of the processes developed for <b>lead-free</b> wafer level <b>solder</b> <b>bumping...</b>|$|R
40|$|The melting {{temperatures}} of most <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloys are somewhat {{higher than that}} of eutectic Sn/Pb solder, and many of the alloys tend to wet typical contact pads less readily. This tends to narrow down the fluxing and mass reflow process windows for assembly onto typical organic substrates and may enhance requirements on placement accuracy. Flip chip assembly here poses some unique challenges. The small dimensions provide for particular sensitivities to wetting and solder joint collapse, and underfilling does not reduce the demands on the intermetallic bond strength. Rather, the need to underfill lead to additional concerns in terms of underfill process control and reliability. Relatively little can here be learned from work on regular SMT components, BGAs or CSPs. The present paper addresses the effects of reflow profile, pad metallurgy, and amount of flux on the assembly of flip chips with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> onto organic substrates. Special attention was paid to the 85. 9 Sn/ 3. 1 Ag/ 10 In/ 1. 0 Cu alloy, which has a relatively low melting point of 197 oC. Good wetting and a robust collapse could, however, not be achieved with flip chip relevant no-clean fluxes developed for eutectic Sn/Pb, even with peak reflow temperatures approaching 250 oC. In fact, both 95. 5 Sn/ 3. 5 Ag/ 1. 0 Cu and 95 Sn/ 5 Sb were seen to perform much better at such temperatures. Given the relatively high melting point of the latter, a Sn/Ag/Cu alloy would seem to offer the more acceptable process windows...|$|R
40|$|Three <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> (Sn- 0. 7 Cu, Sn- 3. 5 Ag, Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu) were {{produced}} by stencil printing of type 6 and type 7 solder pastes on wafers having electroless Ni-P immersion Au (ENIG) under bump metallization (UBM). The diameter and {{height of the}} <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> were measured to be 47 and 43 µm, respectively. Ball shear tests were carried out to evaluate the UBM solderability and the bonding quality of the <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> after 1 Reflow, multiple reflows and thermal aging at 150 oC. The fracture surface, cross section microstructure and interfacial intermetallic compounds (IMCs) growth kinetics were investigated to identify the correlation between failure mode and the metallurgical characteristics of the UBM/solder interface IMC layers. The interfacial IMC phase was mainly (CuNi) 6 Sn 5 for Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu and Sn- 0. 7 Cu solders and Ni 3 Sn 4 for Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder. The coarsening of Ni 3 Sn 4 IMC phase for Sn- 3. 5 Ag solder was much {{greater than that of}} (CuNi) 6 Sn 5 for Sn- 0. 7 Cu and Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu solders with increasing reflows (solid/liquid reaction time). Even if only a small amount of Cu (0. 5 ~ 0. 7 wt %) is presented at the interface during reaction, the type, morphology and evolution of the interfacial IMC particles are greatly different. The growth kinetics of the interfacial IMC layers and the consumption of Ni-P UBM were also identified. Plate-like Ag 3 Sn phase with a rectangle shape was found in both Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu and Sn- 3. 5 Ag <b>solder</b> <b>bumps.</b> The re-deposition of AuSn 4 at the IMC/solder interfaces were observed for all of the solders after aging at 150 oC for 1000 h.

The morphology, size and chemical nature of the interfacial IMCs play a very important role on the reliability of the ultra fine pitch flip chip interconnects.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{melting point}} of Sn–Ag/Sn–Ag–Cu solders {{are higher than}} that of Sn–Pb solders by 30 C in particular. These in turn lead to {{significant}} divergences in plastic and creep behaviors. This research uses the validated finite-element analyses to study the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors of the 96. 5 Sn– 3. 5 Ag, 95. 5 Sn– 3. 8 Ag– 0. 7 Cu <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> and the classical 63 Sn– 37 Pb <b>solder</b> <b>bumped</b> wafer level chip scale package (WLCSP) on printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies subjected to four different temperature cycle tests. The behaviors of equivalent stress and equivalent total strain hysteresis loops are examined in the five key areas, which are the center, upper-right, upper-left, lower-right, and lower-left, at the outmost corner solder joint. It can be seen that: (1) for the elastic-plastic-creep behaviors to these three solder alloys, the range of the temperature loading is the most important factor to assess the reliability of the <b>solder</b> <b>bumped</b> WLCSP on PCB assemblies; (2) {{in the case of the}} same scale to the WLCSP and the WLCSP with underfill, the difference of the equivalent total strain range exceed an order of magnitude for all the three solder joints.

40|$|End-of-life and {{constant}} rate reliability modeling for semiconductor packages are the focuses of this dissertation. Knowledge-based testing approaches are applied and the test-to-failure approach is approved to be a reliable approach. First of all, the end-of-life AF models for solder joint reliability are studied. The research results show using one universal AF model for all packages is flawed approach. An assessment matrix is generated {{to guide the}} application of AF models. The AF models chosen should be either assessed based on available data or validated through accelerated stress tests. A common model can be applied if the packages have similar structures and materials. The studies show that different AF models will be required for SnPb solder joints and SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints. Second, <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> under power cycling conditions are found to follow constant rate reliability models due to variations of the operating conditions. Case studies demonstrate that a constant rate reliability model is appropriate to describe non solder joint related semiconductor package failures as well. Third, the dissertation describes the rate models using Chi-square approach cannot correlate well with the expected failure mechanisms in field applications. The estimation of the upper bound using a Chi-square value from zero failure is flawed. The dissertation emphasizes that the failure data {{is required for the}} failure rate estimation. A simple but tighter approach is proposed and provides much tighter bounds in comparison of other approaches available. Last, the reliability of <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> in flip chip packages under power cycling conditions is studied. The bump materials and underfill materials will significantly influence the reliability of the <b>solder</b> <b>bumps.</b> A set of comparable bump materials and the underfill materials will dramatically improve the end-of-life <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> under power cycling loads, and bump materials {{are one of the most}} significant factors. Comparing to the field failure data obtained, the end-of-life model does not predict the failures in the field, which is more close to an approximately constant failure rate. In addition, the studies find an improper underfill material could change the failure location from <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> cracking to ILD cracking or BGA solder joint failures...|$|R
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry has made astonishing improvements in decreasing circuit dimensions and more importantly, greater performance. Making connections with gold contacts on GaAs devices using <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> instead of silver Epoxy offers lower contact resistance and hence, better performance. Further more, <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> application to GaAs devices is amenable to high volume production {{and ease of}} manufacturing. Benefits from using <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> then become obvious for connections. This paper describes a process development using our existing technology of wafer processing in both wet and dry chemistries to build <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> on GaAs wafer for flip chip Schottky devices. Eutectic Sn/Pb <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> and Pb-free <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> were investigated. Detailed processing and chemistry will be discussed.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for replacing tin-lead (Sn/Pb) <b>solders</b> with <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> in the electronics industry due to health and environmental concerns. The European Union recently passed a law to ban the use of lead in electronic products. The ban will go into effect in July of 2006. The Japanese electronics industry has worked to eliminate lead from consumer electronic products for several years. Although currently there are no specific regulations banning lead in electronics devices in the United States, many companies and consortiums are working on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> initiatives including Intel, Motorola, Agilent Technologies, General Electric, Boeing, NEMI and many others to avoid a commercial disadvantage. The solder joints reliability not only depends on the solder joint alloys, {{but also on the}} component and PCB metallizations. Reflow profile also has significant impact on <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint performance because it influences wetting and microstructure of the solder joint. A majority of researchers use temperature cycling for accelerated reliability testing since the solder joint failure mainly comes from thermal stress due to CTE mismatch. A solder joint failure could be caused by crack initiation and growth or by macroscopic solder facture. There are conflicting views of the reliability comparison between <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> and tin-lead solders. This paper first reviews <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloys, <b>lead-free</b> component lead finishes, and lead-free PCB surface finishes. The issue of tin whiskers is also discussed. Next, <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint testing methods are presented; finite element modeling of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint reliability is reviewed; and experimental data comparing <b>lead-free</b> and tin-lead <b>solder</b> joint reliability are summarized. Finally the paper gives perspectives of transitions to totally lead-free manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} a {{prototype}} design and fabrication of multi-stacked flip chip three dimensional packaging (3 DP) with TSVs for interconnection. Three chips are stacked {{together to make a}} 3 DP with <b>solder</b> <b>bumped</b> flip chips. TSVs are fabricated and distributed along the periphery of the middle chip. The TSVs are formed by dry etching, deep reactive ions etching (DRIE), with dimensions of 150 × 100 microns. The TSVs are plugged by copper plating. The filled TSVs are connected to the solder pads by extended pad patterns surrounding the top and the bottom of TSVs {{on both sides of the}} wafer for the middle chip. After pad patterning passivation and <b>solder</b> <b>bumping,</b> the wafer is sawed into chips for subsequent 3 D stacked die assembly. Because the TSVs are located at the periphery of the middle chips and stretch across the saw street between adjacent chips, they will be sawed through their center to form two open TSVs (with half of the original size) for electrical interconnection between the front side and the back side of the middle chip. The top chip is made by the conventional <b>solder</b> <b>bumped</b> flip chip processes and the bottom chip is a carrier with routing patterns. The three middle chips and top chip are stacked by a flip chip bonder and the solder balls are reflowed to form the 3 DP structure. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> and wafer thinning are implemented in this prototype. In addition to the conceptual design, all wafer level fabrication processes are described and the die stacking assembly is also presented. © 2007 Materials Research Society...|$|R

40|$|Current {{trends in}} the {{preservation}} of our environment are forcing the electronic industry to seriously consider <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders.</b> In a variety of options such as Tin alloys with Indium, Bismuth, Silver, Zinc and others, the issues of their functional performance involves their solderability to the substrate. Clearly, good fatigue characteristics, tensile strength, ductility, adequate melting temperature and acceptable material cost may not be utilized if the solder requires aggressive fluxes or its "spreadability " is inadequate. Thus, a <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> applied on a substrate engineered for good solderability becomes a viable packaging tool. We have tested a variety of multilayer finishes developed at AT&T for applications on PWBs and MCMs and established {{that they can be}} successfully utilized in <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> processes.

For the composite <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> fabrication, ultrasonically dispersed SiC nanoparticles {{were added to}} the plating solutions. DSC analysis indicated that the melting temperature of SiC-mixed Sn– 58 Bi solders was {{the same as that of}} the non-mixed Sn– 58 Bi. Shear strengths of Sn– 58 Bi+SiC <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> were 6 % higher than that of non-mixed <b>solder</b> <b>bumps.</b> The thicknesses of intermetallic compound were almost the same for both Sn– 58 Bi and Sn– 58 Bi+SiC samples. The Sn– 58 Bi+SiC composite <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> had finer lamellar structures than non-mixed Sn– 58 Bi. From the fracture surface analysis, fracture occurred at <b>solder</b> <b>bump</b> matrix, not at joint interface. Therefore, the addition of the SiC nanoparticles in the Sn– 58 Bi solders decreased the grain sizes, which increased the shear strengths.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of mobile consumer electronics, a {{unique set of}} reliability issues those are associated with portable products and their using environment. In particular, accidental dropping is believed to cause substantial damage to the solder joints. The increasing occurrence of drop failure of portable electronics has been traced to the failure of the solder joints that interconnect the integrated circuit (IC) components with the printed circuit board (PCB). The increasing market pressure to replace lead based solder in electronic products has resulted in research being carried out in many areas related to <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder.</b> Thus, the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints under mechanical shock loading is a major concern. The main objective of this thesis is to study the failure mechanism and life prediction for lead-free ball grid array (BGA) solder joint subject to repetitive mechanical drop loading. The emphasis will be placed on the strain hardening effect of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joint under repetitive mechanical drop loading. The mechanical properties of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy were first studied by the tensile test. The results showed that the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was strongly strain rate dependent. The constitutive model of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> was built. Nanoindentation tests were employed to obtain the mechanical properties of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC. The nanoindentation hardness value for SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> and IMC was found to decrease with increasing aging time. The IMC layers grew in thickness during thermal aging tests, while there were no significant changes in the Young’s modulus of IMC. High speed ball pull tests were used to find the brittle fracture strength of IMC. The simulation of the high speed ball pull tests were studied and correlated with the high speed ball pull tests. Then the IMC brittle failure criterion was established. The strain hardening effects of SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> were found by solder wire drop test and board level drop test (BLDT). The structure stiffening effects were also found by the strain measurement during the BLDT experiment. The failure analysis after the PCBA BLDT experiment showed that all the failure modes were brittle failures. A 3 D finite element model of the PCBA was built and studied under repetitive drop loading. The dominant strain rates of the SAC <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> joints were found by correlating the material properties with tensile tests. After gradually correlating the drop loading condition, PCB strain, failure location and mode, and the IMC strain rates, the drop to failure number under repetitive drop loading was found. The predicted life from the simulation model matched well with the BLDT experiments. Finally this simulation model was validated on the industrial PBGA BLDT...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the design, fabrication, and {{evaluation}} of a new method for testing the adhesion strength of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> named the Isotraction Bump Pull method (IBP). In order to develop a direct solder joint-strength testing method that did not require customization for different <b>solder</b> types, <b>bump</b> sizes, specific equipment, or trial-and-error, a combination of two widely used and accepted standards was created. First, <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> were made from three types of lead free solder were generated on untreated copper PCB substrates using an in-house fabricated solder bump-on-demand generator, Following this, the newly developed method made use of a polymer epoxy to encapsulate the <b>solder</b> <b>bumps</b> that could then be tested under tension using a high precision universal vertical load machine. ^ The tests produced repeatable and predictable results {{for each of the}} three alloys tested that were in agreement with the relative behavior of the same alloys using other testing methods in the literature. The median peak stress at failure for the three solders tested were 2020. 52 psi, 940. 57 psi, and 2781. 0 psi, and were within one standard deviation of the of all data collected for each solder. The assumptions in this work that brittle fracture occurred through the Intermetallic Compound layer (IMC) were validated with the use of Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry and high magnification of the fractured surface of both newly exposed sides of the test specimens. Following this, an examination of the process to apply the results from the tensile tests into standard material science equations for the fracture of the systems was performed [...] ...|$|R
