25|$|For {{large-scale}} {{preparation of}} mayonnaise where mixing equipment is being employed, the process typically {{begins with the}} dispersal of eggs, either powdered or liquid, into water. Once emulsified, the remaining ingredients are then added and vigorously mixed until completely hydrated and evenly dispersed. Oil is then added as rapidly {{as it can be}} absorbed. Though {{only a small part of}} the total, ingredients other than the oil are critical to proper formulation. These must be totally hydrated and dispersed within a small <b>liquid</b> <b>volume,</b> which can cause difficulties including emulsion breakdown during the oil-adding phase. Often, a long agitation process is required to achieve proper dispersal/emulsification, presenting one of the trickiest phases of the production process. Though, as technology in the food industry advances, processing has been shortened drastically, allowing roughly 1000 liters to be produced in 10 minutes.|$|E

The electromechanical force does not depend upon field-mediated changes of the contact angle; it is operative even if the liquid surface is constrained.

40|$|An {{equation}} of state (EoS) suitable for describing associating fluids is presented. The equation combines the simplicity of a cubic {{equation of}} st-ate (the Soave-Redlich-Kwong), which {{is used for the}} physical part and the theoretical background of the perturbation theory employed for the chemical (or association) part. The resulting EoS (Cubic Plus Association) is not cubic with respect to volume and contains five pure compound parameters which are determined using vapor pressures and saturated liquid densities. Excellent correlations of both vapor pressures and saturated <b>liquid</b> <b>volumes</b> are obtained for primary-alcohols (from methanol up to 1 -tridecanol), phenol, tert-butyl alcohol, triethylene glycol, and water. Moreover, excellent prediction of saturated <b>liquid</b> <b>volumes</b> may be obtained from parameters which have been estimated by regressing only vapor pressures. Finally, we suggest a method for reducing the number of adjustable parameters for alcohols to three while maintaining the good correlation of vapor pressures and saturated <b>liquid</b> <b>volumes.</b> We investigate the possibility of using the homomorph approach for estimating the EoS parameters and explain the problems observed. The estimated pure compound parameters have been tested in the prediction of second virial coefficients with satisfactory results...|$|R

The obtained model, applicable thus to both vapour and liquid phases, eliminates the uncertainty in estimating the vapour phase non-ideality, a serious problem in using the gamma-phi approach, especially at higher pressures. Application of the model: (i) the correlation of binary vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE) data of polar systems and (ii) the prediction of multicomponent VLE behaviour from binary data, gives very good results, comparable to those with the gamma-phi approach, in both cases.

40|$|Background and purposePreliminary {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} reduced ability to maximally raise vocal pitch correlates with the occurrence of aspiration (i. e., airway invasion by food or liquid). However, it is unclear if this simple task {{can be used as}} a reliable predictor of aspiration in stroke patients. Our aim was to examine whether maximum vocal pitch elevation predicted airway invasion and dysphagia in stroke. MethodsForty-five consecutive stroke patients (< 1 [*]month poststroke) at a rehabilitation setting participated in a videofluoroscopic swallow study and two maximum vocal pitch elevation tasks. Maximum pitch was evaluated acoustically [maximum fundamental frequency (max F 0) ] and perceptually. Swallowing safety was rated using the Penetration/Aspiration Scale and swallowing performance was assessed using components of the Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile (MBSImPTM©). Data were analyzed using simple regression and receiver operating characteristics curves to test the sensitivity and specificity of max F 0 in predicting aspiration. Correlations between max F 0 and MBSImP variables were also examined. ResultsMax F 0 predicted silent aspiration of small <b>liquid</b> <b>volumes</b> with 80 % sensitivity and 65 % specificity (p[*]=[*] 0. 023; area under the curve: 0. 815; cutoff value of 359. 03 [*]Hz). Max F 0 did not predict non-silent aspiration or penetration in this sample and did not significantly correlate with MBSImP variables. Furthermore, all participants who aspirated silently on small <b>liquid</b> <b>volumes</b> (11 % of sample) had suffered cortical or subcortical lesions. ConclusionIn stroke patients (< 1 [*]month poststroke), reduced maximum pitch elevation predicts silent aspiration of small <b>liquid</b> <b>volumes</b> with high sensitivity and moderate specificity. Future large-scale studies focusing on further validating this finding and exploring the value of this simple and non-invasive tool as part of a dysphagia screening are warranted...|$|R
