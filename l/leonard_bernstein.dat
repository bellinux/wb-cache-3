5|$|All the composer's {{major works}} {{and many of}} the minor ones have been recorded. There have been {{numerous}} complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult's Decca cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer's presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was Hugh the Drover, in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of Hugh the Drover, Sir John in Love, Riders to the Sea, The Poisoned Kiss, and The Pilgrim's Progress. Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams's works include Herbert von Karajan, <b>Leonard</b> <b>Bernstein,</b> Leopold Stokowski, and, most frequently, André Previn, who conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are Vernon Handley, Richard Hickox, Sir Mark Elder and Sir Andrew Davis.

5|$|Two {{years after}} Visions de l'Amen, Messiaen {{composed}} the song cycle Harawi, {{the first of}} three works inspired by the legend of Tristan and Isolde. The second of these works about human (as opposed to divine) love {{was the result of a}} commission from Serge Koussevitzky. Messiaen stated that the commission did not specify the length of the work or the size of the orchestra. This was the ten-movement Turangalîla-Symphonie. It is not a conventional symphony, but rather an extended meditation on the joy of human union and love. It does not contain the sexual guilt inherent in Richard Wagner's Tristan und Isolde because Messiaen believed that sexual love is a divine gift. The third piece inspired by the Tristan myth was Cinq rechants for twelve unaccompanied singers, described by Messiaen as influenced by the alba of the troubadours. Messiaen visited the United States in 1949, where his music was conducted by Koussevitsky and Leopold Stokowski.

5|$|Verdi was {{concerned}} about {{working on a new}} opera at his advanced age, but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito's draft libretto. It took the collaborators three years from mid-1889 to complete. Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world, Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer's canon. After the initial performances in Italy, other European countries and the US, the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century. Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full-blooded melodies of the best of Verdi's previous operas, a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini. Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan, Georg Solti and <b>Leonard</b> <b>Bernstein.</b> The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory.|$|E

40|$|Marcel Prawy, 1911 als Marcell Frydmann Ritter von Prawy in Wien geboren, war nicht nur ein {{international}} anerkannter Experte des klassischen und des zeitgenössischen Musiktheaters, sondern auch ein fanatischer Sammler, der mit außergewöhnlicher Sachkenntnis ein beeindruckendes Privatarchiv angelegt hatte. In meiner Arbeit wurde unter Nutzung bislang kaum zugänglicher Quellen aufgezeigt, welche Innovationen das österreichische (Musik) Theaterwesen dem aus einer großbürgerlichen jüdischen Familie stammenden Dr. Marcel Prawy verdankt. Prawy, durch das inhumane NS - Regime in die amerikanische Emigration getrieben, kehrte 1946 als US - Kulturoffizier und „Military Civilian“ nach Österreich zurück. Um das Musical und dessen Entwicklungstendenzen zu explizieren, sind Minstrel -Show, Jazz, Balladenoper, Extravaganza, Burleske, Vaudeville, Revue und Operette substantielle musikalische „Prototypen“, die für das moderne Musical von mehr oder minder großer Bedeutung waren. Mit Musical - Shows unter der Devise „Lernet Amerika lieben“ war es für Prawy als Kultur - Offizier eine primäre Intention, Amerika in Österreich als Kunst- und Kulturszene zu manifestieren und dessen Historie im Spiegel der traditionellen amerikanischen Volksmusik und des Broadway - Musicals zu präsentieren. Als Privatsekretär des damals weltweit bekannten Sänger- und Schauspielerehepaares Jan Kiepura und Marta Eggerth lernte er nicht nur namhafte Künstler des Showbusiness, sondern auch die mitunter „drakonischen“ Produktionsmethoden des Broadway - Theaters kennen. Von 1952 bis 1955 brachte Prawy als Moderator und Conferencier unter der Patronanz der US Information Services Branch (ISB) Musical - Shows im Kosmos - Theater sowie ab Herbst 1954 im cosmos theater zur Aufführung, die vom Publikum mit Begeisterung akzeptiert wurden. Am 1. September 1955 wurde Franz Salmhofer zum Direktor und Marcel Prawy zum Produktionsleiter und Chefdramaturg der Wiener Volksoper ernannt, wobei neben dem Operettengenre auch das Musical Berücksichtigung finden müsse, so Prawys Zielvorstellung von der Volksoper als „Bayreuth der leichten Muse“. Besonders erfolgreiche Musicalproduktionen unter der Ägide Prawys waren Cole Porters Kiss me, Kate (1956), George Gershwins Porgy and Bess (1965) und <b>Leonard</b> <b>Bernsteins</b> West Side Story (1968). Weit weniger reüssieren konnten hingegen <b>Leonard</b> <b>Bernsteins</b> Wonderful Town (1956), Irving Berlins Annie, Get Your Gun (1957), Jerome Kerns Show Boat (1971) und Richard Rodgers Karussell (1972). Am 1. September 1972 wurde Prawy als Chefdramaturg an die Wiener Staatsoper unter der Direktion Gamsjäger berufen, blieb jedoch nach wie vor seinem Faible für das Musical treu. In Musical - Shows, Galavorstellungen, Matineen, Rundfunk- und Fernsehsendungen stellte er auch weiterhin sein profundes Wissen über die (Kultur) Geschichte des amerikanischen Musicals, dessen Komponisten, Librettisten, ProtagonistInnen, als Produzent, Präsentator und Conferencier zur Verfügung. 803 Marcel Prawy starb am 23. Februar 2003 infolge einer Lungenembolie und wurde in einem Ehrengrab der Stadt Wien auf dem Zentralfriedhof bestattet. Marcel Prawy, born Marcell Frydmann Ritter von Prawy in Vienna, Austria, 1911, was {{not only}} an internationally renowned expert of classical and modern musical theatre but also an ardent collector with extraordinary expertise and an impressive private archive. This paper presents the innovations Austria`s (musical) theatre owes to Dr. Marcel Prawy, who descended from a bourgeois family and returned to Austria in 1946 as an American “Kulturoffizier” and military civilian, after having fled from the cruel Nazi regime and emigrated to the United States. For my research I {{was fortunate enough to}} be able to use sources which have hardly been accessible so far. The minstrel show as well as jazz, ballad opera, extravaganza, burlesque, vaudeville, revue and operetta represent important musical “prototypes” of various significance for the modern musical which express the musical and its development trends. With musical shows true the slogan “Learn how to love America” it was one of Prawy`s primary intentions to establish American-style art and culture in Austria and to present its history as reflected in traditional American folk music and Broadway musicals. As private secretary of the world - famous singer and actor Jan Kiepura and his wife Marta Eggerth, also a singer, he not only met well - known artists from the show business but also got a deeper insight into the sometimes “draconian” production methods of Broadway theatre. As a host and presenter under the auspices of the US Information Services Branch (ISB), Prawy arranged the performance of musical shows in the Kosmos theatre from 1952 to 1955 and in the cosmos theater as of autoumn 1954, which were welcomed enthusiastically by the audience. 804 On 1 September, 1955, Franz Salmhofer was appointed director, and Marcel Prawy chief dramaturg and head of production, of the Vienna Volksoper, with Prawy intending to make room for the musical alongside the operetta - such was Prawy`s vision of the Volksoper as a “light version” of Bayreuth. Prawy`s most successful musical productions were Cole Porter`s Kiss me, Kate! (1956), George Gershwin`s Porgy and Bess (1965) and Leonard Bernstein`s West Side Story (1968). However, Bernstein`s Wonderful Town (1956), Irving Berlin`s Annie, Get Your Gun (1957), Jerome Kern`s Show Boat (1971) and Richard Rodger`s Carousel (1972) were less well received. On 1 September, 1972, Prawy was appointed chief dramaturg of the Vienna State Opera by general director Gamsjäger, but always stayed true to his favourite genre of the musical. He continued to share his extensive knowledge of the American musical`s (cultural) history and its composers, librettists, and protagonists as a producer, presenter and host of musical shows, gala performances, matinees and radio and television broadcasts. 805 Marcel Prawy died on 23 February, 2003 of a pulmonary embolism and was interred in a grave of honour at Vienna`s Zentralfriedhof cemetery...|$|R
