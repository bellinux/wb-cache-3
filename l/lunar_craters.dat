25|$|Craters on Mercury {{range in}} {{diameter}} from small bowl-shaped craters to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed-craters, to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from <b>Lunar</b> <b>craters</b> — {{the extent of}} their ejecta blankets is much smaller, which is a consequence of the 2.5 times stronger surface gravity on Mercury.|$|E
25|$|Craters {{within the}} Kuiper {{quadrangle}} increase in complexity as they increase {{in size from}} simple bowl-shaped craters to complex craters with central peaks to multiringed basins. Kuiper (11° S., 31.5°) is a moderate-size crater with a central peak cluster; Brunelleschi (9° S., 22.5°) exhibits an incomplete ring of peaks; and Rodin (22° N., 18°) is a well-developed double-ringed basin. These three craters are mercurian counterparts in morphology to the <b>lunar</b> <b>craters</b> Copernicus, Compton (or Antoniadi), and Schrödinger. All craters larger than about 35km diameter and basins are filled to some extent with plains materials, and exposed rims of partly buried craters within the basins indicate that the fill is about 700 to 1000 m thick (De Hon and Waskom, 1976).|$|E

25|$|Craters are {{ubiquitous}} {{features of}} the mercurian surface. For the purpose of mapping, a fivefold morphologic classification of craters (fig. 10 in McCauley et al., 1981) {{is the basis for}} determining their relative ages. The youngest craters (c5) have sharp rim crests, textured ejecta blankets, and a well-defined field of secondary craters. Under favourable lighting conditions, the youngest craters exhibit bright rays superposed on all older materials. Older craters have increasingly degraded rims and lower relief and have lost their secondary crater fields. The major differences between mercurian and <b>lunar</b> <b>craters</b> are apparently related to the greater gravitational acceleration and the higher impact velocities on Mercury. Continuous ejecta deposits are less extensive, and secondary craters are more sharply defined and clustered nearer their primary crater. Also on Mercury, accentuated secondary craters form prominent crater chains radial to large craters.|$|E
500|$|Their {{hypothesis}} {{relies heavily}} on the suggestion that large <b>lunar</b> <b>craters,</b> generally assumed to be formed from meteor impact, are generally too shallow and have flat or even convex bottoms. [...] They hypothesized that small meteors are making a cup-shaped depression in the rocky {{surface of the moon}} while the larger meteors are drilling through a rocky layer and hitting an armoured hull underneath.|$|E
500|$|Gonsales's {{load-carrying}} {{birds have}} also left their mark. The Oxford English Dictionarys entry for gansa reads [...] "One {{of the birds}} (called elsewhere 'wild swans') which drew Domingo Gonsales to the Moon in the romance by Bp. F. Godwin". For the etymology it suggests ganzæ, found in Philemon Holland's 1601 translation of Pliny the Elders Natural History.

500|$|In 1609, Galileo Galilei drew one of {{the first}} {{telescopic}} drawings of the Moon in his book [...] and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters. Telescopic mapping of the Moon followed: later in the 17th century, the efforts of Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today. The more exact 1834–36 [...] of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler, and their associated 1837 book , the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features, included the heights of more than a thousand mountains, and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography. <b>Lunar</b> <b>craters,</b> first noted by Galileo, were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of Richard Proctor that they were formed by collisions. This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist Grove Karl Gilbert, and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s, leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy, which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology.|$|E

2500|$|The {{very smooth}} plains on Mercury were {{included}} in the smooth plains unit by Trask and Guest. Here the geologic units are mapped separately, because very smooth plains material is clearly younger than smooth plains material. The very smooth plains unit, which is featureless and has no resolvable superposed craters, is possibly ejecta fallback on the floors of craters. However not all craters contain this material; some are floored by material with a rugged surface mapped as crater floor material, because it is analogous to the floor material in younger <b>lunar</b> <b>craters</b> such as Copernicus or Aristarchus. One other possibility is that the very smooth plains are volcanic.|$|E

2500|$|On the Moon, the {{spectral}} effects of space weathering are threefold: as {{the lunar surface}} matures it becomes darker (the albedo is reduced), redder (reflectance increases with increasing wavelength), {{and the depth of}} its diagnostic absorption bands are reduced [...] These effects are largely due to the presence of nanophase iron in both the agglutinates and in the accreted rims on individual grains. [...] The darkening effects of space weathering are readily seen by studying <b>lunar</b> <b>craters.</b> [...] Young, fresh craters have bright ray systems, because they have exposed fresh, unweathered material, but over time those rays disappear as the weathering process darkens the material.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the strongest}} clues to the impact origin of this {{structure}} is {{in the pattern of}} disruption of sedimentary strata. In the center of the structure, strata have been uplifted several hundred feet, {{in much the same way}} that the central uplifts of <b>lunar</b> <b>craters</b> such as Copernicus were formed. In 2003 geologists from Ohio State government and the University of Glasgow (Scotland) corroborated the meteorite impact origin of the structure at Serpent Mound. They had studied core samples collected at the site in the 1970s. Further analyses of the rock core samples indicated the [...] impact occurred during the Permian Period, about 248 to 286 million years ago; thus, all topographic expression of the impact would have been long since erased.|$|E

She turned a coppery hue, then that portion of her surface which was unobscured as yet grew grey and ashen, and at length, as totality approached, her mountains and her plains were to be seen glowing luridly through a crimson gloom.|$|E
