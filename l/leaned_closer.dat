Takao Yamada likewise points out that Hata has criticized all sides in historical controversies and he argues that Hata can be better described as a [...] "positivist".|$|E

60|$|The girl moved not; {{was done}} with all her tremblings; <b>leaned</b> <b>closer</b> to him, with an inexpressible strangeness of an intense love, new and inexplicable.

6000|$|When he was able, he rose, and <b>leaned</b> <b>close</b> {{over the}} Wieroo, lying silent and motionless, his wings {{dropping}} limply and his great, round eyes staring blankly toward the ceiling.

6000|$|That action {{recalled}} Gale's earlier mood, {{the joy of}} the present, and {{he turned}} to Nell's sweet face.
