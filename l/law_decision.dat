If businesses had constantly to verify the nationality or domicile of their customers and their ages, this might slow down business and, potentially, infringe privacy legislation. Hence, conflicts of public policy can emerge which complicate the choice of <b>law</b> <b>decision</b> and invite forum shopping, i.e. traders will always seek to sue infants with whom they have contracts in those states which accord priority to commercial interests, while children will seek the avoidance of liability in the courts which protect their interests. This would be achieved during the characterisation stage by classifying the issue as status and its incidents rather than contract because a party's status and lack of capacity would be in rem.|$|E
2500|$|Ex parte H.V. McKay, {{commonly}} referred to as the Harvester case, is a landmark Australian labour <b>law</b> <b>decision</b> of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The case arose under the Excise Tariff Act 1906 which contained a proviso that excise would not be payable on products if a manufacturer paid [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wages to its employees. The Court therefore had to consider what was a [...] "fair and reasonable" [...] wage for the purpose of the proviso.|$|E
2500|$|The Misrepresentation Act 1967 {{followed}} on {{from the}} Law Reform Committee Report of 1962, produced {{a year before the}} decision in Hedley Byrne was concluded in the House of Lords. The report also preceded a notorious tort <b>law</b> <b>decision,</b> The Wagon Mound (No 1), which imposed on English law a rule that damage which is too [...] "remote" [...] (not reasonably foreseeable) as a consequence from a faulty act will not be compensated. This threw out the established directness test. The recommendations, and the subsequent Act, plainly reflect the prior legal position, and are accordingly more claimant friendly on three grounds. First, {{there is no need to}} prove the problematic Hedley Byrne special relationship. Second, there is no remoteness cap on the damages which may be claimed under s 2(1). And third, possibly reflective of a growing academic favour for claimant rights and strict liability, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show he has not been negligent (i.e. had reasonable grounds to believe her representation was true). The text of section 2(1) reads as follows.|$|E

2500|$|The {{constitutional}} {{place of}} the Treaty of Waitangi is a subject of much debate. Increasingly, the Treaty {{is seen as an}} important source of constitutional law. Indeed, references to the [...] "Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi" [...] appear in a number of statutes, although the principles themselves have not been defined in statute. They are instead defined by a common <b>law</b> <b>decision</b> of the Court of Appeal from 1987, the famous [...] "Lands case" [...] brought by the New Zealand Māori Council (New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-General). There was great concern within Māoridom at that time that the ongoing restructuring of the New Zealand economy by the then Fourth Labour Government, specifically the transfer of assets from former government departments to State-owned enterprises. Because the state-owned enterprises were essentially private firms owned by the government, they would prevent assets which had been given by Māori for use by the state from being returned to Māori by the Waitangi Tribunal. The Māori Council sought enforcement of section 9 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986 [...] "Nothing in this act shall permit the Crown to act {{in a manner that is}} inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi".|$|E
