5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peridium.|$|E
5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 {{is formed}} in upper <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{troposphere}} and the stratosphere at altitudes of 9–15km by a reaction that is precipitated by cosmic rays. Thermal neutrons are produced that collide with the nuclei of nitrogen-14, forming carbon-14 and a proton. As such, 1.2 × 1010% of atmospheric carbon dioxide contains carbon-14.|$|E

5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|However, Lukin {{claims that}} hot-water {{drilling}} {{is much more}} dangerous for the microbiotic fauna, as it would boil the living species, plus disturb the entire structure of water <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lake. Additionally, hot-water drilling would have required more power than the Russian expedition could have generated at their remote camp.|$|E
5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain {{and it is}} suggested that they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E

5|$|The lakes of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by differential erosion of the tilted <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape. The last glacial period ended with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from the Boundary Waters about 17,000 years ago. The resulting depressions in the landscape later filled with water, becoming the lakes of today.|$|E

At least eighteen genera exhibit luminosity. A different effect is the thousands of square miles of the ocean which shine with the light produced by bioluminescent bacteria, known as mareel or the milky seas effect.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}}, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and supercell.

Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20–30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|This {{inflammatory}} cascade typically {{leads to}} the formation of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E
5|$|Very {{massive stars}} can undergo core {{collapse}} when nuclear fusion becomes unable {{to sustain the}} core against its own gravity; passing this threshold {{is the cause of}} all types of supernova except Type Ia.

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere is quite rare. Probably {{the first one}} reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of life on Earth lives in mesophyllic (moderate) environments, a few organisms, most of them microbes, have managed to colonise extreme environments that are unsuitable for most higher life forms. There are bacteria, for example, living in Lake Whillans, half a mile below the ice of Antarctica; in the absence of sunlight, they must rely on organic material from elsewhere, perhaps decaying matter from glacier melt water or minerals from the underlying rock. Other bacteria can be found in abundance in the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean and on Earth; marine snow drifts down from the surface <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea and accumulates in this undersea valley, providing nourishment for an extensive community of bacteria.|$|E
