40|$|BACKGROUND: CT {{perfusion}} (CTP) is {{an important}} diagnostic tool for <b>the</b> imaging <b>of</b> cerebral hemo-dynamics. To obtain quantitative values of cerebral blood volume (CBV), blood flow (CBF), and mean transit time (MTT), measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arterial input function (AIF) is required. To correct for partial volume effects (PVEs), {{it is common to}} normalize <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> with respect to the venous output function (VOF). This correction assumes that measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOF is unhampered by PVEs. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this study was to evaluate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> PVE on <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> and VOF and, consequently, on the absolute perfusion parameters. METHODS: In 10 patients the mean area under <b>the</b> curve (AUC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> and VOF were quantified for 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -mm-thick sections. Differences in the mean (1) AUC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOF, (2) AUC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> and (3) width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> were compared for the 3 section thicknesses, and the influence on <b>the</b> absolute values <b>of</b> CBV, CBF, and MTT were studied. RESULTS: With thinner sections, <b>the</b> AUC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VOF and <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> increased significantly and <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> decreased slightly. Differences in AUC between the 3 section thicknesses were larger for <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> than for <b>the</b> VOF. CONCLUSION: PVEs affect not only <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> but also <b>the</b> VOF.

40|$|Administration of armies {{has been}} sadly {{neglected}} in historical studies but <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> {{to develop an}} efficient system of administration and {{to fit into the}} equally efficient British system, {{had much to do with}} <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> especially late in the war. The various Empire governments had made some preparations for an alliance system <b>of</b> fighting in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> a major war, but in practice these needed a great deal of adjustment. This thesis examines the manner in which the dominions and Britain planned for a possible war and the way in which changes had to be made in practice.

Because <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> and CEF were so alike in size, composition and in the problem they faced, a recurring theme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is a comparison between the two.

Prewar preparation for a combined empire army. b. 	<b>The</b> organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> administrative system <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> and <b>the</b> manner this improved through the war. c.

5|$|Following <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> World War I {{the units}} {{that had been}} raised as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> were disbanded, and <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> Australian defence {{planning}} returned once more to <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizens Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia {{to be able to}} field a force of approximately 270,000 men in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> a war, of which half of this would be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment. It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re-organised along <b>the</b> lines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> adopting <b>the</b> divisional structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> units and maintaining their battle honours. <b>The</b> <b>AIF</b> officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and <b>the</b> new organisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizens Forces was adopted a month later; this saw <b>the</b> reorganisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, <b>the</b> abolition <b>of</b> infantry regiments and <b>the</b> re-establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 60 infantry battalions that had existed within <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.|$|R
500|$|During the inter-war years, <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> Australia's defence {{planning}} {{was primarily}} upon <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> a part-time military force, {{known as the}} Citizen Force. During the war years, this force had existed alongside <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> albeit largely only on paper. After <b>the</b> demobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> a process which was only completed in early 1921, the Citizens Force was reorganised to mirror <b>the</b> divisional structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> forming five infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions, and the previously existing structures were redesignated to adopt <b>the</b> numerical designations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> units. Where possible, these units were allocated to the same geographical areas as those from which <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> unit had been raised. Consequently, the 49th Battalion was reformed in south-east Queensland within the 1st Military District, headquartered at Kelvin Grove, with company-sized detachments at Toowong, Ipswich and Lowood; it {{was assigned to the}} 7th Brigade. Upon formation, the newly raised battalion drew personnel from the 9th and 52nd Infantry Regiments. In 1927, when territorial titles were adopted, the battalion assumed <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Stanley Regiment" [...] and adopted <b>the</b> motto <b>of</b> Semper Fidelis.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> {{organisation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> {{closely followed}} <b>the</b> British Army divisional structure, and remained relatively unchanged throughout the war. During the war, the following infantry divisions were raised as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AIF: ...|$|R

500|$|<b>The</b> {{exploits}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> at Gallipoli, {{and then}} on the Western Front, subsequently became central to the national mythology. In the years that followed much was made <b>of</b> ethos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> including its volunteer status and <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> [...] "mateship". Yet many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors which had resulted in <b>the</b> <b>AIF's</b> success as a military formation were not exclusively Australian, with most modern armies recognising <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> small-unit identity and group cohesion in maintaining morale. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> qualities that arguably defined the Australian soldier were also claimed by New Zealanders and Canadians as having been exhibited by their soldiers, whilst undoubtedly soldiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German, British and American armies also exhibited such traits, even if they were known by different terms. Objectively, <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF's</b> performance {{were more likely to have}} been military professionalism based on [...] "discipline, training, leadership, and sound doctrine". While <b>the</b> volunteer status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> has been seen by some to explain its military performance, it was by no means unique in this regard. <b>The</b> status <b>of</b> their enlistment made little difference against the artillery, machine-gun fire, and wire obstacles of modern industrial warfare at any rate. Equally, individual skill and morale proved to be less important than sound tactics, with effective fire and movement ultimately making the difference in 1918. The Australians were not alone among the Allied armies in embracing such tactical innovations, while many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new technologies and integrated weapon systems they relied upon were provided by the British Army.|$|R
5|$|In 1921, the {{decision}} was made to perpetuate the numerical designations and battle honours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> by re-raising <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> units as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizens Force. This was done by reorganising the existing Citizens Forces units so that they would adopt <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> units that had been recruited within their regions and in which many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-war citizen soldiers had served. This was designed so as to maintain <b>the</b> regional identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citizens Forces units, as well as the honours and traditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> units. In this time the 6th Battalion was re-raised from personnel drawn from six existing units: all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment; as well as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 29th Light Horse Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment; the 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment; the 5th Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment. Through these units, the battalion gained a complex lineage, including that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 64th Infantry, a unit that could trace its lineage back to 1854 and claimed to be the oldest infantry unit in Australia.|$|R
500|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process was}} {{managed by the}} various military districts. At the outset it had been planned to recruit half <b>the</b> <b>AIF's</b> initial commitment <b>of</b> 20,000 personnel from Australia's part-time forces, and volunteers were initially recruited from within designated regimental areas, thus creating a linkage between <b>the</b> units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> and <b>the</b> units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home service Militia. In <b>the</b> early stages <b>of</b> mobilisation <b>the</b> men <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> were selected under some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toughest criterion <b>of</b> any army in World War I and {{it is believed that}} roughly 30 percent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. To enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least , with a chest measurement of at least [...] Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 32,000 original soldiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> only 7,000 would survive to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|R

25|$|In 1921, the {{decision}} was made to disband <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> and to perpetuate its battle honours and traditions by reforming the Citizens Force along the same lines as <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> with <b>the</b> multi-battalion regiments being redesignated as separate battalions and adopting the unit colour patches and battle honours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, 41st Infantry was redesignated as the 41st Battalion.|$|R

500|$|During {{and after}} <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> was often portrayed in glowing terms.

Australian soldiers was also seen as resourceful and self-reliant. The wartime official correspondent and post-war official historian C.E.W. Bean was central to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> this stereotype. Bean believed that the character and achievements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> reflected <b>the</b> unique nature <b>of</b> rural Australians, and frequently exaggerated <b>the</b> democratic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force and <b>the</b> proportion <b>of</b> soldiers from rural areas in his journalism and <b>the</b> Official History <b>of</b> Australia in <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> 1914–1918. <b>The</b> perceived qualities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF</b> were seen as being unique, as <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harsh Australian environment, <b>the</b> ethos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bush and egalitarianism. Such notions built on <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> men from <b>the</b> bush being excellent natural soldiers which was prevalent in Australian culture before the war. <b>The</b> achievements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>AIF,</b> especially during <b>the</b> Gallipoli campaign, were also frequently portrayed by Bean and others as having marked <b>the</b> birth <b>of</b> Australia as a nation.
