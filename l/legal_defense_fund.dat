50|$|Similar to <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>funds,</b> <b>legal</b> {{financing}} companies provide {{money for}} lawsuits but {{are more often}} used by those without strong financial resources. Furthermore, legal financing {{is more likely to}} be used by plaintiffs, whereas <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>funds</b> are more likely to be used by defendants. Money obtained from legal financing companies can be used for any purpose, whether for litigation or for personal matters. On the other hand, money obtained through <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>funds</b> are solely used to fund litigation and legal costs.|$|R

Unlike legal financing from legal financing companies, <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>funds</b> provide a separate account for litigation rather than a one-time cash advancement, though both are used for purposes of financing litigation and legal costs.|$|R

5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> <b>fund</b> to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked the Fifth Amendment, refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E

5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public environmental concern. With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club <b>Legal</b> <b>Defense</b> <b>Fund</b> filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E
