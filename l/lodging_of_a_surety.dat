It is generally known that the procedural legal status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> in tax proceedings {{has always been one}} of the problematic topics for tax administration. It was covered by Section 57, Subs. 5 of Tax and Fee Administration Act No. 337 / 1992 Coll. as amended, by one paragraph only, which resulted in many disputes, discussions, and last but not least, civil proceedings. This was mostly caused by the fact that standing surety for someone, being one of the securities provided, was ranked in section six, called "Tax payment"; however, <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> had never been explicitly stated in legal provisions which related to its legal status. The judicature had always characterised only a principal, not <b>a</b> <b>surety.</b> The surety was explicitly mentioned in the provisions of S. 7, Subs. 2 ZSDP, in which it was ranked as a party to tax proceedings. However, this only meant that <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> did not have the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tax principal or its rights or obligations, although, by operation of law, it bore the responsibility for any [...] ...|$|R

It {{was discovered}} in Oxyrhynchus. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sheet. It is dated between 26 January - 24 February 94.

50|$|Most {{of it was}} {{repealed}} by the Forgery Act 1913, and today forgery is mostly covered by the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 and the Identity Documents Act 2010. However three offences under the 1861 Act remain in force today (in sections 34, 36 and 37). These deal with forgery of registers of births, marriages and deaths, and with impersonation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>surety</b> is {{entitled}} to contribution from a co-surety in respect of their common liability. This particular right is {{not the result of}} any contract, but is derived from a equity, on the ground of equality of burden and benefit, and exists whether the sureties be bound jointly, or jointly and severally, and by the same, or different, instruments. There is, however, no right of contribution where each surety is severally bound for a given portion only of the guaranteed debt; nor in the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> for <b>a</b> surety; nor where a person becomes <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> jointly with another and at the latter's request. Contribution may be enforced, either before payment, or as soon as the surety has paid more than his share of the common debt; and the amount recoverable is now always regulated by the number of solvent sureties, though formerly this rule only prevailed in equity. In the event of the bankruptcy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety,</b> proof can be made against his estate by a co-surety for any excess over the latter's contributive share. The right of contribution is not the only right possessed by co-sureties against each other, but they are also entitled to the benefit of all securities which have been taken by any one <b>of</b> them as <b>an</b> indemnity against the liability incurred for the principal debtor.|$|R

40|$|Periodically {{one needs}} to re-examine the {{objectives}} and the efforts associated with <b>a</b> field <b>of</b> study. In the case of surety which comprises, safety, security and reliability {{one needs to}} be sure that theoretical efforts support the needs of systems and design engineers in satisfying stakeholder requirements. The current focus in the surety areas does not appear to address the theoretical foundations needed by the systems engineer. Examination of papers and abstracts demonstrate significant effort along the lines of thermal hydraulics, chemistry, structural response, control theory, etc. which are analytical disciplines which provide support for <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> theoretic but do not constitute a theoretic. The representations currently employed, fault trees etc., define static representations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> system, not the dynamic representation characteristic of response in abnormal, hostile or under degrading conditions. Current methodologies would require <b>a</b> semi-infinite set <b>of</b> scenarios to be examined before a system could be certified as satisfying <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> requirement. The elements that are required <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> theoretic must include: (1) <b>a</b> dynamic representation <b>of</b> the system; (2) the ability to automatically identify terminal states of the system; and (3) determine the probabilities of specified terminal states under dynamic conditions. This paper examines the requirements <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> theoretic that will support the efforts of the design and development engineer. Speculations then follow on technologies that might provide the theoretical and support foundations needed by the systems engineering community to form <b>a</b> robust <b>surety</b> analysis and design environment...|$|R

Under {{the provisions of}} the Polish Civil Code, the legal position <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guarantor is closely related to non-legal factors. The ambiguity and uncertainty of the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guarantor are even greater due to the variability in time of the normative construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety.</b> Therefore, in addition to the measures available in law, a certain counterweight, such as the general public values, is necessary to address this state of affairs. The most widely understood trust, being the necessary condition for the proper development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modern democratic state of law, may undoubtedly play that role...|$|R

There is no privity <b>of</b> contract between <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> and the principal debtor. Rather, the surety contracts with the creditor and is not jointly liable to the creditor.|$|R

Cultivo de coca e identidad en los Yungas de la Paz (1994) and Kausachun-Coca (2004). She {{is the author}} of three novels in Spanish: Manuel y Fortunato. Una picaresca andina (1997), El viento de la cordillera (2001), and the sci-fi, anarcho-feminist novel De cuando en cuando Saturnina (2004). She is also the author <b>of</b> <b>a</b> book <b>of</b> short stories, El tiempo, la distancia, otros amantes (1994) and the play Un gato en el tejar, the latter published under the pseudonym Alicia Céspedes Ballet. In Bolivia she became <b>an</b> outspoken critic <b>of</b> the government's policy of cracking down on peasant coca farmers. Academics widely considered the arrest was politically motivated and campaigned for her release. She was released in 2000 on payment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety.</b>|$|R
50|$|The death <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>surety</b> {{does not}} per se {{determine}} the guarantee, but, save where from its nature the guarantee is irrevocable by the surety himself, {{it can be}} revoked by express notice after his death, or by the creditor becoming receiving constructive notice of the death; except where, under the testator's will, the executor has the option of continuing the guarantee, {{in which case the}} executor should specifically withdraw the guarantee in order to terminate it. If one <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> joint and several sureties dies, the future liability of the survivors continues, at least until it has been terminated by express notice. In such a case, however, the estate of the deceased surety would be relieved from liability. The statute of limitations may bar the right of action on guarantees subject to variation by statute in any U.S. state where the guarantee is sought to be enforced.|$|R
