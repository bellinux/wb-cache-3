40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} the interdecadal variation {{by applying the}} statistical change-point analysis to {{the frequency of the}} tropical cyclone (TC) that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula (KP) for the recent 54 years (1951 to 2004) and performed cluster classification of the Korea-landfall TC tracks using a Fuzzy Clustering Method (FCM). First, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interdecadal variation analysis, frequency of TC that <b>landed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP was largely categorized into three periods: high frequency period from 1951 to 1965, low frequency period from 1966 to 1985, and high frequency period from 1986 to 2004. The cluster analysis result of the Korea-landfall TC tracks produced the optimum number of clusters as four. In more detail, Cluster A refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP starting from East China Sea followed by heading north while Cluster B refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> west coast of the Korean Peninsula, also starting from East China Sea followed by heading north. Cluster C refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern region of <b>the</b> west coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> KP moving from mainland China while Cluster D refers to a pattern of <b>landing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-north region of <b>the</b> west coast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula, also moving from mainland China...|$|R
