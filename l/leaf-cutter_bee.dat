In mass the inflorescence resembles sheets of flame, and individually {{the flowers are}} eminently beautiful, the bright orange-red petals contrasting brilliantly against the jet-black velvety calyx. The nest of the Megachile (<b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bee)</b> was in thousands in the cliffs, with Mayflies, Caddis-worms, spiders, and many predaceous beetles. Lamellicorn beetles were very rare, even Aphodius, and of Cetoniae I did not see one.|$|E

The latter tribes swarmed under the clods, of many species but all small, and so singularly active that I {{could not give}} the time to collect many. In the banks again, the round egg-like earthy chrysalis of the Sphynx Atropos (?) and the many-celled nidus of the <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bee,</b> were very common.|$|E

50|$|A. virginica is {{an annual}} herb which grows erect and can reach two meters in height. The {{alternately}} arranged leaves are each {{made up of}} many pairs of hairy, glandular leaflets. The leaves are touch-sensitive, folding when touched. Blooming takes place in summer and early fall. The pea-like flower is about a centimeter long and yellow in color with stark red veining. The flowers are pollinated by insects such as the Least Skipper (Ancylozypha numitor) and <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bees</b> (family Megachilidae). The fruit is a legume pod up to 7 centimeters long which is narrowed between the seeds and easily segments. The segments float and the seeds may be dispersed on the water if they don't fall out immediately. Bits of the pods may {{get caught up in}} floating vegetation debris and can be deposited with it in new territory.|$|R

50|$|The {{plant is}} a {{short-lived}} perennial herb producing erect, fleshy {{stems from the}} top of its taproot. The stems grow up to 20 centimeters tall. The leaves are alternately arranged and overlapping, with a number of small leaves in the axil of one larger leaf. They are linear to spatula-shaped and about a centimeter long. The top of each stem is occupied by a short inflorescence of flowers. There are three types of flowers on this plant. The most obvious is the chasmogamous type borne in the inflorescence on the stem. These are each half a centimeter long with pink winglike sepals and three smaller tufted pink petals at the center. The second type of flower is cleistogamous and borne {{at the base of the}} plant. These do not open, but self-pollinate. These flowers, which occur at the leaf axils, are rare. The third type of flower is a cleistogamous, unopening type that remains underground. These are borne on a stalk up to 40 centimeters long which is located just below the surface of the soil. They are white in color, and also self-pollinate. The very uncommon mode of reproduction characterized by aboveground chasmogamous flowers and belowground cleistogamous flowers is called amphicarpy and it is known from fewer than 100 plant species. The different types of flowers may occur at different times of the year. The aboveground flowers depend on insect pollinators for successful reproduction, as evidenced by the low fruit production of flowers in a pollinator-exclusion experiment. Pollinators include bee-flies, flower flies, and <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bees.</b> The fruit is a capsule containing cylindrical seeds each about 0.3 centimeters long. The seeds have hairs which attract ants, which then collect and disperse them. The most common type of seed-collecting ant is Pheidole morrissii and others include Paratrichina arenavaga and P. phantasma.|$|R
50|$|As a <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bee,</b> {{females of}} Megachile illustris may cut {{sections}} of leaves in oval or circular shapes to line {{the cells of}} its nest. Alternatively, they might use dried plant resin to line nest cells, which it carries in its mandible. The species creates its nests in soil, in stems of plants, in twigs, or will tunnel through rotting wood to create nests. It does not produce honey and has a weak sting which it uses in defence. The species pollinates wild plants and crops and is a small or medium-sized bee. The genus name Megachile comes from Greek words mega (large; μεγας) and cheil (lips; χειλ), which refers to mouthparts of species in the genus.|$|E

Observation of pollen-harvesting females {{in the field and}} microscope analysis of scopal pollen contents revealed that the hind leg brush is a specialized device for combing pollen from the inflorescences of thistles and knapweeds (Cardueae, Asteraceae), the exclusive pollen plants of M. pilicrus. Hind leg brushes serving the same purpose were found to be also present in several Megachile species belonging to the subgenus Neoeutricharaea, indicating convergent evolution in these two different Megachile lineages. Compared to all other species, the hind leg brush of M. (Neoeutricharaea) apicalis is distinctly less developed which is assumed to be associated with its polylectic habit...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of the alfalfa <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bee,</b> Megachile rotundata was tested from 1988 to 1991 on alfalfa seed growing fields at the Uvs-Nuur Basin in the North-West of Mongolia. We used the loose-cell technology {{in combination with}} wooden grooved boards (dimensions of the nesting holes: 8 × 110 mm). The climatic conditions at the investigation area proved to be favorable for the rearing of the bees. The average temperature was above 21 °C during 8. 5 h by a mean sunshine duration of 6. 4 h and sporadic rainfall. Nevertheless, the night temperatures felled below 10 °C and are responsible for a complete diapause induction. During the flying period of 4 to 5 weeks, which {{was determined by the}} flowering period of alfalfa, on average 10 cells have been constructed per female corresponding with a 3 -fold increase of the cocoon amount per year. Only a few pests could be registered: A nest destroying Trichodes-species (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and the imagines parasitizing conopid fly Physocephala pusilla (Diptera: Conopidae). The conopid fly will cause problems for the rearing of M. rotundata in Mongolia due to its high abundance and difficulties in the control. However, M. rotundata can be successfully managed as a pollinator for alfalfa on selected cultivation areas in Mongolia...|$|E

Honey bee pests, predators and diseases (3 rd ed.). Medina, OH: The A. I. Root Compan S. tricuspis with a length of 5 – 8 mm and gray-black color {{is similar to a}} domestic fly. Morphologically, it is characterized by a light strip between the reddish compound eyes (Bedini, Pinzauti, & Felicioli, 2006 Bedini, G., Pinzauti, M., & Felicioli, A. (2006, 25 – 27 th April). Interaction between Apis mellifera and its parasites Senotainia tricuspis and Varroa destructor: A teoric model. International Apicultural Scientific Conference, Pulawy, Poland.). Females of S. tricuspis are larviparous and attack forager honey bees flying in front of the hive. When S. tricuspis reaches its host, it deposits a first instar larva on the thorax of the honey bee. Then the larva enters the body of the honey bee and develops, feeding on hemolymph and wing muscles, until it kills its host in 2 – 4 days (Bedini, Pinzauti, & Felicioli, 2006 Bedini, G., Pinzauti, M., & Felicioli, A. (2006, 25 – 27 th April). Interaction between Apis mellifera and its parasites Senotainia tricuspis and Varroa destructor: A teoric model. International Apicultural Scientific Conference, Pulawy, Poland.). At the third instar, the last larval stadium, the larva exits from the body of the dead host. Sometimes, it can also feed on the body of the dead host as a scavenger. Then the larva enters the soil for pupation, with different depths according the structure of the soil: deeper in clay and shallower in sandy soil. During the late spring or summer, the adult fly emerges 7 – 12 days after pupation and the new generation can go forward with its own parasitic behavior. Those larvae that pupate in late summer or autumn will undergo diapause until next spring when the adults emerge (Bailey & Ball, 1991 Bailey, L., & Ball, B. V. (1991). Honey bee pathology (2 nd ed.). London: Academic Press. [CrossRef]). Attacks can be repeated every 10 s during the sunniest hours of the day. Each female has 600 – 700 larvae in its uterus and thus has the potential to kill hundreds of honey bee (Bedini, Pinzauti, & Felicioli, 2006 Bedini, G., Pinzauti, M., & Felicioli, A. (2006, 25 – 27 th April). Interaction between Apis mellifera and its parasites Senotainia tricuspis and Varroa destructor: A teoric model. International Apicultural Scientific Conference, Pulawy, Poland.). The aim of this work was to confirm the existence of S. tricuspis and to estimate its infestation rate and potential danger in apiaries in Arab countries of North Africa and the Middle East. Samples from Italy were used as a reference indicator for the level of infestation. For the monitoring of S. tricuspis, 124 samples were collected from seven countries: Algeria (33), Egypt (12), Italy (4), Iraq (18), Jordan (27), Palestine (9), and Lebanon (21). A pooled sample was collected from each apiary from three randomly chosen hives. Each sample represented one apiary and contained at least 50 forager bees. Hives were selected according to the beekeepers complaints of unexplained colony depopulation. Each apiary was been geolocalized using GPS, and its coordinates were used to produce a synoptic map of the pest distribution (Figure 1). The bees were kept in a closed glass jar of 390 ml volume. The jar was closed with a net to allow air exchange for the breathing of the bees. Then, the collected honey bees were observed for 72 h and eventual specimens of S. tricuspis larvae were counted and removed. Removal of S. tricuspis larvae is necessary to avoid the behavior of cannibalism, which is known with S. tricuspis larvae (Pinzauti & Santini, 1995 Pinzauti, M., & Santini, L. (1995).

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were (a) to measure the amount of cross-pollination caused by three bee species at 10, 20 and 40 rods distance from a foreign pollen source, (b) to measure the effects of bee species, planting pattern and season on broad sense heritability estimates for seed yield in alfalfa, (c) to determine the incidence of selfing caused by the bees, (d) to investigate the usefulness of bees as a breeding tool in alfalfa and (e) to determine which of the three planting patterns used in this investigation is the best in effecting the maximum amount of cross-pollination. Three bee species, the honey bee, Apis mellifera L.; the <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bee,</b> Megachile rotundata F. and the alkali bee, Nomia melanderi Ckll. were chosen for this investigation because of their importance as pollinators in alfalfa. Studies under conditions of good isolation for bee species and competitive bloom were necessary to obtain reliable results. In the center of a three mile square isolated area, seven plots of recessive white-flowered clonally established plants were planted 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 240 and 320 rods north of a colored-flowered population, and seven plots were planted at the same distance east of the colored-flowered population. Seven planting patterns were used in the east series. Three of these were utilized by the bees described. The number of florets tripped, pods developed and seeds developed in each pod were recorded for each raceme visited by pollen collecting bees. Seed samples from the white-flowered clones were grown in a greenhouse to ascertain whether the seed resulted from cross- or self-pollination. A record of flower color in 1963 demonstrated that at 10, 20 and 40 rods from a contaminant source honey bees caused 15. 7, 11. 2 and 5. 8 percent cross-pollination; leaf-cutter bees caused 13. 1, 4. 8 and 8. 1 percent cross-pollination while endemic pollinators caused 42. 9, 30. 9 and 10. 0 percent cross-pollination in 1962. An important fact in this regard was that endemic pollinators caused 6. 52 percent cross-pollination at a distance of a mile. Bee species, planting pattern and season caused large fluctuations in broad sense heritability estimates for seed yield in alfalfa. The ratio environmental variance to phenotypic variance gave a good indication which environmental factor caused the most fluctuation in the estimate. When endemic pollinators were used 94. 7, 88. 3, 36. 3 and 23. 1 percent selfed seeds were recorded as occurring in pods with one, two, three and four or more seeds per pod. One seven seeded pod was recorded as possessing three selfed seeds. Data from leaf-cutter bees showed that all of the pod types had over 67 percent selfed seeds. Distance from the contaminant source affected the percentage selfed seeds. At 40 rods only the four or more seeded pods contained any crossed seeds (20 percent) Leaf-cutter bees trip 27 - 50 percent more florets per raceme and cause less cross-pollination at 10, 20 and 40 rods than honey bees. Honey bees cause approximately the same amount of cross-pollination at 10 and 20 rods while the value obtained at 20 rods for the <b>leaf-cutter</b> <b>bee</b> was close to one-third of the value at 10 rods. Leaf-cutter bees also showed less preference between colored- and white-flowered alfalfa flowers. Of several planting patterns considered, maximum cross-pollination was obtained in a plot planted with alternating rows of alfalfa...|$|E
