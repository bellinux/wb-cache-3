40|$|Aiming {{to study}} the {{mechanism}} and time history of weak local events we invert the dominant part of high-frequency seismograms (S and surface waves) by using two methods which implement moment tensor description of the focus. The point-source approximation is applied since {{we assume that the}} size of the focus with respect to the minimum wavelength of the analyzed signals is relatively small. Various constraints of the moment tensor are applied to cover local events of different origin - both the tectonic earthquakes and seismic events induced by volcanic activity. In the former case the double-couple constraint is applied, in the latter one a full moment tensor is decomposed into a volumetric part (V), representing volume changes, a compensated linear vector [...] dipole part (CLVD), describing opening of a fluid-filled <b>lenticular</b> <b>crack,</b> and a double couple part (DC), representing a shear slip. In the full moment tensor inversion the hypocentral depth and structural model may vary within pre-defined intervals. In the orogenic area of Friuli, Northern Italy, both the method looking for a DC only and the procedure implying the complete moment tensor arrive produce a DC mechanism, the orientation of which is consistent with the polarity readings. In the volcanic area of Phlegraean Fields, Southern Italy, the possible existence of fluid motion, which can be associated to volume changes and crack openings has to be taken into account, therefore, we used only the full moment tensor description to analyze several events in the magnitude range from 1. 3 to 3. The obtained source durations vary from a few tenths of a second to about two seconds, suggesting that even small events may be characterized by relatively complex rupture history, although some of the retrieved complexities may be an artifact due to lateral inhomogeneities and other unmodelled structural effects. The percentage of the V component was found to be as large as 30...|$|E
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{states of}} internal penny cracks at interfaces in thin-sheet bodies are investigated. Consideration {{is given to}} cracks held open by a center-loading force from an entrapped particle in combination with a uniform pressure from a fixed mass of entrapped gas. A fracture mechanics analysis indicates that under these conditions the cracks are stable, but are amenable to growth from an enhancement in net pressure (increase in internal pressure or decrease in external pressure) or effective particle size. Essential details of the theory are confirmed by experiments on <b>lenticular</b> <b>cracks</b> at healed interfaces in muscovite mica. The results are pertinent to flaw responses in brittle ceramic systems where structural integrity is an issue. <br /...|$|R
