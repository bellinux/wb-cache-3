40|$|Abstract — In DTC drive {{stator flux}} is {{controllable}} variable so accurate flux estimation in a high-performance induction motor drive, {{is important to}} ensure proper drive operation and stability. Most of the flux estimation techniques proposed {{are based on the}} voltage model. The voltage model, on the other hand, is normally used in a high speed range, since at low speed, some problems arise. Practical implementation, even a small dc offset present in the back electromotive force (EMF) due to noise or measurement error inherently present in the current sensor, can cause the integrator to saturate. To overcome this, a low-pass (<b>LP)</b> <b>filter</b> is normally used in place of a pure integrator. The voltage only motor parameter used is the stator resistance, which can be measured quite accurately. These can be considered as an advantage of the voltage-mode and are also the reasons why the former is preferred over the latter in some industrial applications. However, the use of an <b>LP</b> <b>filter</b> in place of a pure integrator reduces the performance of the drive because of the phase and magnitude errors inherent in the <b>LP</b> <b>filter</b> as compared to the pure integrator, particularly at low speed. Attempts have been made to improve the estimated stator flux based on an <b>LP</b> <b>filter</b> as given by the proposed method used an adaptive control system which was {{based on the fact that}} the back EMF is orthogonal to the stator flux. The compensator is adapted for this condition. However, to implement the proposed system requires large processor resources and longer execution time for a slower processor. The implementation of adaptive Control will significantly increase the complexity of the control system; hence, it will outweigh the property of simple control structure inherent in DTC...|$|R
40|$|Muscle synergies {{calculated}} from electromyography (EMG) data identify weighted groups of muscles activated together during functional tasks. Research {{has shown that}} fewer synergies are required to describe EMG data of individuals with neurologic impairments. When considering potential clinical applications of synergies, understanding how EMG data processing impacts results and clinical interpretation is important. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how EMG signal processing impacts synergy outputs during gait. We evaluated the impacts of two common processing steps for synergy analyses: low pass (<b>LP)</b> <b>filtering</b> and unit variance scaling. We evaluated EMG data collected during barefoot walking from five muscles of 113 children with cerebral palsy (CP) and 73 typically-developing (TD) children. We applied <b>LP</b> <b>filters</b> to the EMG data with cutoff frequencies ranging from 4 to 40 Hz (reflecting the range reported in prior synergy research). We also evaluated the impact of normalizing EMG amplitude by unit variance. We found that the total variance accounted for (tVAF) by a given number of synergies was sensitive to <b>LP</b> <b>filter</b> choice and decreased in both TD and CP groups with increasing LP cutoff frequency (e. g., 9. 3 percentage points change for one synergy between 4 and 40 Hz). This change in tVAF can alter the number of synergies selected for further analyses. Normalizing tVAF to a z-score (e. g., dynamic motor control index during walking, walk-DMC) reduced sensitivity to LP cutoff. Unit variance scaling caused comparatively small changes in tVAF. Synergy weights and activations were impacted less than tVAF by <b>LP</b> <b>filter</b> choice and unit variance normalization. These results demonstrate that EMG signal processing methods impact outputs of synergy analysis and z-score based measures can assist in reporting and comparing results across studies and clinical centers...|$|R

40|$|Two advanced, hot gas, {{barrier filter}} system {{concepts}} {{have been proposed}} by the Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation to improve the reliability and availability of barrier filter systems in applications such as PFBC and IGCC power generation. The two hot gas, barrier filter system concepts, the inverted candle filter system and the sheet filter system, were the focus of bench-scale testing, data evaluations, and commercial cost evaluations to assess their feasibility as viable barrier filter systems. The program {{results show that the}} inverted candle filter system has high potential to be a highly reliable, commercially successful, hot gas, barrier filter system. Some types of thin-walled, standard candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> can be used directly as inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> {{and the development of a}} new type of <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is not a requirement of this technology. Six types of inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program in cold flow and high-temperature test campaigns. The thin-walled McDermott 610 CFCC inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements,</b> and the thin-walled Pall iron aluminide inverted candle <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> are the best candidates for demonstration of the technology. Although the capital cost of the inverted candle filter system is estimated to range from about 0 to 15 % greater than the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, the operating cost and life-cycle cost of the inverted candle filter system is expected to be superior to that of the standard candle filter system. Improved hot gas, barrier filter system availability will result in improved overall power plant economics. The inverted candle filter system is recommended for continued development through larger-scale testing in a coal-fueled test facility, and inverted candle containment equipment has been fabricated and shipped to a gasifier development site for potential future testing. Two types of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> were procured and assessed in the program through cold flow and high-temperature testing. The Blasch, mullite-bonded alumina sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> is the only candidate currently approaching qualification for demonstration, although this oxide-based, monolithic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> may be restricted to operating temperatures of 538 C (1000 F) or less. Many other types of ceramic and intermetallic sheet <b>filter</b> <b>elements</b> could be fabricated. The estimated capital cost of the sheet filter system is comparable to the capital cost of the standard candle filter system, although this cost estimate is very uncertain because the commercial price of sheet <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> manufacturing has not been established. The development of the sheet filter system could result in a higher reliability and availability than the standard candle filter system, but not as high as that of the inverted candle filter system. The sheet filter system has not reached the same level of development as the inverted candle filter system, and it will require more design development, <b>filter</b> <b>element</b> fabrication development, small-scale testing and evaluation before larger-scale testing could be recommended...|$|R
