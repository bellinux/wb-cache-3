He takes off his gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks up into his own reflection and contemplates himself for a <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kimberly Roots, {{writing for}} TV Line, {{responded to the}} kiss scene by stating, [...] "What got me – and still gets me – about this kiss is how much fire it has. This isn’t a drunken, {{convenient}} hook-up. This isn’t a let’s-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something unacknowledged between them. We get a <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> of LoVe in action before they break apart and realize what just happened." [...] Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] one of the [...] "10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars".|$|E
500|$|When {{the tenth}} inning ended, giving Hershiser the record, he [...] "stood bent {{with his hands}} on his knees for a <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> after the final out and then was {{inundated}} by teammates pouring out of the dugout to congratulate him." [...] Drysdale served as the Dodger radio broadcast announcer with Vin Scully that year. As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand, he was searching for Drysdale and saying [...] "Where is Drysdale? I've got to find Drysdale". Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the dugout, Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview.|$|E

60|$|For <b>long</b> <b>moments</b> {{there was}} silence {{broken only by the}} tramp of the old man as he strode heavily to and fro. At last the {{footsteps}} ceased, and Hare opened his eyes to see Naab's tall form erect, his arms uplifted, his shaggy head rigid.|$|R
60|$|The watcher quivered at {{the sight}} of those pale faces; but he must wait while <b>long</b> <b>moments</b> passed.

500|$|Director Tom Hooper {{lets his}} actors shine, {{as he did}} so marvelously in Helen Mirren's Elizabeth I and the child-killer drama Longford, but he {{complements}} them, too, with this kind of immediate point of view. And when he does give us panoramic shots from afar – of the Adams farm in Braintree, for example – they're askew, to keep us out of the classroom mode. At the end of episode 2 [...] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice. When the long-fretting Congress finally decides to break with Britain, he refrains from using any visual or aural tweaks. Upon the announcement, [...] "The resolution carries," [...] the scene remains perfectly silent for one <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room, while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away.|$|E
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night.

60|$|Suddenly Jane's {{concentrated}} gaze {{caught a}} fleeting glint. Quickly {{she brought her}} glass {{to bear on the}} spot.

60|$|On {{the other}} side of the ridge of cedars the hounds treed their quarry again, as was easy to tell by their change from sharp {{intermittent}} yelping to an unbroken, full, deep chorus.

40|$|Background: Patients {{undergoing}} proximal femoral {{replacement for}} tumor resection often have compromised hip abductor muscles {{resulting in a}} Trendelenberg limp and hip instability. Commercially available proximal femoral prostheses offer several designs with varying sites of attachment for the abductor muscles, however, no analyses of these configurations have been performed to determine which design provides the <b>longest</b> <b>moment</b> arm for the hip abductor muscles during normal function. Methods: This study analyzed hip abductor moment arm through hip adduction and abduction with a trigonometric mathematical model to evaluate the effects of alterations in anatomy and proximal femoral prosthesis design. Prosthesis dimensions were taken from technical schematics that {{were obtained from the}} prosthesis manufacturers. Manufacturers who contributed schematics for this investigation were Stryker Orthopaedics and Biomet. Results: Superior and lateral displacement of the greater trochanter increased the hip abductor mechanical advantage for single-leg stance and adduction and preserved moment arm in the setting of Trendelenberg gait. Hip joint medialization resulted in less variance of the abductor moment arm through coronal motion. The Stryker GMRS endoprosthesis provided the <b>longest</b> <b>moment</b> arm in single-leg stance...|$|R

60|$|He {{heard the}} click of iron-shod hoofs on stone, the coarse {{laughter}} of men, and then voices gradually dying away. <b>Long</b> <b>moments</b> passed. Then he rose.

60|$|<b>Long</b> <b>moments</b> I sat there, {{with the}} poignant {{consciousness}} of the wildness of the scene, of the significant rattling of the stones and of the bell-tongued hound baying incessantly, sending warm joy through my veins, the absorption in sensations new, yielding only to the hunting instinct when Satan snorted and quivered. Again the deep-toned bay rang into the silence with its stirring thrill of life. And a sharp rattling of stones just above brought another snort from Satan.|$|R
60|$|With that {{a puff of}} air {{seemed to}} rise, and on it the most awful bellow of thunderous roar. It rolled up and widened, deadened to burst out and roll louder, then slowly, like {{mountains}} on wheels, rumbled under the rim-walls, passing on and on, to roar back in echo from the cliffs of the mesas. Roar and rumble--roar and rumble! for two <b>long</b> <b>moments</b> the dull and hollow echoes rolled at us, to die away slowly in the far-distant canyons.|$|R
