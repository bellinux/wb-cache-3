25|$|While not {{the fastest}} car all week, the #11 Castrol Holden VR Commodore {{was close to}} the front in most sessions, and the race looked <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> battle between Wayne Gardner, Craig Lowndes, Glenn Seton and the Perkins car. At the start, a minor {{collision}} between Perkins and Lowndes saw the tyre valve from Perkins front right wheel torn off, resulting in the deflation of the tyre, and a slow lap back around to the pits. After replacing the tyre, and checking for other damage, Perkins roared down pit lane, trying to stay on the lead lap, a feat he accomplished.|$|E
25|$|JR {{goes through}} a brief time of having lost himself and again battling legal troubles. Months later, he is back on track with his life and has {{reconciled}} with Babe, though the two still do not continue their romance. On January 10, 2008, they {{go out for a}} snowday with Little Adam and have fun building a snowman, throwing snowballs and enjoying each other's company. The two express that they <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> family, just them and Little Adam. When JR talks of being a better man, one that Babe can possibly like again, the two nearly kiss. Babe stops the intimate encounter before it can happen and reminds JR that when they become romantic with each other, it never lasts and ends in destruction. JR tells Babe that he loves her and asks her to give them another chance, but as friends first and see where it leads. Babe, hesitant at first, accepts his request.|$|E

I hung out {{with a lot of}} rock stars but no one ever did that to the same extent. There was just an ease to the whole thing. They really were the kindest, most fun band I ever worked with." ...|$|E
500|$|Epstein {{attended}} the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors Susannah York, Albert Finney, and Peter O'Toole, but Epstein dropped {{out after the}} third term, {{saying that he had}} become [...] "too much of a businessman to enjoy being a student, and I didn't <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> student at all." [...] He said in 1964 that he [...] "felt like an old man at the age of 21". He also revealed that {{he would have liked to}} produce a theatre play, or even act, [...] "in something by Chekhov", or a [...] "straight drama" [...] by John Osborne.|$|E
500|$|The celebration proved popular, {{and when}} the Queen {{came of age in}} 1898, her inauguration was {{postponed}} a week to 6 September so as not to interfere with Koninginnedag. [...] The annual holiday fell {{on the final day of}} school summer vacation, which made it popular among schoolchildren. It is uncertain how much Wilhelmina enjoyed the festivities; although writer Mike Peek, in a 2011 magazine article about Koninginnedag, suggests she was enthusiastic, there is a story of Wilhelmina, after a tired return from one of these birthday processions, making her doll bow until the toy's hair was dishevelled, and telling it, [...] "Now you shall sit in a carriage and bow until your back aches, and see how much you <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> Queen!" ...|$|E

500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but {{for me it was}} a bit <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} advice he gives aspiring songwriters {{is to write}} what you know or what you've experienced. [...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 2009, Morrissey {{appeared}} as corrupt police detective Maurice Jobson in Red Riding, the Channel 4 adaptation of David Peace's Red Riding novels. Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or wanted to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a good cop, he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Prydain, Alexander was chosen to be author-in-residence at Temple University from 1970 to 1974.

2500|$|The 2003 Ang Lee-directed Hulk film saw {{discussion}} of the character's appeal to Asian Americans. The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the [...] "subcurrent of repression" [...] that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: [...] "Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed—there was always pressure to do something 'useful,' <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> doctor." [...] Jeff Yang, writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that [...] "the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans—especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents' wishes." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that the differences}} between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde's works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily—race and sexuality. In Ada Gay Griffin and Michelle Parkerson's documentary A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde, Lorde says, [...] "Let me tell you first {{about what it was}} <b>like</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> Black woman poet in the '60s, from jump.
