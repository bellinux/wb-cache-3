40|$|Impact {{evaluation}} studies routinely {{find that}} lending to women benefits their households, {{but not necessarily}} the women concerned. The reasons for this paradox are not well understood. This, I argue, is {{partly because of the}} obsession with viewing women’s empowerment as outcomes alone and ignoring the processes leading to these. I investigate this paradox by examining the processes surrounding <b>loan</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> a case study from rural India. The way in which women’s <b>loans</b> are <b>used</b> is found to be critical to their empowerment. Specifically, women whose loans are invested in household assets can find the process disempowering. This is because women lack co-ownership in household’s productive assets. Where loan diversion by households cannot be controlled, women’s joint ownership of household assets emerges as integral to their empowerment. This paper cautions against the excessive focus on women’s outcomes as a measure of their empowerment. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{relentless}} {{effort of}} the government to control rising house prices in urban China have differential impacts on the various segments of the population due to their differential demand for homeownership. Hence, {{it is important for the}} government to have a better understanding of the underlying demand for homeownership, especially with respect to the different demographic variables and accessibility to loans and housing providence funds (HPF), in order to provide a more comprehensive strategy and to address some of the equity issues that may arise from these countermeasures. To this effect, this paper develop and estimate a binary logit model of homeownership and accessibility to HPF <b>loans</b> <b>using</b> a variety of demographic variables. Our findings document that high school graduates are less likely to own a house while people with longer duration of employment and households who are married and with children are more likely to own a house. The results also show that gender, marital status, education level, high annual income and duration of employment are significantly related to HPF <b>loan</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> homeownership...|$|R

In particular we are interested to know whether households use mental accounting when consuming different categories of good. It is useful for assessing the impact of remittances on household consumption behaviour. We use 1998 cross-sectional data to find the following key results: (i) mental accounting systems are in operation. Remittance income exhibits a high marginal propensity to save, (ii) household income influences consumption habits, (iii) receipt of remittance income impacts on saving and spending habits. This {{is in line with}} the theory of remittances and corresponding mental accounting theory, and, finally, (iv) both remittances and <b>loans</b> are <b>used</b> <b>for</b> consumption smoothing and investment purposes. ...|$|R

These findings contrast with studies for the United States which generally find significant negative abnormal returns for convertible bond loans and negative but no significant abnormal returns for warrant-bond loans. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that Dutch companies generally package these announcements with other (good) firm specific news. Using regression analysis, in which the amount of new equity and new debt involved in the issue are taken into account, {{it is found that}} shareholders react more positively to the announcement of warrant-bond loans than to the announcement of convertible bond loans. ...|$|R
