A cis-acting DNA element within a discreet KSHV genomic region termed the long unique region (LUR) can initiate and support replication of plasmids lacking LANA-binding sequences or a eukaryotic replication origin.

We have investigated the interaction of EBNA- 1 with p 32, a host mitochondrial protein that associates with EBNA- 1 in EBV-positive Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that a fraction of p 32 localizes to the viral latent cycle origin of DNA replication oriP in vivo. p 32 binds EBNA- 1 independently of other proteins or DNA. EBNA- 1 variants lacking one of two p 32 binding elements did not interact stably with p 32 in cultured cells and were defective for both transcriptional activation of a reporter gene linked to oriP FR and replication and/or maintenance of a plasmid bearing oriP.

As for most viral diseases, current {{antiviral}} treatments {{are based on the}} inhibition of viral replication once it has already started. As a consequence, they impair neither the viral cycle at its early stages nor the latent form of the virus, and thus cannot be considered as real preventive treatments. Latent HSV 1 virus could be addressed by rare cutting endonucleases, such as meganucleases. With the aim of a proof of concept study, we generated several meganucleases recognizing HSV 1 sequences, and assessed their antiviral activity in cultured cells. We demonstrate that expression of these proteins in African green monkey kidney fibroblast (COS- 7) and BSR cells inhibits infection by HSV 1, at low and moderate multiplicities of infection (MOIs), inducing a significant reduction of the viral load. Furthermore, the remaining viral genomes display a high rate of mutation (up to 16 %) at the meganuclease cleavage site, consistent with a mechanism of action based on the cleavage of the viral genome.

Sequence alignments among OBPs of gammaherpesviruses have revealed that the C terminus of LANA is structurally related to EBNA 1, the OBP of Epstein-Barr virus. Based on secondary structure predictions for LANA(DBD) and published structures of EBNA 1 (DBD), this study used bioinformatics tools to model a putative structure for LANA(DBD) bound to DNA. To validate the predicted model, 38 mutants targeting the most conserved motifs, namely three alpha-helices and a conserved proline loop, were constructed and functionally tested. In agreement with data for EBNA 1, residues in helices 1 and 2 mainly contributed to sequence-specific DNA binding and replication activity, whilst mutations in helix 3 affected replication activity and multimer formation.

During latent phase, the viral episome is tethered to the host chromosome and replicates once during every cell division. Latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is a predominant multifunctional nuclear protein expressed during latency, which plays {{a central role in}} episome tethering, replication and perpetual segregation of the episomes during cell division.

This study demon-strates that BBLF 1 is a myristoylated and palmitoylated protein, as are UL 11 and UL 99. Myristoylation of BBLF 1 both facilitates its membrane anchoring and stabilizes it. BBLF 1 is shown to localize to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) along with gp 350 / 220, a site where final envelopment of EBV particles takes place. The localization of BBLF 1 at the TGN requires myristoylation and two acidic clusters, which interact with PACS- 1, a cytosolic protein, to mediate retrograde transport from the endosomes to the TGN. Knockdown of the expression of BBLF 1 during EBV lytic replication reduces the production of virus particles, demonstrating the requirement of BBLF 1 to achieve optimal production of virus particles. BBLF 1 is hypothesized to facilitate the budding of tegumented capsid into glycoprotein-embeddedmembrane during viral maturation.

As the casein kinase 2 (CK 2) site at serine 392 is the C-terminal phosphorylation motif that exhibits the most pronounced conservation at the primary amino acid level, we have focused on determining whether the CK 2 site is modified in vivo and whether radiation effects the extent of that phosphorylation. Using antibodies that can detect serine 392 -phosphorylation of p 53, we demonstrate that UV radiation can trigger extensive phosphorylation at the CK 2 site.

During latent infection, two viral {{elements are}} required: latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which functions as an origin binding protein, and the latent origin, which resides within the terminal repeats (TRs) of the viral genome. Previously, we identified two cis-elements within the TRs which {{are required for}} <b>latent</b> <b>DNA</b> replication: two LANA binding sites (LBS 1 and LBS 2 [LBS 1 / 2]) and a GC-rich replication element (RE) upstream of LBS 1 / 2. To further characterize the RE, we constructed a 71 -bp minimal replicon (MR) and performed a detailed mutational analysis. Our data indicate that the first 8 nucleotides within the RE are critical for replication. Moreover, both the position and {{the distance between the}} RE and LBS 1 / 2 can affect origin replication activity, suggesting that the RE may function as a loading pad for cellular proteins involved in replication. Using biotinylated DNA fragments of wild-type or mutant MRs as probes, we identified 30 proteins that preferentially bind to the origin. Among these proteins, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (SSRP 1), a subunit of the FACT complex, and telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TRF 2) formed complexes with LANA at the MR region. Furthermore, the small interfering RNA-based knockdown of SSRP 1, but not the dominant-negative-based knockdown of TRF 2, significantly decreased the efficiency of LANA-dependent DNA replication.

Previous work demonstrated that latent HSV- 1 genomes are not extensively methylated, but these studies lacked the resolution to examine methylation of individual CpGs that could repress transcription from individual promoters during latency. To address this point, we employed established models to predict genomic regions with the highest probability of being methylated and, using bisulfite sequencing, analyzed the methylation profiles of these regions.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the latent HSV- 1 DNA repeat regions demonstrated that a portion of the LAT region is associated with histone H 3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14, consistent with a euchromatic and nonrepressed structure. In contrast, the chromatin associated with the HSV- 1 DNA polymerase gene located in the unique long segment was not enriched in H 3 acetylated at lysines 9 and 14, suggesting a transcriptionally inactive structure.

These results demonstrate that BoHV- 5 and the recombinant BoHV- 5 tk&# 916; do establish latent infection in neural and non-neural sites. Reactivation of the recombinant BoHV- 5 tk&# 916;, however, appeared to occur only in non-neural sites. In anyway, the ability of a tk-deleted strain to reactivate latent infection deserves attention in the context of vaccine safety...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -encoded BART microRNAs (miR-BARTs) {{are highly}} {{expressed}} in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), {{suggesting that they}} might {{play a critical role}} in NPC development. In order to investigate the function of miR-BARTs in nasopharyngeal epithelial (NP) cells, here a novel recombinant EBV construction and NP cell infection system was developed. CRISPR/Cas 9 system is an emerging DNA editing technology platform which is powerful in the manipulation of cellular genome. We first demonstrated that not only the human genome but also the genome of <b>latent</b> <b>DNA</b> viruses, which undergoes episomal replication in human cells, are amenable to cleavage and editing by CRISPR/Cas 9. By using this novel system, we constructed the miR-BART-deficient EBV by removal of 558 bp in the promoter region of BART transcript which encodes viral microRNAs in latently infected cells. A recombinant virus with the desired deletion was obtained after puromycin selection and the loss of miR-BART expression and activity was verified. Although CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated editing of EBV genome was highly efficient, the multicopy episome of EBV in infected cells constituted a major technical challenge to CRISPR/Cas 9 -medaited editing. In order to overcome this technical barrier, DsRed selectable marker was introduced into EBV genome during the course of CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated editing. DsRed incorporated viruses were successfully recovered and introduced into B cells at low moi and further isolated through cell sorting. B cells containing the pure mutant virus served as a good source of recombinant EBV for subsequent introduction into NP cells through co-culture. As one example, the miR-BART-deficient EBV was studied in NP cells. Taken together, our work provides a new and efficient method not only for targeted editing of EBV genome in human cells, but also for functional characterization of recombinant EBVs in NP cells...|$|E
40|$|Mutant viral strains deleted in non-essential genes {{represent}} useful {{tools to}} study the function of specific gene products in the biology of the virus. We herein describe an investigation on the phenotype of a bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV- 5) recombinant deleted in the gene encoding the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) in rabbits, with special emphasis to neuroinvasiveness {{and the ability to}} establish and reactivate latent infection. Rabbits inoculated with the parental virus (SV- 507 / 99) (n= 18) at a low titer (10 (5. 5) TCID 50) shed virus in nasal secretions in titers up to 10 (4. 5) TCID 50 for up to 12 days (average: 9. 8 days [5 - 12]) and 5 / 16 developed neurological disease and were euthanized in extremis. Rabbits inoculated with the recombinant BoHV- 5 TK&# 916; at a high dose (10 (7. 1) TCID 50) also shed virus in nasal secretions, yet to lower titers (maximum: 10 (2. 3) TCID 50) and for a shorter period (average: 6. 6 days [2 - 11]) and remained healthy. PCR examination of brain sections of inoculated rabbits at day 6 post-infection (pi) revealed a widespread distribution of the parental virus, whereas DNA of the recombinant BoHV- 5 TK&# 916;-was detected only in the trigeminal ganglia [TG] and olfactory bulbs [OB]. Nevertheless, during latent infection (52 pi), DNA of the recombinant virus was detected in the TGs, OBs and also {{in other areas of the}} brain, demonstrating the ability of the virus to invade the brain. Dexamethasone (Dx) administration at day 65 pi was followed by virus reactivation and shedding by 5 / 8 rabbits inoculated with the parental strain (mean duration of 4. 2 days [1 - 9]) and by none of seven rabbits inoculated with the recombinant virus. Again, PCR examination at day 30 post-Dx treatment revealed the presence of <b>latent</b> <b>DNA</b> in the TGs, OBs and in other areas of the brain of both groups. Taken together, these results confirm that the recombinant BoHV- 5 TK&# 916; is highly attenuated for rabbits. It shows a reduced ability to replicate in the nose but retains the ability to invade the brain and to establish latent infection. Additional studies are underway to determine the biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the inability of BoHV- 5 TK&# 916; to reactivate from latency...|$|E

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have localized the minimal DNA binding domain of EBNA 1 to between amino acids 470 and 607. We have also demonstrated that EBNA 1 assembles cooperatively on the dyad symmetry subelement of oriP and that this cooperative interaction is mediated by residues within the minimal DNA binding and dimerization domain of EBNA 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTreatment {{for most}} {{persistent}} viral infections consists of palliative drug options rather than curative approaches. This is often because long-lasting viral DNA in infected cells is {{not affected by}} current antivirals, providing a source for viral persistence and reactivation. Targeting <b>latent</b> viral <b>DNA</b> itself could therefore {{provide a basis for}} novel curative strategies. DNA cleavage enzymes can be used to induce targeted mutagenesis of specific genes, including those of exogenous viruses. Although initial in vitro and even in vivo studies have been carried out using DNA cleavage enzymes targeting various viruses, many questions still remain concerning the feasibility of these strategies as they transition into preclinical research. Here, we review the most recent findings on DNA cleavage enzymes for human viral infections, consider the most relevant animal models for several human viral infections, and address issues regarding safety and enzyme delivery. Results from well-designed in vivo studies will ideally provide answers to the most urgent remaining questions, and allow continued progress toward clinical application...|$|R
40|$|Biotin-labeled Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -specific DNA probes {{have been}} used to detect viral genomes by in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemically amplified signals {{produced}} by the hybridized probe allow visualization of viral DNA even in cells previously reported to contain only one or two EBV genomes. In EBV producer lymphoid cell lines, such as B 95 - 8, P 3 HR- 1, or Daudi, activation of <b>latent</b> EBV <b>DNA</b> could be observed in mitotic cells; in non-virus-producing cells of these same lines, EBV was found to be present in low copy numbers. Noninducible cell lines such as IB 4, AW-Ramos, and Namalwa exhibited low but clearly positive hybridization. Unexpectedly, significant variations in the amounts of EBV DNA per cell were observed between individual cells of these lines. The EBV DNA in the cloned IB 4 cell line was localized to chromosome 4 in metaphase cells, but in the noncloned converted line AW-Ramos, the location of integrated viral DNA was essentially random...|$|R
