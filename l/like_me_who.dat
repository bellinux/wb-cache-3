Peter Gabriel's So kind of gave everyone the go-ahead that this could work in a popular fashion. For people <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> were exploring those sounds, the wonder of if it's going to work or not just went away at that point."

500|$|After {{retirement}} from first-class cricket {{at the end}} of the 1960 season in England, McCool returned to Australia, taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at Umina Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue.

500|$|Sam McPherson of Zap2it {{said that}} he [...] "enjoyed 'A Christmas Carol' more than I have almost any other special that has aired since the series {{restarted}} in 2005", but thought that [...] "some parts were absolutely silly, and others were absolutely incoherent" [...] due to the frantic pace. While he considered Amy and Rory [...] "criminally underused", they were responsible for [...] "heavy laughs" [...] and left the Doctor to be the [...] "delight of the episode". The Daily Telegraph Chris Harvey was less enthusiastic about the episode, saying that it [...] "started nicely", but that [...] "by {{the time she was}} singing to the shark, I'd had enough," [...] while thinking that, [...] "It's not really for old curmudgeons <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>who</b> got more of a kick out of Michael Gambon's miserly Kazran Sardick when he was sneering and snarling {{at the beginning of the}} episode than when he had been thoroughly heartwarmed by the end." ...|$|E

500|$|Hole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but {{dropped out}} of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over {{production}} costs between Love and Manson, in addition to the fact that Hole was forced the open for Manson under an agreement with Interscope Records. Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen. Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members. Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: [...] "What I really don't like—there are certain girls that like us, or <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> <b>who</b> are really messed up... and they {{do not need to be}}—they're very young—and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously cut themselves, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool." ...|$|E
500|$|Founder Ted Frank {{has said}} that [...] "the whole reason I started this is {{because there is a}} high {{probability}} of district courts rubber-stamping settlements. I think these are very bad settlements that the [...] will provide guidance for when judges should or shouldn’t approve settlements.” He has also said [...] "the class action landscape has long included some “professional settlement objectors” who target large cases in hopes of extracting a percentage of the attorney fees as a reward. But that doesn’t solve the problem. The niche isn’t being filled unless you find somebody crazy <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> is willing to spend dozens of hours of his own time and hundreds of dollars of his own money to make a claim he can’t benefit from." [...] Frank said in an objection in a case at the Court of the United States District Court Northern District of Ohio of the CCAF, [...] "while the Center focuses on bringing objections to unfair class action settlements, it makes no effort to engage in quid pro quo settlements to extort attorneys, and has never settled an objection. The Center analyses complaints from consumers aggrieved by class actions settlement notices to determine whether a settlement is objectionable under the law because it favors attorneys over class members." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{consistently}} warm reception towards Cox and her character, {{some aspects}} of Monica's characterization have been criticized. The second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies" [...] sparked controversy due to one of its storylines revolving around Monica and Rachel arguing over which roommate will win the last remaining condom in their apartment {{in order to have}} sex with their respective boyfriends, Richard and Ross. In her book Narratives, Health, and Healing: Communication Theory, Research, and Practice, author Lynn M. Harter defended the storyline, arguing that it promotes safe sex. Rachel eventually wins the condom in a game of rock, paper, scissors, forcing Monica to abstain for the night. Monica's overweight alter-ego [...] "Fat Monica" [...] has often been accused of being an offensive stereotype of overweight women exploited for laughs. Although identifying a formerly overweight character as [...] "a standard TV trope", the New Statesman's Bim Adewunmi wrote that Fat Monica [...] "always struck a weird note" [...] with the writer despite the show's efforts [...] "to pinpoint a solid and satisfying back-story for the character". Megan Kirby of xoJane questioned the negative effect the show's fat jokes would have on its overweight viewers, writing, [...] "What does this mean for the girls <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> never become thin? Are we relegated to side roles and stereotypes in our own lives? Of course, this isn’t true. But I think it sometimes, dark and secret: The fat girl doesn’t get to be the protagonist." [...] Emma Tarver of Feminspire complained that Fat Monica [...] "made me think as a child that I was unworthy of love, was going to be mocked relentlessly by my friends and family for my weight, and should never bother flirting because I would just disgust every man I looked at." [...] Contrarily, Kelsey Miller of Refinery29 received Fat Monica positively as [...] "proof I could overcome my disgusting plumpness and be seen as lovable, too". In spite of these complaints, Fat Monica proved so popular among audiences that the writers would resurrect the character for a total of four flashback episodes, each of which aired featuring Cox dressed as Fat Monica and eating a doughnut while dancing after the show had finished taping much to the amusement of the studio audience. Although she only appears physically in four, Fat Monica is referenced in approximately half of the show's episodes, and has since proven popular enough to be adapted into an internet meme.|$|E

2500|$|Not all BevMo! {{expansion}} {{has been}} welcomed by city residents. In March 2010 in Santa Barbara, California, a group voiced opposition at a city board meeting, delaying {{approval of a}} BevMo! store. Concerns brought up at the meeting included complaints about the company's plans to cut down a tree in the parking lot, and about loading dock plans that would increase congestion in a narrow alley. The city's Architectural Board of Review member Paul Zink recommended against BevMo!'s plans to have pedestrians cross a parking lot to enter the store, saying that [...] "there's a tie-in between what's inside and the street". Zink continued, [...] "here in Santa Barbara, we like to window shop." [...] Area retailers noted that a new liquor store within range of nine smaller liquor stores and several supermarkets that sell liquor would decrease sales for longstanding area businesses. Sarkis Abdulhi, a liquor store owner, asked, [...] "how can a politician say they support small business when they bring in giant chains? How many employees {{are they going to}} have, 13? What good does that do anybody when they put nine or 10 small shops out of business?" [...] Area resident Trudy Fernandez said the opening of chain location [...] "takes away from what people <b>like</b> <b>me</b> <b>who</b> have been in Santa Barbara 40 years came here for.

5000|$|PopMatters {{described}} this song: [...] "In {{a number of}} songs on the new album, including the current single, 'The Real Slim Shady,' Eminem slams his 'enemies' with comic book intensity. In the video, he wears a superhero costume and an insane asylum straitjacket while rapping, 'I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, {{all you do is}} annoy me / So I have been sent here to destroy you / And there's a million of us just <b>like</b> <b>me</b> / <b>Who</b> cuss <b>like</b> me; who just don't give a fuck <b>like</b> <b>me</b> / <b>Who</b> dress <b>like</b> me; walk, talk and act <b>like</b> <b>me</b> / And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me!' Of course, the irony is built into the song: Eminem's signature style the bleached blond hair, pale skin, humungous T-shirt has spawned droves of lookalikes and wannabes. Voila, he's a teen idol. Poor Em, can't win for losing." [...] Allmusic highlighted the single. Will Hermes was positive: [...] "In the aftermath of Slim Shady, he married the girlfriend he imagined killing, while his mother, immortalized in his hit single 'My Name Is' (I just found out my Mom does more dope than I do), sued him for $10 million for defamation of character." [...] The defamation case was settled in 2001 for $25,000, with Debbie Mathers' former attorney being awarded $23,354—netting Ms. Mathers' just over $1600 for her efforts. LA Times wrote: [...] "'The Real Slim Shady,' the first single from the album, is a modest step to the mainstream—a fresh and funny, almost PG-rated swipe at everything from the Grammy Awards to shallow teen pop." ...|$|R
