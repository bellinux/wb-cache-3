The process of lateral erosion in bedrock channels is poorly understood. This thesis {{sheds light on}} the mechanisms of lateral bedrock erosion {{as well as the}} larger scale drivers of lateral erosion. Contained in this thesis are three distinct studies: a field-based study that investigates the drivers of <b>lateral</b> <b>planation</b> of strath surfaces; an experimental study that seeks to identify specific mechanisms of lateral erosion; and a numerical modeling study that seeks to corroborate the findings of the experimental study and permit exploration of parameter space. The field study (Chapter 1) concludes that <b>lateral</b> <b>planation</b> of strath surfaces in the dominant channel erosion process during periods of elevated sediment supply. This study further concludes that the elevated sediment supply conditions were driven by changes in climate. The experimental study (Chapter 2) concludes that the deflection of saltating bedload particles by fixed roughness elements into the wall is an effective mechanism of erosion. In addition, the experimental study identifies a minimum roughness threshold that must be crossed before significant lateral erosion can occur. Finally, the experimental study suggests that once the roughness threshold is crossed (i. e. moving from a smooth bed devoid of roughness elements to a bed with roughness elements), further increases in bed roughness do not produce ever increasing rates of lateral erosion. Rather, an erosion rate plateau is reached shortly after the roughness threshold is crossed. The numerical modeling study (Chapter 3) corroborates the findings of the experimental study and demonstrates, from first principles, that lateral erosion by deflected bed load particles is an effective mechanism of lateral bedrock erosion. In addition, this study identifies an important trade-off between increased deflection surface area from larger roughness elements and the increased form drag associated with the larger roughness elements. Here, {{the increase in the number}} of particle deflections is offset by the decrease in particle kinetic energy on impact, resulting in the erosion rate plateau observed in the physical experiments...|$|E

This estimated elevation casts doubt on the conventional belief that the low-relief geomorphic surface was formed by <b>lateral</b> <b>planation</b> of streams to a base level not much higher than sea level and that the present deeply incised canyons must represent Neogene uplift of Colorado. Description of the surface, calculations of sediment volume, and isostatic balance and fluvial landsculpting models demonstrate that while the high elevation of the erosion surface was due to tectonic forces, its smoothness was mostly a result of climatic factors. A sediment balance calculated for the Front Range suggests that from 2 to 4 km of material were eroded by the late Eocene, consistent with fission track ages. This amount of erosion would remove a significant portionof the 7 km of Laramide upper crustal thickening. Isostatic modeling implies that the 2. 2 - 3. 3 km elevation was most likely created by lower crustal thickening during the Laramide. A numerical model of fluvial erosion and deposition suggests a way that a late Eocene surface could have formed at this high elevation without incision. A humid climate with a preponderance of small storm events will diffusively smooth topography and is a possible mechanism for formation oflow-relief, high-level surfaces. Paleoclimate models suggest a lack of large strom events in the late Eocene because of cool sea surface temperatures in the equatorial region. Return to a drier but stormier climate post-Eocene could have caused the incision of the surface by young canyons. By this interpretation, regional erosion surfaces may represent regional climatic rather than tectonic conditions...|$|E

These rates must however be taken with caution. Numericalsimulations actually suggest that incision rates are not linear betweenthe formation of two successive terraces. The Rangitikei River (New Zealand) is downcutting in an uplifting basement. Entrenchment is punctuated by terraces, the more recent one(T 1) being classically considered to formed from 30 to 15 ka. Sinceabandonment of T 1, the river incised 75 -meter deep gorges within thebedrock. We investigated this entrenchment using optical dating (IRSLon feldspars) of 17 alluvial deposits from strath terraces cut into the bedrock. We performed measurements using Multiple Aliquots or SingleAliquot Regenerative protocols on large aliquots of fine grains of feldspars(4 - 11 um) as well as measurements on single-grains on a coarserfraction (125 - 200 um) of the same samples but using Post-Infrared IRSL(p-IRIR) protocol. We show that :(1) abandonment of terrace T 1 occurred 10 kyr ago, more recentlythan previous estimates(2) a period of very fast incision follows the formation of T 1. Incisionrate then slows down; this decrease coincides with the development ofextensive post-T 1 terraces. Our data support numerical findings showingthat the ratio of vertical incision to <b>lateral</b> <b>planation</b> is driven largely byvariations in vertical incision rate(3) The distribution of single-grains ages depend on the river incisionrate, periods of fast incision being characterized by a larger proportionof unbleached grains in the samples. Accordingly, IRSL ages obtainedusing classical methods that consider measures on aliquots instead ofon singles grains, all show an overestimation of ages whose magnitudedepends on incision rate. We show that ion IRLL geochronology, the proportion of mixing betweenbleached and unbleached grains is intimately linked to variationsin the rate of bedrock erosion and related supply of unbleached grainsto the river. Our study consequently suggests that the shape and widthof IRSL age distributions obtained through single-grain measurementscould illuminate the past dynamics of rivers...|$|E
50|$|A polje, in {{geological}} terminology, is a large, flat-floored depression within karst limestone, whose {{long axis}} develops {{in parallel with}} major structural trends and can become several miles (tens of kilometers) long. Superficial deposits tend to accumulate along the floor. Drainage may be either by surface watercourses (as an open polje) or by swallow holes (as a closed polje) or ponors. Usually, the ponors cannot transmit entire flood flows, so many poljes become wet-season lakes. The structure of some poljes {{is related to the}} geological structure, but others are purely the result of <b>lateral</b> dissolution and <b>planation.</b> The development of poljes is fostered by any blockage in the karst drainage.|$|R

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems Graduate Group, Geology Option, 2012 Strath terrace and {{knickpoint}} formation along mainstem {{channels are}} indicators of landscape response to tectonic and climatic forcing in the Smith River watershed in northwestern California. Knickpoints in the Smith River basin are manifest {{as a distinct}} point {{where there is a}} break in slope of the longitudinal profile at the upstream end of an oversteepened reach, the knickzone. Two types of knickpoints occur. At larger drainage areas in the lower portion of the basin, knickpoints and associated downstream knickzones occur within rock types with no significant difference in rock strength as confirmed by Schmidt hammer measurements. There is a distinct upstream convergence of the modern channel with the lowest elevated strath surface along these knickzones, resulting in elevated strath surfaces downstream of the knickzones. We infer that the knickpoints are migratory and that the straths are more vertically separated from the modern channel only after the knickpoint has migrated upstream. Reconstructed paleo-longitudinal profiles project to oxygen isotope stage 5 e marine terraces near the coast and suggest that base-level fall as a result of falling sea level following late Pleistocene eustatic sea level highstands may engender migratory knickpoints now preserved upstream. At smaller drainage areas in the upper portion of the basin, the only knickpoints present in channels are those associated with large landslides that mobilize entire hillslopes into the channel and thereby force a channel response. 	Extensive preservation of strath terraces throughout the basin indicates that strath terraces record base-level lowering and subsequent incision of the river. In lower portions of the basin incision is achieved by knickpoint migration, producing strath terraces with long profiles that are nonparallel to the modern river profile. In upper portions of the basin periods of vertical incision and <b>lateral</b> <b>planation</b> are related to climate-driven fluctuations in sediment production on channel hillslopes resulting in strath terrace long profiles that do parallel the modern river profile...|$|E
40|$|Techniques and {{approaches}} from the disciplines of pedology and geomorphology have been integrated {{to investigate the}} distribution and properties of soils, the development of landscapes, and to provide insights about previous climates and pedogenic processes in two areas in SE-Tasmania. The study areas include a coalesced fan landscape on a farm near Cambridge owned by the University of Tasmania, and a landscape of predominantly valley floor alluvial deposits in the Coal River Valley north of Richmond. Stratigraphic investigations show {{the landscape of the}} University Farm to be a pediment cut in predominantlyTertiary sediments covered by a veneer of Quaternary clastic deposits, with isolated outliers of Jurassic dolerite and Triassic sandstone rising above it. Stratigraphic units have been identified in the pedisediment based on differences in composition (source and nature of the sediment) and age (relative position in the landscape, degree of weathering and dissection). Sedimentological evidence suggests that these units have been formed by processes of <b>lateral</b> <b>planation</b> and alluvial and debris flow deposition ie., processes associated with both pediment and alluvial fan formation. Soil properties are related to the characteristics of each stratigraphic unit. They are attributable to both the composition and age of the unit. Sand infills have been identified in some soils and investigated using quartz grain morphoscopy and granulometric analysis. The infill phenomenon {{can be used as a}} time stratigraphic marker and provides insights about previous climatic conditions. Ferricrete and silcrete deposits were shown to have formed over discrete intervals of time due to precipitation from iron and silicon bearing groundwater flowing from higher level Jurassic dolerite and Triassic sandstone across hydraulic discontinuities in Tertiary sediments. The Coal River Valley has been shown to have a complex distribution of Quaternary sediments. These include alluvial deposits in a sequence of alluvial terraces (five stratigraphic units identified), pedisediment deposited on a surface cut in Tertiary basalt and Tertiary sediments (two stratigraphic units identified), and aeolian deposits (two units described). Soil profile classes have been identified developed in the stratigraphic units. Chronofunctions of properties of soils on alluvial stratigraphic units have been established, the most useful of which are depth functions of...|$|E
