25|$|An {{assessment}} of hyperacusis, a frequent accompaniment of tinnitus, {{may also be}} made. The measured parameter is <b>Loudness</b> <b>Discomfort</b> <b>Level</b> (LDL) in dB, the subjective level of acute discomfort at specified frequencies over the frequency range of hearing. This defines a dynamic range between the hearing threshold at that frequency and the loudnes discomfort level. A compressed dynamic range over a particular frequency range is associated with subjectve hyperacusis. Normal hearing threshold is generally defined as 020 decibels (dB). Normal loudness discomfort levels are 8590+ dB, with some authorities citing 100dB. A dynamic range of 55dB or less is indicative of hyperacusis.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the characteristics of tinnitus and tinnitus-related variables and explore their possible relationship with tinnitus-related handicap. Methods: Eighty-one patients with chronic tinnitus were included. The study protocol measured hearing status, tinnitus pitch, loudness, maskability and loudness discomfort levels. All patients filled in the Tinnitus Sample Case History Questionnaire, the Hyperacusis Questionnaire and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory. The relationship of each variable with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score was evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Five univariables {{were associated with the}} Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score: <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>level,</b> subjective tinnitus loudness, tinnitus awareness, noise intolerance and Hyperacusis Questionnaire score. Multiple regression analysis showed that the Hyperacusis Questionnaire score and tinnitus awareness were independently associated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score. Conclusion: Hyperacusis and tinnitus awareness were independently associated with the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory score. Questionnaires on tinnitus and hyperacusis are especially suited to providing additional insight into tinnitus-related handicap and are therefore useful for evaluating tinnitus patients...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{tinnitus}} is {{an increasingly}} common symptom, {{few studies have}} assessed its prevalence or incidence among adolescents. PURPOSE: To assess whether the presence of tinnitus in adolescents is associated with minimal hearing damage, evaluated through high-frequency audiometry (HFA), otoacoustic emission (OAE), and <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> (LDL). METHODS: The sample comprised 168 adolescents of a private school (61. 3 % boys; mean age 14. 1 years old; standard deviation= 2). All of them completed a questionnaire about tinnitus and hypersensitivity to sounds (sound intolerance), and then underwent otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry, HFA, LDL, transient and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (TOAE and DPOAE), and tinnitus pitch/loudness matching (the latter only in those with tinnitus). Participants were later divided into three groups: with no tinnitus (n= 73, 43. 4 %), with sporadic tinnitus (n= 47, 28 %), and with constant tinnitus (n= 48, 28. 6 %). RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between the groups regarding audiometry thresholds in frequencies from 0. 25 to 16 kHz, or TOAE and DPOAE. However, the LDL in adolescents with constant tinnitus was significantly lower than that in other groups, suggesting hypersensitivity to sounds. CONCLUSION: There {{was no evidence of}} minimal hearing damage in the audiometry and OAE. Nonetheless, the decreased LDL in adolescents with constant tinnitus suggests that their auditory system is more sensitive. Therefore, this may be the first sign of vulnerability to sounds. Future medium- to long-term monitoring of these students may show whether they will begin a process of functional impairment, altering hearing thresholds, and OAE...|$|E

This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an {{abstract}} published in Australian Journal of Audiology 2002. This version is reproduced with permission from the publisher, Australian Academic Press. [URL] aim of fitting a cochlear implant is to establish electrical stimulation parameters that will provide the wearer with comfortable and useful auditory sensations. One parameter that is fundamental to achieving this aim is the Maximum Comfortable Level (C-level). A C-level {{is the amount of}} electrical current that produces a loud, but comfortable sound. C-levels need to be established for all channels that a person will use in their speech processor Map. Determining C-levels can be complicated as the person is required to make a judgment about the loudness of a sound. While most adults and older children have the ability to make such a judgment and provide feedback to the clinician, this is rarely the case for young children. Generally, the only way a clinician will be aware a sound could be too loud for a young child is when they observe the child giving an aversive reaction or an involuntary blink. A current level that produces such a reaction is called the <b>Loudness</b> <b>Discomfort</b> <b>Level</b> (LOL). This study examines the relationship between LDLs and C-levels. Testing was performed with a group of adults, using stimulation rates and stimulation modes that are commonly used by children. The LDL/C-level relationship established in this study provides a procedure for selling C-Levels for young children when only loudness discomfort responses can be obtained. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{the present}} work to {{correlate}} clinical symptoms of auditory dysfunction (tinnitus, hyperacusis) after ablunt trauma of the head with objective audiological test results (otoacoustic emission, auditory brainstem response testing, impedance audiometry).

The clinical and otolaryngological examination (including otoscopy) of all patients revealed no pathological abnormalties. Pure tone audiometry showed a sensineural hearing loss at eight patients, this loss vanished entirely after three months. The main auditory symptomps were tinnitus (n= 9) and hyperacusis (n= 2). The results of testing the central auditory pathway showed that the transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions revealed statistically significant differences between amplitude differences of all patients in the linear, but not in the non-linear stimulation mode.

40|$|Background. There is no universally {{accepted}} definition for hyperacusis, {{but in general}} {{it is characterised by}} decreased sound tolerance to ordinary environmental sounds. Despite hyperacusis being prevalent and having significant clinical implications, much remains unknown about current management strategies. Purpose. To establish the current position of research on hyperacusis and identify research gaps to direct future research. Design and Sample. Using an established methodological framework, electronic and manual searches of databases and journals identified 43 records that met our inclusion criteria. Incorporating content and thematic analysis approaches, the definitions of hyperacusis, management strategies, and outcome measures were catalogued. Results. Only 67 % of the studies provided a definition of hyperacusis, such as “reduced tolerance” or “oversensitivity to sound. ” Assessments and outcome measures included <b>Loudness</b> <b>Discomfort</b> <b>Levels,</b> the Hyperacusis Questionnaire, and Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) interview.

40|$|In DFNA 8 / 12, an {{autosomal}} dominantly inherited type of nonsyndromic hearing impairment, the TECTA {{gene mutation}} causes a {{defect in the}} structure of the tectorial membrane in the inner ear. Because DFNA 8 / 12 affects the tectorial membrane, patients with DFNA 8 / 12 may show specific audiometric characteristics. In this study, five selected members of a Dutch DFNA 8 / 12 family with a TECTA sensorineural hearing impairment were evaluated with pure-tone audiometry, loudness scaling, speech perception in quiet and noise, difference limen for frequency, acoustic reflexes, otoacoustic emissions, and gap detection. Four out of five subjects showed an elevation of pure-tone thresholds, acoustic reflex thresholds, and <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels.</b> <b>Loudness</b> growth curves are parallel to those found in normal-hearing individuals. Suprathreshold measures such as difference limen for frequency modulated pure tones, gap detection, and particularly speech perception in noise are within the normal range. Distortion otoacoustic emissions are present at the higher stimulus level. These results are similar to those previously obtained from a Dutch DFNA 13 family with midfrequency sensorineural hearing impairment. It seems that a defect in the tectorial membrane results primarily in an attenuation of sound, whereas suprathreshold measures, such as otoacoustic emissions and speech perception in noise, are preserved rather well. The main effect of the defects is a shift in the operation point of the outer hair cells with near intact functioning at high levels. As most test results reflect those found in middle-ear conductive loss in both families, the sensorineural hearing impairment may be characterized as a cochlear conductive hearing impairment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Tinnitus is the {{perception}} of sound {{in the absence of}} a corresponding external acoustic stimulus. Bi-modal neuromodulation is emerging as a promising treatment for this condition. The main objectives of this study are to investigate the relevance of inter-stimuli timing and the choice of auditory stimuli for a proprietary bi-modal (auditory and somatosensory) neuromodulation device and to explore whether specific subtypes of patients are differentially responsive to this novel intervention for reducing the symptoms of chronic tinnitus. Methods and analysis: This is a two-site, randomised, triple-blind, exploratory study of a proprietary neuromodulation device with a pre-post and 12 -month follow-up design. Three different bi-modal stimulation parameter sets will be examined. The study will enrol 342 patients, split 80 : 20 between two sites (Dublin, Ireland and Regensburg, Germany), to complete 12 weeks of treatment with the device. Patients will be allocated to one of three arms using a step-wise stratification according to four binary categories: tinnitus tonality, sound level tolerance (using <b>Loudness</b> <b>Discomfort</b> <b>Level</b> of < 60 dB SL as an indicator for hyperacusis), hearing thresholds, and presence of a noise-induced audiometric profile. The main indicators of relative clinical efficacy for the three different parameter sets are two patient-reported outcomes measures, the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and the Tinnitus Functional Index, after 12 weeks of intervention. Clinical efficacy will be further explored in a series of patient subtypes, split by the stratification variables and by presence of a somatic tinnitus. Evidence for sustained effects on the psychological and functional impact of tinnitus will be followed up for 12 months. Safety data will be collected and reported. A number of feasibility measures to inform future trial design include: reasons for exclusion, completeness of data collection, attrition rates, patient’s adherence to the device usage as per manufacturer’s instructions and evaluation of alternative methods for estimating tinnitus impact and tinnitus loudness. Ethics and dissemination: This study protocol is approved by the Tallaght Hospital / St. James’s Hospital Joint Research Ethics Committee in Dublin, Republic of Ireland, and by the Ethics Committee of the University Clinic Regensburg, Germany. Findings will be disseminated to relevant research, clinical, health service and patient communities through publications in peer-reviewed and popular science journals and presentations at scientific and clinical conferences. Trial registration number; the trial is registered on ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 02669069). The sponsor is Neuromod Devices, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY • The main strength of this study is that it is a large two-site, triple-blinded, randomised trial that will provide exploratory evidence of the relevance of stimulation parameters on the clinical efficacy of different bi-modal stimulation parameters and will inform future trial design. • The study comprehensively characterises patients for subtyping and this will refine candidature for the intervention. • Among the limitations of this study are the variability in duration between screening and enrolment and the selection of the investigated stimulation parameters. • The online recruitment process may inadvertently introduce participant selection bias...|$|E
40|$|Hyperacusis is a {{frequent}} auditory disorder that is characterized by abnormal loudness perception where sounds of relatively normal volume are perceived as too loud or even painfully loud. As Hyperacusis patients show decreased <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> (LDLs) and steeper loudness growth functions, it has been hypothesized that hyperacusis might be caused {{by an increase in}} neuronal response gain in the auditory system. Moreover, since about 85 % of hyperacusis patients also experience tinnitus, the conditions might be caused by a common mechanism. However, the mechanisms that give rise to hyperacusis have remained unclear. Here we have used a computational model of the auditory system to investigate candidate mechanisms for hyperacusis. Assuming that perceived loudness is proportional to the summed activity of all auditory nerve fibers, the model was tuned to reproduce normal loudness perception. We then evaluated a variety of potential hyperacusis gain mechanisms by determining their effects on model equal-loudness contours and comparing the results to the LDLs of hyperacusis patients with normal hearing thresholds. Hyperacusis was best accounted for by an increase in nonlinear gain in the central auditory system. Good fits to the average patient LDLs were obtained for a general increase in gain that affected all frequency channels to the same degree, and also for a frequency-specific gain increase in the high-frequency range. Moreover, the gain needed to be applied after subtraction of spontaneous activity of the auditory nerve, which is in contrast to current theories of tinnitus generation based on amplification of spontaneous activity. Hyperacusis and tinnitus might therefore be caused by different changes in neuronal processing in the central auditory system...|$|R
40|$|Hyperacusis is a {{frequent}} auditory disorder where sounds of normal volume are perceived as too loud or even painfully loud. There is {{a high degree of}} co-morbidity between hyperacusis and tinnitus, most hyperacusis patients also have tinnitus, but only about 30 - 40 % of tinnitus patients also show symptoms of hyperacusis. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of hyperacusis, detailed measurements of <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> (LDLs) across the hearing range would be desirable. However, previous studies have only reported LDLs for a restricted frequency range, e. g. from 0. 5 to 4 kHz, or from 1 to 8 kHz. We have measured audiograms and LDLs in 381 patients with a primary complaint of hyperacusis for the full standard audiometric frequency range from 0. 125 to 8 kHz. On average, patients had mild high-frequency hearing loss, but {{more than a third of}} the tested ears had normal hearing thresholds, i. e. ≤ 20 dB HL. LDLs were found to be significantly decreased compared to a normal-hearing reference group, with average values around 85 dB HL across the frequency range. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that LDL measurements are neither sensitive nor specific enough to serve as a single test for hyperacusis. There was a moderate positive correlation between hearing thresholds and LDLs (r = 0. 36), i. e. LDLs tended to be higher at frequencies where hearing loss was present, suggesting that hyperacusis is unlikely to be caused by hearing threshold increase, in contrast to tinnitus for which hearing loss is a main trigger. Moreover, our finding that LDLs are decreased across the full range of audiometric frequencies, regardless of the pattern or degree of hearing loss, indicates that hyperacusis might be due to a generalized increase in auditory gain. Tinnitus on the other hand is thought to be caused by neuroplastic changes in a restricted frequency range, suggesting that tinnitus and hyperacusis might not share a common mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Hyperacusis {{is a type}} of {{decreased}} sound tolerance {{where the}} individual has decreased <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> (LDL), normal hearing thresholds and is sensitive to ordinary environmental sounds. Persons with hyperacusis frequently seek help at audiological departments as they are often affected by other audiological problems. Regrettably, there is neither a consensus-based diagnostic procedure nor an evidence-based treatment for hyperacusis. The principal aim of this thesis was to gain knowledge about the clinical condition hyperacusis. The specific aim of Paper I was to compare hyperacusis measurement tools {{in order to determine the}} most valid measures for assessing hyperacusis. Items from a constructed clinical interview were compared with the LDL test, the Hyperacusis Questionnaire (HQ) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). LDLs were significantly correlated with the anxiety subscale of the HADS. A third of the 62 investigated patients scored below the previously recommended cut-off for the HQ. The results suggest that HQ and HADS in combination with a clinical interview are useful as part of the assessment procedure in patients with hyperacusis. The aim of Paper II was to further investigate the patient group with respect to individual characteristics, psychiatric morbidity and personality traits. It was shown that anxiety disorders and anxiety-related personality traits were over-represented, which suggests common or cooperating mechanisms. Avoidance behaviour proved to be very common in the patient group, as was being unable to work due to hyperacusis. In Paper III it was investigated in a randomized controlled trial whether Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) could be helpful for patients with hyperacusis. The effect of CBT for hyperacusis was assessed with measures of LDLs, symptoms of hyperacusis and of anxiety and depression, fear of (re) injury due to exposure to sounds, and quality of life, compared to a waiting list control group. There were significant group effects for a majority of the measures with moderate and strong effect sizes within- and between groups. After assessment the waiting list group was also given CBT, and was then reassessed with similar effects. The results were maintained for 12 months, concluding CBT to be potentially helpful for these patients. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that persons with sensori-neural hearing losses have a narrower dynamic range than persons with normal hearing. This narrow dynamic range could {{be caused by}} elevated thresholds, {{or a combination of}} elevated thresholds and lowered <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> (LDL's). Which of these two possibilities actually takes place is still a question. It has been accepted by many audiologists that the narrow dynamic range is due to the combination of lowered LDL's and elevated thresholds (Fowler, 1963 and Eby and Williams, 1951). Recently some investigators have found results that conflict with the accepted reasons for the narrow dynamic range. They found similar LDL's in normal hearers and persons with sensori-neural losses. In these persons the narrow dynamic range appears to be due solely to the elevated thresholds. It is important to know the LDL's of individuals so that their residual hearing can be used to maximum. By simply knowing a person's threshold, {{it is not possible to}} predict how he will function auditorally when signals are presented above that threshold. A complete picture of auditory ability is needed to determine how a person might function auditorally. When selecting a hearing aid for a person* knowledge of the LDL is important. Hearing aids that can give all the amplification that one will ever need are available. How much amplification a person can use varies among individuals. In the adult or older child no problem exists in determining the maximum amount of amplification that can be used, These persons can tell when sounds are too loud. An infant or young child can not verbalize this. Therefore, if general rules about LDL's can be developed in different kinds of deafness, amplification can be planned for these persons. If it is found that LDL's for some sensori-neural ears are the same as or greater than normal hearers, such a finding requires explanation. It seems that some sensori-neural impairments are accompanied by "overrecruitment". In some of the previous studies where LDL's were found to be more like those of normal hearers recruitment appeared to be non-existent. Perhaps the time of onset of the loss has some bearing on the problem of overrecruitment. Perhaps, also, the site of the lesion and extent of damage determine this. Either of these assumptions could hold the answer as to why recruitment is or is not present. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between several measures of the acoustic reflex [acoustic reflex threshold (ART), dynamic range of the acoustic reflex growth function, the 50 % point along the acoustic reflex growth function, and the maximum intensity value of the acoustic reflex growth function] and behavioral measurements of <b>loudness</b> [loudness <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> (LDL) and the loudness contour (LC) ]. The underlying objective was to determine if any of these measures can be used to predict the LDL. A finding of a strong relationship between these measures could potentially assist in the creation of an objective method to measure LDLs, which may have implications for hearing aid fittings. Prior research in this area has yielded conflicting results. However, very few studies examined measures of loudness growth and the dynamic range of the acoustic reflex. Twenty young adults ranging from 22 - 35 years of age (Mean age = 25. 85, s. d. 3. 07) with normal hearing participated in this study. Participants were required to provide a subjective loudness rating to warbled-tone stimuli in accordance with a categorical loudness scaling procedure adapted from Cox et al. (1997), as well as an LDL rating. Additionally, an ART was obtained from each participant, as defined by a 0. 02 mmho change in admittance. Following identification of the ART, the acoustic reflex growth function was obtained by increasing the stimulus until the termination point. Experimental measures were obtained over two test sessions. Results revealed no significant relationship between measures of the acoustic reflex and loudness. Analysis of test-retest measures revealed moderate to very high positive (0. 70 - 0. 92) correlations for the acoustic reflex and LDL measures over a period of 1 day to 2 weeks. Test-retest performance on the majority of loudness categories on the LC did not reveal stable results. Implications for these findings are that the ART cannot be used to reliably predict the LDL. Additionally, the LC may not be a reliable clinical measurement to assess loudness...|$|R

In half of the study participants, venipunctures caused a moderate or high <b>level</b> of <b>discomfort</b> (49 %). Corresponding figures for nasopharyngeal swabbing and vaccinations were 28 % and 12 %, respectively. Within the reported age group, increasing age was related with higher <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels.</b> In a majority of cases for all study procedures, the perceived <b>levels</b> of <b>discomfort</b> met the parents' expectations. ...|$|R

50|$|Speech mapping (also {{known as}} output-based measures) {{involves}} testing with a speech or speech-like signal. The hearing aid is adjusted {{so that the}} speech is amplified to the approximate middle of the patient's residual auditory area (the amplitude range between the patient's hearing threshold and upper limit of comfort) while observing a real-time spectrum display of the speech in the patient's ear canal. Many multi-channel hearing aids allow each frequency channel to be adjusted separately. The aim {{is to find a}} good compromise between intelligibility and <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort.</b> This approach to hearing aid testing is implemented in most current real ear systems {{and there has been a}} significant increase in audiologists selecting to verify using the output method. Using a real speech signal to test a hearing aid has the advantage that features that may need to be disabled in other test approaches can be left active, and the effects of these features in normal use are included in the test.|$|R
40|$|The Desired Sensation Level (DSL) Method was {{revised to}} support hearing {{instrument}} fitting for infants, young children, and {{adults who use}} modern hearing instrument technologies, including multichannel compression, expansion, and multimemory capability. The aims of this revision are to maintain aspects of the previous versions of the DSL Method that have been supported by research, while extending the method to account for adult-child differ-ences in preference and listening requirements. The goals of this version (5. 0) include avoiding <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort,</b> selecting a frequency response that meets audibility require-ments, choosing compression characteristics that appropriately match technology to the user’s needs, and accommodating the overall prescription to meet individual needs for use in various listening environments. This review summarizes the status {{of research on the}} use of the DSL Method with pediatric and adult populations and presents a series of revisions that have been made during the generation of DSL v 5. 0.

40|$|The {{two major}} aspects of camera {{misalignment}} that cause visual discomfort when viewing images on a 3 D display are vertical and torsional disparities. While vertical disparities are uniform throughout the image, torsional rotations introduce {{a range of}} disparities that depend on the location in the image. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the discomfort ranges for the kinds of natural image that people are likely to take with 3 D cameras rather than the artificial line and dot stimuli typically used for laboratory studies. We therefore assessed visual discomfort on a five-point scale from ‘none’ to ‘severe’ for artificial misalignment disparities applied to a set of full-resolution images of indoor scenes. For viewing times of 2 s, discomfort ratings for vertical disparity in both 2 D and 3 D images rose rapidly toward the <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> of 4 (‘severe’) by about 60 arcmin of vertical disparity. Discomfort ratings for torsional disparity in the same image rose only gradually, reaching only the <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> of 3 (‘strong’) by about 50 deg of torsional disparity. These data were modeled with a second-order hyperbolic compression function incorporating a term for the basic discomfort of the 3 D display in the absence of any misalignments through a Minkowski norm. These fits showed that, at a criterion <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> of 2 (‘moderate’), acceptable levels of vertical disparity were about 15 arcmin. The corresponding values for the torsional disparity were about 30 deg of relative orientation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative discomfort evaluation method based on biomechanical analysis results for human body movement, {{as well as}} its application to an assessment of the discomfort for truck ingress and egress. In this study, the motions of a human subject entering and exiting truck cabins with different types, numbers, and heights of footsteps were first measured using an optical motion capture system and load sensors. Next, the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) ratios of the muscles were calculated through a biomechanical analysis of the musculoskeletal human model for the captured motion. Finally, the objective discomfort was evaluated using the proposed discomfort model based on the MVC ratios. To validate this new discomfort assessment method, human subject experiments were performed to investigate the subjective <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> through a questionnaire for comparison with the objective <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels.</b> The validation results showed that the correlation between the objective and subjective discomforts was significant and could be described by a linear regression model...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} manufacturing assembly in the automotive industry on the aetiology of Cumulative Trauma Disorders (CTDs). Two assembly lines for chassis assembly, (line A and line B) in one vehicle manufacturing plant, were studied. The main {{difference between the two}} lines was that the working height for line B was higher than line A by 270 mm. It was hypothesised that the workers on line A (N= 30) were more vulnerable to CTDs than the workers on line B (N= 38). The methodology included the use of a work-related sickness absence/ill health symptom reports database to quantify attendance at the company Occupational Health Centre. A questionnaire utilising body maps was distributed to all the employees in the two groups to investigate the <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> for various body regions. Sixty % of workers on line A and 50 % of workers on line B returned their completed questionnaires. The Quick Exposure Checklist (QEC) technique was used to analyse all job tasks on each line. Initial analysis of results showed that work related absence rate and attendance at Occupational Health Centre for group A was higher than group B. Self-reported <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> were found to be higher for the neck, shoulders, chest, elbows, hands, upper and lower back, knees, and ankles for group A. However, the <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> for the lower legs and hips for group A were lower than group B.

40|$|The present work {{analyzes}} and {{evaluates the}} global thermal comfort and local thermal <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> of an occupant {{subjected to a}} symmetric nonuniform airflow, originated in common use ventilators. Several incident airflow directions are studied and their effects are described. The global thermal comfort level is evaluated through a multi-nodal numerical model that simulates human and clothing thermal responses, while the local thermal <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> is analyzed using an empirical model that predicts draft risks. The computational model {{of the human body}} and clothing thermal systems is based on the energy balance integral equations for human body tissue, blood, and clothing, as well as mass balance integral equations for the blood and transpired water in skin surface and the clothing. The human body is divided into 35 elements, each one in several layers of tissue, which could be protected through some clothing layers. A thermoregulatory system model was adapted to control the human body tissue temperature. The experimental tests were carried out in a test chamber in controlled environmental conditions; a thermal manikin was used to simulate the human posture, an indoor climate analyzer was used to measure the environmental variables around the occupant, and two ventilators were used to produce an airflow field around the occupant. The frontal and ascendant airflows from the ventilators placed in front of the occupant are characterized and their velocities around the occupant are measured for several incident angles. The global thermal comfort conditions of the occupant are evaluated both with and without ventilation, and the local thermal <b>discomfort</b> <b>level</b> is evaluated with ventilation for slightly warm, moderate environments...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{artificial}} {{neural networks}} (ANNs) were developed and applied {{in order to}} forecast the <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> due to the combination of high temperature and air humidity, during the hot season of the year, in eight different regions within the Greater Athens area (GAA), Greece. For {{the selection of the}} best type and architecture of ANNs-forecasting models, the multiple criteria analysis (MCA) technique was applied. Three different types of ANNs were developed and tested with the MCA method. Concretely, the multilayer perceptron, the generalized feed forward networks (GFFN), and the time-lag recurrent networks were developed and tested. Results showed that the best ANNs type performance was achieved by using the GFFN model for the prediction of <b>discomfort</b> <b>levels</b> due to high temperature and air humidity within GAA. For the evaluation of the constructed ANNs, appropriate statistical indices were used.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the influence of choice of prescription and other child-, family- and intervention-related factors on speech, language, and functional performance of hearing-impaired children by three years of age. Design and study sample: A randomized controlled design was implemented as part of a population-based, longitudinal study on outcomes of children with hearing impairment (LOCHI) in Australia. Two hundred and eighteen children were randomly assigned to either the NAL or the DSL prescription for first fitting of hearing aids. Their performance outcomes were evaluated. Results: Prescriptive targets were closely matched in children's hearing aids. There {{were no significant differences in}} children's language, speech production, or functional performance between prescriptions. Parents’ ratings of children's device usage and <b>loudness</b> <b>discomfort</b> were not significantly different between prescription groups. Functional performance within the first year of fitting together with degree of hearing loss, presence of additional disabilities, and maternal education explained 44 % of variation in language ability of children by three years of age. Conclusions: There was no significant association between choice of hearing-aid prescription and variance in children's outcomes at three years of age. In contrast, additional disability, maternal educational level, and early functional performance were significant predictive factors of children's outcomes. 12 page(s...|$|R
