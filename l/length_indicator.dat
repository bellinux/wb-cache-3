40|$|OBJECTIVES. To {{determine}} appropriate {{indicators and}} age intervals for growth monitoring in this population, {{the relationship between}} monthly weight and <b>length</b> <b>indicators</b> and nutritional status at 12 months was evaluated among 102 low-income Peruvian infants. METHODS. Cutoffs for defining adequate vs slow growth were obtained from published reference data, and sensitivities and specificities of each indicator were calculated. RESULTS. Low weight gain in early infancy, especially from 1 to 2 months, is useful for predicting low weight at 1 year (sensitivity = 81 %, specificity = 65 %, 25 th percentile cutoff). Use of actual weight at 2 months, however, produces comparable results (sensitivity = 86 %, specificity = 57 %, 50 th percentile cutoff). Monthly length gains were weak predictors of low length for age. Neither weight nor length gains accurately predicted the opposite form of undernutrition. Nonhuman milk consumption before 4 months and poor appetite from 3 to 12 months were related to low early weight gain and subsequent undernutrition. CONCLUSIONS. Growth monitoring programs in this population should enroll infants at birth, monitor actual weight, promote exclusive breast-feeding and delayed introduction of nonhuman milk, and provide specific feeding advice to mothers of infants with frequently depressed appetite...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a priori}} {{knowledge}} of maximum channel impulse response (CIR) length, time domain OFDM channel estimation systems outperforms frequency domain channel estimation. Because CIR length is an unknown quantity at the receiver side, a suitable estimation method is necessary. In this paper 1, we propose a novel algorithm named FCLI-Frequency Domain Channel <b>Length</b> <b>Indicator,</b> which estimates CIR length {{in order to}} minimize MSE. The FCLI algorithm works in OFDM systems with null-subcarriers, like the spectrum mask defined in IEEE 802. 11 a/g and does not require to average indicators over more than one OFDM symbol. Furthermore, FCLI is designed to work in both SISO and MIMO-OFDM. The simulation results show that channel estimation performance by the FCLI algorithm can approach or outperform the performance with perfect knowledge of channel length in low or high SNR. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of the widely applied timedomain channel estimation for SISO- and MIMO-OFDM systems strongly depends on the preciseness of information regarding maximum channel impulse response (CIR) length. In practice the required CIR length is usually approximated by {{the length of the}} cyclic prefix which is an upper bound for most of the actual instantaneous CIR length. In this article 1, we introduce an appropriate channel length estimation method- named as FCLI (Frequency Domain Channel <b>Length</b> <b>Indicator)</b> which estimates the CIR length minimizing the estimated mean square error of an instantaneous channel estimate. The simulation results present that the FCLI outperforms the approximation of cyclic prefix length. In addition, we investigate two applications of FCLI on 1) cyclic prefix adaptation OFDM systems in which we minimize the overhead of the cyclic prefix by the estimated CIR length and 2) cyclic prefix free OFDM systems in which we directly re-construct the structure of cyclic repetition with reduced error. Compared to the traditional channel estimation with the approximation of cyclic prefix length, the overall system throughput of either cyclic prefix adaptation or cyclic prefix free OFDM transmission scheme is significantly enhanced regardless of perfect synchronization or practical distribution of time offsets.

40|$|The size {{structure}} of fish-communities is an emergent high-level property of marine food webs responsive {{to changes in}} structure and function. To measure this food web property using data arising from routine fisheries surveys, a simple metric known as Typical Length has been proposed as more suitable than the Large Fish Indicator, which has been highly engineered to be responsive to fishing pressure. Typical Length avoids the inherent dependence of the Large Fish Indicator on a parameter that requires case-by-case adjustments. Using IBTS survey time series for five spatial subdivisions of the Greater North Sea, we show that the Typical Length can provide information equivalent to the Large Fish Indicator when fishing is likely the strongest driver, but differences can also arise. In this example, Typical Length exhibits smaller random fluctuations ("noise") than the Large Fish Indicator. Typical Length is also more adaptable than the Large Fish Indicator and can be easily applied to monitor pelagic fish in addition to demersal fish, and together with information on the potential growth of the fish community, a proxy {{of which can be}} derived from the Mean Maximum <b>Length</b> <b>indicator,</b> it is possible to partition change in community composition from change in size structure.

40|$|To derive location-specific {{parameters}} {{that reflect}} the geographic differences among cultivars in vernalization requirements, sensitivity to day length (photoperiod) and temperature, {{which can be used}} to simulate the phenological development of wheat and maize at the global scale. Location: Global. Methods: Based on crop calendar observations and literature describing the large-scale patterns of phenological characteristics of cultivars, we developed algorithms to compute location-specific parameters to represent this large-scale pattern. Vernalization requirements were related to the duration and coldness of winter, sensitivity to day length was assumed to be represented by the minimum and maximum day lengths occurring at a location, and sensitivity to temperature was related to temperature conditions during the vegetative development phase of the crop. Results: Application of the derived location-specific parameters resulted in high agreement between simulated and observed lengths of the cropping period. Agreement was especially high for wheat, with mean absolute errors of less than 3 weeks. In the main maize cropping regions, cropping periods were over- and underestimated by 0. 5 - 1. 5 months. We also found that interannual variability in simulated wheat harvest dates was more realistic when accounting for photoperiod effects. Main conclusions: The methodology presented here provides a good basis for modelling the phenological characteristics of cultivars at the global scale. We show that current global patterns of growing season length as described in cropping calendars can be largely reproduced by phenology models if location-specific parameters are derived from temperature and day <b>length</b> <b>indicators.</b> Growing seasons can be modelled more accurately for wheat than for maize, especially in warm regions. Our method for computing parameters for phenology models from temperature and day length offers opportunities to improve the simulation of crop productivity by crop simulation models developed for large spatial areas and for long-term climate impact projections that account for adaptation in the selection of varieties...|$|R

30|$|For CL estimation, {{a number}} of {{techniques}} {{can be found in}} the literatures. For example, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) [19] employs numerous data samples to represent the statistical characteristic of the channel/noise for CL estimation. However, AIC encounters over-estimate when signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is high. The frequency-domain channel <b>length</b> <b>indicator</b> (FCLI) scheme [20] requires only one snapshot channel estimate while a prior information of noise power is assumed to be known, but FCLI becomes impractical as CFO exists. The conditional model order estimation (CME) [21] is proposed for MIMO communication channels. However, CME assumes that the CIR remains unchanged during a data frame and the processing of the block of available observations is performed offline. In [22], a joint estimate approach for channel and instantaneous CL is proposed. Unfortunately, it fails to work properly in the presence of CFO. Based on information criterion, a joint channel and CL estimation is proposed for single-input single-output (SISO) OFDM systems in [23] where the Levinson recursion technique is employed without significant incremental cost. Another CL estimate technique found in [24] is introduced based on the minimization of a combination of cost functions for single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channels where the channel is also assumed to be unchanged during a symbol frame. To the best of the authors’ knowledge so far, no work has been devoted to the development of a joint channel and CFO estimation where the information of CL is not available for MIMO-OFDM systems. In light of these works, it is essential to develop an approach to estimate CL especially for MIMO-OFDM systems as CFO exists.|$|E
