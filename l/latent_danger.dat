Its object is to contribute to the historical coming to terms with and the comparative analysis of dictatorships of fascist, national socialist and communist provenance as well as authoritarian regimes; it is to elucidate their mechanisms of rule and their driving forces. Moreover, it is dedicated to reveal the significance of opposition and resistance against authoritarian and totalitarian suppression and it keeps alive the memory of the victims of dictatorial violence. Besides, it is concerned with the problems of “coping” with the past and questions of transition from dictatorship to democracy as well as the stability conditions of liberal democracies.Accordingly, it is the task of the Stiftung Ettersberg to prospectively pursue historical research which does not only perform work of memory but goes beyond this by making successive generations sensitive for the <b>latent</b> <b>danger</b> to freedom and democracy. The Stiftung Ettersberg attempts to foster the international and interdisciplinary dialogue between political scholars, historians, and researchers in the field of social and cultural studies in Europe. It endeavours to disseminate national experiences internationally and thereby to make a contribution to the stabilisation of liberal democracy throughout Europe. It also aims at being a platform of international encounters, reflection, remembrance, encouragement and last but not least of a critical analysis of contemporary developments.|$|E

40|$|Undoubtedly, one of {{the most}} {{manifest}} indices of new age globalisation has been the transboundary movement of toxic and hazardous waste products, principally from developed countries to the developing countries otherwise known as the ‘Third World’. While waste generation is essentially a domestic problem, the issue has assumed global importance as industrialised countries continually seek convenient disposal sites outside their own shores. Despite increasing global, regional, and national legal and policy interventions to curb the menace of toxic and hazardous waste dumping, however, the problem has largely not abated. Against the backdrop of the enormous negative consequences of the transboundary movement of toxic and hazardous waste products in developing countries, and the impunity engendered by this ubiquitous practice, is it not high time that new strategies were evolved for tackling this menace? With the global proliferation of information technology continuing to escalate at an exponential rate, driven largely by the lure of exploiting the globalised info-tech market, this essay accentuates the <b>latent</b> <b>dangers</b> looming in developing countries particularly with regard to electronic wastes. Reflecting on the litany of treaties already adopted in responding to the problem of toxic and hazardous wastes, this essay attempts to highlight alternative policy and strategic initiatives against current trends...|$|R
40|$|Shakespearean charisma, {{with its}} medieval roots in both {{religion}} and politics, {{served as a}} precursor to Max Weber&# 8217;s later understanding of the term. The on-stage portrayal of charismatic kingship in the twilight of the Tudor dynasty was not coincidental; facing the imminent death of a queen, the English nation {{was concerned about the}} future of the monarchy. Through the depiction of the production and deterioration of royal charisma, Shakespeare presents the anxiety of a population aware of the <b>latent</b> <b>dangers</b> of charismatic authority; while Elizabeth managed to perpetuate an unprecedented degree of long-term charismatic rule, there could be no certainty that her successor would be similarly capable. Shakespeare&# 8217;s second tetralogy &# 8212; known as the Henriad &# 8212; examines this royal charisma as it appears both under crisis and in the process of what Weber would later characterize as routinization. While Henry IV (Bolingbroke) originally makes use of charisma to ensure his succession to Richard II&# 8217;s throne, he loses his charismatic authority in the process.

40|$|Theater, historically, {{has served}} as a site for intense debates about ontology, {{specifically}} as concerns distinctions between what is real, in Plato's sense, and what is "merely" mimetic. Similar ontological debates have attended the development of new media technologies, which are often figured as enabling shady activities like impersonation, simulation, and piracy (on the internet, after all, no one knows you're a dog, and Photoshopped images of Iranian missile tests circulate globally nearly instantly), and arousing related questions about authenticity, identity and ownership. My dissertation brings debates about realness and mimesis to three sites of twenty-first century performance: intermedial theater, specifically the Wooster Group's 2007 Hamlet and the mediatized Burton/Gielgud Hamlet it deconstructs; reality television, specifically MTV's "scripted reality" show The Hills; and alternate reality gaming, in particular the 2007 future forecasting game World Without Oil. In each of these sites I examine the ways mediatization and theatricality work, sometimes in concert and sometimes in conflict, to complicate and perform realness. Questions of realness, authenticity and honesty have long haunted Western theater traditions, and so I use the lens of Western theatrical acting to address related questions in new media performance contexts. While only one of the dissertation's sites of analysis positions itself explicitly as theater, each is a theatrical situation that places its players in a subjunctive stance [...] one that depends on their acting "as if" circumstances were other than they are [...] and so evokes the concerns and "ontological queasiness" (Barish) that accompanies the mimetic activity of Western theater. In bringing together these disparate sites of mixed realities, I make a case for the opportunities this mixing and subjunctivity enable: mischievous interventions into supposedly stable differences between the real and its various others (the artificial, the fake, the feigned, the staged or rehearsed). An uncertain real is often described in terms of loss and threat, of radical instability that poses either overt or <b>latent</b> <b>dangers.</b> My argument, however, prioritizes the ways in which refiguring relationships to realness might be occasion opportunity, especially the opportunity for exploration, excitement, even productive mischief...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} {{tuberculosis}} {{has been an}} accepted objective in public health practice for many years. If present-day knowledge of the disease could be utilized to its fullest, the rate of decline would be accelerated appreciably. Present-day facilities are of little value unless the public will readily and willingly cooperate with the public health agency in utilizing this knowledge. Since Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus and set up his famous postulates in 1882, the basic facts have been available, {{and they have not}} changed to this day although the methods of application have been improved. With the organization of the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1905, increasing emphasis has been placed on health education. Undoubtedly, much has been accomplished, but it is clearly obvious that the public generally do not yet fully appreciate the seriousness of the disease. When it strikes a member of a family, interest is aroused but even then the members too frequently fail to heed the <b>latent</b> <b>dangers</b> that threaten them. Biggs made a memorable statement when he said that "Public Health is purchasable. " He, too, was a strong advocate of the importance of health education for the masses. Making a purchase of any commodity requires a buyer and a seller. If the commodity is attractive and in demand, the buyer is eager to purchase even at an advanced cost. Certainly there is no commodity available to mankind with more intrinsic value and every-day satisfaction than sound health. Yet we have but to look to our next door neighbor to see evidence of the ignorance of good health habits, or the careless refusal to consider them until it is too late. Thus a basic concept in the further eradication of tuberculosis must depend upon an enlightened public consciousness of its mode of spread and of the methods of prevention. Tuberculosis is a chronic communicable disease, spread from person to person. Generally speaking, the greater the exposur...|$|R

40|$|During the 'cold war' the two power blocs of {{the world}} held a colossal {{potential}} of weapons and technology in Europe, particularly at the German border and the hinterland. Up to {{the disintegration of the}} eastern military alliance, the West Group of the Soviet Armies, together with the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and its paramilitary unities, represented a high fighting strength and battle readiness on a military area of about 5000 Km" 2. Together with the properties of the western Allies (U. S. Forces, the British and the French Army, and others) and the Federal Armed Forces in the former Federal Republic of Germany, the total military area was approx. 10. 000 Km" 2 (=approximately 4 -times the surface of the federal state of Saarland). With the year 1990 the fears have been confirmed that particularly the military or former military sites held considerable dangers for the human health. Besides pollution from former production sites, other causes within the last decades were improper handling of toxic and water endangering substances. The gradual discount of the western group of the Soviet army was realized in close cooperation with the Federal Environmental Agency. Once this phase was finished, the Governments of the Laender, the Federal authorities for environment and health, the Federal Army, and the Federal Committee for Immediate Help (FKST) on Drinking Water (FKST), more than 40 sites of drinking water extraction were assessed as being acutely at risk. Since then, the interest has driven from such openly manifesting dangers to those being still unrecognised but of at least the same risk potential, called <b>latent</b> <b>dangers.</b> The significance of these military 'hangovers' is due to long-term effect chains on the soil/ground -water/drinking water path. Experts assessed, that the surface of the former GDR could comprise at least 100 out of 10. 000 objects (combined properties of WGT, NVA, bordering troops, department for security of the state and others) with potentially serious consequences for human health.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to adapt ceramics to conventional metals, e. g. steel, in order to guarantee an extended application as an engineering material in machines and technical equipment. The different expansion coefficients {{in connection with the}} small temperature shock resistence lead to problems in metal-ceramics compounds.

The aim of our investigations was the development of graduated SiC-TiC ceramics where a gradual transition from SiC to TiC is realized. This material shall be used as a metal-ceramics compound. An interesting prospective results from the thermal expansion coefficient of TiC which is more similar to steel than to SiC. Therefore the thermal tension can be almost compensated, and a compound with a unimportent loss of strength not worth mentioning can be produced. It is also expected that a TiC-metal compound is easier to realize. As a result of the i nvestigations the microstructure in the transition zone has been evaluated of a pressureless sintered SiC-TiC ceramics with increasing TiC-content (up to 100 percent).

Mr. Sargent is sometimes accused of a want of [...] "finish," [...] but if finish means the last word of expressiveness of touch, [...] "The Hall with the Four Children," [...] as we may call it, may-stand as a permanent reference on this point. If {{the picture of the}} Spanish dancer illustrates, as it seems to me to do, the <b>latent</b> <b>dangers</b> of the Impressionist practice, so this finer performance shows what victories it may achieve. And in relation to the latter I must repeat what I said about the young lady with the flower, that {{this is the sort of}} work which, when produced in youth, leads the attentive spectator to ask unanswerable questions. He finds himself murmuring, [...] "Yes, but what is left?" [...] and even wondering whether it be an advantage to an artist to obtain early in life such possession of his means that the struggle with them, discipline, tâtonnement, cease to exist for him. May not this breed an irresponsibility of cleverness, a wantonness, an irreverence--what is vulgarly termed a [...] "larkiness"--on the part of the youthful genius who has, as it were, all his fortune in his pocket? Such are the possibly superfluous broodings of those who are critical even in their warmest admirations and who sometimes suspect that it may be better for an artist to have a certain part of his property invested in unsolved difficulties. When this is not the case, the question with regard to his future simplifies itself somewhat portentously. [...] "What will he do with it?" [...] we ask, meaning by the pronoun the sharp, completely forged weapon. It becomes more purely a question of responsibility, and we hold him altogether to a higher account. This is the case with Mr. Sargent; he knows so much about the art of painting that he perhaps does not fear emergencies quite enough, and that having knowledge to spare he may be tempted to play with it and waste it. Various, curious, as we have called him, he occasionally tries experiments which seem to arise from the mere high spirits of his brush, and runs risks little courted by the votaries of the literal, who never expose their necks to escape from the common. For the literal and the common he has the smallest taste; when he renders an object into the language of painting his translation is a generous paraphrase.|$|R

40|$|Hazardous and noxious {{substances}} (HNS) {{are widely}} transported in marine vessels to reach {{every part of}} the world. Bulk transportation of hazardous chemicals is carried out in tank container–carrying cargo ships or in designed vessels. Ensuring the safety of HNS containers during maritime transportation is critically important as the accidental release of any substance may be lethal to the on-board crew and marine environment. A general assumption in maritime accidents in open ocean is that it will not create any danger to the coastal population. The case study discussed in this article throws light on the <b>dangers</b> <b>latent</b> in maritime HNS accidents. An accident involving an HNS-carrying marine vessel in the Arabian Sea near the coast of Yemen became a safety issue to the coastal people of Kasargod District of Kerala, India. The ship carried more than 4000 containers, which were lost to the sea in the accident. Six HNS tank containers were carried by the waves and shored at the populated coast of Kasargod, more than 650 nautical miles east from the accident spot. The unanticipated sighting of tank containers in the coast and the response of the administration to the incident, the hurdles faced by the district administration in handling the case, the need for engaging national agencies and lessons learned from the incident are discussed in the article. This case study has proven that accidents in the open ocean have the potential to put the coastal areas at risk if the on-board cargo contains hazardous chemicals.

The latter two, namely the use of plants and microbes, are preferred because of their cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness and fewer side effects. Also the obvious disadvantages of other alternatives are listed. In the future the application of genetic engineering or cell engineering to create an expected and ideal species would become popular and necessary. However, a concomitant and <b>latent</b> <b>danger</b> of genetic pollution is realized by a few persons. To cope with this potential harm, several suggestions are put forward including choosing self-pollinated plants, creating infertile polyploid species and carefully selecting easy-controlled microbe species. Bravely, the authors point out that current investigation of noncrop hyperaccumulators is of little significance in application. Pragmatic development in the future should be crop hyperaccumulators (newly termed as "cropaccumulators") by transgenic or symbiotic approach. Considering no effective plan has been put forward by others about concrete steps of applying a hyperaccumulator to practice, the authors bring forward a set of universal procedures, which is novel, tentative and adaptive to evaluate hyperaccumulators' feasibility before large-scale commercialization.

40|$|There lies a <b>latent</b> <b>danger</b> in {{utilizing}} some known mathematical {{results in}} ecology. Some results {{do not apply}} to the problem at hand. We identify one such trend. Based on a couple of theorems in mathematical statistics, Link (2013) cautions ecologists about the inappropriateness of using the discrete uniform prior in their analysis under certain conditions and instead recommends the routine use of the scale prior during analysis. This recommendation is been absorbed immediately and widely among ecologists. In this study, we consider the two fundamental capture-recapture models used widely in ecology, $M_ 0 $ and $M_h$, and derive conditions for posterior propriety by examining the behavior of the right tail of the posterior distributions of animal population size $N$ in a Bayesian analysis. We demonstrate that both these likelihoods are far more efficient than the ones considered in Link (2013). We argue that no particularly prescriptive approach should be adopted by ecologists in regard to choosing priors of the fear of posterior impropriety. Instead, we recommend the efficient construction of likelihoods for the problem and data on hand, choosing priors based existing knowledge of a parameter of interest and encourage examining posterior propriety by asymptotic arguments as demonstrated in this study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{understand}} parental approach to the topic of smoking with school-age preadolescent children. In-depth interviews were conducted with 38 parents and yielded a grounded theory that explains how parents communicated with their children about smoking. Parents perceived smoking to be a <b>latent</b> <b>danger</b> for their children. To deter smoking from occurring they verbally interacted with their children on the topic and took action by having a no-smoking rule. There were three interaction approaches, which differed by style and method of interaction. Most parents interacted by discussing smoking with their children. They intentionally took advantage of opportunities. Some interacted by telling their children about the health effects of smoking and their opposition to it. They responded on the spur-of-the-moment if their attention was drawn to the issue by external cues. A few interacted by acknowledging to their children the negative effects of smoking. They responded only when their children brought it up. The parents’ intent for the no-smoking rule, which pertained mainly to their homes and vehicles, was to protect their children from second-hand smoke and limit exposure to smoking. The theory can be used by nurses to guide interventions with parents about youth smoking prevention...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} how {{the standpoint of}} the gaijin (foreigner) shapes and challenges the act of philosophizing, through the experience of overwhelming cultural difference. I examine three challenges the foreigner faces—the need to understand a foreign culture, the need to contribute to a foreign culture, and the need for caution and self-awareness vis-à-vis the excesses and dangers of this attempt. First, through a reading of Thomas Kasulis’ Intimacy or Integrity: Philosophy and Cultural Difference (2002), I take the reader through the experience of trying to understand a foreign culture by examining the kind of relationships that are prioritized in a particular culture. Kasulis discusses intimacy-oriented cultures as those that stress internal relationships between interdependent individuals, and integrity-oriented cultures as those that stress external relationships between autonomous individuals. He then shows how this affects the way this influences the worldview and norms of a particular culture. Next, through a reading of various writings of Watsuji Tetsurô on culture and ethics, I explore the attempt to go beyond cultural difference—seeking a universal standpoint from which one can contribute to or criticize another culture despite cultural difference. I discuss the relationship Watsuji presents between universal ethics and national morality in his “Theory of National Morals” (1932), and connect it with his project in Ethics (1937, 1942 / 46, 1949) that tries to resolve the contradiction between individuality (integrity) and totality (intimacy) through a “dual-negative structure. ” Finally, through an examination of Sakai Naoki’s Translation and Subjectivity: On “Japan” and Cultural Nationalism (1997), I explore the <b>dangers</b> <b>latent</b> in Kasulis’ and Watsuji’s approach. I delve into the danger of schematizing “us vs. them” or “gaijin vs. nihonjin,” which can be present in the attempt to understand cultures. Then I examine Sakai’s warning as to the danger of trying to have a universal standpoint and its tendency to deny the embeddedness of one’s position. Through a dialogue with these three thinkers, I thus attempt to explore in a relatable but nuanced way, what it might mean for the foreigner to confront cultural difference in a manner that both respects cultural difference but transcends it...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate the common injuries of leisure diving and to analyze the <b>latent</b> risks and <b>dangers</b> in the surrounding area of Kenting ocean. We hope that this study {{can be used as a}} reference by correlated units and people in this profession. The subjects were 50 diving coaches who worked in Kenting, Pingtung. These divers were chosen randomly. 86 % of these divers were male. The average age of the coaches was 37. 7 ± 8. 8 yrs. The average diving experience of the coaches was 14. 4 ± 6. 8 yrs. The average teaching experience of the coaches was 12. 7 ± 6. 5 yrs. The average number of scuba tanks used per year was 209. 1 ± 63. 7. These coaches mostly have 2 or 3 different professional diving licenses. 47 coaches have PADI certificates, 31 of them have SSI certificates, 24 have ADS certificates and 16 have NAUI certificates. The five most common injuries or accidents were contusions, animal stings, loss of equilibrium, injuries due to current flow or entanglement and suffocation. The most common response when the coaches were injured was to go to hospital immediately. But in some circumstances they chose to ignore it. Their decision was probably influenced by the severity of the injury. According to the study results and the experience of the coaches, most of the stings were inflicted by Jellyfishes or Hydroids. We recommend applying urine or ammonia on the injured area as preliminary treatment. Decompression sickness rarely occurs in recreational scuba diving. Most of them happen during rescues or rapid ascension due to emergency. The diver should take necessary precautions after rapid ascension since symptoms often do not begin to appear for at least an hour and the diver should go to the hospital as soon as possible. [[abstract]]本研究目的主要在調查墾丁海域休閒潛水教練本身較常發生的傷害或意外及分析潛水周遭環境可能的潛在危機，希望結果能相關單位或從業人員做參考。本研究採用隨機抽樣法，調查工作地點在屏東縣墾丁地區之潛水店家之 50 位教練作潛水常見的傷害及意外。研究結果顯示從事潛水教練的以男性居多，佔了 86 %；而教練群的平均年齡為 37. 7 ± 8. 8 歲；居住地則以屏東縣居多。教練平均潛水經驗為 14. 4 ± 6. 8 年；平均工作經驗為 12. 7 ± 6. 5 年；平均每年潛水氣瓶數為 209. 1 ± 63. 7 瓶，且其持有證照張數大約分佈在 3 張與 2 張居多， 50 位教練中擁有PADI的有 47 位，SSI有 30 位，ADS有 24 位，NAUI有 16 位。教練群較常遇到的前五大傷害為外傷與生物螫傷、耳壓、海上漂流、糾纏(例如漁網、海藻) 及嗆水。傷害發生時的處置部分，大部分的教練受傷時，都幾乎採用馬上就醫的處置，但有些是視當時的狀況而定，但也有別的教練對於自己的傷勢完全不予理會。歸納調查結果及教練經驗可得墾丁海域生物螫傷部分最常發生於水母、水螅，建議可用胺水或乾淨尿液做初步治療。另外休閒潛水中減壓症的發生並不常見，多半是發生在教練因為要救人或是有緊急事故需急速上升；而假設有類似狀況，需小心事發後 1 ~ 2 小時的發病時間，以儘速送醫為原則...|$|R
40|$|In {{view of the}} modern, disenchanted {{world this}} work {{emphasized}} the particular dimension of anxiety – anxiety as a permanently disturbing oppressive sensation, caused by crises. According {{to the previous studies}} on the gothic novels in the context of literary anxiety the fear of the reader is a literary repeat of the anxieties or fears that have already been overcome historically, and it is justified by the reader’s identification with the literary figures. Contrary to this opinion reveals my work the thesis that the fear of the reader is evoked by the existential crises of modernity. The analysis of Hoffmann's novels shows in detail which modern crises have stimulated the reader’s anxiety. With the disruption and the destruction of the conventional metaphysical world system, and as the traditional elements which used to give a sense of security losing their validness, the modern man has come in the situation of transcendent homelessness and the general ontological disorientation: he finds himself exposed to contingency without any metaphysical supports. Hoffmann's detective novels depict the failure of the rational method of investigation in the discovery of the truth of the criminality by coincidences. This makes the inadequacy of the ratio visible. Logical deduction constructs only a false truth, which almost leads to a judicial murder. Instead of guaranteeing public security, the police and the court present themselves as a <b>latent</b> cause of <b>danger.</b> The Enlightenment raised the ideas of self-determination and the freedom of the will to fundamental values of the modern subject. Due to this mentality background, the heteronomy that the will is subject to outside influences in Hoffmann’s novels evokes the feeling of discomfort in their readers and stimulates an anxiety because the subject is compelled to recognize his dependency and his powerlessness. Thus the narcissistic self-assessment of the modern subject is violated. A more pressing irritation arises {{from the fact that the}} ego is in secret agreement with the hostile power and undermines its autonomy and sovereignty through its own actions. Moreover, with masochistic pleasure, it enjoys its endangerment through the foreign violence and his suffering under the hostile power. Since the late Enlightenment, the psychiatry discovered the demoniac side in the human psyche, which had a great influence on the romantic writers such as Hoffmann and Tieck. In their novels, the destructive power which exists in the human is demoniacally directed toward the subject itself. The incomprehensible desire for the regressive union of the ego with the inorganic world drives the subject into the death. It is not the influence of an objective hostile force but the incomprehensible desire of the subject as well as the irrational confusion of the soul, which leads to the miserable end. Because of the dark side of the psyche and the destructive power the ego proves itself to be the most dangerous enemy. Hoffmann's novels which were judged in their contemporary reception as products of a diseased imagination document the crises of the modernism. In a literary and intellectual way, by representing the crisis in the modern time they evoke by their readers an anxiety...|$|R
