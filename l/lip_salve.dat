25|$|The trumpet is a {{notoriously}} hard instrument on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage {{over much of}} his life due to his aggressive style of playing and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place easier, but which tended to dig into the soft flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade. By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme <b>Lip</b> <b>Salve.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Earning plaudits for his {{determination}} and leadership, Atherton {{followed up with}} two centuries {{in the first two}} Tests at home against New Zealand. His reputation suffered a blow when he was implicated in a ball-tampering controversy during the first Test against South Africa at Lord's, for which he was fined £2,000 by Ray Illingworth. Atherton was accused of lying to Peter Burge, the Match Referee. [...] Atherton claims in his autobiography that he answered 'no' when asked if he had anything in his pockets. He believed that Burge was referring to nefarious substances such as resin or <b>lip</b> <b>salve.</b> Nonetheless, the TV pictures were damning, showing Atherton deliberately putting dirt, taken from the pitch, on the ball. Strictly speaking, Atherton was not breaking the laws [...] – he pointed out that plenty of bowlers improve their grip on the ball by rubbing their hands on the pitch.|$|E
50|$|Aqueous Cream BP is a light, hydrocarbon-based emulsion, {{which is}} officially {{registered}} in the British Pharmacopoeia and categorised by the British National Formulary as a non-proprietary emollient preparation. It {{is used as a}} topical, external medicine, emollient moisturiser and general-purpose substitute for toiletries such as soap, shower gel, shaving cream and <b>lip</b> <b>salve.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1895, Dr. George F. Smith founded Rosebud Perfume Company in Woodsboro. Smith {{had eight}} children, {{and served as}} mayor of the town for 19 years. The {{business}} has remained in the family, and as of 2012, was still producing its famous [...] "Smith's Rosebud Salve," [...] a <b>lip</b> gloss and <b>salve</b> originally known as tholene. The products are shipped from company headquarters in Woodsboro; however, [...] "the salve is manufactured and filled at Case Mason in Joppa, Md., and the tins are made in Baltimore." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{children}} have a habit of sucking and chewing on the lower lip, producing a combination of cheilitis and sharply demarcated perioral erythema (redness). [...] Treatment is usually successful with barrier lubricants, such as <b>lip</b> <b>salve</b> or Vaseline. Medical grade (USP) lanolin accelerates repair of the lips, and is used in some lip repair products.|$|E
50|$|Lip balm or <b>lip</b> <b>salve</b> is a wax-like {{substance}} applied topically to {{the lips}} of the mouth to moisturize and relieve chapped or dry lips, angular cheilitis, stomatitis, or cold sores. Lip balm often contains beeswax or carnauba wax, camphor, cetyl alcohol, lanolin, paraffin, and petrolatum, among other ingredients. Some varieties contain dyes, flavor, fragrance, phenol, salicylic acid, and sunscreens.|$|E

60|$|On the Thursday evening, Belle shut {{herself up}} with her maid, and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady. They crimped and curled her hair, they {{polished}} her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched her <b>lips</b> with coralline <b>salve</b> to make them redder, and Hortense would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed {{at herself in the}} mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.|$|R
5000|$|While she {{was living}} at Alfreton Hall Clara kept a recipe book during the 1830s which was {{recently}} acquired by the Derbyshire Records Office. It contains recipes with medicinal and veterinary cures as well as beauty treatments. According to the Records Office {{it is a great}} example of the books of this time with recipes for fashionable foreign dishes such as ‘fromage fondue’, petit choux and ‘Spanish fritters’, but also ‘a cure for dogs who are troubled with the snort’, <b>lip</b> <b>salve</b> and a recipe to wash chintz amongst other delights. Some of the pages from the book are on their website and can be viewed here ...|$|E

5000|$|The casting of Gillian Anderson as the obsessive jilted bride Miss Havisham drew {{attention}} to the production due to her being a mere 43 compared to other actresses who have played her. The move was generally accepted with The Independent saying [...] "Phelps's biggest liberty, making Miss Havisham young and beautiful... didn't greatly worry me, because Gillian Anderson nicely captured the continuing hysteria of her obsession." [...] The Guardian said that [...] "some people have been moaning that Gillian Anderson isn't old enough to be Miss Havisham, that she's a cougar rather than a crone, too ravishing for Havisham. She's not that ravishing, though. They've done {{a pretty good job of}} ageing and witchifying her. And, more importantly, she feels like Miss Havisham". The Daily Telegraph also praised her saying [...] "this pale yet still beautiful wraith, mouth in need of <b>lip</b> <b>salve</b> and Baby Jane ringlets slowly unravelling, speaking in insidious singsong instead of the usual dotty dowager tones. This was a Miss Havisham who has never really grown up." [...] The Telegraph also pointed out that Anderson is only a little younger than the generally considered definitive version of Miss Havisham as played by Martita Hunt in the David Lean version, a point that Anderson herself made on The Graham Norton Show.|$|E
