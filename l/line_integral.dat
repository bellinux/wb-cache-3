40|$|Tomography {{is widely}} used in {{geophysics}} as a technique for imaging geological structures by means of data that are <b>line</b> <b>integrals</b> of physical characteristics. In some transmission measurements, due to various kinds of normalization, the measured data are related to two (the current and the reference) raypaths and can be expressed {{as a function of}} differences between <b>line</b> <b>integrals.</b> This is the case, for example, in seismo-acoustic emission measurements, when (since the exact start time is unknown) only the differences between traveltimes (differences between <b>line</b> <b>integrals</b> of the slowness) can be determined. Similarly the use of normalized Fourier amplitudes results in data dependent upon the difference between <b>line</b> <b>integrals</b> of the absorption coefficient (computed along the actual and the reference raypaths). In order to invert these data the ordinary tomography algorithms should be modified. Some generalizations are presented for series expansion tomography methods in order to make them applicable to reconstruction problems in which the input data are differences between two <b>line</b> <b>integrals.</b> The conjugate gradient and the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) methods were adapted and tested. It is shown that the modified tomography algorithms are stable and sufficiently accurate for practical use. In the reconstruction of noise-free difference data, the conjugate gradient algorithm is found to be faster and more accurate while, in the case of noisy difference data, the modified SIRT algorithm is more stable and insensitive to noise...|$|R

25|$|Scientific {{visualization}} using {{computer graphics}} gained in popularity as graphics matured. Primary applications were scalar fields and vector fields from computer simulations and also measured data. The primary methods for visualizing two-dimensional (2D) scalar fields are color mapping and drawing contour lines. 2D vector fields are visualized using glyphs and streamlines or <b>line</b> <b>integral</b> convolution methods. 2D tensor fields are often resolved to a vector field by {{using one of}} the two eigenvectors to represent the tensor each point in the field and then visualized using vector field visualization methods.|$|E
25|$|It is {{desirable}} to choose basis functions which reflect the essential feature of incompressible flow – the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, {{the existence of}} the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz Theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow {{in the absence of a}} pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the <b>line</b> <b>integral</b> of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by Stokes' Theorem.

25|$|The {{direction}} of the curl is the axis of rotation, {{as determined by the}} right-hand rule, and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the vector field represents the flow velocity of a moving fluid, then the curl is the circulation density of the fluid. A vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes' theorem, which relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the <b>line</b> <b>integral</b> of the vector field around the boundary curve.|$|E
