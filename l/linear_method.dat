40|$|This talk {{investigates the}} {{canonical}} properties of general <b>linear</b> <b>methods</b> for long time integration of Hamiltonian problems. It {{is known that}} the classical symplecticity property {{is important for the}} accurate numerical solution of Hamiltonian problems and this is only possible for "canonical" Runge-Kutta methods. Even if general <b>linear</b> <b>methods</b> cannot be symplectic (see [3]), it is possible to lead them inherit a nearly canonical behavior from their nonlinear stability properties. This is done by imposing a further algebraic constraint on their coecient matrices, known as G-symplecticity [1], which is a rst requirement to obtain an accurate conservation of the invariants of an Hamiltonian problem. Special attention will be given to the numerical treatment of separable Hamiltonian problems: to this purpose, the family of G-symplectic partitioned general <b>linear</b> <b>methods</b> is introduced [2]. Due to their multivalue nature, partitioned general <b>linear</b> <b>methods</b> generate parasitic components of the numerical solution which needs to be properly removed: we discuss how G-symplectic partitioned general <b>linear</b> <b>methods</b> free from parasitism can be constructed. We also consider the eects of G-symplecticity on the order of convergence of the derived methods, by exploiting the theory of B-series.
