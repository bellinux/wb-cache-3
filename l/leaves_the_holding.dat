50|$|The {{airfield}} site still {{houses a}} VOR navigational beacon, code BNN. The airspace above the airfield and nearby Chesham {{is known as}} the Bovingdon stack and is a holding area for aircraft approaching Heathrow Airport, 32 km to the south. Aircraft are requested to join <b>the</b> <b>hold,</b> typically at an altitude of 14000-16000 feet, and then fly a 'race-track' pattern around the Bovingdon VOR beacon, separated at intervals of 1000 feet from other aircraft. Each aircraft is then instructed to descend to a lower available altitude as <b>the</b> lowest aircraft <b>leaves</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> to make its final approach to Heathrow. At busy times, therefore, there may be up to 10 aircraft <b>holding</b> at <b>the</b> available 1000 foot separations between 7000 feet and 16000 feet and these may be seen circling overhead on a clear day.|$|R
2500|$|The term leaf is also inconsistent.

50|$|On June 20, 1930, His Excellency, Bishop Jeanmard {{appointed}} Reverend Edmund Daull, {{a native}} of Strasbourg, France, as pastor. Father Daull made many improvements to the church. During Father Daull’s pastorate, youth work began in earnest due mainly to the zeal and energy of a young assistant who came in 1938 — Reverend J. Verbis Lafleur. Father Lafleur lost his life while a prisoner during World War II. He lost his life while aboard a sinking prisoner of war ship. He was last seen persuading men to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold</b> of <b>the</b> ship, blessing them and helping them up the ladder to possible safety.

The van contained genetically modified scorpions intended to be used to develop new drugs to fight AIDS and cancer. The scorpions excessive size is blamed on the fact they were cloned and engineered using DNA from [...] "loads of things", including prehistoric scorpions. Milhouse intends to sell specimens to an unknown third party. As Fred foiled the hijack attempt, Milhouse decides to steal some of the specimens himself. He attempts to move some of the specimens into a coffin in <b>the</b> plane's cargo <b>hold</b> when Fred interrupts. A fight ensues and Milhouse accidentally kills Fred. Milhouse moves the specimens before balancing the coffin {{on the edge of a}} container and <b>leaving</b> <b>the</b> <b>hold.</b>|$|R

They and the priests and fighting-{{men in the}} Castle worked well together, and with a zeal that was beyond praise. The heavy cases seemed almost {{of their own accord}} to <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> <b>holds,</b> so fast came the procession of them along the gangways from deck to dock-wall. It was a part of my design that the arms should be placed in centres ready for local distribution.

50|$|A {{series of}} {{treatment}} processes is utilized to maintain water quality in intensive fish farming operations. These steps are often done in order or sometimes in tandem.

As they are leaving, they find Preston's body, and an infected Bev who tries to attack the group before they escape. When they meet up {{with the rest of the}} group, they begin to realize that the infection is probably a form of rabies spread through bites. Doc is bitten on the head by an infected rat and the group decide to lock him and Paula away to prevent further infection. George (Mattie Liptak), an unaccompanied minor, accuses Henry of being responsible for the infection by bringing rats onto the plane. Jenny talks to Henry and asks if George's accusations are true. When Henry tells Jenny that George is just confused, they reconcile, and are then attacked by the escaped Ralph. With the help of Ed and Shilah, Jenny and Henry kill Ralph by strangling him.|$|R
