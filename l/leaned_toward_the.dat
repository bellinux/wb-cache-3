5|$|Thompson still {{wished to}} leave Alaska, however, and in 1915, he sold a {{majority}} share of News-Miner stock on option to O.P. Gaustad, a Republican Party booster. Scandal erupted {{when it was}} revealed that Gaustad was merely a stand-in for James Wickersham, who was Alaska's delegate to Congress. Partially because of the scandal, Gaustad was unable to sell the shares he held an option for, and Thompson returned to Alaska in spring 1916 to reassume his role as publisher. Later that year, Republican interests took over the Fairbanks Times, which had <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party. The new owners of the Times were unable to come up with financing for new equipment, however, and the Times went out of business in October 1916.|$|E
25|$|Politically, he <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{mainstream}} Conservative Party, {{which had}} Maiorescu as chief doctrinaire. It {{is probable that}} Bassarabescu began frequenting the Ploiești Conservative chapter in or around 1901, making friends with political boss Temelie Dinescu, and courting his intellectual daughter, Ecaterina Dinescu. From about 1906, he registered formally with the Conservative Party.|$|E

After {{developing}} {{a crush on}} Grace, Tony asked her to jam when he was between bands, and the [...] "punkgrass" [...] sound that evolved was a natural fusion of their music backgrounds: playing punk rock tunes on acoustic instruments such as guitar, banjo, mandolin, and ukulele.

25|$|Western comics have {{included}} serious entries (such as the classic comics {{of the late}} 1940s and early 1950s), cartoons, and parodies (such as Cocco Bill and Lucky Luke). In the 1990s and 2000s, Western comics <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Weird West subgenre, usually involving supernatural monsters, or Christian iconography as in Preacher. However, more traditional Western comics are found throughout this period (e.g., Jonah Hex and Loveless).|$|E
25|$|The newspaper's {{editorial}} page is conservative in its political stance, and has long <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party, {{although this is}} gradually changing under its current publisher to reflect the current population and opinion trends of newer Valley residents. As a result, it will often publish two opinion pieces of opposing persuasions, side-by-side. The featured writers in them increasingly are local residents with strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.|$|E
25|$|The Republican Party {{has been}} {{historically}} dominant in county-level politics. For statewide and national-level candidates, Pike County has <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party. In 2000 Republican George W. Bush won 53% to Democrat Al Gore's 42%. In 2004 Republican George W. Bush won 58% to Democrat John Kerry's 40%. In 2008 Republican John McCain won 51% to Democrat Barack Obama's 47%. But, due to population growth, new residents have led {{an increase in}} Democratic voting. In 2006, Democratic Governor Ed Rendell won Pike with 53%. Of the four statewide Democratic candidates in the 2008 election, {{the only one to}} carry Pike was Jack Wagner.|$|E

25|$|Once {{released}} from captivity, Sanielevici returned to occupied Bucharest, and, exposing himself to accusations of collaborationism, began {{his contribution to}} Lumina, a newspaper put out by Germanophile-Poporanist Constantin Stere. His articles there, Boia notes, were apolitical, but his correspondence of the time showed that he <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Germanophile camp. This change occurred in mid 1918, after Romania agreed to a separate peace with the enemy, when he resumed contacts with the Poporanists who had fled to Moldavia. In October 1918, believing that the turn of events had confirmed the Germanophiles' justness, and their leadership position in Romanian culture, Sanielevici began working on a literary supplement for Stere's newspaper.|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} Civil War meant new {{opportunities}} for the men in Morgan's Republican machine, including Arthur. [...] Morgan <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> conservative wing of the New York Republican party, as did the men {{who worked with him}} in the organization, including Weed, Seward (who continued in office under President Andrew Johnson), and Roscoe Conkling (an eloquent Utica Congressman and rising star in the party). [...] Arthur rarely articulated his own political ideas during his time {{as a part of the}} machine; as was common at the time, loyalty and hard work on the machine's behalf was more important than actual political positions.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Annie Barrett {{opined that}} Stritch and Alda [...] "really made this episode great." [...] Meredith Blake, a {{contributor}} for the Los Angeles Times, opined that television Christmas episodes [...] "are a sitcom staple, but... they're also a risky proposition {{for a show}} like 30 Rock. Just how do you maintain the right balance between holiday cheer and year-round irreverence? It's a delicate formula, and on Thursday night 30 Rock got it just right. That is, they <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> former, delivering a Christmas episode full of cynicism – but topped with just a sprinkle of sweetness." [...] In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't the best Christmas episode that [...] has had. Past episodes like 'Ludachristmas,' 'Christmas Special' and 'Secret Santa' were put together better and had more heart". Sassone noted that the problem with [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was Tracy's subplot [...] "as it wasn't very funny" [...] {{and the one that}} dragged the episode down.|$|E

2500|$|Greater {{investment}} in brain emulation and associated cognitive science might enhance {{the ability of}} artificial intelligence (AI) researchers to create [...] "neuromorphic" [...] (brain-inspired) algorithms, such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, and hierarchical perception. This could accelerate risks from uncontrolled AI. Participants at a 2011 AI workshop estimated an 85% probability that neuromorphic AI would arrive before brain emulation. This {{was based on the}} idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components, and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form. By a very narrow margin, the participants on balance <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> view that accelerating brain emulation would increase expected AI risk.|$|E
2500|$|Reportedly, King Ferdinand I read Nici într-un chip cu Rusia and {{approved}} of its content, although {{he found it}} somewhat [...] "excessive". However, even in 1915 Rosetti could clearly read that both he and Prime Minister Brătianu <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Entente Powers. Eventually, in mid 1916, Romania declared war on the Central Powers. Following an abortive attack on Austria-Hungary, Romania was invaded by the Central Powers, suffering major defeats at Turtucaia and at Bucharest. King Ferdinand and the army, alongside a mass of refugees, withdrew to Iași; Romania, directly supported by the Russians, only held on to Rosetti's native Moldavia. As a loyalist soldier, Radu Jr fought with distinction and was severely wounded at Răzoare-Mărășești, earning the rank of Colonel.|$|E
2500|$|The 8th congressional {{district}} of Illinois had long <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party, {{and was considered}} to be the most Republican-leaning {{congressional district}} in Illinois. As of 2002, the district had been represented by Phil Crane for 33 years. Democratic challenger Melissa Bean criticized Crane, who had once been one of the leading voices of American conservatism, of having become a [...] "do-nothing" [...] congressman, pointing to the large number of lobbyist-funded trips the congressman had taken during his later terms in office. Bean lost the 2002 election, but received over 40% of the vote. This total shocked many political experts, as not only had the district been considered to be strongly Republican, but Bean had received almost no funding from the national arm of the Democratic Party. Bean ran against Crane again in 2004, leveling many of the same accusations that she had in her 2002 campaign. Bean won, obtaining 52% of the vote.|$|E

2500|$|At a Government {{meeting in}} November 1955, the {{question}} about acquiring nuclear weapons by Sweden was raised for the first time. The opposition Conservative Party called for procurement of nuclear weapons, raising the public salience of the issue. In the 1955 polls, {{the majority of the}} Swedish population, the ruling Social Democrats, and the armed services voted in favor of a Sweden armed with nuclear weapons. The Social Democrats were ambivalent: the majority was skeptical about the nuclear weapons program, whereas their leader and the then Prime Minister Tage Erlander <b>leaned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> nuclear option. The split in the ruling party became public knowledge. In 1956, an anti-nuclear faction of the party {{made it clear that they}} would not support the acquisition of nuclear weapons. As the party's crisis deepened in 1957, the majority of Social Democrats and the electorate apparently favored going nuclear. In 1957, the Commander-in-Chief in his report took an official position on the [...] acquisition of tactical nuclear weapons by Sweden. That same year, the FOA (upon the Chief's request) undertook a detailed study of what would be needed to develop Swedish plutonium-based nuclear devices with estimates for timeframe and costs. Much was related to studies of plutonium and its properties, research that required very complex and highly protected facilities because of plutonium's many hazards.|$|E

[...] Also in general, those that <b>lean</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> [...] "not yet view", or complete knowledge view, practice infant baptism for covenantal reasons, and dispensationalistic Christians (even though they tend to practice believer's baptism), because they believe the New Covenant is more future reality than present reality.|$|R
