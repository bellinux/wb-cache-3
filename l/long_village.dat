2500|$|Arkley {{is an area}} of North London, England, {{within the}} London Borough of Barnet and the {{historic}} county of Hertfordshire. It consists of a <b>long</b> <b>village</b> strung out between Barnet and Stirling Corner, roughly centred on the [...] "Gate" [...] pub, and composed of the ancient hamlets of Barnet Gate, Rowley Green and Arkley. [...] It is located [...] north north-west of Charing Cross, and at [...] above sea level is one of the highest points in London.|$|E
2500|$|The first shells passed {{overhead}} and the mines were fired at [...] on 27 March, it [...] "appeared as if a <b>long</b> <b>village</b> was being lifted through flames into the air" [...] and [...] "there was an earth shake but no roar of explosion". The detonation obliterated the Mound and the trenches rocked and heaved, burying about [...] of Reserve Jäger Battalion 18 (RJB 18), which had partly withdrawn into the reserve line as a precaution. The British heavy artillery fired a barrage along the flanking trenches {{and behind the}} salient, varying the area periodically. Infantry advanced quickly ignoring the half-minute delay for flying débris and found that [...] had gone off under the German front and support lines, demolishing the defences. [...] had exploded in no man's land on the right flank forming a crater to defend the flank [...] {{had done the same}} on the left flank and also blown up a German grenade throwing post. The Royal Northumberland Fusiliers advanced and lost only one man before reaching the German wire and found that the German survivors were ready to surrender.|$|E
60|$|Towards {{evening we}} went abroad again to post some letters. It {{was cool and}} pleasant; the <b>long</b> <b>village</b> was quite empty, except {{for one or two}} urchins who {{followed}} us as they might have followed a menagerie; the hills and the tree-tops looked in from all sides through the clear air; and the bells were chiming for yet another service.|$|E

60|$|It {{began to}} grow dark in earnest. We could no longer {{distinguish}} {{the faces of the}} people who passed us by with an inarticulate good- evening. And the householders of Pont seemed very economical with their oil; for we saw not a single window lighted in all that <b>long</b> <b>village.</b> I believe it is the longest village in the world; but I daresay in our predicament every pace counted three times over. We were much cast down when we came to the last auberge; and looking in at the dark door, asked timidly if we could sleep there for the night. A female voice assented in no very friendly tones. We clapped the bags down and found our way to chairs.|$|E
6000|$|Of course Friedrich now pushes on, double speed; detaches other force, {{horse and}} foot: which was lucky, says my informant; for the Ziethen Hussars, getting good plunder, had {{by no means}} {{demolished}} the Saxons; but had left them time to draw up in firm order, with a hedge in front, a little west of the Village;--from which post, unassailable by Ziethen, they would have got safe off to the main body, with little but an affront and some loss of goods. The new force--a rapid Katzler with light horse in the van, cuirassiers and foot rapidly following him--sweeps past the <b>long</b> <b>Village,</b> [...] "through a thin wood and a defile;" [...] finds the enemy firmly ranked as above said; cavalry their left, infantry on right, flanked by an impenetrable hedge; and at once strikes in. At once, Katzler does, on order given; but is far too weak. Charges, he; but is counter-charged, tumbled back; the Saxons, horse and foot, showing excellent fight. At length, more Prussian force coming up, cuirassiers charge them in front, dragoons in flank, hussars in rear; all attacking at once, and with a will; and the poor Saxon Cavalry is entirely cut to shreds.|$|E
60|$|He {{put on his}} hat, {{and with}} his {{overcoat}} on his arm he started {{out for a walk}} which was hopeless, but not so aimless as he feigned to himself. The air was lullingly warm still as he followed the <b>long</b> <b>village</b> street down the hill toward the river, where the lunge of rapids filled the dusk with a sort of humid uproar; then he turned and followed it back past the hotel as far as it led towards the open country. At the edge of the village he came to a large, old-fashioned house, which struck him as typical, with its outward swaying fence of the Greek border pattern, and its gate-posts topped by tilting urns of painted wood. The house itself stood rather far back from the street, and as he passed it he saw that it was approached by a pathway of brick which was bordered with box. Stalks of last year's hollyhocks and lilacs from garden beds on either hand lifted their sharp points, here and there broken and hanging down. It was curious how these details insisted through the twilight.|$|E

60|$|The {{second best}} example of a Caster, perhaps, is Lancaster. In all {{probability}} this is the station which appears in the Notitia Imperii as Longovico, an oblique case which it might be hazardous {{to put in the}} nominative, seeing that it seems rather to mean the town on the Lune or Loan than the <b>Long</b> <b>Village.</b> Here, as in many other cases, the formative element, vicus, is exchanged for Ceaster, and we get something like Lon-ceaster or finally Lancaster. Other remarkable Casters are Brancaster in Norfolk, once Branadunum (where the British termination dun has been similarly dropped); Ancaster in Lincolnshire, whose Roman name is not certainly known; and Caistor, near Norwich, once Venta Icenorum, a case which may best be considered under the head of Winchester. On the other hand, Tadcaster gives us an instance where the Roman prefix has apparently been entirely altered, for it appears in the Antonine Itinerary (according to the best identification) as Calcaria, so that we might reasonably expect it to be modernised as Calcaster. Even here, however, we might well suspect an earlier alternative title, of which we shall get plenty when we come to examine the Chesters; and in fact, in Bæda, it still bears its old name in a slightly disguised form as Kaelca ceaster.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing {{could be}} better suited to {{progress}} through the <b>long</b> <b>village,</b> which rises and sinks beside the shore like a landscape with its sea-legs on; and {{nothing could be more}} charming and friendly than this village. It is quite untainted as yet by the summer cottages which have covered so much of the coast, and made it look as if the aesthetic suburbs of New York and Boston had gone ashore upon it. There are two or three old- fashioned summer hotels; but the summer life distinctly fails to characterize the place. The people live where their forefathers have lived for two hundred and fifty years; and for the century since the baronial domain of Sir William was broken up and his possessions confiscated by the young Republic, they have dwelt in small red or white houses on their small holdings along the slopes and levels of the low hills beside the water, where a man may pass with the least inconvenience and delay from his threshold to his gunwale. Not all the houses are small; some are spacious and ambitious to be of ugly modern patterns; but most are simple and homelike. Their gardens, following the example of Sir William's vanished pleasaunce, drop southward to the shore, where the lobster-traps and the hen-coops meet in unembarrassed promiscuity. But the fish-flakes which once gave these inclines the effect of terraced vineyards have passed as utterly as the proud parterres of the old baronet; and Kittery Point no longer [...] "makes" [...] a cod or a haddock for the market.|$|E
6000|$|Five {{hours in}} the train {{took us to the}} {{beginning}} of a 'rickshaw journey of twenty-five miles. The guide unearthed an aged cart on Japanese lines, and seduced us into it by promises of speed and comfort beyond anything that a 'rickshaw could offer. Never go to Nikko in a cart. The town of departure is full of pack-ponies who are not used to it, and every third animal tries to get a kick at his friends in the shafts. This renders progress sufficiently exciting till the bumpsomeness of the road quenches all emotions save one. Nikko is reached through one avenue of cryptomerias--cypress-like trees eighty feet high, with red or dull silver trunks and hearse-plume foliage of darkest green. When I say one avenue, I mean one continuous avenue twenty-five miles long, the trees so close to each other throughout that their roots interlace and form a wall of wood {{on either side of the}} sunken road. Where it was necessary to make a village along the line of march,--that is to say once every two or three miles,--a few of the giants had been wrenched out--as teeth are wrenched from a full-planted jaw--to make room for the houses. Then the trees closed up as before to mount guard over the road. The banks between which we drove were alight with azaleas, camelias, and violets. [...] "Glorious! Stupendous! Magnificent!" [...] sang the Professor and I in chorus for the first five miles, in the intervals of the bumps. The avenue took not the least notice of our praise except by growing the trees even more closely together. [...] "Vistas of pillared shade" [...] are very pleasant to read about, but on a cold day the ungrateful heart of man could cheerfully dispense with a mile or two of it if that would shorten the journey. We were blind to the beauty around; to the files of pack-ponies with manes like hearth-brooms and the tempers of Eblis kicking about the path; to the pilgrims with blue and white handkerchiefs on their heads, enviable silver-grey leggings on their feet, and Buddha-like babies on their backs; to the trim country drays pulled by miniature cart-horses bringing down copper from the mines and saki from the hills; to the colour and movement in the villages where all the little children shouted [...] "Ohio's!" [...] and all the old people laughed. The grey tree-trunks marched us solemnly along over that horrid bad road which had been mended with brushwood, and after five hours we got Nikko in the shape of a <b>long</b> <b>village</b> at the foot of a hill, and capricious Nature, to reward us for our sore bones, laughed on the instant in floods of sunshine. And upon what a mad scene did the light fall! The cryptomerias rose in front of us a wall of green darkness, a tearing torrent ran deep-green over blue boulders, and between stream and trees was thrown a blood-red bridge--the sacred bridge of red lacquer that no foot save the Mikado's may press.|$|E
