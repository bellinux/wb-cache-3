Recently, contamination of soils and vegetables caused by mining activities is of great social concern because of the potential risk to human health, especially to the residents whom live near metal or metalloid mines. In this study, 18 topsoil and 141 vegetable samples were collected from the contaminated areas in Daye City Hubei Province, China and the concentrations of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) were analyzed. A self-designed questionnaire was assigned to obtain the exposure scenario and the USEPA health risk assessment model was adopted to assess two type of risks (non-carcinogenic risks and carcinogenic risks) of vegetables to humans. The results showed that the average contents of metal(loid) s in soils exceeded the background value of Daye City. The average contents of metal(loid) s, especially As, Cd, Pb, in three kinds of vegetables were significantly higher than the permissible values based on Chinese national standard. Leafy vegetables had relatively higher concentrations and the transfer factors of As (0. 015), Cd (0. 080) and Pb (0. 003) were comparable to leguminous and fruit vegetables. <b>Leguminous</b> <b>vegetables</b> had relatively higher concentrations and transfer factors of Cu (0. 032) and Zn (0. 094) than leafy and fruit vegetables. The transfer factors from soil to plants follows a decreasing order as Cd (0. 068), Zn (0. 047) > Cu (0. 023) > As (0. 006), Pb (0. 002). Furthermore, health risk assessment revealed the following results: the non-carcinogenic risk decreased in the order of children, adult, adolescent, while the carcinogenic risk followed a decreasing order of adult, adolescent, children; the calculated carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk of the metal(loid) s by vegetable consumption decreased in the order of leafy vegetables > fruit vegetables > <b>leguminous</b> <b>vegetables.</b> The relatively lower transfer factors and lower risks may suggest that leguminous and fruit vegetables are more suitable for planting in Daye City.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Battery {{production}} {{is one of}} the main sources of heavy metals that present great harm to human health even in low concentrations. Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb) were measured in edible portions of vegetables and soils around a battery production area in China, and the potential health risk of heavy metal contamination to the local population via veg-etable consumption was evaluated. Their concentrations in edible portions of vegetables were 2. 354 (0. 078 - 14. 878), 0. 035 (0. 003 - 0. 230) and 0. 039 (0. 003 - 0. 178) mg kg− 1, respectively. Approximately 3 % of the Cd in the vegetable samples exceeded the maximum concentration allowable by national food safety criteria, although Pb content in all samples were within the criteria. Transfer factors (TF) from soils to vegetables were dependent on vegetable species. <b>Leguminous</b> <b>vegetables</b> were more likely to accumulate Cr, while leaf vegetables tended to show higher levels of concentration of Cd and Pb. Melon vegetables demonstrated a relatively low capacity for accumulating the heavy metals studied. TF were positively correlated with soil organic matter and negatively correlated with soil pH. The mean estimated daily intake of Cr, Cd and Pb via dietary consumption of vegetables was 0. 011, 1. 65 × 10 − 4 and 1. 84 × 10 − 4 mg kg− 1 of body weight per day, respectively, levels that were much lower than the reference doses recommended by USEPA (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency) and JECFA (Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives), indicating that the potential health risk of Cr, Cd and Pb exposure via vegetable consumption to the local population around this battery production area could be negligible...|$|E

40|$|Since declaring {{independence}} in 1957, the Republic of Ghana {{has become a}} stable constitutional democracy. Ghana’s economy has grown substantially over the past decade, yet remains primarily agrarian, accounting for 50 % of the total employment and 25 % of the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Smallholder rain-fed farming using rudimentary technologies dominates the agricultural sector accounting for 80 % of total agricultural production. Approximately 90 % of smallholder farms are less than two hectares in size, and produce a diversity of crops. The major crops cultivated in Ghana include numerous cereal, root and tuber, <b>leguminous,</b> fruit, <b>vegetable</b> and industrial crops. Maize is the most widely cultivated crop in Ghana, and accounts for {{a significant proportion of}} the daily caloric intake. However, significant yield gaps exist where actual maize yields are 50 to 80 % less than achievable yields. The following document was written after conducting a three month 2012 summer internship in Ghana as an agronomic expert volunteer for the Ghana Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement (ADVANCE) Project. My primary objectives included monitoring ADVANCE crop production demonstration plots and farmers’ fields to diagnose and address crop health issues, with the goal of identifying why smallholders in the north continue to get lower than expected yields even when good agronomic practices (GAPs) are being implemented. Observations indicate GAPs are not being adopted, partly because they are not often being implemented correctly at demonstration plots. The benefits of GAPs can be better realized through improved planning, communication, cooperation and education among all participants. This document is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is an introduction to the Republic of Ghana. Chapter 2 is a brief introduction to agriculture production in Ghana, emphasizing agriculture in the northern savannah and the major challenges facing development in the north. Chapter 3 is a detailed summary of my experience working on the ADVANCE Project. The final chapter discusses how agricultural development—in particular maize productivity—can be improved in the northern savannah of Ghana. Advisor: Gary L. Hei...|$|R

Gas chromatographic (GC) analysis revealed the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) of sample comprising of sterilized soil seeded with Bacillus subtilis, sterilized soil with Pseudomonas putida and sterilized soil with Candida albicans to be 1. 721 mg/kg, 5, 791 mg/kg and 4. 987 mg/kg respectively. Treated soil seeded with B. subtilis recorded the least value followed by treated soil with C. albicans and treated soil with P. putida in that order. However, for Z. mays sample that was coated with B. subtilis recorded the least value of 2, 339 mg/kg. By contrast though, amongst all the plant samples V. unguiculata coated with C. albicans recorded the lowest TPH value of 1, 902 mg/kg whereas T. occidentalis coated with P. putida had the lowest TPH value of 2. 285 mg/kg. Different alkane groups degraded during these remediation processes were also highlighted. C alkanes ranging from C 8 – C 12 were removed though some plants were not able to degrade C 8 and/or C 9 whereas C 40 was generally degraded by all set ups. Statistical analysis depicting the effect of individual plant samples and non- indigenous microorganisms and different plants per individual non- indigenous microorganisms in degrading different concentration of crude oil at 5 % significant difference and 95 % confident limit was analysed using SPSS software.

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} one of the most {{prevailing}} cancers worldwide with particularly high incidence and mortality rates in the Western countries. Compelling evidence indicates that diet is considered as an important etiological factor of colorectal cancer risk. Consumption of vegetables has been shown in numerous epidemiological, case-control and prospective studies to be inversely associated with the pathogenesis of several cancers including cancers of colon and rectum. <b>Leguminous</b> and cruciferous <b>vegetables</b> abundant in every day diet are a rich source of many bioactive compounds. Some of those phytochemicals such as glucosinolates and their derivatives, flavonoids - especially isoflavones and saponins have been demonstrated to be potent chemoprotective agents with an ability to inhibit carcinogenesis. Recently, sprouting seed of many plants has been popularized as a healthy and nutritious food plentiful in proteins, minerals, vitamins and a range of phytochemicals. The germination process results in significant increases in concentrations of particular compounds as compared to the mature plants and may contribute to enhanced anticancer activity of sprouts. The focus of this study was primarily to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of the extracts prepared from leguminous (alfalfa, red clover) and cruciferous (Raab broccoli, Daikon radish) sprouts on key stages of colon carcinogenesis, namely initiation, promotion and invasion using in vitro model systems. The shoots were investigated as a commercial product - BroccoShoots sprouts mixture which were processed following extraction methods to obtain crude juice, methanol and in vitro digested extracts to assess how changes in the chemical characteristics could affect the biological activity of the samples. BroccoShoots extract at the highest concentrations (100, 150, 200 ug/ml) inhibited growth of CaCo- 2 cells. At non-toxic range of concentrations (0 - 50 ug/ml) BroccoShoots extracts reduced H 202 induced DNA damage in CaCo- 2 cells and significantly inhibited migration and invasion of the HT 115 cell-line. These effects appeared to be stronger for the crude juice extracts than for the other two types of extracts. There were no evident changes in the epithelial integrity of CaCo- 2 cells (measured as trans-epithelial electrical resistance) and in cell cycle progression (24 hours) after exposure to the extracts. Then individual plants were prepared as crude juice extracts to examine the extent to which particular species contributed to the overall activity of the mixture. It was found that anti-genotoxic, anti-proliferative, anti-migrative and anti-invasive effects observed for Daikon radish extracts were the highest among all individual sprouts. Further, Daikon radish extracts at non-toxic concentrations (35, 50 ug/ml) were shown to induce G 2 /M phase cell cycle arrest in CaCo- 2 cells and significantly reduce cell proliferation (over 144 hours) due to cytostatic effects. Thus, it was postulated that anti- cancer effects exerted by BroccoShoots mixture were mainly mediated by activity of Daikon radish extracts. These results demonstrate that sprouts and notably Daikon radish sprouts were effective in inhibiting several stages of colon carcinogenesis in vitro. Also, hypothesis was proposed that lymphocytes could be used as a surrogate biomarker of colonic tissue in assessment of DNA hypermethylation status of genes involved in colon carcinogenesis and that supplementation with folate rich watercress could affect promoter methylation of these genes. However, no detectable levels in promoter methylation ofp 16 INK 4 a, MGMT, CDX- 2 and C-Myc genes were found in lymphocytes from healthy volunteers. Moreover, there was no evidence that watercress consumption could change methylation status of investigated genes. This indicates that lymphocytes may not be a suitable marker for measurement of DNA hypermethylation in the selected genes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|I was {{encouraged}} to read Dr. Longo and colleagues' Letter to the Editor entitled "The best athletes in ancient Rome were vegetarian!"(Longo et al., 2008). These writers ask that we rethink {{the issue of what}} is an optimal dietary protein content for athletes by considering the diets that sustained the ancient gladiators of Rome. Historical evidence shows that humans of ancient times performed at intense levels while consuming 78 % of their diets' as plant protein (Kanz and Grosschmidt, 2007). This anthropological fact, and some recent laboratory evidence, argues against the need to increase the protein RDA for athletes from 0. 8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day to 1. 2 to 1. 4 g per kilogram per day (ACSM, 2000). Our research group found that amino acids make a small contribution (2 - 3 % of total) to endurance energy needs (Lamont et al, 1999) and that athlete's have similar oxidation rates if corrections are made for oxygen consumption and fat-free body mass. Others report that a short-term training program of 38 -days reduces amino acid use during exercise and down-regulates a critical enzyme in the oxidative pathway in order to spare this nutrient (McKenzie et al., 2000) Yet sport nutritionists and physiologists continue to recommend an increased protein RDA for this group. If one does a Google search using the words exercise and protein you would literally get millions of citations recommending the athlete to increase their protein intake. One reason for this continued recommendation, I believe, is that the laboratory procedure used to justify an increased protein RDA (field-based nitrogen balance measurements) has many methodological shortcomings that are not recognized by the sports science community (Lamont, 2008). The problems with this technique are so great that its scientific fidelity has been questioned (Lamont, 2008). And as Longo and colleagues have highlighted (2008) the Institute of Medicine concluded that the evidence for increasing the RDA in active individuals is not compelling (Washington, 2002). All of these facts speak to the argument that many have "jumped the gun" in recommending that athlete's increase their protein intake. The ancient (and modern) evidence indicates that we need to recalibrate our dietary protein recommendations for this group. This argument is compelling when we consider that protein and amino acid supplements are among the highest nutritional supplements consumed (Lawrence and Kirby, 2002) We appreciate Dr. Lamont's comments on the need to recalibrate dietary protein recommendations for athletes. Protein requirements for experienced athletes {{have been the subject of}} a long and ongoing scientific debate. For strength-trained individuals to maintain a positive nitrogen balance, it is suggested that they need to consume a protein intake of 1. 6 to 1. 8 g·kg- 1 ·day- 1 (American Dietetic Association et al., 2000). Half of American collegiate athletes use nutritional supplements, with protein supplementation being one of the most commonly used (Schenk and Costley, 2002). High protein intake in daily diet using protein supplementation is widely used to gain muscle mass and strength among athletes and coaches. It is commonly believed that high intensity training increases protein requirements. The concept that if more proteins are available to the exercising muscle, greater protein muscular synthesis occurs is diffuse in recreational and competitive athletes. This so widely accepted belief of protein supplementation and consequently high protein intake increases sport performances does not seem to be supported by scientific data. Sport magazines are full of articles in which the authors explains how to made the highest amount of protein and in the same pages we can find out protein supplementation sponsors and pictures of "hardcore" bodybuilders. We can therefore speculate about the origin of the huge diffusion of the "protein supplementation culture": it is possible that behind it there are just the economic interests of commercial producers, but other reasons are also possible. Protein supplementation indeed could be 'psychological doping' for athletes, so that this could be the fertile soil on which protein supplementation business may grow up. We should admit that the ability to achieve adequate protein intake for many collegiate athletes is compromised from inadequate nutrition attributed to low caloric intake, poor food choices, and irregular meals (Cole, 2005; Hinton, 2004), and this could be another reason why these athletes have to rely on protein supplementation to ingest their daily requirement of proteins. Studies examining the effect of protein supplementation on strength enhancement are limited and results have been inconclusive. Although some investigators have shown augmented strength gains from protein supplementation (Bird et al., 2006), others have reported no effects (Chromiak et al., 2004; Rankin et al., 2004). However, these studies have generally used untrained or recreationally trained individuals. A recent study (Hoffman, 2007) evaluates the effect of protein supplementation on athletic performance and hormonal changes in 21 experienced collegiate strength/power athletes participating in a 12 -week resistance training program. Although protein supplementation appeared to augment lower body strength development, similar upper body strength, anaerobic power and lean tissue changes do not provide clear evidence in supporting the efficacy of a 12 -week protein supplementation period in experienced resistance trained athletes. Kraemer et al., 1998 reported no differences in training volume or intensity in experienced resistance-trained men during several days of protein supplementation. In 2001, the American Heart Association published a statement on dietary protein and weight reduction and suggested that individuals following such a diet may be at potential risk for metabolic, cardiac, renal, bone and liver diseases (St. Jeor et al., 2001). Charles Darwin remarked: "The most extraordinary workers I ever saw, the labourers in the mines of Chile, live exclusively on vegetable food, including many seeds of <b>leguminous</b> plants. " <b>Vegetable</b> proteins, when combined to provide for all of the essential amino acids, provide an excellent source for protein, considering that they will likely result in a reduction in the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol. Vegetable sources of protein also provide numerous other nutrients such as phytochemicals and fiber that are also highly regarded in the diet (Hoffman, 2004) Considering the paucity of studies examining protein supplementation in experienced athletes for long period of time, further studies are warranted to examine the optimal protein intake for the health of athletes, and to ameliorate sport performance. Finally, we can consider that, for the modern sportsman, the hunger for gaining "hardcore" muscles becomes as pointless as it would have been for a Roman legionnaire or for a gladiato...|$|R
