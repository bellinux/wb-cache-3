50|$|Hypothecation is the {{practice}} where (usually through a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation)</b> a debtor pledges collateral {{to secure a}} debt or as a condition precedent to the debt, or a third party pledges collateral for the debtor. A common example occurs when a debtor enters into a mortgage agreement, in which the debtor's house becomes collateral until the mortgage loan is paid off.|$|E

40|$|Charges {{for parking}} in the {{countryside}} pose a particular dilemma in Scotland as they are seen by many outdoor groups as a backdoor approach to restricting the public's newly acquired right of responsible access to the countryside. The issue is particularly sensitive {{in the case of}} the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) where charging has spread to a number of key car parks across the area. Based on the results of a survey of over 300 visitors this paper investigates visitors' attitudes and perceptions towards car park charging in the CNP, and explores the conditions under which they would find charging legitimate; in particular, the notion <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> (i. e. the practice of declaring where and how monies contributed will be spent). We find that the vast majority of visitors surveyed are supportive of charging but that support is conditional on: the nature of the charging system, the type of location in question, and the landowners' commitment to hypothecating user fees for reinvestment in visitor facilities and preservation of the environment. We conclude by proposing a CNP-wide charging policy, fundamentally based on the principle <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Hypothec ( [...] or 16th century, from Fr. hypothèque, from Lat. hypotheca, from Gk. : hypothēkē), {{sometimes}} tacit hypothec, is a {{term used}} in mixed legal systems (e.g. Scots law, South African law, Ukrainian law (Іпотека)) to refer to an express or implied non-possessory real security over corporeal movable property. This real right in security operates by way <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation,</b> often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. At common law it is equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge.|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> is to {{mitigate}} the creditor's credit risk. If the debtor cannot pay, the creditor possesses the collateral and therefore can claim its ownership, sell it and thus compensate the lacking cash inflows. In a default of the obligor without previous hypothecation, the creditor cannot be sure that it can seize sufficient assets of the debtor. Because hypothecation {{makes it easier to}} get the debt and potentially decreases its price; the debtor wants to hypothecate as much debt as possible - but the isolation of 'good assets' for the collateral worsens the quality {{of the rest of the}} debtor's balance sheet and thus its credit quality.|$|R

G/ 206 /PN-Mdn on September 8, 2006. This case has caused legal problem, for the ruling for sequestration by the District Court cannot be executed {{in the interest of the}} plaintiff. This is because the object placed on the sequestration by the District Court has been charged the first degree hypothecation by defendant, PT Pancing Business Center as a debt guarantee to PT Bank Mestika. According to Article 1, paragraph (1) <b>of</b> <b>Hypothecation</b> Law (UUHT) No. 4 / 1996,” A hypothecation is a security right which is charged on land rights as it is stipulated in Law No. 5 / 1960 on the Principal Provision of Agrarian Law, with or without other objects related to the land to the paying off, the position is prioritized to a certain creditor other than to the other creditors. ” Although the ruling about sequestration is placed on the object case (the land) by the District Court, the ruling is void (illusoir) sinct e he position of the creditor as the receiver <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation</b> is prioritized to carry out his rights according to civil law. The condition will, of course, harm the plaintiff and ignore the principle of claiming sequestration (conservatoir beslag) in order to obtain a number of properties from the defendant as collateral for the loss suffered by the plaintiff. Therefore, the judge in the civil case should be careful in using sequestration institution because, if he does not look into the object (the land) as an immovable object and makes a verdict on sequestration haphazardly, the verdict will not have any executorial power...|$|R

40|$|Environmental Tax Reform (ETR) {{is widely}} {{accepted}} to be a policy with desirable environmental, {{and other economic}} effects. The question arises then as to why its implementation has been so patchy. There is a broad literature on {{the economic impact of}} ETR, however, there have been very few research efforts devoted to understanding the roles and imperatives of the public, policy-makers, businesses and other stakeholders who are addressed by ETR. This paper examines the impediments to environmental tax reform. Focus groups were formed comprising of members of the general public and these provided a forum for detailed reactions to the ETR concept. Interviews were conducted with policy makers and key business people in an attempt to identify both the patterns of thinking behind ETR and the main obstacles to its introduction. Having presented the results, a theory of the main impediments to ETR is developed. The principal potential impediments to ETR include: mistrust of the government, implausibility of the policy, means <b>of</b> <b>hypothecation,</b> information asymmetries, the political system, the structure of government, the macroeconomic environment, the impact on competitiveness, inequity between sectors, regressivity, elasticities and the level of the tax, terminology, and the marketing of ETR...|$|R
