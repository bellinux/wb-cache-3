Prominent methods are either powderbed-based like Laser Metal Fusion (LMF), or utilizing a powder nozzle like Laser Metal Deposition (LMD). While LMF allows the manufacturing of complex structures, build rate, part volumes and material flexibility are limited. In contrast, LMD is able to operate with high deposition rates on existing parts, and materials can be changed easily during the process. However LMD shape complexity is <b>limited.</b> <b>Utilizing</b> their respective strengths, a combination of these two additive technologies has the potential to produce complex parts with high deposition rates and increased material flexibility. In this paper, combined manufacturing with additive technologies LMF and LMD is described. Its benefit for industry with emphasis on turbomachinery is shown.

The aim was to study the effects of potential e-mail stressors on emotional exhaustion as mediated and moderated by person and situation variables. Results indicated that 2 distinct e-mail stressors-high quantity and poor quality (in terms of high emotionality and ambiguity) of workplace e-mail-were associated both with stress appraisals (e-mail overload and e-mail uncertainty) and with emotional exhaustion. Furthermore, the effects of the 2 e-mail stressors on emotional exhaustion were mediated by appraised e-mail overload. Perceived normative response pressure-a relevant aspect of the specific work environment-added to the explanation of emotional exhaustion and accentuated the positive effect of e-mail ambiguity on emotional exhaustion, although effects involving normative response pressure were not explained by the stress appraisals...|$|E

Mature (3 ̆e 1 year old) biofilms were developed before inoculation with sterilized DW (control, Con), Lp, or Lp and A. polyphaga (LpAp). Comparison of uPVC and Cu biofilms indicated significant differences between bacterial (P = 0. 001) and eukaryotic (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) members attributable to the unique presence of several family taxa: Burkholderiaceae, Characeae, Epistylidae, Goniomonadaceae, Paramoebidae, Plasmodiophoridae, Plectidae, Sphenomonadidae, and Toxariaceae within uPVC biofilms; and Enterobacteriaceae, Erythrobacteraceae, Methylophilaceae, Acanthamoebidae, and Chlamydomonadaceae within Cu biofilms. Introduction of Lp alone or with A. polyphaga had no effect on bacterial community profiles (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) but did affect eukaryotic members (uPVC, P 3 ̆c 0. 01; Cu, P = 0. 001).

Data on the natural history of allografts in children developing de novo Ab after transplantation are <b>limited.</b> <b>Utilizing</b> sera collected pretransplant, and serially posttransplant, we retrospectively evaluated 82 consecutive primary pediatric kidney recipients, without pretransplant donor-specific antibodies (DSA), for de novo Ab occurrence, and compared results with clinical-pathologic data. At 4. 3 -year follow up, 19 patients (23 %) developed de novo DSA whereas 24 had de novo non-DSA (NDSA, 29 %). DSA appeared at a median time of 24 months after transplantation and were mostly directed to HLA-DQ antigens. Among the 82 patients, eight developed late/chronic active C 4 d+ antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and four C 4 d-negative AMR. Late AMR correlated with DSA (p < 0. 01), whose development preceded AMR by 1 -year median time. Patients with DSA had a median serum creatinine of 1. 44 mg/dL at follow up, significantly higher than NDSA and Ab-negative patients (p < 0. 005).

40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is {{a common}} {{pathogen}} in im-munocompromised hosts. The virus may affect many different body systems including the central nervous system, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract. In patients with AIDS, CMV most commonly manifests itself as necrotizing retinitis. 1, 2 Untreated disease can progress to retinal scarring, retinal detachment, loss of vision, and, ultimately, blindness. 2 Although incidence has declined greatly due to the advent of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART), CMV retinitis remains an important opportunistic infection due to the great impact it can have on a patient’s quality of life. Effective treatments for CMV retinitis remain <b>limited.</b> <b>Utilizing</b> HAART to treat the underlying HIV infection may aid in controlling CMV retinitis if immune reconstitu-tion occurs. Unfortunately, not all patients will experience CD 4 + counts sufficiently high enough or sustained long enough to provide adequate protection against CMV dis-ease. 3 Patients will require induction therapy for 14 – 21 days to control their retinitis, then usually lifetime mainte-nance therapy. Intravenous ganciclovir remains the drug of choice for induction and maintenance due to its effective-ness and tolerability. For those that fail intravenous ganci-clovir, foscarnet and cidofovir are alternative therapeutic options. All 3 agents are effective for induction and main-tenance therapy of CMV retinitis. 4 Intravenous therapy with these medications poses the risk of complications from catheter-related complications such as thrombophlebitis, line infection, and bacteremia. 5 Foscarnet treatment is as-sociated with nephrotoxicity and electrolyte abnormalities such as hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypo/hyperphos-phatemia, and hypokalemia. 6 Cidofovir treatment is also associated with nephrotoxicity, hypotony, and rash (sec-ondary to concomitant probenecid). 7 These unfavorable adverse effects have caused these 2 drugs to be considered second-line alternatives...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} aimed to investigate how culture impacts on engagement {{with mental health}} services by first; understanding how culture impacts on working cross-culturally, and second; investigating intercultural willingness to interact, as a mechanism which may impact on that engagement. A thorough {{review of the literature}} revealed that intercultural communication is a complex process for clinicians to navigate. A systematic review on effective intercultural communication indicated that within a mental health setting current empirical data is <b>limited.</b> <b>Utilizing</b> secondary data from a local mental health service, the research assessed time taken to access mental health services by ethnic minority status and service utilization. South East (SE) Asian-born patients showed significant underutilization of services across time. However, Middle Eastern-born patients showed improved service utilization across time and a shorter duration to access treatment relative to Australian-born patients. A series of experimental studies was then undertaken to investigate willingness to engage in intercultural communication. Study 1 has shown that participants were less willing to engage in intercultural contact when anxiety was high, and that state anxiety was a stronger indicator than both perceived predictability and trait anxiety. Moreover, that ethnocentrism alongside state anxiety may be an important predictor of willingness to communicate. Results of Study 2 indicate that anxiety and predictability are also significant factors influencing willingness to engage within a health context; and that anxiety may be a more important indicator when predictability is low. Finally, psychological help-seeking behaviour, acculturation, ethnocentrism and willingness to interact in a SE Asian sample across two generations was considered (Study 3). Findings indicate that despite significant acculturation effects, negative attitudes towards seeking psychological help persist generationally.

D 43 e, B. succinogenes A 3 c, Ruminococcus flavefaciens B 34 b, and R. albus 7). Only three strains, 23, D 16 f, and D 31 d, utilized galacturonic acid as a sole energy source, whereas all strains except A 3 c and H 10 b degraded (solubilized) and utilized purified pectin. Nutrient composition of the basal medium and separate sterilization of the substrate affected the rate and extent of fermentation for both substrates. Pectin degradation and utilization were measured with two maturity stages each of intact bromegrass and alfalfa. For bromegrass I, all strains tested (B 34 b, 23, D 16 f, D 31 d, D 15 d, and D 43 e) degraded {{a considerable amount of}} pectin and, with the exception of B 34 b, utilized most of what was degraded. Similar, but lower, results were obtained with bromegrass II, except for the two strains of B. ruminicola, 23 and D 31 d, which were unable to degrade and utilize pectin from this forage. All strains were able to degrade and utilize pectin from both maturity stages of alfalfa; however, values were considerably lower for strains 23 and D 31 d. Synergism studies, in which a <b>limited</b> <b>utilizing</b> strain, B 34 b, was combined with the limited degrading strain, D 31 d, resulted in a slight increase in degradation and a very marked increase in utilization of the pectin in all four forages.
