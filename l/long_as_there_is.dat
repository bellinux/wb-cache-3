5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has taken an official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked {{into the air and}} the Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E
5|$|The 1790 {{constitution}} {{abolished the}} council and replaced the president with a governor, and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years. The 1838 constitution moved {{the start of the}} term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years. The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms. There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a four-year break after a second term.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a ferry {{operating}} in Woolwich since the 14th century, and commercial crossings operated intermittently until the mid-19th century. The free service opened in 1889, following the abolition of tolls across bridges {{to the west of}} London. Traffic increased in the 20th century owing to the rise in motor vehicle use, and {{because of the lack of}} nearby fixed crossings of the Thames it has remained popular, although pedestrian use has dropped as a result of the construction of a parallel foot tunnel and the extension of the Docklands Light Railway through to Woolwich Arsenal station. Alternatives such as the Thames Gateway Bridge and the Gallions Reach Crossing have been proposed as replacements, but there are no immediate plans to discontinue the Woolwich Ferry as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a demand.|$|E

25|$|Cold seeps do {{not last}} indefinitely. As {{the rate of}} gas seepage slowly decreases, the shorter-lived, methane-hungry mussels (or more precisely, their methane-hungry {{bacterial}} symbionts) start to die off. At this stage, tubeworms become the dominant organism in a seep community. As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> some sulfide in the sediment, the sulfide-mining tubeworms can persist.

25|$|In social theory, {{the concept}} of self-referentiality has been {{introduced}} as a sociological application of self-organization theory by Niklas Luhmann (1984). For Luhmann {{the elements of a}} social system are self-producing communications, i.e. a communication produces further communications and hence a social system can reproduce itself as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> dynamic communication. For Luhmann human beings are sensors in the environment of the system. Luhmann developed an evolutionary theory of Society and its subsystems, using functional analyses and systems theory.|$|E

As <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a demand for the issuer's currency, whether the bond holder is foreign or not, governments can never be insolvent when the debt obligations are in their own currency; {{this is because the}} government is not constrained in creating its own currency (although the bond holder may affect the exchange rate by converting to local currency). Similarly, according to the FX theory outlined above, the currency paid out at maturity cannot leave the country of issuance either.|$|E

Common goldfish, London and Bristol shubunkins, jikin, wakin, comet and some hardier fantail goldfish can be kept in a pond all year round in temperate and subtropical climates. Moor, veiltail, oranda and lionhead can be kept safely in outdoor ponds year-round only in more tropical climates and only in summer elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The Devil Trigger {{enables the}} player's {{character}} {{to assume a}} demonic form.

The Devil Trigger state lasts as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> energy in the Devil Trigger gauge; the gauge rises by attacking (or taunting) enemies in normal mode, and falls when using the Devil Trigger transformation or other abilities using Devil Trigger power (such as the Quicksilver and Doppelganger styles, described below). The Devil Trigger mode is not available to Dante until one-third {{of the way through}} the game, while Vergil (playable in the special edition) has the ability at the outset.|$|E
25|$|Series hybrids use an {{internal}} combustion engine (ICE) to turn a generator, which in turn supplies current to an electric motor, which then rotates the vehicleâ€™s drive wheels. A battery or supercapacitor pack, {{or a combination of}} the two, can be used to store excess charge. Examples of series hybrids vehicles include the Chevrolet Volt (first generation), Fisker Karma, Renault Kangoo, Elect'Road, Toyota's Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus, Daimler AG's hybrid Orion bus, Opel Flextreme concept car, Swissauto REX VW Polo prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives. With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the ICE. As is the case for other architectures, series hybrids can operate without recharging as <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> liquid fuel in the tank.|$|E
