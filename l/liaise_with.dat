Speer reassigned {{some members of the}} H class design staff to work on new U-boats and other tasks deemed critical to the war effort. The Schiffsneubaukommission (New Ships Construction Commission), intended to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> Speer and the OKM, was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp. This group was responsible for the design work that resulted in the H-42 type, as well as the subsequent designs. The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H-41 type and played no further role in battleship development.|$|E

5|$|Under the {{constitutional}} rules governing protocol {{in the event}} of a hung parliament, Brown, as the sitting Prime Minister, would remain in office until a new government could be formed, a process which could continue without resolution until the State Opening of Parliament, which was scheduled for 25 May. On Brown's instructions, Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell had updated the protocol for dealing with a hung parliament earlier in the year. Following confirmation that no party had achieved an overall majority, Brown authorised O'Donnell to begin the process. Four-member teams of civil servants were sent to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> the main political parties to facilitate negotiations.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after his last meeting with the CIA, he led an assault against Matamoros along {{with a handful of}} supporters. The attack failed, and Castillo Armas was wounded and arrested. A year later, he bribed his way out of prison, and escaped back to Honduras. The {{engineer}} dispatched by the CIA to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed to still have support among the army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The mayor's main duties are to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> the {{municipal}} council, district councils {{and the entire}} administrative apparatus of the canton, and to approve and implement the decisions taken by {{the municipal}} council. The number {{of members of the}} municipal council varies from one canton to another, and they are elected by local elections held every four years. The head of the council is titled the municipal president (presidente municipal). The council's main task is to manage the canton at the local level, and is responsible for planning basic policies and establishing budgets. More specifically, the responsibilities include urban and agricultural planning and organizing cultural affairs, health care, education and industry. Each municipal president appoints a number of working commissions that deal with issues specific to the municipality.|$|E
5|$|Two United States {{intelligence}} and communications facilities {{are located in}} Australia; the Pine Gap satellite tracking station near Alice Springs and Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt near Exmouth, Western Australia. Pine Gap is jointly operated by Australian and United States personnel and Naval Communication Station Harold E. Holt has been an exclusively Australian-operated facility since 1999. In early 2007 the Australian Government approved {{the construction of a}} new unmanned US communications installation at the Defence Signals Directorate Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station facility near Geraldton, Western Australia. The United States Military also frequently uses Australian exercise areas and these facilities have been upgraded to support joint Australian-United States training. As well as these facilities, between 200 and 300 US Military personnel are posted to Australia to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> the ADF and in November 2011 the Australian and American Governments announced plans to rotate United States Marine Corps and United States Air Force units through bases in the Northern Territory for training purposes.|$|E

5|$|Dowling {{retired from}} the {{military}} on 27May 1961 and was succeeded as Chairman of COSC by Air Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger. Though keen to secure a diplomatic appointment, nothing was offered to him and, as a practising Anglican, he instead busied himself with church affairs in Canberra. In July 1962, the government gave him responsibility for organising Queen Elizabeth II's upcoming royal tour. In this role he was required to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> the state governments to plan the Queen's itinerary, and {{to become a member}} of the royal household for the duration of the tour, the first time an Australian tour planner had been given such close access to a visiting monarch. He was rewarded with appointment as a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) as of 27March 1963, and became Australian Secretary to the Queen on 1November the same year. Dowling was also the Australian Red Cross Society's Canberra chairman from 1962 to 1967; at the time he took over the chairmanship, Lady Dowling was acting president of the organisation, in the absence of Lady William Oliver. Roy Dowling died of a heart attack on 15April 1969 in Canberra Hospital. He was given a naval funeral at St John's Church, and cremated. His wife and five children survived him.|$|E
5|$|From Conakry, Penfold also {{assisted}} Kabbah {{in negotiations}} with Sandline International—a private military company led by Tim Spicer, a former British Army officer—whom Kabbah intended to hire to lead a counter-coup. Sandline had been contracted to provide assistance to the Nigerian-led forces in Sierra Leone {{at a time when}} relations between the UK and Nigeria were poor, so Penfold used Sandline personnel to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> the Nigerians to provide intelligence for Kabbah and the British High Commission. In February 1998, a coalition of Nigerian troops and local militia—assisted by Sandline—restored Kabbah to power, and Penfold was transported back to Freetown by a British warship. The role of Sandline, however, sparked a political controversy in the United Kingdom, as the company was accused of violating an international arms embargo on Sierra Leone. Penfold was ordered back to the UK, where he was investigated by HM Customs and Excise for allegedly assisting Spicer in violating the embargo. Customs dropped their investigation after deciding it was not in the public interest to prosecute anybody, but Foreign Secretary Robin Cook ordered a parliamentary inquiry into what the FCO knew about Sandline's contract with Kabbah. Penfold received a reprimand for failing to report adequately on his dealings with Sandline, and the inquiry—led by Sir Thomas Legg—recommended better communication between the FCO and the high commissioner.|$|E
5|$|While at Oxford, Tarr {{had served}} in the Officers' Training Corps, {{reaching}} the rank of cadet sergeant. In 1911, he joined the Territorial Force, serving with the 1/4th Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment, as a second lieutenant. In 1913, he was promoted to lieutenant and when war was declared the following year, Tarr enlisted almost immediately, becoming the regiment machine-gun officer. His battalion was deployed to the Western Front with the 46th (North Midland) Division and landed at le Havre, France, on 3 March 1915. Following the Second Battle of Ypres, the battalion's dugouts were located between Lake Zillebeke and the Ypres–Comines railway line south-east of Ypres, Belgium. On the afternoon of 18 July 1915, Tarr, who was the acting adjutant of his battalion and whose name had been put forward for promotion to captain, had gone to the dugouts of the 5th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, towards Zillebeke, to <b>liaise</b> <b>with</b> the adjutant. While the Germans were shelling the position, Tarr put his head out to tell some men to remain under cover when a splinter from a shell struck him in the face, killing him. If it had struck any other part of his body, he would have survived.|$|E
