The turbulence model as well the model parameters, the modeling of the equilibrium atmospheric boundary layer, the mesh discretization etc., were carefully considered in the numerical model to improve the numerical accuracy. Also a numerical validation of one configuration with the wind tunnel test data was made. Through detailed analyses of the wind load characteristics with the inclined part and the wind incidence angle, {{it was found that}} the addition <b>of</b> an <b>inclined</b> part to a noise mitigation structure at-grade would affect the mean nett pressure coefficients on the vertical part, and that the extent of this effect depends on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> part itself. The magnitudes of the mean nett pressure coefficients for both the vertical part and the <b>inclined</b> part <b>of</b> noise mitigation structure at-grade tended to increase with <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>inclined</b> part. Finally, a comparison with the wind load code British/European Standard BS EN 1991 - 1 - 4 : 2005 was made and the envelope of the mean nett pressure coefficients of the noise mitigation structures was given for design purposes. The current research should be helpful to improve current wind codes by providing more reasonable wind pressure coefficients for different configurations of noise mitigation structures...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} lossy {{polymeric}} infills are introduced into metallic honeycombs {{with the goal}} that the resulting filled honeycombs simultaneously have high stiffness and appreciable loss factor. A finite element analysis is conducted with the honeycomb walls modeled with beam elements and the polymeric infill modeled with shell elements. Soft (10 MPa) and stiffer (100 MPa) fillers are used, and the filled honeycombs are oriented to deform along the x- and the y-directions. The paper presents a discussion on the cell geometries that yield highest stiffness and loss factor, for loading in the different directions. When the honeycomb is loaded the Poisson’s contraction of the cell walls in the transverse direction squeezes and increases the strain energy in the polymer, to levels significantly greater than that in an isotropic polymer sheet {{subject to the same}} global strain. From the results in the study it was observed that filled Aluminum honeycombs can achieve a Young’s Modulus in the range of 2 - 7 GPa while simultaneously having a loss factor in the range of 5 − 10 %.

ABAQUS {{finite element analysis}} is used and cellular honeycombs with different cell geometries are considered. For various cell angles, comparison of simulation results for full size honeycombs and their single cell analogs suggest that the energy absorption can be accurately determined using the single cell model. Cell wall length study shows that the specific energy absorption (energy absorption per unit mass) is higher for cells with shorter vertical walls. Cell wall thickness study shows that increasing wall thickness increases the specific energy absorption. Vertical wall thickness study shows that the vertical walls be thick enough not to buckle, but no thicker, providing the maximum energy absorption for minimum weight.

40|$|Matrix {{spalling}} or crushing {{is one of}} {{the important}} mechanisms of fiber-matrix interaction of fiber reinforced cementitious composites (FRCC). The fiber pullout mechanisms have been extensively studied for an aligned fiber but matrix failure is rarely investigated since it is thought not to be a major affect. However, for an inclined fiber, the matrix failure should not be neglected. Due to the complex process of matrix spalling, experimental investigation and analytical study of this mechanism are rarely found in literature. In this paper, it is assumed that the load transfer is concentrated within the short <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> fiber from the exit point towards anchored end and follows the exponential law. The Mindlin formulation is employed to calculate the 3 D stress field. The simulation gives much information about this field. The 3 D approximation of the stress state around an inclined fiber helps to qualitatively understand the mechanism of matrix failure. Finally, a spalling criterion is proposed by which matrix spalling occurs only when the stress in a certain volume, rather than the stress at a small point, exceeds the material strength. This implies some local stress redistribution after first yield. The stress redistribution results in more energy input and higher load bearing capacity of the matrix. In accordance with this hypothesis, the evolution of matrix spalling is demonstrated. The accurate prediction of matrix spalling needs the careful determination of the parameters in this model. This is the work of further study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The flow past different surface mounted permeable rib geometries i. e. solid, slit, split-slit and inclined split-slit ribs have been investigated in this study. Both two-component and stereo Particle image velocimetry (PIV) {{have been used in}} streamwise and cross stream planes to study the underlying flow structures. The detailed turbulent statistics i. e. mean and rms velocity, higher order moments, quadrant decomposition of turbulent shear stress producing motions, skewness and components of the turbulent kinetic energy budgets have been compared for different rib geometries. The reattachment <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> split-slit rib is lowest among all rib geometries. The average Reynolds stresses and the production of turbulent kinetic energy are highest for the inclined split-slit rib. The pressure transport calculated as residual of the turbulent kinetic energy budget equation is highest for the inclined split-slit rib. This is attributed to the smaller reattachment length leading to greater adverse pressure gradient for the inclined split-slit rib. The quadrant motions, turbulent fluxes, skewness and kinetic energy budgets at post reattachment region compares well with that of flat plate turbulent boundary layer from hot wire measurements in literature.

40|$|Sediments of the Central Bohemian Carboniferous basins {{have long}} been {{considered}} as typical platform deposits with subhorizontal dips of strata and a predominance of normal faulting. Nevertheless, seismic measurements in the Mšeno-Roudnice Basin (MRB) have revealed that some Upper Carboniferous sediments dip at angles of 20 ° or more (Kadlečík et al. 1985, 1990). These strata are overlain by subhorizontally deposited Upper Carboniferous sediments. This situation was also confirmed by samples from several boreholes (Bosák 1989, Bosák in Žbánek et al. 1990). The dips were, however, explained by deltaic deposition in a lacustrine environment (Bosák 1991). As suggested by the revision of seismic sections from theMRBarea performed {{during the past few}} years at the Faculty of Science of Charles University in Prague, the above mentioned dips of strata can be explained otherwise. Upper Carboniferous rocks usually dip at the same angle from the base of the Carboniferous up to a certain stratigraphic level (commonly to the lower part of the Hředle Member), while the overlying Upper Carboniferous sediments are subhorizontal.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that numerical modeling {{tools such as}} a RANS-VOF model can be applied confidently to reduce the level of uncertainty from empirical guidance and provide for a deterministic quantification of the hydraulic response associated with any arbitrary Caisson breakwater superstructure geometry. The RANS-VOF model used for this paper is first satisfactorily validated against laboratory measurements (surface elevation, overtopping and pressure) of a caisson breakwater on a rubble-mound foundation and then applied to several prototype caisson breakwater superstructure geometries. Numerical simulations {{presented in this paper}} for prototype geometries demonstrate that curved/inclined parapets, when compared with vertical face caisson breakwaters with the same crest elevation, can lead to large increases in overtopping as well as downward forces. Expectedly, the landward forces are reduced by the implementation of a curved or recessed and inclined parapet when compared to a caisson with a completely vertical face. During large overtopping events, the model results show that much larger short-duration seaward loads can be generated for curved and inclined superstructures when compared to vertical face geometries. This is in general agreement with previous laboratory experiments as well as field observations of seaward caisson sliding and failure resulting from large overtopping events. Further, numerical experiments indicate that the overtopping response of a superstructure can vary noticeably due to small changes in the recessed <b>length</b> <b>of</b> an <b>inclined</b> or curved parapet. The numerical model also easily provides for the quantification of the variation of instantaneous and peak overtopping discharges along the crest of the caisson superstructure, and which can provide for useful guidance in the design of various crest infrastructure components, such as drainage systems, flow deflectors, wave power devices etc...|$|R

40|$|The {{convective}} instability of pore-fluid flow in inclined and fluid-saturated three-dimensional fault zones has been theoretically investigated in this paper. Due to the consideration <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone with any values <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> angle, {{it is impossible}} to use the conventional linear stability analysis method for deriving the critical condition (i. e., the critical Rayleigh number) which can be used to investigate the {{convective instability}} of the pore-fluid flow in an inclined three-dimensional fault zone system. To overcome this mathematical difficulty, a combination of the variable separation method and the integration elimination method has been used to derive the characteristic equation, which depends on the Rayleigh number and the <b>inclined</b> angle <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone. Using this characteristic equation, the critical Rayleigh number of the system can be numerically found as a function <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> angle <b>of</b> the three-dimensional fault zone. For a vertically oriented three-dimensional fault zone system, the critical Rayleigh number of the system can be explicitly derived from the characteristic equation. Comparison of the resulting critical Rayleigh number of the system with that previously derived in a vertically oriented three-dimensional fault zone has demonstrated that the characteristic equation of the Rayleigh number is correct and useful for investigating the convective instability of pore-fluid flow in the inclined three-dimensional fault zone system. The related numerical results from this investigation have indicated that: (1) the convective pore-fluid flow may take place in the inclined three-dimensional fault zone; (2) if the height of the fault zone is used as the characteristic <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the system, a decrease in the <b>inclined</b> angle <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> fault zone stabilizes the three-dimensional fundamental convective flow in the inclined three-dimensional fault zone system; (3) if the thickness of the stratum is used as the characteristic <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the system, a decrease in the <b>inclined</b> angle <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> fault zone destabilizes the three-dimensional fundamental convective flow in the inclined three-dimensional fault zone system; and that (4) the shape <b>of</b> the <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone may affect the convective instability of pore-fluid flow in the system.
