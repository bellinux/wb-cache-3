For acute toxicity, including median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (<b>LD</b> 50) of C. longa, its HAE was administered @ 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight to female albino rats of groups 2 to 4, respectively.

40|$|Saxitoxin and its derivatives, the paralytic {{shellfish}} toxins (PSTs), {{are known}} to be toxic to humans, and maximum permitted levels in seafood have been established by regulatory authorities in many countries. Until recently, the mouse bioassay was the reference method for determining the levels of these toxins in seafood, but this has now been superseded by chemical methods of analysis. The latter methods are able to determine the levels of many PSTs in shellfish, but for risk assessment an estimate of the relative toxicities of the individual components of the PST mixture is required. The relative toxicities are expressed as "Toxicity Equivalence Factors" (TEFs).

Although there is cross-reactivity between these antibodies and venoms from snakes indigenous to Korea (e. g. Agkistrodon genus), protection is not optimal. Antivenoms specifically prepared to neutralize Korean snake venoms could be more effective, with fewer side effects. To this end, we established an infrastructure to develop national standards and created a standardized method to evaluate the efficacy of two horse-derived antivenoms using mouse lethal toxin test. Additionally, we determined the antivenoms neutralizing activity against <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> (<b>LD</b> 50) of Agkistrodon halys (from Japan) and Jiangzhe Agkistrodon halys (from China) venoms. We also performed cross-neutralization tests using probit analysis on each pairing of venom and antivenom in order to check the possibility of using Jiangzhe A. halys venom as a substitute for A. halys venom, the current standard. Slope of A. halys venom with A. halys antivenom was 10. 2 and that of A. halys venom with Jiangzhe A. halys antivenom was 9. 6. However, Slope of Jiangzhe A. halys venom with A. halys antivenom was 4. 7 while that of Jiangzhe A...|$|R
