6000|$|... "Wal, you see I got upsot over yonder, and the {{old horse}} went home while I was floundering in a drift, so I tied on the buffalers to tote 'em easy, and come along till I see the {{children}} playin' in the holler.

6000|$|MARGARET. I am {{not quite}} sure whether I want you to. It makes such a difference. Perhaps you won't know me. Even the pool is looking a <b>little</b> <b>scared.</b> (The change in her voice makes him open his eyes quickly. She confronts him shyly.) What do you think? Will I do? ...|$|E

6000|$|Ultimately I overcame all her scruples, and by {{promising}} her {{a visit to}} the great city of Minneapolis (with the privilege of returning if she didn't like the school) I finally got her to start with me.

6000|$|The {{shepherd}} aroused {{them the}} next morning, {{as he had}} said. It was bright and clear, and the four miles to the train were accomplished pleasantly.
