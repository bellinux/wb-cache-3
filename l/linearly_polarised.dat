Objective: The objective of the work reported in this paper {{was to create a}} three-dimensional stereoscopic movie describing the life of the Milky way galaxy. This was a technical and artistic exercise to take observed and simulated data from leading scientists and produce a short (six minute) movie that describes how the Milky Way was created and what happens in its future.

50|$|Some {{interesting}} {{limits on}} the HHG process which are explained by this model show that HHG will only occur ifthe driving laser field is <b>linearly</b> <b>polarised.</b> Ellipticity on the laser beam causes the returning electron to miss the parent nucleus. Quantummechanically, the overlap of the returning electron wavepacketwith the nuclear wavepacket is reduced. This has been observedexperimentally, where the intensity of harmonics decreases rapidlywith increasing ellipticity. Another effect which limits theintensity of the driving laser is the Lorentz force. Atintensities above 1016 Wcm−2 the magnetic component ofthe laser pulse, which is ignored in weak field optics, can becomestrong enough to deflect the returning electron.

The degree of linear polarisation is determined from the bremsstrahlung spectrum itself.

A simple power-counting argument discloses that np-intermediate rescattering states must be explicitly included at leading order already. This automatically results in the correct Thomson limit and guarantees current conservation. In view of ongoing effort at MAXlab, proposals at HIγS and plans at MAMI, we address in detail single- and double-polarised observables with <b>linearly</b> or circularly <b>polarised</b> photons on both unpolarised and vector-polarised deuterons.

Unlike many other magneto-optical effects such as the Kerr or Faraday effect which are linearly proportional to the magnetization (or to the applied magnetic field for a non magnetized material), the Voigt effect {{is proportional to the}} square of the magnetization (or square of the magnetic field) and can be seen experimentally at normal incidence. There are several denominations for this effect in the literature: the Cotton-Mouton effect (in reference to French scientists Aimé Cotton and Henri Mouton), the Voigt effect (in reference to the German scientist Woldemar Voigt), and magnetic-linear birefringence This last denomination is closer in the physical sense, where the Voigt {{effect is a}} magnetic birefringence of the material with an index of refraction parallel (...) and perpendicular [...] ) to the magnetization vector or to the applied magnetic field.|$|E
5000|$|Nonlinear {{electrodynamic}} {{effects in}} vacuum have been predicted since {{the earliest days}} of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), a few years after the discovery of positrons. One such effect is vacuum magnetic birefringence, closely connected to elastic light-by-light interaction. The effect is extremely small and has never yet been observed directly.Although today QED is a very well-tested theory, the importance of detecting light-by-light interaction remains. First, QED has always been tested in the presence of charged particles either in the initial state or the final state. No tests exist in systems with only photons. More in general, no interaction has ever been observed directly between gauge bosons present in both the initial and final states. Second, to date, the evidence for zero-point quantum fluctuations relies entirely on the observation of the Casimir effect, which applies to photons only. PVLAS deals with the fluctuations of virtual charged particle-antiparticle pairs (of any nature, including hypothetical millicharged particles) and therefore the structure of fermionic quantum vacuum: to leading order, it would be a direct detection of loop diagrams. Finally, the observation of light-by-light interaction would be an evidence of the breakdown of the superposition principle and of Maxwell’s equations. One important consequence of a nonlinearity is that the velocity of light would depend on the presence or not of other electromagnetic fields. PVLAS carries out its search by looking at changes in the polarisation state of a <b>linearly</b> <b>polarised</b> laser beam after it passes through a vacuum with an intense magnetic field. [...] The birefrigence of the vacuum in quantum electrodynamics by an external field is generally credited to Stephen L. Adler, who presented the first general derivation in Photon splitting and photon dispersion in a strong magnetic field in 1971. Experimental investigation of the photon splitting in atomic field was carried out at the ROKK-1 facility at the Budker institute in 1993-96.|$|E

40|$|This thesis focusses on the {{phenomena}} of charge ordering and orbital ordering in transition metal oxides, using {{the technique of}} resonant x-ray diffraction (RXD). The technique is suited to such studies, as it provides an elemental and band specific probe of long range electronic correlations. Here, we present hard and soft x-ray diffraction results on iron and manganese compounds, and demonstrate the utility of resonant x-ray diffraction in revealing their electronic properties. By performing comprehensive hard x-ray RXD studies on the complex charge ordered structures of magnetite and iron oxyborate, we demonstrate that both systems possess non-integer charge order by using the FDMNES simulation code. We find certain reflections have anisotropic polarisation dependencies, due entirely to the crystal structure, with no need to invoke orbital order to explain the observations. In both materials we demonstrate that the anomalous scattering components {{can result in a}} surprising conversion from <b>linearly</b> to non-linearly <b>polarised</b> light, through two subtly different interference processes. This is the first report of such mechanisms. By performing soft x-ray scattering on Pr(Sr$_{ 0. 1 }$Ca$_{ 0. 9 }$) $_ 2 $Mn$_ 2 $O$_ 7 $, we have provided the first direct observation of the orbital rotation within this compound. We have found that there is no apparent change in the orbital occupation during the stripe rotation, but an increase in the charge disproportionation upon cooling. We have used soft x-ray RXD on lutetium ferrate to discover an anisotropic contribution to the scattering at the charge order wavevector. This is not apparent when probing the crystal structure directly using hard x-rays. We attribute such a signal to charge-orbital order within the system, in contrast to previous claims that the system is an orbital glass.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{fundamental}} aspects of time-resolved two-photon excited fluorescence depolarisation. The thesis presents experimental {{as well as}} theoretical progress. We show that a multi-photon induced instrumental response function obtained from a suspension of gold nanoparticles is appropriate {{for the analysis of}} two-photon excited fluorescence decays obtained using time-correlated single photon counting detection. Theoretical expressions have been derived for the fluorescence anisotropy decay obtained upon two-photon excitation of various molecular systems in liquid solutions: a) an anisotropic rigid rotor that undergoes rotational diffusion in the presence of ultrafast unresolved restricted reorientations, e. g. librations. b) a molecular group covalently attached to a stationary macromolecule, and undergoing local reorientation in a uniaxial ordering potential. A new approach to the analysis of two-photon excited fluorescence depolarisation experiments was developed, which combines data obtained by using <b>linearly</b> and circularly <b>polarised</b> excitation light, in a global manner. In the analysis, knowledge about unresolved reorientations was obtained from one-photon excitation studies of the corresponding systems. By means of this procedure it has been possible to obtain quantitative information about the molecular two-photon absorption tensor for perylene and two of its derivatives. Thereby the symmetry of the final excited and intermediate vibronic states could be assigned. The analysis reveals that the two-photon transition studied with the 800 nm laser exhibits mixed character. An important finding from the experiments was that the two-photon absorption tensor appears to be solvent dependent. Furthermore, the thesis presents the first theoretical treatment of two-photon excited donor-donor energy migration in the presence of molecular reorientation and which applies the extended Förster theory. Explicit expressions for molecules that belong to the point groups D 2 h, D 2 and C 2 v are given. Preliminary experiments are finally also reported on a two-photon excited donor-donor energy migration system consisting of a bisanthryl-bisteroid...|$|R

We observe robust circularly polarised solitons when a circularly polarised pump is applied, a result attributed to phase synchronisation between nondegenerate TE and TM polarised polariton modes at high momenta. For {{the case of a}} <b>linearly</b> <b>polarised</b> pump either s+ or s- circularly polarised bright solitons can be switched on in a controlled way by a s+ or s- writing beam respectively. This feature arises directly from the widely differing interaction strengths between co- and cross-circularly polarised polaritons. In the case of orthogonally <b>linearly</b> <b>polarised</b> pump and writing beams, the soliton emission on average is found to be unpolarised, suggesting strong spatial evolution of the soliton polarisation, a conclusion supported by polarisation correlation measurements.
