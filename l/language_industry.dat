2500|$|India {{is a major}} {{regional}} {{center for}} cinema. The Indian film industry is the second {{largest in the world}} (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in Mumbai, formerly Bombay, is called Bollywood (a melding of Hollywood and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry (Sandalwood) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry (Kollywood, from the Kodambakkam district of Chennai) and the Telugu film industry (Tollywood). Tollygunge is a metonym for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of Kolkata. The Bengali <b>language</b> <b>industry</b> is notable as having nurtured the director Satyajit Ray, an internationally renowned filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the yo yorat Ratna (India's highest civilian award), the Légion d'honneur (France), and the Lifetime achievement Academy Award. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India. (Tollywood is close on Bollywood's heels, and sometimes will turn out more films in a year.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>language</b> <b>industry</b> is {{the sector}} of {{activity}} dedicated to facilitating multilingual communication, both oral and written. According to the European Commission's Directorate-General of Translation, the <b>language</b> <b>industry</b> comprises the activities of translation, interpreting, subtitling and dubbing, software and website globalisation, language technology tools development, international conference organisation, language teaching and linguistic consultancy. According to the Canadian <b>Language</b> <b>Industry</b> Association, this sector comprises translation (with interpreting, subtitling and localisation), language training and language technologies. The European <b>Language</b> <b>Industry</b> Association limits the sector to translation, localisation, internationalisation and globalisation.
