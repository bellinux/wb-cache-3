5000|$|Although a {{law on the}} {{national}} anthem did not exist, the anthems of all three South Slavic nations were unified into a single anthem of the Kingdom. It started with a few measures <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Serbian anthem [...] "Bože pravde", continued with a few <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Croatian anthem [...] "Lijepa naša domovino", which were in turn followed by a few <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional Slovenian anthem [...] "Naprej zastava slave". The anthem finished with some <b>lines</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Serbian anthem again.|$|R

5|$|A second <b>line,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Boeing Everett Factory to Mill Creek and Bothell via State Route 527, is in development, and is {{expected}} to open in 2019 as the Green Line. Long-range plans adopted by Community Transit include Swift trunk lines replacing its most popular corridors by 2030, feeding into future Link Light Rail stations at Lynnwood Transit Center and Everett Station.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the better}} known {{pipelines}} were the Northern Lights <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Komi petroleum deposit to Brest on the Polish border, the Soiuz line running from Orenburg to Uzhgorod near the Czechoslovak and Hungarian borders, and the Export pipeline from the Urengoy gas field to L'vov and thence to First World countries, including Austria, Italy, West Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The 1,420-millimeter Export pipeline was 4,451 kilometers long. It crossed the Ural and Carpathian Mountains and almost 600 rivers, including the Ob', Volga, Don, and Dnepr. It had 41 compressor stations and a yearly capacity of 32 billion {{cubic meters of}} natural gas.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} of the IND Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> terminal at 57th Street under the center of Central Park and then running via Fifth Avenue once {{out of the park}} at 110th Street, and would continue under the East River with a branch connecting to the IRT Pelham Line, which would have been modified in order to fit B Division subway cars, and a branch continuing up the Grand Concourse and then connecting to the IND Concourse Line.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{original}} announced {{alignment of the}} line, a West Coast Extension to the Circle <b>Line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Jurong Region Line is currently under study. It links the West Coast region directly to Pasir Panjang, allowing commuters on the Jurong Region Line access to the central area of the city easily. If feasible, the extension would be ready by 2030.|$|E

5|$|Following a lost {{vote in the}} Scottish Parliament, the SNP-led {{minority}} Scottish Government {{agreed to}} continue the <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airport to Leith on condition that no more public money would be supplied. A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498 million, £375 million in funding from the Scottish Government and £45 million from Edinburgh Council.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 Metro began {{studying}} {{the needs of}} the system through 2040. New Metro rail lines and extensions under consideration as part of this long term plan include: a new line which parallels the Capital Beltway; a new <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Friendship Heights Metro station to White Oak, Maryland, which would pass through the District and Silver Spring; an extension of the Green Line to National Harbor in Maryland; and re-routing the Blue Line in the District between the Orange Line and Green Line. None of these lines are yet funded for planning or construction.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were {{estimated}} to be £27.5billion. Scotland's primary exports include whisky, electronics and financial services. The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France and Norway constitute the country's major export markets. Scotland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012. If Scotland became independent, it would hold 95% of the UK's current oil and gas reserves if they were split geographically using a median <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> English-Scottish border. If the reserves were split by population, that figure would be reduced to 9%.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany, {{supported}} by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, with Germany accusing the Soviets of plotting against them. They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary. The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, {{with the ultimate}} goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan <b>line,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caspian to the White Seas. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate Lebensraum ("living space") by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 1880 the Carson and Colorado Railway was formed, {{with the}} intent of {{extending}} a rail <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> existing Virginia and Truckee Railroad at Hawthorne, Nevada through the Owens Valley towards the Colorado River. Though the rail line was never finished, it did bring economic development to the valley. The railroad was never completed past Keeler on the shores of Owens Lake. This line was acquired by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1900. There were plans to connect this narrow gauge line with SP's standard gauge lines in the area, however these plans never materialized and the narrow gauge line was scrapped in 1959.|$|E
5|$|One {{suggested}} {{route for}} an O-Bahn was for an alignment {{adjacent to the}} Noarlunga Centre railway <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city to the Tonsley railway line. The O-Bahn would end there, with buses continuing on the Southern Expressway through the far south. Construction of this O-Bahn would require moving the railway track slightly to fit the O-Bahn alongside. In addition, Emerson Crossing and the Goodwood tram overpass would require alteration. The estimated cost of construction, $182million, was considered too expensive, and the proposal was suspended in 2001. Since then, the Government has focused on road upgrades and an inner-city light rail extension.|$|E

5|$|Operationally and historically, {{the entire}} <b>line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Illawarra Junction at Redfern to its {{terminus}} in Bomaderry on the South Coast {{was known as}} the Illawarra Line. However, since 1989 CityRail has marketed the suburban services to Waterfall and Cronulla as the Illawarra line and interurban services south to Wollongong and Bomaderry as the South Coast Line. The line is coloured an azure blue on Sydney Trains timetables and other promotional materials.|$|E
5|$|Several of the area's coastal {{settlements}} have {{facilities for}} small boats, but generally only fishing and holiday craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service {{runs to the}} Catlins. A railway line, the Catlins River Branch, linked the area with the South Island Main Trunk <b>Line</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, {{but it did not}} reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of the line at Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.|$|E
