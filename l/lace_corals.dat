5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, <b>lace</b> <b>corals).</b> The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that other organisms can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} other organisms. Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E

50|$|As Hurricane Betsy {{approached}} {{the east coast}} of Florida on September 7, 1965, Amaryllis, bound from Manchester, England to Baton Rouge, Louisiana with a Greek crew of 30, sought refuge in the Port of Palm Beach in Riviera Beach, Florida. As she {{approached the}} Palm Beach Inlet from the Atlantic Ocean into the port, she suffered steering problems in addition to the high winds and seas, which resulted in her being forced into the shallow waters <b>laced</b> with <b>coral</b> reefs north of the inlet. Sometime during the night of September 7-8, she ran aground on the Singer Island beach in front of the Rutledge Motel, later known as the Rutledge Inn, in Riviera Beach. During the next day the winds and seas increased as Hurricane Betsy made her landfall to the south in Key Largo; this pounding wedged the ship farther onto the beach.|$|R

Tornai has combined water-like crystals, <b>coral</b> <b>lace,</b> wavy ruffles and water-like pearls to mimic the magic of wind upon water. From flowing chiffons, to dripping water-like details and coral-inspired lace, each gown's details echo the elemental rhythm of the world. Beginning again, in a new decade, with this collection represents her resolve to re-energize and empower the environment.|$|R

40|$|International audienceStylasterids are azooxanthellate <b>lace</b> <b>corals,</b> {{which may}} show an unusual {{colouration}} in coral reef ecosystems, ranging from red to purple on the light-exposed {{side of their}} colonies. In the present study, {{it was discovered that}} the calcareous skeletons of such corals are actually invaded and eroded by cryptic carbonate boring algae that represent Conchocelis phases in the life cycle of bangialean rhodophytes. For the first time, the shape, organisation and distribution of Conchocelis filaments within the skeletons of two different genera of <b>lace</b> <b>corals</b> are reported and documented by light and electron microscopy. Such description and characterisation of Conchocelis can help to distinguish between morphologically and taxonomically different endolithic microorganisms penetrating coral skeletons, including their recognition in fossil borings as indicators of depositional depth, i. e. of the extent of the photic zone and light conditions in ancient marine environments. The results are discussed in the light of a possible symbiotic or parasitic relationship between Conchocelis phases and their stylasterid host corals...|$|E

Information stemming from three recreational Trimix diving expeditions in Wright and Jesser canyons between April 1998 and June 2001 revealed distinct and diverse invertebrate and fish communities in the canyons of the Greater St Lucia Wetland Park (GSLWP). In total, 69 invertebrate taxa were collected from Wright Canyon, including at least 15 new records for South Africa plus 11 potential new species and 16 range or depth extensions. Divers documented the first five coelacanth specimens and obtained information on fish distribution and abundance. Five different habitat types were recognized supporting distinct biological communities; the sandy plains outside of the canyons, scattered rock outcrops within the sandy plains, the canyon margin, canyon walls and caves and overhangs. The canyon margin is the richest habitat and supports dense communities of invertebrate suspension feeders, {{as well as a}} diverse and abundant fish fauna. Dominant canyon invertebrates included sponges, black corals, gorgonians, alcyonarian soft corals and stylasterine <b>lace</b> <b>corals.</b> These invertebrates support a diverse epifauna including basket- and brittlestars, winged oysters and other molluscs.

40|$|Physical {{characteristics}} of the region The most prominent geomorphological feature along the South West Tasmanian coast is the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour estuarine system, which includes Bathurst Harbour, Bathurst Channel, Port Davey and associated small embayments. While all estuarine systems possess a unique combination of physical characteristics, the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour system can justifiably be regarded as Australia’s most unique estuary, {{and perhaps the most}} anomalous globally. The unusual combination of factors operating in this system include: 1. negligible human population density in catchment 2. little anthropogenic impact in estuary 3. large water volume and surface area 4. ria formation, but with many fjord characteristics, including narrow deep channels and relatively shallow sill at seaward entrance 5. high levels of riverine input 6. strongly stratified conditions that vary seasonally, with marine salt wedge and low-salinity surface layer 7. low-salinity surface layer deeply tannin-stained, blocking light penetration to depth 8. low levels of nutrients and low aquatic productivity 9. seaward entrance of main channel protected from wave action by island barriers 10. strong barometric influence on tides 11. low residence time of bottom water 12. high stability of bottom water with respect to temperature and chemical signature Biological {{characteristics of}} the region The anomalous combination of geomorphological, climatic, hydrodynamic and hydrological conditions operating in the Port Davey region has generated an aquatic environment with a highly unusual mix of flora and fauna. The uniqueness of this biota exceeds that of terrestrial habitats in the Port Davey catchment, which are similar to terrestrial habitats in other catchments of the Tasmanian west coast. Like the adjacent terrestrial environment, the estuarine ecosystem has compositional and phylogenetic relationships with the fjord regions of southwestern New Zealand and Chile. Unique and characteristic features of the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour ecosystem include: 1. presence of extremely narrow-range endemic species 2. high variability in biotic composition over small spatial scales, with several different zones distributed along the estuary and different bands distributed with depth in each zone 3. relictual Gondwanan elements present (at least 80 mya), notably including the Port Davey skate 4. displaced deepsea species, including many octocorals 5. paucity of introduced taxa 6. predominance of fragile and delicate sessile invertebrates, including slowgrowing fenestrate bryozoans 7. presence of threatened taxa 8. bryozoan-based sediments that are more characteristic of the continental slope than inshore environments 9. relatively few molluscs, echinoderms, or decapods. A total of 46 unicellular algal taxa, 108 seaweeds and seagrasses, 496 invertebrates and 102 fishes have been recorded from the region during recent surveys. Floral and faunal assemblages should be resurveyed to gain a more complete picture of species composition and changes through time. Additional new species, many of which are likely to be endemic to the region, should be discovered with further field investigations. Distribution of biota Plant and animal communities associated with reefs in Port Davey differ greatly from those found in Bathurst Channel, with few species in common. Major differences are evident between plant and sessile invertebrate assemblages associated with eastern and western Port Davey shores. Few studies have investigated planktonic or soft-sediment assemblages in the region. The Bathurst Channel biota varies along the estuarine cline, with foliose algae reaching 5 m depth in the western region but not penetrating below 1 m in the east. By contrast, sessile invertebrates are most abundant below 5 m depth in the west and below 2 m in the east. Multivariate analysis indicated a total of eight major biotic assemblages that characterise different sections and depths of the Channel. For management purposes, the Bathurst Channel-Bathurst Harbour subregion has been subdivided into five zones with different biological characteristics. From west to east, these are: (i) Bramble Cove Zone, extending from Port Davey to western Turnbull Island, (ii) Bathurst Channel Sea Pen Zone, extending eastwards to Forrester Point and Munday Island, (iii) Bathurst Channel Tube Worm Zone, extending to Joan and Farrell Points, (iv) Bathurst Narrows <b>Lace</b> <b>Coral</b> Zone, extending to Bathurst Harbour, and (v) Shallow Embayment Sediment Zone, which includes Bathurst Harbour and the larger embayments off Bathurst Channel including Joe Page Bay and Horseshoe Inlet. The five different zones are subject to different types and levels of threat. Threats Seven major threats to the integrity of the Port Davey – Bathurst Harbour ecosystem are outlined and discussed: boating impacts, fishing impacts, diver impacts, effluent impacts, introduced species, global climate change, and onshore activities. In order to reduce the potential of these impacts to threaten the unique Port Davey ecosystem, 20 management recommendations are outlined: 1. Anchoring should be prohibited within the main channel of Bathurst Channel (defined within a baseline extending between rocky headlands along northern and southern shores) and in adjacent bays for 200 m distance from the main channel. 2. A Code of Conduct for Boat Operators and Vessel-based Visitors should be prepared and distributed to commercial and private vessel operators visiting Port Davey. Port Davey-Bathurst 3. A booklet on boating in Port Davey should be produced that includes the Code of Conduct, legal regulations, background information on the unique biota, threats to biodiversity, quarantine protocols to reduce risk of transfer of introduced species, safety issues, health risk associated with eating local shellfish, actions required {{in the event of an}} oil spill, and location of no-anchoring zones. 4. An oil spill response strategy for the region should be finalised, and an oil spill response kit permanently stationed at Port Davey. 5. The boundary of the Bathurst Channel No-take Sanctuary Zone should be extended to include Shanks Island and the western as well as the eastern side of Breaksea Island to a distance of 500 m offshore, and the boundary of the Inner Saddle Bight No-take Sanctuary Zone should be extended to include Outer Saddle Bight and Point Lucy to a distance of 500 m offshore. 6. Diving should be prohibited without special permit to a distance of 200 m offshore from Farrell Point, Munday Island and Little Woody Islands. 7. A Code of Conduct for Divers should be prepared and distributed to divers visiting Bathurst Channel. 8. The Code of Conduct should state that no contact with reef surfaces is permitted while diving in Bathurst Channel. 9. The Code of Conduct should include a warning that diving should not be attempted in Bathurst Channel unless the diver is experienced with dark cold conditions and strong currents, and can achieve a high level of buoyancy control. 10. All commercial dive operations should be required to include a dive guide accredited by Parks and Wildlife Service (PWS) with demonstrated experience in the area, and who is responsible for compliance with the Code of Conduct. 11. Biological monitoring at key dive sites and “no-dive” zones using video and photoquadrats should be undertaken at intervals not exceeding 3 years, and annually if resources allow, to provide information on diver impacts and reef assemblage resilience. 12. If deterioration of habitats at key dive sites is noted during monitoring, then controls should be placed on diver visitation at these sites. 13. Diver visitation rates at key dive sites should be recorded and compiled on a PWS database. 14. Discharge of sewage effluent should be banned from live-aboard vessels operating within Bathurst Channel east of Schooner Cove, Bathurst Harbour and adjacent inlets. 15. A monitoring program should be established to assess the distribution and dynamics of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum, and the impact of this species on the natural food web. 16. A health warning should be issued that eating shellfish from Bathurst Harbour or Bathurst Channel could cause 17. A systematic monitoring program to detect the presence of introduced marine pests should be established with monitoring interval of three years or less, with emphasis on the detection and range mapping of target pest species (Crassostrea gigas, Asterias amurensis, Gymnodinium catenatum, Carcinus maenas, Corbula gibba, Undaria pinnatifida and Musculista senhousia) and the New Zealand screw shell Maoricolpus roseus. 18. Baseline surveys of zooplankton species distribution should be conducted, with emphasis on assays for the presence of larval Maoricolpus roseus. 19. Long-term changes in water temperature should be monitored using loggers deployed at multiple sites and depths along the Bathurst Channel estuarine cline. 20. Populations of the hollow-spined sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii should be monitored in Bathurst Channel in conjunction with surveys of introduced marine pests, MPA zone ecological reef monitoring, and surveys of native sessile invertebrate assemblages. A total of 41 research recommendations are also outlined and prioritised, as described in Section 6...|$|R
6000|$|Three of {{the ladies}} quickly retired, but the Miss Gunns were quite content that Mrs. Osgood's {{inclination}} to remain with her niece gave them also a reason for staying to see the rustic beauty's toilette. And {{it was really a}} pleasure--from the first opening of the bandbox, where everything smelt of lavender and rose-leaves, to the clasping of the small coral necklace that fitted closely round her little white neck. Everything belonging to Miss Nancy was of delicate purity and nattiness: not a crease was where it had no business to be, not a bit of her linen professed whiteness without fulfilling its profession; the very pins on her pincushion were stuck in after a pattern from which she was careful to allow no aberration; and as for her own person, it gave the same idea of perfect unvarying neatness as the body of a little bird. It is true that her light-brown hair was cropped behind like a boy's, and was dressed in front in a number of flat rings, that lay quite away from her face; but there was no sort of coiffure that could make Miss Nancy's cheek and neck look otherwise than pretty; and when at last she stood complete in her silvery twilled silk, her <b>lace</b> tucker, her <b>coral</b> necklace, and coral ear-drops, the Miss Gunns could see nothing to criticise except her hands, which bore the traces of butter-making, cheese-crushing, and even still coarser work. But Miss Nancy was not ashamed of that, for even while she was dressing she narrated to her aunt how she and Priscilla had packed their boxes yesterday, because this morning was baking morning, and since they were leaving home, it was desirable to make a good supply of meat-pies for the kitchen; and as she concluded this judicious remark, she turned to the Miss Gunns that she might not commit the rudeness of not including them in the conversation. The Miss Gunns smiled stiffly, and thought what a pity it was that these rich country people, who could afford to buy such good clothes (really Miss Nancy's lace and silk were very costly), should be brought up in utter ignorance and vulgarity. She actually said [...] "mate" [...] for [...] "meat", [...] "'appen" [...] for [...] "perhaps", and [...] "oss" [...] for [...] "horse", which, to young ladies living in good Lytherly society, who habitually said 'orse, even in domestic privacy, and only said 'appen on the right occasions, was necessarily shocking. Miss Nancy, indeed, had never been to any school higher than Dame Tedman's: her acquaintance with profane literature hardly went beyond the rhymes she had worked in her large sampler under the lamb and the shepherdess; and in order to balance an account, she was obliged to effect her subtraction by removing visible metallic shillings and sixpences from a visible metallic total. There is hardly a servant-maid in these days who is not better informed than Miss Nancy; yet she had the essential attributes of a lady--high veracity, delicate honour in her dealings, deference to others, and refined personal habits,--and lest these should not suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at all resemble theirs, I will add that she was slightly proud and exacting, and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion as towards an erring lover.|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure that}} {{destructive}} bottom fishing activities {{do not have}} significant adverse impacts on Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) in high seas areas of the World Ocean, as required by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 61 - 105, knowledge of the locations of VMEs is required. Quantifying the occurrence and abundance of VME indicator taxa in research bottom-trawl samples, {{as well as from}} in situ observations with underwater photography, provides methods for detecting these ecosystems. A case study is presented in which a threshold density of indicator taxa was used as the basis for VME designation. In 2009, high densities of VME indicator taxa were encountered at 11 sites off th`e South Orkney Islands in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. In most cases, thresholds were exceeded by a limited number of VME indicator taxa, primarily representatives of the class Demospongiae (siliceous sponges), Hexactinellida (glass sponges) and Ascidiacea (tunicates). In situ imagery further showed the importance of bryozoans (<b>lace</b> <b>corals),</b> scleractinians (stony corals) and stylastrids (hydrocorals) in the study region. The approach outlined here, which relies on widely used sampling techniques, could be employed throughout the World Ocean to detect and document the presence of VMEs from existing datasets. To illustrate this point, the method was applied to a separate dataset, collected in 2006, from a research cruise off the northern Antarctic Peninsula, which led to the detection of 17 VMEs. The VMEs from both the 2006 and 2009 data are now registered and influence the management of fisheries in the Southern Ocean.

Analyses of videographic and still photographic data revealed six habitat types: 1) Sediment (obsolete rippled and flat bioturbated), 2) Large-scale sediment features – large depressions and sand waves. 3) Tilefish burrows – one great northern tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), and a few burrows of probable blueline tilefish (Caulolatilus microps). 4) Pennatulids – chiefly widely scattered colonies of a sea pen in 3 ̆e 900 ft. 2) Low-cover hard bottom – scattered clusters of rubble or small rocks, often in patches a few meters across, rarely in more extensive fields, and separated by expanses of sediment, occasionally accompanied by a few low-relief rocks up to 0. 8 m across and rare veneered slabs or pavements to 1 m across. 3) High-cover hard bottom – low- to moderate-relief characterized by phosphoritic limestone outcrops, pavement and slabs, each chieflyacross, with varying amounts of rubble and small to large rocks, frequently in patches separated by expanses of sediment and intermixed with low-cover hard-bottom areas. The most abundant organisms on hard bottoms were a variety of sea anemones (Actiniaria), nephtheid soft corals (?Capnella nigra), zoanthids (colonial anemones) and echiuran spoon worms, accompanied by smaller numbers of primnoid and isidid octocorals, stylasterid <b>lace</b> <b>corals,</b> demosponges and hexactinellid glass sponges. The only stony corals observed were small solitary azooxanthellate cup corals (= 2 cm) (except for two small branching colonies on the fuselage of a sunken airplane). The most common fish in this habitat was the blacktail codling, Laemonema melanurum (Moridae). Four large fishes (grouper or snapper) were seen in side cameras. A total of 869 still images were analyzed in eight still photographic series identified as having high biological interest (based on organism abundance and diversity, and extent of exposed hard substrate), ranging from 82 to 136 per series with a mean of 108. 6 images per series.
