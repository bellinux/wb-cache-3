25|$|Circularly {{polarized}} light {{can be converted}} into <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light by passing it through a quarter-wave plate. Passing <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light through a quarter-wave plate with its axes at 45° to its polarization axis will convert it to circular polarization.

Note that passing <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light through a quarter-wave plate at an angle other than 45° will generally produce elliptical polarization.|$|E
25|$|A {{homogeneous}} circular polarizer passes one handedness of {{circular polarization}} unaltered and blocks the other handedness.

40|$|A {{magnetic}} monopole traversing a dielectric medium at a velocity {{greater than the}} phase velocity of light in that medium, will give rise to Cerenkov radiation with the electric field tangent to the cone generated by the photon wave propagation vector, and the magnetic field normal to that surface. This is the opposite polarization to that encountered with an electric charge. It is proposed that either by inserting a <b>linearly</b> <b>polarizing</b> layer between the radiator and the photographic emulsion, or by selecting a <b>linearly</b> <b>polarizing</b> material as the radiator, one could directly observe the field polarization by examining the photographic image and thus uniquely identify a {{magnetic monopole}}.

40|$|The polarimetric vector is a {{more general}} {{descriptor}} of light than intensity information alone, and it con-tains physical information about the imaged objects in a scene that traditional intensity based sensors ig-nore. Polarimeters – devices that measure polarization – are used to extract physical features from an im-age such as specularities, occluding contours, and material properties. Scientists use polarization informa-tion to perform difficult tasks such as image segmentation and surface reconstruction, object orientation, material classification, atmospheric and solar analysis. We will present an integrated CMOS sensor/imager that uses a unique polymer-based polarizing filter to sense two orthogonal directions of linear polarization. The CMOS imager uses analog translinear circuitry to compute, in real-time on the focal-plane, polariza-tion contrast: {{a measure of the}} orientation and degree of linear polarization in an imaged scene. We will present the microfabrication technique that enables us to apply CMOS fabrication technology to bulk manufactured poly(vinyl alcohol) <b>linearly</b> <b>polarizing</b> films.

25|$|First {{note that}} a quarter-wave plate always {{transforms}} circularly polarized light into <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the quarter-wave plate and the handedness of the circularly polarized light. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the polarizer is transformed into <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear polarizer and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly polarized light would have been transformed into <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{polarizing}} filters {{were the}} first types {{to be used in}} photography and can still be used for non-reflex and older SLR cameras. However, cameras with through-the-lens metering and autofocusing systems – that is, all modern SLR and DSLR – rely on optical elements that pass <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light. If light entering the camera is already <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized,</b> it can upset the exposure or autofocus systems. Circular polarizing filters cut out <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light and so can be used to darken skies or remove reflections, but the circular polarized light it passes does not impair through-the-lens systems.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} or retarder is {{an optical}} device that alters the polarization state {{of a light}} wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate {{can be used to}} produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E

Both have physically simple and predictable polarized phase functions. The exoplanetary diurnal variation of the polarized light reflected from a ocean but not from a land surface has the potential to enable reconstruction of the continental boundaries on an Earth-like extrasolar planet.

40|$|Abstract. In {{an earlier}} article, it was {{explained}} how {{there are four}} kinds of electric charge. There are in fact only two kinds of electric charge. The earlier article created four kinds of charge by identifying both a simple and a compound version for each {{of positive and negative}} charge. Simple charge was based on the tension and pressure associated with pure aether flow, in and out of negative and positive particles, while compound charge was about the intermediary effect of the electron-positron dipoles that fill the space between charged bodies. A charged body <b>linearly</b> <b>polarizes</b> the surrounding electron-positron sea and this causes a centrifugal repulsive force to act laterally from the field lines. It will be explained how two negative charges may either attract or repel depending on the strength of the charge, and hence explaining the link between gravity and electrostatics...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create circularly {{polarized}} light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a linear polarizer and directing unpolarized light through the linear polarizer. The <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light leaving the linear polarizer is transformed into circularly polarized light by the quarter wave plate.|$|E
25|$|Water-air {{interfaces}} provide {{another source}} of circular polarization.

40|$|In {{chemistry}} and biology, chirality, or handedness, refers to molecules {{that exist in}} two spatial configurations that are incongruent mirror images of one another. Almost all biologically active molecules are chiral, and the correct determination of their absolute configuration {{is essential for the}} understanding and the development of processes involving chiral molecules. Anomalous x-ray diffraction and vibrational optical activity measurements are broadly used to determine absolute configurations of solid or liquid samples. Determining absolute configurations of chiral molecules in the gas phase is still a formidable challenge. Here we demonstrate the determination of the absolute configuration of isotopically labeled (R,R) - 2, 3 -dideuterooxirane by foil-induced Coulomb explosion imaging of individual molecules. Our technique provides unambiguous and direct access to the absolute configuration of small gas-phase species, including ions and molecular fragments.

25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} {{diagrams}} below trace the {{electric field vector}} over a complete cycle for linear polarization at two different orientations; these are each considered a distinct state of polarization (SOP). Note that the linear polarization at 45° can also {{be viewed as the}} addition of a horizontally <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> wave (as in the leftmost figure) and a vertically polarized wave of the same amplitude in the same phase.|$|E
25|$|In {{trying to}} {{appreciate}} how the quarter-wave plate transforms the <b>linearly</b> <b>polarized</b> light, {{it is important}} to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate what is happening. In the case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the quarter-wave plate merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field.|$|E
