They are hardware devices that produce a measurable response {{to a change in}} a physical condition like temperature or pressure. Sensors measure physical data of the parameter to be monitored and have specific characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity etc. The continual analog signal produced by the sensors is digitized by an analog-to-digital converter and sent to controllers for further processing. Some sensors contain the necessary electronics to convert the raw signals into readings which can be retrieved via a digital link (e.g. I2C, SPI) and many convert to units such as °C. Most sensor nodes are small in size, consume little energy, operate in high volumetric densities, be autonomous and operate unattended, and be adaptive to the environment. As wireless sensor nodes are typically very small electronic devices, they can only be equipped with a <b>limited</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> of less than 0.5-2 ampere-hour and 1.2-3.7 volts.|$|E

However, their effects are unsatisfactory because the synchronization range of PBS is too small. Synchronization range is the key factor for the energy-efficient protocol design. No protocol notices that, in multi-hop synchronization, the synchronization range of a common node is smaller than the single-hop synchronization range.|$|R
