The VAR is a state of the art risk management system practiced internationally that takes into account risk associated with each share based on historical data.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This project will build on {{and develop the}} findings from an ESRC funded study which explored the experiences, personal identifications and meanings drawn on by pupils <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of school exclusion. The aim is to produce targeted policy and practice resources in collaboration with Kids Company (a charity supporting challenged and challenging children and young people) their service users and other specialist practitioners. Two core products will be produced as an outcome of a co-ordinated programme of knowledge exchange: A policy directed 'Manifesto for Learning' detailing specific policy recommendations. This will involve joint working with Kids Company practitioners {{as well as the}} children and young people who use their services focusing on and refining findings from the original research to clarify policy implications. A practitioner directed 'Reflexive Toolkit' to prompt and facilitate critical, reflexive awareness among teachers and other professionals working with pupils <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of school exclusion. This activity will synthesise findings from the original research with the insights and experience of a specially selected panel of practitioners to generate a practical overview of the dynamics commonly framing school conflict. Both resources will be <b>launched</b> <b>at</b> a one day seminar for policymakers and practitioners...|$|R
40|$|In general, poverty {{measures}} are estimated by applying income information. However, only using income data for calculating relative poverty {{might lead to}} an incomplete view. For example, a household can be under a poverty threshold even if a household member owns real estate or equity. In this thesis, <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty in Germany is estimated. In {{order to get a}} more complete picture of <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty, a multidimensional approach is applied. Not only <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty, also <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty is measured. Moreover, households that are both <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income and wealth poor are analyzed. Furthermore, several poverty groups are identified: twice-poor which are households that are, <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income and wealth poverty; protected-poor, households that are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty but not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty; vulnerable-poor, households which are <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty but not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty; non-poor, households which are either <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of income poverty nor <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of wealth poverty. Poverty profiles in Germany and their changes over time are analyzed for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. In fact, it is investigated to which degree <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty rates differ in socio-economic characteristics. A logit regression is applied for each dimension and each wave for estimation. For robustness checks, 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals are calculated for all results. Findings suggest that young age, region East Germany, single, lone parent, unemployment and low education are factors that condition the <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty rates. The definition of a certain rate influences the percentage of households that are affected by <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of poverty, however, has a limited effect on poverty profiles. Poverty profiles have not changed over time but some factors such as unemployment and low education have significantly increased...|$|R
