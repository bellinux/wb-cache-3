25|$|Value network {{analysis}} addresses both financial and non-financial value. Every business relationship includes contractual or mandated activities between participants — and also informal exchanges of knowledge, favors, and benefits. The analysis {{begins with a}} visual map or diagram that first shows the essential contractual, tangible revenue- or funding-related business transactions and exchanges that occur between each node of the networks. Nodes represent real people, typically individuals, groups of individuals such as a business unit or aggregates of groups such {{as a type of}} business in an industry network. During analysis when adopting a reflective, double loop or generative <b>learning</b> <b>mode,</b> it is beneficial to regard nodes as role plays (shortened to roles). Practitioners have found {2} that conversation between participants about role plays within a larger whole invariably results in transforming individual behaviour and gaining commitment to implementing needed change as elaborated below.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY According to {{experience}} learning theory (ELT) {{learning is a}} process. ELT conceives of learning as a four-stage cycle including four learning modes: concrete experience, re ective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation. The learning style inventory (LSI) invented from ELT provides a framework for examining one’s approach to learning situations. The aim {{of the present study}} was to collect data with the LSI and present: (a) the test–retest reliability coef cients for the different learning modes; (b) the correlation between different <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> and age; (c) gender differences in the learning modes; and (d) homogeneous groups of students with different learning styles. The results showed highly signi cant reliability coef cients, non-signi cant correlations between <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> and age, gender differences in some <b>learning</b> <b>modes,</b> and a cluster analysis found homogenous groups with different learning styles...|$|R

So, developing adaptive learning resources according to the different terminals and users’ preferences is the key research issue of mobile learning. In this paper, we mainly introduce an adaptive mobile learning framework, which considers four dimensions in process of adaptation. Meanwhile, we also introduce two different <b>learning</b> <b>modes,</b> whole course <b>learning</b> and knowledge point learning. In these two kinds of <b>learning</b> <b>modes,</b> we use cache mechanism and knowledge grade to improve the capability of the adaptive system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>modes</b> of social <b>learning</b> and level of team familiarity, i. e. agents that have worked together before, on team performance. A computational model is implemented under a set of typical social <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> in a team environment. In this model, agents can learn from personal interaction with other agents and the tasks, and by observing interaction among other agents and the tasks. Agents in the team are considered domain experts, which means the task knowledge is pre-coded. Agents learn about each others competence (i. e., who knows what), which leads to the formation of a team mental model. Agents that have team familiarity are expected to have developed each other’s mental model to the extent facilitated by the available <b>learning</b> <b>modes.</b> Simulations are conducted with team familiarity and <b>learning</b> <b>modes</b> as parameters. Simulation results indicate that team performance is positively correlated with social learning and team familiarity. Implications of the findings on managing information exchange within teams are discussed...|$|R

Locating our study within manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia, we find that absorptive capacity enhances the EO–performance relationship, both as a moderator and a mediator.
