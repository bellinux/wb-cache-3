The upper portion of water is skimmed off the top for everyday use while {{the water in the}} bottom of the tower is held in reserve to fight fire.

5000|$|When {{the water}} level is below both switches, the float switch {{physical}} contacts are both closed, and a true (logic 1) value is passed to the Fill Valve output. Water begins to fill the tank. The internal [...] "Fill Valve" [...] contact latches the circuit so that even when the [...] "Low Level" [...] contact opens (as the water passes the lower switch), the fill valve remains on. Since the High Level is also normally closed, water continues to flow as {{the water level}} remains between the two switch levels.

50|$|In Fur Fighters, the player's job is {{to rescue}} the tiny animal babies who have been taken from their parents (in one case, it's the little brother) by the central villain, General Viggo. Viggo has {{scattered}} these babies all over the world, requiring the fathers (again, in one case it's the little brother, in another, it's the mother) to explore, confront Viggo's henchmen, and rescue all of them. The gameplay featured many unique aspects for a third-person shooter {{of the time it}} was released, most notably making each level an extremely large, expansive area that requires sometimes hours of involved exploration to locate the babies and get rid of the enemies. (Examples include a giant construction site and an entire section of a large city, complete with buildings to explore, including a complete museum of modern art.) Maneuvering through these levels often requires careful observation of the environment so as not to get lost, as well as solving puzzles to figure out where some babies might be hidden or how to gain access to more of the level. Unlike most action games of this type, Fur Fighters distinguishes itself by featuring a system where the player can, at many intervals on a <b>level,</b> <b>switch</b> between one of many animal parents. Each parent has their own advantages and disadvantages, with many having special abilities allowing them to do certain things easier. This substitute system also makes it easier for players who are low on hit points or ammunition to switch to a more suitable character.|$|E

40|$|In Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), which locates {{primarily}} in the bone marrow (BM), VH gene analysis had previously suggested origins from a post-follicular B-cell arresting prior to isotype switch. Using more sensitive assays, facilitated by amplified cDNA from BM cells, nested PCR unexpectedly revealed tumor-derived isotype-switch transcripts in 7 / 7 cases. In 5 / 7 cases, both C and C variant transcripts were identified, and C or C only in 2 / 7. Detection of activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and germline and circle transcripts confirmed switching activity. Selected gene expression profiles established the memory B-cell marker CD 27 as highly expressed in all cases. These findings were evaluated further in additional WM cases where availability of tumor material allowed detailed analysis. In 2 / 2 cases, phenotype suggested a variable CD 27 expression within the tumor clone. In these, tumor IgM transcripts were readily detected in both the CD 19 +CD 27 + and CD 19 +CD 27 – fractions, and in 1 of the 2 cases, post-switched tumor-derived C transcripts were also identified in each fraction. In this WM case, the frequency of tumor-derived transcripts was then assessed at the single cell <b>level.</b> <b>Switch</b> transcripts were identified in 3 / 96 cells with no co-expression of the IgM isotype. Similarly, AID transcripts were observed in some cells, not always correlating with switch events or with ongoing somatic mutation, which was apparent in VDJ-Cµ sequences.

Heterogeneity in CD 27 expression is also evident within tumor cells, revealing phenotypic change. Interestingly, these data indicate that although WM tumor cells have arrested at the IgM stage and do not express isotype switched Ig, they retain the capacity to initiate events critical for isotype switch...|$|E

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2011 Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on June 6, 2011 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 44 - 46) Thesis advisor: Xiaojun ShenVitaA large industrial company needs a cost efficient telecommunication network to support heavy telecommunication needs among its different departments which are distributed in various locations. Because {{of the huge}} amount of daily communications, the network designer must partition the communicating devices into subnets {{each of which is}} supported by a high speed Ethernet. Then, the subnets are connected by a second <b>level</b> <b>switch</b> device called controller which handles inter-subnet communications. An optimization problem is how to partition n communicating devices into k groups such that the amount of intra-network traffic is balanced among the k groups {{and at the same time}} the inter-network traffic is minimized for a given traffic demand. This problem is known as the Network Partition Problem (NPP). The NPP problem has been studied by some researchers, but because of its NPhardness, only limited progress has been reported by two recent papers. The later one slightly improved on the results obtained by the previous one, and both papers used genetic algorithms. This thesis investigated the NPP problem and concluded by extensive tests that it is very difficult to improve further if we purely follow the method of genetic algorithms. Motivated by searching for new approaches, this thesis tried another evolutionary algorithm, i. e., the simulated annealing (SA) to see any hope to get a breakthrough. Encouraging results were obtained for some cases but not show overall superiority. Finally, this thesis investigated the approach that combines these two methods in searching for a better result. Extensive simulations demonstrated that this method work efficiently. By the combination of these two methods, we obtained obvious improvements on previous published results. This approach studied in this thesis can be applicable to practically solving other NP-hard problems also.

40|$|Network-on-Chip (NoC) is {{proposed}} as a systematic approach to address future System-on-Chip (SoC) design difficulties. Due to its good performance and small buffering requirement, wormhole switching is being {{considered as a}} main network flow control mechanism for on-chip networks. Wormhole switching for NoCs is challenging from NoC application design and switch complexity reduction. In a NoC design flow, mapping an application onto the network should conduct a feasibility analysis {{in order to determine}} whether the messages’ timing constraints can be satisfied, and whether the network can be efficiently utilized. This is necessary because network contentions lead to nondeterministic behavior in message delivery. For wormhole-switched networks, we have formulated a contention tree model to accurately capture network contentions and reflect the concurrent use of links. Based on this model, the timing bounds of real-time messages can be derived. Furthermore, we have developed an algorithm to test the feasibility of real-time messages in the networks. From the wormhole switch micro-architecture <b>level,</b> <b>switch</b> complexity should be minimized to reduce cost but with reasonable performance penalty. We have investigated the flit admission and flit ejection problems that concern how the flits of packets are admitted into and ejected from the network, respectively. For flit admission, we propose a novel coupling scheme which binds a flit-admission queue with an output physical channel. Our results show that this scheme achieves a reduction of up to 8 % in switch area and up to 35 % in switch power over other comparable solutions. For flit ejection, we propose a p-sink model which differs from a typical ideal ejection model in that it uses only p flit sinks to eject flits instead of p • v flit sinks as required by the ideal model, where p is the number of physical channels of a switch and v is the number of virtual channels per physical channel. With this model, the buffering cost of flit sinks only depends on p, i. e., is irrespective of v. We have evaluated the coupled flit-admission technique and p-sink model in a 2 D 4 x 4 mesh network. In our experiments, they exhibit only limited performance penalties in some cases. We believe that these cost-effective models are promising candidates to be used in wormhole-switched on-chip networks. QC 2010052...|$|E
