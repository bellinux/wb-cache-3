5|$|The phase {{stability}} principle was tested {{with the old}} 37-inch cyclotron at Berkeley after McMillan returned to the Radiation Laboratory in September 1945. When it was found to work, the 184-inch cyclotron was similarly modified. He became a full professor in 1946. In 1954 he was appointed {{associate director of the}} Radiation Laboratory. He was promoted to deputy director in 1958. On the death of Lawrence that year, he became director, and he stayed in that position until his retirement in 1973. The laboratory was renamed the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory in 1958.

5|$|After {{service on}} the Western Front with the Royal Field Artillery during the Great War, Cockcroft studied {{electrical}} engineering at Manchester Municipal College of Technology. He then won a scholarship to St. John's College, Cambridge, where he sat the tripos exam in June 1924, becoming a wrangler. Ernest Rutherford accepted Cockcroft as a research student at the Cavendish <b>Laboratory,</b> <b>and</b> Cockcroft completed his doctorate under Rutherford's supervision in 1928. With Ernest Walton and Mark Oliphant he built {{what became known as}} a Cockcroft–Walton accelerator. Cockcroft and Walton used this to perform the first artificial disintegration of an atomic nucleus, a feat popularly known as splitting the atom.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical <b>Laboratory</b> <b>and</b> DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E

In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E

5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the <b>laboratory</b> <b>and</b> have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Holly Compton (September 10, 1892– March 15, 1962) was an American {{physicist}} {{who won the}} Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for his 1923 {{discovery of}} the Compton effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation.
