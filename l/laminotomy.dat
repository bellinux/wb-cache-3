5000|$|The {{procedure}} of a <b>laminotomy</b> remains largely the same {{regardless of the}} instrument used, or the level of vertebrae operated on. Laminotomies require general or spinal anesthesia and frequently require a hospital stay following the procedure- although {{the duration of the}} stay depends on the physical condition of the individual and their reason for having a <b>laminotomy.</b> A <b>laminotomy</b> takes about 70-85 minutes {{depending on the type of}} procedure used. Unilateral laminotomies typically require less time because bone is only removed from one lamina, whereas bilateral laminotomies usually take more time because bone is removed from both laminae. The level of the vertebrae that the <b>laminotomy</b> is performed on and what instrument is used produce no significant differences in the length of the procedure. Both the unilateral and bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> are performed in a shorter time period compared to a conventional laminectomy which takes over 100 minutes on average.|$|E
5000|$|During a <b>laminotomy,</b> the {{individual}} lays supine, or lying on their stomach with their back facing up towards the physician. An initial incision is made {{down the middle}} of the back exposing the vertebrae on which the <b>laminotomy</b> will be performed. In this procedure, the spinous process and the ligaments of the vertebral column are kept intact, but the muscles adjacent to the vertebral column known as the paraspinous muscles (Example:spinalis muscle) must be separated from the spinous process and vertebral arch. In a unilateral <b>laminotomy,</b> these muscles are only detached from the side on which the <b>laminotomy</b> is being performed. During a bilateral <b>laminotomy,</b> these muscles must be removed on both sides of the vertebrae. The ligaments connecting the lamina of upper and lower vertebrae, known as Ligamenta flava are often removed or remodeled in this procedure to adjust for the small amount of bone lost. [...] Using either a microscope or an endoscope to have a visual of the procedure, a small surgical drill is used to remove a part of bone from the lamina on one or both laminae of the vertebrae. Laminotomies can be performed on multiple vertebrae during the same surgery; this is known as a multi-level <b>laminotomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{slightly}} different, but {{commonly used}} procedure of <b>laminotomy</b> is the unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> for bilateral spinal decompression. This {{minimally invasive procedure}} {{is often used to}} treat patients with excessive pressure in the vertebral column that must be relieved. In this procedure, the same spinal ligaments are kept intact and the paraspinous muscles must still be detached. A unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> is performed on one lamina of a vertebra. This removal of bone from one lamina provides an opening into the spinal canal. Using a microscope or an endoscope to visualize the procedure, surgical tools are inserted through this opening into the spinal canal. The surgical tools are then navigated underneath the spinous process and across the spinal canal to reach the other lamina {{on the opposite side of}} the vertebra to perform a second <b>laminotomy.</b> The incision for this procedure is smaller because doctors only need access to one lamina yet can perform a bilateral laminotomy- remove bone from both lamina of a single vertebra. The unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> with bilateral spinal decompression procedure was developed almost 20 years ago and is a common successful surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{types of}} <b>laminotomies</b> {{are defined by}} the type of {{instrument}} used to visualize the surgical procedure, what vertebra the procedure is performed on, and whether or not both lamina of a vertebra are operated on or just one.|$|R

A prospective study of 25 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures who underwent C-arm machine-guided posterior indirect reduction and short segment fixation without fusion is described. No <b>laminotomies</b> were performed. All patients had a mean follow-up of 30. 4  months. At postoperative review, the average anterior and posterior vertebral heights were corrected from 57. 9 % to 99. 0 % and 89. 0 % to 99. 5 %, respectively. The Cobb angle was corrected from 18. 4 ° to 0. 17 °. The canal compromise ratio was improved from 35. 2 % to 8. 6 %. In all 25 cases, neurological status was intact at last follow-up. Fluoroscopy guidance is an effective method to accomplish indirect reduction and fixation.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is steadily rising, {{mostly because of}} a noticeably older age structure. In Sweden, LSS surgery has increased continuously {{over the years and}} is presently the most common argument to undergo spine surgery. The purpose of the surgery is to decompress the neural elements in the stenotic spinal canal. To avoid instability, there has been a tradition to do the decompression with a complementary fusion, especially if degenerative spondylolisthesis is present preoperatively. The overall aims of this thesis were to evaluate which method of surgery that generally can be considered to give sufficiently good clinical results with least cost to society and risk of complications and to determine whether there is a difference in outcome between smokers and non-smokers. The Swespine Register was used to collect data on clinical outcome after LSS surgery. In two of the studies, large cohorts were observed prospectively with follow-up after 2 years. Data were analysed in a multivariate model and logistic regression. In a randomised controlled trial (RCT, the Swedish Spinal Stenosis Study), 233 patients were randomised to either decompression with fusion or decompression alone and then followed for 2 years. The consequence of preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis on the results was analysed and a health economic evaluation performed. The three-dimensional CT technique was used in a radiologic biomechanical pilot study to evaluate the stabilising role of the segmental midline structures in LSS with preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis by comparing laminectomy with bilateral <b>laminotomies.</b> Smokers, in comparison with non-smokers, showed less improvement after surgery for LSS. Decompression with fusion did not lead to better results compared with decompression alone, no matter if degenerative spondylolisthesis was present preoperatively or not; nor was decompression with fusion found to be more cost-effective than decomression alone. The instability caused by a decompression proved to be minimal and removal of the midline structures by laminectomy did not result in increased instability compared with the preservation of these structures by bilateral <b>laminotomies.</b> In LSS surgery, decompression without fusion should generally be the treatment of choice, regardless of whether preoperative degenerative spondylolisthesis is present or not. Special efforts should be targeted towards smoking cessation prior to surgery...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Study Design: A {{retrospective}} study Objective: To analyze incidence, causes and prognosis of the spinal nerve root injury during the degenerative low back surgery. Summary of Literature Review: There {{were very few}} studies about intraoperative spinal nerve root injuries during low back surgery. Materials and Methods: Six hundred and twenty seven patients underwent degenerative low back surgery from Jan 1990 to Jan 2001 were included in this study. All patients were operated on by the first author and operation records made by the author himself were reviewed. Eight cases of intraoperative spinal nerve root injury were identified and causes and level of injuries, preoperative diagnosis, types of surgery and follow-up clinical results were analyzed. Results: Eight cases of nerve root injury were developed during 5 posterior <b>laminotomies</b> for discectomy and 3 instrumentation and fusion. Spinal nerve root injuries were caused by Kerrison punch in 4 cases, pituitary forcep in 2, rongeur in 1, and not cer-tain but probably by Kerrison punch in 1 case. The levels of injuries were 5 th lumbar nerve root in 4 cases, and 1 st sacral nerve root and 2 nd lumbar nerve root in 1 case respectively. Two cases had sacral nerve rootlet injury with paramedian dural tear but the level of root injury was uncertain. Six of 8 patients had symptoms.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) {{used for}} {{spasticity}} treatment could worsen or develop spinal deformities. Our {{goal is to}} describe spinal deformities seen in patients with cerebral palsy (CP) after being treated by SDR. Methods: Retrospective study of patients operated on (SDR) between January/ 1999 and June/ 2012. Inclusion criteria: spinal Rx before SDR surgery, spinography, and assessment at follow-up. We evaluated several factors emphasizing level and type of SDR approach, spinal deformity and its treatment, final Risser, and follow-up duration. Results: We found 7 patients (6 males) : mean age at SDR 7. 56 years (4. 08 - 11. 16). Mean follow-up: 6. 64 years (2. 16 - 13), final age: 14. 32 years (7. 5 - 19). No patient had previous deformity. GMFCS: 2 patients level IV, 2 level III, 3 level II. Initial walking status: 2 community walkers, 2 household walkers, 2 functional walkers, 1 not ambulant, at the follow-up, 3 patients improved, and 4 kept their status. We found 4 TL/L <b>laminotomies,</b> 2 L/LS laminectomies, and 1 thoracic laminectomy. Six spinal deformities were observed: 2 sagittal, 3 mixed, and 1 scoliosis. There was no association among the type of deformity, final gait status, topographic type, GMFCS, age, or SDR approach. Three patients had surgery indication for spinal deformity at skeletal maturity, while those patients with smaller deformities were still immature (Risser 0 to 2 / 3) although with progressive curves. Conclusions: After SDR, patients should be periodically evaluated until they reach Risser 5.

50|$|High-speed craniotomes usually run at 40,000 to 80,000 rpm {{and have}} greatly {{facilitated}} intracranial approaches in neurosurgery. They are also employed to temporarily remove the vertebral arch in <b>laminotomy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Endoscopic/Microendoscopic {{decompression}} <b>laminotomy</b> uses an endoscope {{to visualize}} the surgical procedure. An endoscope is a small tube-shaped camera inserted into the patient in order {{to visualize the}} surgical procedure internally.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, laminectomies {{have been}} the primary way to treat lumbar spinal stenosis.  A laminectomy is a more {{invasive}} method with the aim to decrease {{the total amount of}} pain and numbness associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.  It is a surgery that eliminates the entire lamina to allow the nerves around this region to function properly. Laminectomies also often produce a longer recovery time as well as a greater risk for post-operative complications. There is typically more damage to the surrounding muscle tissue accompanied by a laminectomy.  Since a laminectomy involves the excision of the entire lamina, a laminectomy will usually cause more spinal instability than a <b>laminotomy.</b>  When going with the option of <b>laminotomy,</b> the procedure reduces the total amount of muscle severed. Because a <b>laminotomy</b> does not damage the spinous process and critical ligaments, there is not as much muscle weakness, pain, and lumbar instability seen with laminectomies.  Laminotomies are fairly new compared to laminectomies, and it involves using less invasive methods with precise instruments to minimize the risk of tissue damage.|$|E
50|$|These classifications of laminotomies can be {{combined}} to form the most descriptive name for the procedure possible. For example, an endoscopic unilateral lumbar <b>laminotomy</b> is the removal of bone from only one lamina of a lumbar vertebrae using an endoscope.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>laminotomy</b> is an {{orthopaedic}} neurosurgical {{procedure that}} removes {{part of the}} lamina of a vertebral arch in order to relieve pressure in the vertebral canal. A <b>laminotomy</b> is less invasive than conventional vertebral column surgery techniques, such as laminectomy because it leaves more ligaments and muscles attached to the vertebral column intact and it requires removing less bone from the vertebra. As a result, lamonotomies typically have a faster recovery time and result in fewer postoperative complications. Nevertheless, possible risks can occur during or after the procedure like infection, hematomas, and dural tears. [...] Laminotomies are commonly performed as treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis and herniated disks. MRI and CT scans are often used pre- and post surgery {{to determine if the}} procedure was successful.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>laminotomy</b> {{procedure}} {{has many}} benefits {{as to why}} it is a preferred spinal surgery since it is less invasive than other spinal procedures such as a laminectomy or a spinal fusion. Once a <b>laminotomy</b> procedure is done, patients have a great improvement in their pain and mobility. Laminotomies are usually safer than other surgeries that are open or invasive. This surgery usually is shorter than other spinal decompression procedures by having an average duration of 70-85 minutes, whereas other decompression surgeries can have a duration anywhere from 90 to 109 minutes. Laminotomies are usually more cost efficient than other surgical decompression surgeries. In 2007, it was seen that laminotomies were around $10,000, whereas other surgical procedures were around $24,000. Smaller skin incisions and scarring as well as less surgical trauma are also a benefit of <b>laminotomy.</b> [...] With this procedure, there is usually a faster recovery time that results in a shorter hospital stay if one is necessary at all. During the surgery {{there is also a}} benefit of minimizing the injury to muscles, ligaments, and bones in the spine since more invasive surgeries have a greater risk of damaging them. General anesthesia is usually required, but postoperative spinal instability is typically limited.|$|E
5000|$|Laminae (singular: lamina) are the {{anatomical}} structures of primary importance in a <b>laminotomy.</b> Laminae {{are part of}} the vertebral arch which is the region of bone on the back side of each vertebra that forms a protective covering for {{the back side of the}} spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|While {{conservative}} {{approaches for}} rehabilitation are ideal, some patients will not improve and surgery {{is still an}} option. Patients with large cervical disk bulges may be recommended for surgery, however most often conservative management will help the herniation regress naturally. Procedures such as foraminotomy, <b>laminotomy,</b> or discectomy may be considered by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>laminotomy</b> is {{typically}} used to relieve {{pressure from the}} spinal canal. Excessive pressure in the spinal canal causes the spinal canal and spinal nerves to be compressed which can be very painful and can impair motor control and/or sensation. A common disorder that causes increased pressure in the spinal canal is lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar spinal stenosis is formally defined as a decline in diameter length of either the neural foramina, lateral recess, or spinal canal. Stenosis is classified as a decaying disease because it causes the canal to gradually {{become more and more}} narrow which can cause pain or loss of function. Common symptoms of lumbar stenosis are pain, fatigue, weakness of the muscle and numbness. Stenosis can be caused by old age or an injury to the vertebral column and usually requires a CT scan or MRI to diagnose. Performing a <b>laminotomy</b> can relieve pressure in the spinal canal caused by lumbar stenosis and therefore alleviate symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Spinal {{microsurgery}} is a {{minimally invasive}} unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> used to correct bilateral lumbar spinal compression. Spinal microsurgery {{is the most}} common and effective microsurgical decompression treatment for patients that present with moderate to severe spinal stenosis. Spinal microsurgeries are performed with high magnification 3D imaging of the fixated area of the spine, reducing the potential risk of harming the architecture of the spine itself.|$|E
50|$|A CT scan is not {{the most}} {{effective}} imaging technique when observing lumbar abnormalities, however it can supplement an MRI by detecting certain degenerative processes. When determining whether or not a <b>laminotomy</b> will be beneficial for the patient, a healthcare provider must assess the severity of the possible abnormalities. Out of all the potential reasons to have a <b>laminotomy</b> performed, lumbar spinal stenosis is the chief reason. CT scans are used specifically to pinpoint a buckled lumbar ligamentum flavum as well as facet hypertrophy, which are some of the main pathophysiological changes indicative of lumbar spinal stenosis. Even though a CT scan can reveal these pertinent signs of lumbar spinal stenosis, it can sometimes give a cloudy image due to the shadowing of the tissue contrast. When this occurs, an intrathecal myelography contrast is conducted with the CT scan to fix the abnormal contrast. A CT scan can also reveal an increase in the cross sectional area of the L3 vertebrae, which ultimately decreases the cross sectional area of the spinal canal. As an increase {{in the size of the}} L3 vertebrae occurs, pressure builds up on the cauda equina, commonly causing pain in the lower back and lower extremities. Cauda equina compression can also be due to stenosis of L4-5 region as well. Even though the CT scan allows for intensive image studying, the fixed nature of the image collection process alone is not enough to reach a definitive diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis. The outcome of the CT scan can help compile physiological evidence that the patient has lumbar spinal stenosis, and that the patient may potentially benefit from a <b>laminotomy</b> to improve his or her quality of life.|$|E
50|$|An {{artificial}} facet replacement is a {{joint prosthesis}} intended to replace the natural facets and other posterior elements of the spine, restoring normal (or near-normal) motion while providing stabilization of spinal segments. It is typically used {{as an adjunct to}} laminectomy, <b>laminotomy,</b> neural decompression, and facetectomy, in lieu of standard lumbar fusion. The prosthesis is indicated for back and leg pain caused by central or lateral spinal stenosis, degenerative disease of the facets with instability, and grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis with objective evidence of neurological impairment.|$|E
50|$|Spinal fusion {{involves}} fusing two vertebrae together using a spacer, and {{is intended}} to prohibit movement at that particular segment. Screws are typically inserted {{to assure that the}} spacer is held in place. The most common lumbar spinal fusion occurs between L4 and L5. A lumbar spinal fusion may be recommended when non-surgical treatment options for severe degenerative disc disease are ineffective. A <b>laminotomy</b> would not be effective in this case, since this procedure is concerning a degenerated disc that needs to be removed in order to relive certain symptoms.|$|E
50|$|A discectomy (also called open discectomy) is the {{surgical}} removal of herniated disc material that presses on a nerve root or {{the spinal cord}}. The procedure involves removing the central portion of an intervertebral disc, the nucleus pulposus, which causes pain by stressing the spinal cord or radiating nerves. The traditional open discectomy, or Love's technique, was published by Ross and Love in 1971. Advances in options have produced effective alternatives to traditional discectomy procedures (e.g. microdiscectomy, endoscopic discectomy, and laser discectomy). In conjunction with the traditional discectomy, a <b>laminotomy</b> is often involved to permit access to the intervertebral disc. In this procedure, {{a small piece of}} bone (the lamina) is removed from the affected vertebra, allowing the surgeon to better see and access the area of disc herniation.|$|E
50|$|Since an MRI {{provides}} excellent imaging {{of blood}} vessels and tissues, it is recognized as the best type of imaging to observe signs associated with lumbar compression. The precise measurement of {{the diameter of the}} spinal canal is a particularly important component when determining the severity of the stenosis itself. High strength 3-Tesla MRI machines are being utilized due to the increased vascular imaging capabilities. Better resolution capacity allows for more detailed observations by the healthcare provider. The sharp contrast of the high power MRI outlines details in the vertebra that are critical when examining a patient with lumbar spinal stenosis who may need a <b>laminotomy.</b> MRI scanning post invasive surgery is used to see the quality of the surgery itself, yet the appropriate postoperative time elapsed before conducting an MRI is a debated topic.|$|E
50|$|Laminotomies {{are also}} {{performed}} {{to create a}} window into the spinal canal in order to fix a problem that is within the spinal canal. Laminotomies are frequently used as a way to surgically repair a spinal disc herniation at any level of the vertebral column (cervical, thoracic, lumbar). A herniated disc can compress spinal nerves and cause intense pain and impaired sensation. Removing a portion of the lamina allows physicians to be able to access and repair the herniated disc. Laminotomies may also be used to treat intraspinal lesions such as spinal tumor or problems with the blood vessels supplying the spinal cord. In any scenario where the inside of the spinal canal must be accessed or there is an increase in pressure in the spinal canal, <b>laminotomy</b> may be used to treat the disorder or alleviate symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertebral}} arch {{is composed}} of several anatomical features in addition to laminae that {{must be taken into}} account when performing a <b>laminotomy.</b> In the center of the vertebral arch is a bony projection called the spinous process. [...] The spinous process is located on the posterior or back side of the vertebra and serves as the attachment point for ligaments and muscles which support and stabilize the vertebral column. [...] Each vertebra has two lateral bony projections called the transverse processes that are located on either side of the vertebral arch. Transverse processes come into contact with the ribs and serve as attachment points for muscles and ligaments that stabilize the vertebral column. The lamina is the segment of bone that connects the spinous process to the transverse process. Each vertebra has two lamina, one on each side of the spinous process.|$|E
50|$|Other than static imaging processes, a CT scan {{can also}} be used for observing changes in spinal canal {{features}} before and after a <b>laminotomy.</b> One of the main signs of lumbar spinal stenosis is the thickening of the ligamentum flavum, causing it to expand towards the spinal canal. When observing the cross sectional area of the spinal canal of a human cadaver, {{it was found that the}} area had decreased due to ligamentum flavum thickening. The ligamentum flavum did not appear to alter the dynamic alterations in the dimensions of the spinal cord. Even after the intervertebral disc was removed, the ligamentum flavum did not appear to be a factor in the change in the dimensions of the spinal canal. By understanding the magnitude of the role that ligamentum flavum hypertrophy plays in lumbar sacral stenosis, the necessity of an invasive lumbar spinal procedure can be accurately measured.|$|E
50|$|The lamina is a {{posterior}} arch of the vertebral bone lying {{between the}} spinous process (which juts {{out in the}} middle) and the more lateral pedicles and the transverse processes of each vertebra. The pair of laminae, along with the spinous process, make up the posterior wall of the bony spinal canal. Although the literal meaning of laminectomy is 'excision of the lamina', a conventional laminectomy in neurosurgery and orthopedics involves excision of the posterior spinal ligament and {{some or all of}} the spinous process. Removal of these structures with an open technique requires disconnecting the many muscles of the back attached to them. A laminectomy performed as a minimal spinal surgery procedure is a tissue-preserving surgery that leaves more of the muscle intact and spares the spinal process. Another procedure, called the <b>laminotomy,</b> is the removal of a mid-portion of one lamina and may be done either with a conventional open technique or in a minimalistic fashion with the use of tubular retractors and endoscopes.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{effectiveness}} of techniques of posterior decompression that limit the extent of bony decompression or to avoid removal of posterior midline structures of the lumbar spine versus conventional facet-preserving laminectomy {{for the treatment of}} patients with degenerative lumbar stenosis. Methods: A comprehensive electronic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the clinical trials registries ClinicalTrials. gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform was conducted for relevant literature up to June 2014. Results: A total of four high-quality RCTs and six low-quality RCTs met the search criteria of this review. These studies included a total of 733 participants. Three different techniques that avoid removal of posterior midline structures are compared to conventional laminectomy; unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> for bilateral decompression, bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> and split-spinous process <b>laminotomy.</b> Evidence of low or very low quality suggests that different techniques of posterior decompression and conventional laminectomy have similar effects on functional disability and leg pain. Only perceived recovery at final follow-up was better in patients that underwent bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> compared with conventional laminectomy. Unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> for bilateral decompression and bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> resulted in numerically fewer cases of iatrogenic instability, although in both cases, the incidence of instability was low. The difference in severity of postoperative low back pain following bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> and split-spinous process <b>laminotomy</b> was significantly less, but was too small to be clinically important. We found no evidence to show that the incidence of complications, length of the procedure, length of hospital stay and postoperative walking distance differed between techniques of posterior decompression. Conclusion: The evidence provided by this systematic review for the effects of unilateral <b>laminotomy</b> for bilateral decompression, bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> and split-spinous process <b>laminotomy</b> compared with conventional laminectomy on functional disability, perceived recovery and leg pain is of low or very low quality. Therefore, further research is necessary to establish whether these techniques provide a safe and effective alternative for conventional laminectomy. Proposed advantages of these techniques regarding the incidence of iatrogenic instability and postoperative back pain are plausible, but definitive conclusions are limited by poor methodology and poor reporting of outcome measures among included studies.

40|$|We {{assigned}} 67 {{patients with}} central lumbar stenosis alternately to either multiple <b>laminotomy</b> or total laminectomy. The protocol, however, allowed multiple <b>laminotomy</b> {{to be changed}} to total laminectomy if {{it was thought that}} the former procedure might not give adequate neural decompression. There were therefore three treatment groups: group I consisting of 26 patients submitted to multiple laminotomy; group II, 9 patients scheduled for <b>laminotomy</b> but submitted to laminectomy; and group III, 32 patients scheduled for, and submitted to, laminectomy. The mean follow-up was 3. 7 years. Bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> at two or three levels required a longer mean operating time than total laminectomy at an equal number of levels. The mean blood loss at surgery and the clinical results did not differ in the three groups. The mean subjective improvement score for low back pain was higher in group I {{but there was also a}} higher incidence of neural complications in this group. No patient in group I had postoperative vertebral instability, whereas this occurred in three patients in groups II and III, who had lumbar scoliosis or degenerative spondylolisthesis preoperatively. Multiple <b>laminotomy</b> is recommended for all patients with developmental stenosis and for those with mild to moderate degenerative stenosis or degenerative spondylolisthesis. Total laminectomy is to be preferred for patients with severe degenerative stenosis or marked degenerative spondylolisthesis...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} clinical outcome of interlaminar discectomy in patients suffering with degenerated lumbar disc lesions. We made a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients who underwent limited lumbar discectomy. The clinico-radiological parameters, type of surgery performed and the post-operative follow up were assessed. We found that interlaminar discectomy without <b>laminotomy</b> was adequate in 33 cases (66 %). Most patients requiring <b>laminotomy</b> (17 cases - 34 %) for discectomy had associated lumbar canal stenosis, herniation at proximal levels (L 3 - 4) and/or sacralization of L 5 vertebra. Selective foraminotomy in addition to discectomy was performed in 28 cases (56 %). The post-operative results were good in 43 (86 %fair in 6 (12 %) and poor subjective in 1 case (2 %). No patient was classified as poor objective. In conclusion, interlaminar discectomy without <b>laminotomy</b> is a safe, effective and reliable surgical technique for treating properly selected patients with herniated lumbar disc at L 4 - 5 and L 5 -S 1 levels...|$|E
40|$|Multilevel laminectomy in {{children}} {{has a significant}} rate of postoperative spinal deformity. To decrease the incidence of this complication, the use of osteoplastic <b>laminotomy</b> is advocated to minimise the risk of spinal deformity by preserving the normal architecture of the spine. In this retrospective study, a 10 -year series of a paediatric population undergoing multilevel osteoplastic <b>laminotomy</b> is reviewed to determine the incidence, especially in contrast to laminectomies, and to identify factors that affect the occurrence of spinal column deformity. Seventy patients (mean age 4. 2  years) underwent multilevel osteoplastic <b>laminotomy</b> for congenital anomalies or removal of spinal tumours. All patients had a clinical and radiographic examination preoperatively, 12  months postoperatively and at follow-up. Mean follow-up was 5. 3  years (range 3 – 12. 6  years). Nineteen patients (27 %) had a new or progressive spinal deformity. There was an increased incidence in patients who had surgery for spinal tumours (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), surgery of the cervical spine (P[*]<[*] 0. 01), and who had more than five levels of the spine included (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). A {{review of the literature}} on children with multilevel laminectomy (n[*]=[*] 330), the incidence of spinal deformity found a significantly higher (46 %) compared to our study group. This study demonstrates that osteoplastic <b>laminotomy</b> was found to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of spinal deformities after spinal-canal surgery for spinal-cord tumours or congenital anomalies {{in children}} and adolescents. The choice of an anatomical reconstructive surgical technique such as osteoplastic <b>laminotomy</b> seems to be essential to minimise secondary problems due to the surgical technique itself.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the various symptomatic complications following decompressive bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> for treating lumbar spinal stenosis. Methods: Out of 878 patients who underwent decompressive <b>laminotomy</b> from 2006 through 2008, 178 patients who were able to be followed for a minimum of 24 months were included in this study. The mean age at the time of surgery was 64. 4 years (range, 38 - 79), and the average follow-up period was 32. 7 months. The development of symptomatic complications was observed using simple radiographs and MR imaging during the follow-up period. Imaging and clinical compli- cations were focused on postoperative spondylolisthesis, disc herniation, and facet cysts, and were analyzed according to develop-menttime, the degree of symptom, and their course. Results: Postoperative simple radiographs revealed that eight out of 178 patients (4. 4 %) had developed symptomatic spondy-lolisthesis and six required an interbody fusion procedure. Five patients with disc herniation (2. 8 %) at the level of the decom-pressive bilateral <b>laminotomy</b> site underwent another operation within 24 months after the first surgery. In two patients, disc herniations developed within 1 month after surgery. Three (1. 7 %) out of 178 patients showed facet cysts but all symptoms were relieved by conservative treatment.
