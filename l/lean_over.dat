5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} homeowners to attach wall-mounted mailboxes {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of mail slots. Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> to deposit the mail. They also allowed the homeowner to keep outgoing mail dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.|$|E
25|$|Conservation is {{not always}} a full {{explanation}} for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its precession axis. Also, in any planetary system, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.|$|E

25|$|After Fatboy {{breaks a}} tree in Albert Square, Leon helps to replace it but is horrified to {{discover}} the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after a prolonged silence, causing Leon to walk out. She finds him to apologise, as she had not realised the discovery had affected him badly. He then recalls the day his mother {{died in a car}} crash when it took an hour for firemen to cut him free and he was unable to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> to close his mother's eyes. He admits to Zsa Zsa that he sometimes feels alone. He fails most of his GCSE exams. Months later he flirts with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber) in the local bookmaker's and agree to meet later. He obtains two tickets to a music festival in France and plans to take Zsa Zsa, but he reveals to Fatboy that he slept with Glenda, who tells Mercy, who then tells Zsa Zsa. Zsa Zsa asks Leon if he has seen anyone else but he says no. Zsa Zsa then seduces Leon in Fatboy's van before throwing him out in his underwear and leaving Walford for France. Leon decides that as his bags are packed he will go to France anyway, hinting that he will follow Zsa Zsa to apologise and resume their relationship. Before leaving, he tells Fatboy that he will always be his best friend and they continue to stay in touch.|$|E
500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, Go Man Go {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the stall door waiting for people to come along and tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". Go Man Go passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in Go Man Go to Briarwood Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. Go Man Go died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. His crown-shaped granite headstone is engraved: [...] "Go Man Go, The King." ...|$|E
500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only {{to see what she}} senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|E

500|$|Russian {{psychiatrist}} Fedor Kondratev {{not only}} denied accusations {{that he was}} ever personally engaged in Soviet abuses of psychiatry; he stated publicly that the very conception {{of the existence of}} Soviet-era [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] was nothing more than: [...] "the fantasy [...] of the very same people who are now defending totalitarian sects. This is slander, which was [...] used for anti-Soviet ends, but is now being used for anti-Russian ends." [...] He says that there were attempts to use of psychiatry for political purposes but there was no mass psychiatric terror, he calls allegations about the terror a propagandistic weapon of activists of the Cold War. As Alexander Podrabinek writes, psychiatrists of punitive conscription and namely Kondratev are relatively indifferent to the public's indignation over illegal use of psychiatry both in Soviet times and now, they do not notice this public, allowing themselves to ignore any unprofessional opinion. In response to the article by Podrabinek, Kondratev instituted a suit against Podrabinek under Russian Civil Code Article 152 on protecting one's honor, dignity and business reputation. According to Valery Krasnov and Isaak Gurovich, official representatives of psychiatry involved in its political abuse never acknowledged the groundlessness of their diagnostics and actions. The absence of the acknowledgement and the absence of an analysis of made errors cast a shadow upon all psychiatrists in the USSR and, especially, in Russia. As Russian-American historian Georgi Chernyavsky writes, {{after the fall of the}} communist regime, no matter how some psychiatrists <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> backwards, foaming at the mouth to this day when stating that they were slandered, that they did not give dissidents diagnoses-sentences, or that, at least, these cases were isolated and not at all related to their personal activities, no matter how the doctors, if one may call them so, try to rebut hundreds if not thousands of real facts, it is undoable.|$|E

[...] In the upper right a woman carries a large furoshiki bundle full of the courtesans' and geishas' bedclothes. [...] Several women in a back room sit playing hand games. [...] The women's kimonos tend to be of subdued colours such as indigo or brown, in {{contrast}} with the bright, flashy colours of the other two paintings.|$|E

2500|$|Swa {{and his two}} mahouts unsuccessfully {{tried to}} fight off the enraged {{elephant}} but their elephant was pushed out of position into the open view of the enemy. Both elephants immediately came under Siamese fire, and Swa and the front mahout were felled by a mortar round. The lone survivor, the middle mahout named Tuyin Bala (...) , tried to hide Swa's death by having the crown prince's body <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> his back while he managed to drive his elephant {{to the back of}} the lines. No one in Burmese or Siamese command knew of the death, and the battle went on. The battle ended with the Siamese army retreating to Ayutthaya. After the battle, the Burmese command now led by Thado Dhamma Yaza III of Prome realized the death, and they collectively decided to retreat, rather than to attack the city.|$|E
2500|$|The series follows life on [...] "the vast Bering Sea" [...] aboard various crab {{fishing boats}} during {{two of the}} crab fishing seasons, the October king crab season and the January opilio crab (C. opilio; often {{referred}} to as [...] "snow crab" [...] or [...] "opies") season. The show emphasizes the dangers on deck to the fishermen (and the Discovery Channel camera crews recording their work) as crews duck heavy crab pots swinging into position, maneuver hundreds of pounds of crab across a deck strewn with hazards (i. e., holding tank hatches, uneven surfaces, maintenance access plates, wet decks), and <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the rails to position pots for launch or retrieval as galeforce winds and high waves constantly lash the deck. The series also documents the dangers of being on a boat in the Bering Sea, in the midst of some of the coldest and stormiest waters on earth, where even a minor problem may become complex or even catastrophic with the nearest port often hundreds of miles away.|$|E
2500|$|A pair of [...] long {{self-acting}} mules with 1320 spindles {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E
