30|$|Credit fraud {{problems}} {{stem from}} information asymmetries among economic agents (Petersen and Rajan 2002); therefore, social credit evaluates the economic activities of various economic agents such as countries (or governments), corporations, and {{individuals and their}} credit variations in online markets (i.e., network credit). Credit risk discloses the likelihood of target agents reneging on promises (in terms of contracts). Particularly, when investing in government debt or <b>loans,</b> <b>country</b> (or government) credit {{should be considered a}} primary risk factor, namely, country risk represents the debt paying capability of the government. Similarly, when trading in commodity markets and investing in financial markets, the ability of the target corporations or individuals to meet debt obligations should be carefully estimated by credit scoring or rating using information about history records, current economic state, and other attributes (Huang et al. 2004; Huang et al. 2006). For example, commercial banks make financial loan decisions and issue credit cards to customers dependent on corporate (or individual) credit ratings or credit scores. Moreover, the rapid development of online markets has facilitated economic activity through networks, and the new concept of network credit has aroused increasingly wide interest concerning corresponding participant credit risk evaluation based on vast amounts of online historic data (Xu and Zhang 2009).|$|R
