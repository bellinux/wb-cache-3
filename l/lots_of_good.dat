500|$|The episode {{received}} highly positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called [...] "Broke" [...] a [...] "great, great" [...] episode, {{although he}} said he wished the Michael Scott Paper Company arc could have lasted longer. Sepinwall praised touches such as the Korean women who were constantly getting into the sales van, and Michael's moment of nervousness on the elevator, and said the ending when Michael came through was particularly satisfying. Will Leitch of New York magazine described [...] "Broke" [...] as [...] "a rousing, exuberant episode that continues one of The Offices best runs in history". Leitch said the negotiations during {{the latter half of}} the episode had genuine tension, and that all the storylines of the Michael Scott Paper Company arc were wrapped up perfectly. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was strong enough that it could have served as the season finale. He said the episode had <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> throw-away moments, like Charles brown-nosing to David and realizing Dwight is eccentric, as well as several clever twists, like Jim's actions in tricking Dwight and helping the Michael Scott Paper Company get bought out. Eric Rezsnyak of the City Newspaper said the episode was a strong finale to the Michael Scott Paper Company arc, which was [...] "probably the best thing to happen to the show in the last two seasons". Rezsnyak praised Michael's impressive actions in the episode and said he was curious to see how Michael's relationship with several of the supporting characters would be recast as a result of this episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] {{garnered}} {{very positive}} reviews from most music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine for Allmusic was complimentary of the pop song, writing {{that it is}} [...] "giddy" [...] and [...] "delirious". Chris Younie for 4Music wrote that Aguilera is [...] "ramping up the romance and sexual energy" [...] on [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love", which will make the listener {{need to take a}} cold shower. He also wrote that the listener should expect to hear [...] "lots of 'oooh', 'aah', and 'la la la' in her usual Mariah Carey-shrilling manner." [...] Sam Hine for Popjustice described the song as [...] "a welcome blast of upbeat pop following the rather serious start to the album. There are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> [...] "oooh" [...] "lalala" [...] hooky bits that all fit together and make a for an enjoyable listen." [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard described it as the [...] "standout song on Lotus" [...] which sees her [...] "at her most relaxed and playful." [...] He also noted that Secon's production takes [...] "precedence" [...] on the song. Annie Zaleski for The A.V. Club called it a [...] "dancehall-tinged, vibrant party jam," [...] while Sarah Rodman for The Boston Globe named it a [...] "kooky horn-and-yodel fest". Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "care-free" [...] and [...] "a bit cheeky." [...] Sarah Godfrey for The Washington Post praised Aguilera for sounding more like herself on the [...] "frenzied" [...] track. Jim Farber for Daily News wrote that [...] "Red Hot Kinda Love" [...] contains [...] "a can't-miss gimmick of a chorus". He also wrote that Aguilera [...] "hits the clubs in horny revenge." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{thought it was a}} [...] "confident finale" [...] to the fifth season, which [...] "had seen the series become progressively more surreal and self-aware." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote that he thought the episode ended the season with a [...] "high note", and that Homer’s insensitive gossiping about his relationship [...] "presents <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> bits. It completes this excellent year well." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was [...] "This is a place of learning, not a house of hearing about things!", which Homer tells his class after they demand him to reveal more secrets about him and Marge. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A−, and commented that episodes focusing on the relationship between Homer and Marge can [...] "never fail", and there are [...] "numerous opportunities for some classic Homer-isms" [...] in the episode. Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5. One-time Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] his fifth favorite episode of the show, and commented that Homer's line to Marge, [...] "I know now what I can offer you that no one else can. Complete and utter dependence," [...] is [...] "so sweet, because he's right!" [...] It was placed at number seven on MSNBCs top ten The Simpsons episodes list. They felt the episode embodied Homer's qualities of being [...] "stupid, good-natured and mildly pathetic, [...] from his conversations with his brain [...] to his final proclamation that the one thing he can give Marge that no one else can is 'complete and utter dependence'." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Kornheiser's {{first game}} on Monday Night Football, Paul Farhi wrote in The Washington Post that Kornheiser had {{emphasized}} the obvious, played third fiddle, and was reminiscent of Dennis Miller [...] "in a bad way." [...] Kornheiser responded {{during an interview}} on The Dan Patrick Show on August 15, 2006, saying that Farhi was a [...] "two-bit weasel slug" [...] and his own newspaper had back-stabbed him. His response generated more criticism from The Washington Post and other media outlets. Other criticism has come from Toronto Argonauts play-by-play commentator Mike Hogan, who said, [...] "The thing that really bothers me is that Kornheiser doesn't seem to know his place. If you're there for comic relief, that's one thing. But for God's sake, leave the football analysis to guys who actually played the game." [...] Former NFL offensive lineman Mike Schad also criticized Kornheiser, saying that [...] "when people watch a game, they want to learn something. I don't need a guy who's sarcastic or trying to be funny. I love listening to Ron Jaworski on Monday Nights. He played the game and has <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> insight and Kornheiser just gets in his way." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
