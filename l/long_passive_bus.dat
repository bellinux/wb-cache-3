40|$|This paper revisits the categorial {{status of}} the Mandarin passive marker bei and the derivational {{relationship}} between long and short bei passives. In regard to its categorial status, {{there have been three}} major analyses: bei is a preposition, or is a verb, or it has the dual status of being both a verb and a preposition. This paper reviews these views, especially the latter two, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses. On this basis, it makes three claims. (a) Bei is a verb, which is supported by the new evidence from reflexive ziji tests, Chinese fragmentary constructions, and the chameleonic properties of the bei passive alternating between control and raising structures. (b) As for the structures of the <b>long</b> and short <b>passives,</b> by reviewing the uniform and non-uniform approaches, we provide the third approach, arguing that <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> can be further divided into local <b>long</b> and long-distance <b>passives.</b> The local <b>long</b> <b>passive</b> and its corresponding short form may be derivationally related, while the long-distance passive does not have a short form.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} there at {{two types of}} Marshallese (Austronesian, Oceanic, Micronesian) infinitival constructions.

In {{the second type of}} infinitival construction, which include sentences with matrix verbs such as jino 2 ̆ 7 start, 2 ̆ 7 aikuj 2 ̆ 7 need 2 ̆ 7 and maron 2 ̆ 6 #; 2 ̆ 7 be able, 2 ̆ 7 in is not obligatory, <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> are possible, and the subject may not follow the matrix verb, provided that in is present.

Following Cinque (2006) and Wurmbrand (2001), I argue that restructuring verbs are the heads of a functional projection (FP) rather than the heads of VPs and therefore cannot take either internal or external arguments, while the embedded verb is head of a VP. This analysis is supported by the fact that, in Marshallese sentences of the second class, the matrix verb does not impose any selection restrictions on the subject. In addition, this analysis also explains why <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> are possible in the second type of sentence and why post matrix verbal subjects are not possible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} visual {{experience}} is usually investigated through active (task dependent) training in a discrimination task. In contrast, the current work explored the psychophysical and electrophysiological correlates of passive (task independent) visual experience in texture segmentation {{by using an}} inattentional blindness-like paradigm (Mack et al., 1992). The psychophysical and electrophysiological responses to a segmented line-texture bar, with texture elements oriented either congruently (parallel) or noncongruently (orthogonal) to bar orientation, were collected after both short and <b>long</b> <b>passive</b> experience, with the texture presented on the background while subjects performed a primary task. Subjects {{were not able to}} distinguish the orientation of the bar (psychophysical results) after either short or <b>long</b> <b>passive</b> experience. However, the short experience produced an electrophysiological correlate of texture segmentation (N 150), and the amplitude of this component was greater for the parallel bar, demonstrating that it reflected not simply local orientation discontinuities but also texture boundary–surface orientation congruency. This configurational effect in texture segmentation, which occurred without awareness during passive viewing, disappeared when the subjects had previously discriminated the orientation of the bar and when experience was lengthened, probably as a consequence of adaptation. Our study provides the first ERP evidence that boundary–surface relations are available during short passive visual experiences of very salient texture images and are suppressed by long experience, probably because of adaptation...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to defend the {{complementation}} approach to Chinese passives and discuss its consequences. Four interesting issues related to Chinese passives ai e examined. (a) the categorial status of bei in Chinese passives (b) the possibility of having an empty agent argument, (c) sub-categorization of passive verbs and their grammatical status, and (d) the function of gei in passive and nonpassive sentences. The findings of this paper are as follows. First of all, it is argued that bei is not a preposition in Chinese <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> and is not a passive morpheme in short passives. Second, assuming that the complementation approach is on the right trade, it is argued that Chinese <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> are ECM structures. Hence, the embedded agent argument can be neither pro nor PRO. The agent argument cannot be a trace either, because movement will be blocked by a null operator adjoined to the embedded clause. Third, after comparing several passive verbs in Mandarin and Cantonese, it is observed that only the passive verbal elements that are less lexical, more functional may enter short passives. Fourth, it is argued that preverbal gel is a marker that marks affectedness, which has nothing to do with passivization. The occurrence of gel in various apparently unrelated contexts is explained under a unified account. Department of Mechanical EngineeringDepartment of Chinese and Bilingual Studie...|$|R

In this work, we have analyzed from theoretical perspective a new proposed microring resonator structure based on the wafer-bonding technique which implies the vertical coupling between the <b>passive</b> <b>bus</b> waveguide and the active ring resonator. We have investigated the possibility to obtain the monomode operation of the active ring waveguide for certain ring radius values by the selective attenuations of the higher order modes and the obtaining of the desired coupling efficiency by varying the technological parameters like the layers thickness, etching depth, bus waveguide width and the offset (misalignment between the ring and the bus waveguide). Depending on the fabrication method, the misalignment between the ring resonator and the bus waveguide may vary within a significant range. Therefore, we considered a much wider bus waveguide in the coupling region in order to minimise the effects of misalignment...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{defining}} properties of Marshallese (Austronesian, Oceanic, Micronesian) <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> {{is that they}} allow one of two prepositions in what roughly corresponds to English by phrases. These prepositions are ippa:n and in. Although the semantics of these two prepositions appears to be identical in passives (i. e. both introduce an agent phrase), there are syntactic differences between sentences containing these prepositions, a fact which leads Willson (2008) to conclude that ippa:n and the agent phrase form a constituent, while in and the agent phrase do not. This conclusion presents {{a problem for the}} traditional analysis of passives because the traditional analysis offers no explanation as to why one preposition+agent string is a constituent but the other is not. In order to explain the differences in the syntax of these strings, I propose an analysis of passives reminiscent of Collins’ (2005) smuggling approach to English passives and argue (1) that in, like the English by, is the head of a Voice projection and (2) that the agent DP in passive sentences containing in is merged as the specifier of vP and receives an agent theta role from the verb. A similar analysis cannot be proposed for sentences containing ippa:n, however, as such an analysis would predict that ippān and the agent are not a constituent. Instead, I argue that ippa:n+agent strings are adjunct prepositional phrases, a fact that can explain why these strings can appear in nonpassive sentences, as well as the constituency differences between <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> containing in and those containing ippa:n...|$|R

I propose treating bei-passives as a type of long-distance dependency (LDD) construction analogous to English tough-type sentences, and discuss the merits of this analysis. Recent research on the topic has generally concluded that “short” and “long” passives have separate derivations (Huang, Li, & Li 2009). Since this account can be challenged upon grounds of desired theoretical simplicity and explanatory adequacy, one desired outcome is a uniform derivation of bei-sentences. The LDD analysis proposed here is able to account for the defining properties of long bei-passives, including unbounded dependencies and resumptive pronouns. I also argue that the unique control structure of “adversative passives” can be explained naturally by an LDD structure. However, certain differences between short <b>passives</b> and <b>long</b> <b>passives</b> cannot be completely accounted for under the present account, and should encourage further inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Classes of {{performance}} measures {{expressed in terms}} of H_ 2 -norms have been recently introduced to quantify the response of coupled dynamical systems to external perturbations. For the specific case of electric power networks, these measures quantify for instance the primary effort control to restore synchrony, the amount of additional power that is ohmically dissipated during the transient following the perturbation or, more conceptually, the coherence of the synchronous state. So far, investigations of these performance measures have been restricted to nodal perturbations. Here, we go beyond earlier works and consider the equally important, but so far neglected case of line perturbations. We consider a network-reduced power system, where a Kron reduction has eliminated passive buses. Identifying the effect that a line fault in the physical network has on the Kron-reduced network, we find that performance metrics depend on whether the faulted line connects two passive, two active buses or one active to one <b>passive</b> <b>bus.</b> In all cases, performance metrics depend quadratically on the original load on the faulted line times a topology dependent factor. Our theoretical formalism being restricted to Dirac-δ perturbations, we investigate numerically the validity of our results for finite-time line faults.
