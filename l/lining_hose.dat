40|$|Primary human ovarian surface {{epithelial}} (HOSE) {{cells were}} immortalized by a retroviral vector (LXSN- 16 E 6 E 7) expressing HPV-E 6 E 7 open reading frames (ORF). Immortalizations of primary ovarian epithelial cells were achieved {{in three of}} three attempts. Detailed analysis {{was carried out in}} one <b>line,</b> <b>HOSE</b> 6 - 3, {{selected on the basis of}} its epithelial morphology. The immortalized <b>line</b> (<b>HOSE</b> 6 - 3) was nontumorigenic in nude mice when examined at subculture number 20. Cytogenetic analysis confirmed its human origin and detailed karyotypic analysis revealed a mixed karyotype made up of about 60 % of diploid and 40 % of near-tetraploid cells. Clonal chromosomal aberration was observed in a subpopulation of cells involving a ring chromosome number 9. Immunofluorescence and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of vimentin and several species of cytokeratin (K 7, K 8, K 18, K 19). The profile of the cytoskeletal filaments of HOSE 6 - 3 cells is largely identical with that of normal ovarian epithelial cells before immortalization. The immortalized ovarian epithelial cells have a lower sensitivity to TGF-β 1 inhibition compared to normal ovarian epithelial cells. The immortalized <b>line,</b> <b>HOSE</b> 6 - 3, has altered growth properties including a higher proliferation rate, plating efficiency, and saturation density. The establishment of a continuous line of human ovarian epithelial cells may provide an in vitro model for study of carcinogenesis in human ovarian cancers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Ovarian adenocarcinomas {{develop as}} the result of {{multiple}} genetic and epigenetic changes in the precursor ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells which result in a malignant phenotype. We investigated changes in gene expression in ovarian adenocarcinoma using a cDNA array containing 588 known human genes. We found that intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) was expressed at lower levels in the ovarian tumour cell lines OAW 42, PEO 1 and JAM than in the immortalised human ovarian surface epithelial cell <b>line</b> <b>HOSE</b> 17. 1. Further investigation revealed ICAM- 1 was expressed in the surface epithelium of normal ovaries and both mRNA and protein expression levels were reduced in the majority of ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines and primary tumours. ICAM- 1 expression was increased in 8 / 8 cell lines treated with the de novo methyltransferase inhibitor 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine, indicating that methylation of CpG islands {{may play a role in}} the down-regulation of its expression in primary tumours. There was a significant association between patients whose tumours expressed ICAM- 1 and survival (P= 0. 03), suggesting that expression levels of ICAM- 1 may have clinical relevance. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|The SFRP 1 gene on {{chromosome}} 8 p 11. 2 encodes a Wnt signaling antagonist, and {{was recently}} demonstrated to {{be a new}} tumor suppressor that is inactivated by promoter methylation in human colon cancers. Here, we analyzed promoter methylation of the SFRP 1 gene in human ovarian cancers, in which loss of heterozygosity in 8 p is frequently observed and involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway has been suggested. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis showed that four of 13 ovarian cancer cell lines and two of 17 primary ovarian cancers had methylated SFRP 1, while an immortalized ovarian epithelial cell <b>line,</b> <b>HOSE,</b> and seven ovarian endometrial cyst samples did not. In the four ovarian cancer cell lines with the methylation, SFRP 1 was not expressed at all as determined by quantitative RT-PCR analysis. A cell line with SFRP 1 methylation, MCAS, was treated with a demethylating agent, 5 -aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine, and demethylation of the promoter and re-expression of SFRP 1 were observed. These results show that SFRP 1 is inactivated by promoter methylation in human ovarian cancers, as well as colon cancers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a serine {{threonine}} kinase, overexpression {{of which}} promotes tumour growth and invasion through {{deregulation of the}} cell cycle. This study demonstrates the relative expression of ILK in normal, benign, low-grade, and high-grade (borderline, grade I/II, and grade III) ovarian tumours of serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell types {{in order to assess}} its potential as a marker for epithelial ovarian cancer progression. Seventy-three specimens including ten normal, ten benign, 14 borderline, 17 grade I/II, and 22 grade III were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactive ILK was not detectable in normal ovarian surface epithelium. All 53 carcinomas studied were positive and the staining intensity correlated significantly with the grade of the tumour. Ovarian cancer cell lines had high expression of ILK, while immortalized normal ovarian surface epithelial cell <b>lines</b> (<b>HOSE)</b> showed low basal expression of ILK by western blotting. Peritoneal tumour fluid (PTF) upregulated ILK expression in ovarian cancer cell lines but had no effect on HOSE cells. PTF-induced up-regulation of ILK expression in ovarian cancer cell lines correlated with the activation of the downstream protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ILK expression increases with ovarian cancer progression and that soluble factors in PTF mediate sustained overexpression of ILK in ovarian cancer cells. Suppression of ILK expression may therefore represent a novel and an efficient mechanism for controlling ovarian tumour growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{events that}} drive the initiation and progression of ovarian adenocarcinoma {{are not well}} defined. We have investigated changes in gene expression in ovarian cancer cell lines compared to an immortalized human ovarian surface epithelial cell <b>line</b> (<b>HOSE)</b> using a cDNA array. We identified 17 genes that were under-expressed and 10 genes that were over-expressed in the cell lines compared to the HOSE cells. One of the genes under-expressed in the ovarian cancer cell lines, Id 3, a transcriptional inactivator, was selected for further investigation. Id 3 mRNA was expressed at reduced levels in 6 out of 9 ovarian cancer cell lines compared to the HOSE cells while at the protein level, all 7 ovarian cancer cell lines examined expressed the Id 3 protein at greatly reduced levels. Expression of Id 3 mRNA was also examined in primary ovarian tumours and was found in only 12 / 38 (32 %) cases. A search was conducted far mutations of Id 3 in primary ovarian cancers using single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Only one nucleotide substitution, present also in the corresponding constitutional DNA, was found in 94 ovarian tumours. Furthermore no association was found between LOH at 1 p 36 and lack of expression of Id 3. These data suggest that Id 3 is not the target of LOH at 1 p 36. (C) 2001 Cancer Research Campaign...|$|R

40|$|Epidemiological {{data have}} implicated the {{pituitary}} gonadotropin {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) as both {{a risk factor for}} and a protective agent against epithelial ovarian cancer. Yet, little is known about how this hormone could play such opposing roles in ovarian carcinogenesis. Complementary DNA microarrays containing 2400 named genes were used to examine FSH-induced gene expression changes in ovarian cancer (OC) and immortalized normal human ovarian surface epithelial (<b>HOSE)</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Two-way t-statistics analyses of array data identified two distinct sets of FSH-regulated genes in HOSE and in established OC cell lines established from patients (OVCA cell <b>lines).</b> Among the <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>lines,</b> FSH increased expression of 57 % of the 312 genes and downregulated 43 %. In contrast, FSH diminished expression of 92 % of the 177 genes in the OVCA cell lines. All but 18 of the genes affected by FSH in <b>HOSE</b> cell <b>lines</b> were different from those altered in OVCA cell lines. Among the 18 overlapping genes, nine genes exhibited the same direction of change following FSH challenge, while the other nine showed discordance in response between HOSE and OVCA cell lines. The FSH-induced differential expression of seven out of nine genes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Gene-specific antisense oligonuleotides (ODNs) were used to inhibit the expression of genes encoding GTPase activating protein (rap 1 GAP), neogenin, and restin in HOSE and OVCA cells. Antisense ODNs to neogenin and restin, but not an antisense ODN to rap 1 GAP, were effective in inhibiting OVCA cell growth, diminishing proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression, and increasing caspase 3 activities. Furthermore, the ODN to rap 1 GAP was further shown to be ineffective in altering migration properties of OVCA cell <b>lines.</b> <b>HOSE</b> cell proliferation was not affected by treatment with any of the antisense ODNs. In summary, gene profiling data reveal {{for the first time that}} FSH may exert different biological actions on OVCA cells than on HOSE cells, by differential regulation of a set of putative oncogenes/tumor suppressors. Specifically, neogenin and restin were found to exhibit proproliferation/survival action on OC cells...|$|R
