5|$|United States <b>Life-Saving</b> Service District 9 {{opened a}} <b>life-saving</b> station at Presque Isle in 1876. William Clark was the keeper from 1877 until he drowned in 1891. He was succeeded by Andrew Jansen, {{who was the}} keeper until 1914. When the <b>Life-Saving</b> Service and the Revenue Cutter Service merged in 1915 to become the United States Coast Guard, LSS Presque Isle, also called the Erie <b>life-saving</b> station, became Coast Guard Station #236. The station, still in operation, is {{assigned}} to the Ninth District of the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|The first Hispanic-American {{to command}} a Coast Guard vessel (USRCS) was Joseph Ximenez, who took {{command of the}} Carysfort Reef Lightship in Florida in 1843. He was not, however, the first Hispanic officer. That {{distinction}} belongs to Domingo Castrano, who is listed by the United States Revenue Cutter Service Register as having served aboard USRC Grant in 1872, as an engineering officer. The first known Hispanics to have served in the U.S. <b>Life-Saving</b> Service were Surfmen Telesford Pena and Ramon Delgado who, in 1897, served at the Brazos <b>Life-Saving</b> Station in Texas.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Gianna Chien (aged 14) {{presented}} {{to more than}} 8,000 doctors at the Heart Rhythm Society meeting that Apple iPad 2 can, in some cases, interfere with <b>life-saving</b> heart devices (pace maker) because of the magnets inside. Apple's webpage has advised pacemaker users to keep iPads at least 6-inches away from the pacemaker.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, Conroy fell {{seriously ill}} with a {{suspected}} vascular aneurysm. He successfully {{recovered from the}} illness after undergoing a <b>life-saving</b> emergency operation that had a survival rate of just 10%. Whilst in hospital {{he had been given}} the last rites twice. He published his autobiography, You Don't Remember Me Do You?, in August 2014.|$|E
5|$|In the State of the Union {{address in}} January 2003, Bush {{outlined}} a five-year strategy for global emergency AIDS relief, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.

5|$|After touring Australia {{with the}} British Isles {{team for the}} second time in 1904, he settled in Sydney. A keen all-round sportsman he coached not only rugby but also hockey, was {{vice-president}} of the Sydney Swimming Club, and training senior military cadets for surf <b>life-saving</b> examinations. He also joined the Australian Militia, and by 1914 had reached the rank of captain and had passed the promotion exams for the rank of major.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) {{published}} a paper describing {{the first successful}} elective human tracheotomy to be performed {{for the purpose of}} administration of general anesthesia. In 1888, Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837–1892) {{published a}} book discussing the indications for tracheotomy. In the early 20th century, tracheotomy became a <b>life-saving</b> treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation. In 1909, Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) described a technique for tracheotomy that is used to this day.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, {{guests at}} the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the United States <b>Life-Saving</b> Service for the Norwegian bark Dictator. The ship's figurehead, which washed {{up on the beach}} several days later, was erected as a {{monument}} to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching Norwegian Lady Monuments, sculpted by Ørnulf Bast and installed in Virginia Beach and Moss, Norway.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone <b>life-saving</b> ring {{that appeared to}} have come from Fitzgerald. It bore markings different from those of rings found at the wreck site, and was thought to be a hoax. Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, but had been lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E
5|$|Set in the mid-2060s, Thunderbirds is a {{follow-up}} to the earlier Supermarionation productions Four Feather Falls, Supercar, Fireball XL5 and Stingray. It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a <b>life-saving</b> organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the Thunderbirds and launched from IR's secret base in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the Thunderbird machines.|$|E
5|$|Six {{people were}} killed in the Dominican Republic and another {{fourteen}} in Haiti. Three were killed in Jamaica, which also suffered US$310million of damage—the heaviest in the Caribbean. The most severe damage there was to the agricultural sector; nearly the entire banana crop was destroyed. Global aid organizations contributed to the subsequent recovery effort; immediate <b>life-saving</b> needs were met within days, but the damage to Jamaica's infrastructure and economy took much longer to repair. With loans and grants from the local government, the European Union, and the United Nations, normality was restored by the following summer.|$|E
5|$|Skagen Town and Regional Museum (Skagen By- og Egnsmuseum), {{an open-air}} museum, was opened {{by the local}} {{population}} in 1927. In 1938 it {{was moved to the}} sand dunes of Vesterby. The museum brings together examples of fishermen's cottages and the homes of less fortunate inhabitants of Skagen {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. There is an old <b>life-saving</b> station, a smithy, an old Dutch windmill, pictures of ships in distress and related nautical artefacts as well as a collection of items illustrating the town's history over various periods.|$|E
5|$|The United States Coast Guard {{was formed}} in 1915 when its {{predecessors}} – the United States <b>Life-Saving</b> Service and the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which was established in 1790 by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton as an armed maritime law enforcement service – were merged. According to Dr. William H. Thiesen, Ph.D., Atlantic Area Historian of the United States Coast Guard, the following events involving Hispanics occurred {{in the early years}} of the Coast Guard its predecessor services.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a college student}} while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica investigates when two masked men rob a Halloween party and steal Veronica's necklace from Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) helps Dean O'Dell (Ed Begley, Jr.) find the biological father of his stepson, the only person who can give the stepson a <b>life-saving</b> bone marrow transplant.|$|E
5|$|Hispanics in the United States Coast Guard {{can trace}} their {{tradition}} {{of service to}} the early 19th century, when they initially performed duties at light house stations as keepers and assistant keepers in its predecessor services (the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States <b>Life-Saving</b> Service). Hispanic is an ethnic term employed to categorize any citizen or resident of the United States, of any racial background, of any country, and of any religion, who has at least one ancestor from the people of Spain or is of non-Hispanic origin, but has an ancestor from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central or South America, or some other Hispanic origin. The three largest Hispanic groups in the United States are the Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the {{schooner}} Isaiah K. Stetsen sank off {{the coast}} of Massachusetts during a storm. Mess Attendant First Class Arthur J. Flores and Seaman John E. Gomez, assigned to USRC Acushnet, volunteered to save survivors of the schooner and were awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal for their heroism. That same year, USRC Algonquin, which was stationed in the Caribbean, set sail with fifteen Hispanic-Americans (a fourth of the cutter's complement) to San Juan, Puerto Rico to assist the Puerto Ricans battling fires that threatened to destroy parts of that city. In 1915, the City of San Juan, Puerto Rico, paid tribute to the crew of the cutter Algonquin and presented them with an Official Resolution of Thanks. The Coast Guard was already formed by September 1918, with the merger of United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States <b>Life-Saving</b> Service, when Seaman Richard E. Cordova became the first Hispanic Coast Guardsman to perish in a military conflict when his cutter, the USCGC Tampa, was torpedoed and sunk with all its crew by a German U-Boat during World War I. The Coast Guard can be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. Boatswains Mate First Class Pablo Valent and Surfman Indalecio Lopez, members of the Texas Brazos <b>Life-Saving</b> Station crew were awarded the Coast Guard Silver Lifesaving Medal and The Grand Cross Medal from the American Cross of Honor Society for their assistance in the rescue of the crew of the schooner Cape Horn on September 16, 1919. In 1935, Chief Boatswains Mate Pablo Valent was given command of the Port Isabel (Texas) Boat Station, becoming the first Hispanic-American to do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team erected two posts {{on the summit}} plateau to assist walkers {{attempting}} the descent in foggy conditions. These posts were subsequently cut down by climbers, sparking controversy in mountaineering circles on the ethics of such additions. Critics argued that cairns and posts are an unnecessary man-made intrusion into the natural landscape, which create {{a false sense of}} security and could lessen mountaineers' sense of responsibility for their own safety. Supporters of navigational aids pointed to the high number of accidents that occurred on the mountain (between 1990 and 1995 alone there were 13 fatalities, although eight of these were due to falls while rock climbing rather than navigational error), the long tradition of placing such aids on the summit, and the potentially <b>life-saving</b> role they could play. A series of solidly-constructed cairns currently (September 2009) marks the upper reaches of the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|The Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and Load Line (LL 66) {{conventions}} {{focus on}} shipboard safety issues. Originally developed {{in response to}} the sinking of RMS Titanic, SOLAS sets regulations on lifeboats, emergency equipment and safety procedures, including continuous radio watches. It has been updated to include regulations on ship construction, fire protection systems, <b>life-saving</b> appliances, radio communications, safety of navigation, management for the safe operation of ships, and other safety and security concerns. , the Bolivian, Lebanese, and Sri Lankan flags of convenience have not ratified the SOLAS treaty. LL 66 sets standards for minimum buoyancy, hull stress, and ship's fittings, as well as establishing navigational zones where extra precautions must be taken. , the Bolivian, Georgian and Sri Lankan governments have not ratified LL 66.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its inaugural session was {{the issue of how}} to raise revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, as well as a trade imbalance with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and draining the nation of its currency. The first effort to begin addressing these issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. <b>Life-Saving</b> Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the Hispanic {{pioneers in}} the Coast Guard were the Andreu family of Florida; Joseph Ximenez, the first Hispanic-American to command a Coast Guard vessel; and Detlef Frederick Argentine de Otte, the first Hispanic to {{graduate}} from Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction. The Coast Guard can {{be transferred to the}} Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. During World War I, Hispanics served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and U.S. <b>Life-Saving</b> Service; and during World War II, Hispanics served aboard ships guarding the shores of the United States and the Atlantic Ocean against enemy submarines. However some men, such as Jose R. Zaragoza, served on missions on lonely atolls. Hispanics have served in every major conflict, and continue to do so. Coast guard service is not limited to armed conflicts with other nations; the Coast Guard also plays a vital role in the apprehension of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.|$|E
5|$|Criminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed <b>life-saving</b> organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made <b>life-saving</b> surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|The Nathan F. Cobb was a three-masted {{schooner}} {{named after}} the shipbuilder and founder of Cobb’s Salvaging Company whose many rescues of stranded ships help lead {{to the formation of}} the United States <b>Life-Saving</b> Service. Despite its namesake's history of shipwreck rescues, the Nathan F. Cobb capsized in heavy seas on 1 December 1896 en route from Brunswick, Georgia to New York with a cargo of timber and cross ties. The cook and a shipmate drowned when they were swept overboard in violent seas. The crew righted the vessel by removing the three masts and they drifted for four days until they became grounded on a sandbar off Ormond Beach, Florida. Rescue attempts led to the drowning of volunteer Ferd Waterhouse, whose body was never recovered, but no other crew members were lost. A plaque commemorates Ferd Waterhouse’s rescue efforts. The Cobb Cottage, a structure built using materials salvaged from the ship, is part of Ormond Beach’s Historic Trail.|$|E
5|$|The first {{practical}} {{electron microscope}} {{was built by}} the physics department in 1938. During World War II, the university developed the G-suit, a <b>life-saving</b> garment worn by Allied fighter plane pilots, later adopted for use by astronauts. Development of the infrared chemiluminescence technique improved analyses of energy behaviours in chemical reactions. In 1963, the asteroid 2104 Toronto is discovered in the David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill and is named after the university. In 1972, studies on Cygnus X-1 led to {{the publication of the}} first observational evidence proving the existence of black holes. Toronto astronomers have also discovered the Uranian moons of Caliban and Sycorax, the dwarf galaxies of Andromeda I, II and III, and the supernova SN 1987A. A pioneer in computing technology, the university designed and built UTEC, one of the world's first operational computers, and later purchased Ferut, the second commercial computer after UNIVAC I. Multi-touch technology was developed at Toronto, with applications ranging from handheld devices to collaboration walls. The AeroVelo Atlas, which was the first to win the Igor I. Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition in 2013, was developed by the university's team of students and graduates and was tested in Vaughan.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a <b>life-saving</b> operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
5|$|Eldred did {{not have}} a troop board of review, a review by the adult troop leaders to ensure eligibility. Instead, Eldred had a {{thorough}} National Board of Review consisting of West, Baden-Powell, Ernest Thompson Seton, Daniel Carter Beard, Arthur R. Forbush, and Wilbert E. Longfellow, who wrote in the Handbook for Boys on <b>life-saving</b> and swimming. At the time there had still not been a council-level system for Eagle Scouts boards of review. Largely due to delays caused by Baden-Powell's visit, the National Court of Honor did not convene until March 29, 1912. A press announcement was released on or about April 10, 1912, leading to a century of confusion wherein it was believed Eldred's Board of Review had been held in April. West informed Eldred of his Eagle award in a letter dated August 21, 1912. Another reason for the delays was that the Boy Scouts of America felt no one would ever earn the Eagle Scout award and at the time of Eldred's Board of Review, the Eagle Scout medal had not yet been designed. This letter also informed Eldred of the delay in the medal, caused {{by the fact that the}} design of the Eagle Scout medal had not been finalized. Eldred was presented Eagle Scout on Labor Day, September 2, 1912, becoming the first to earn Scouting's highest rank, just two years after the founding of the BSA itself.|$|E

Despite being the second-deadliest {{accident}} on the Great Lakes, Edward Spencer '62 and other students from the Garrett Bible Institute were credited with rescuing dozens of passengers. Following a public outcry over <b>life-saving</b> facilities and transportation safety, in 1871, the federal government granted the University a lifeboat and later, in 1876, constructed a <b>life-saving</b> station, both of which were manned and operated by students, near the Grosse Point reef and lighthouse. By the time the Coast Guard assumed control of the station in 1916, it had remained the nation's only student-manned <b>life-saving</b> station; Northwestern students were credited with saving more than 400 people.|$|E
