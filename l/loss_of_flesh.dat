The unique peeling principle uses a self loading, self adjusting single point cutting tool that can follow the contour of the cut cassava tuber sections or sized lots.

For this, four groups of samples were harvested at the maturation stage. Three of them were separately exposed to a Co- 60 source, receiving respective doses of 0. 10, 0. 15 and 2. 00 kGy, while the non-irradiated group was kept as a control. All samples were stored for 35 days at 24 °C (± 2) and at 39 % relative humidity. The following aspects were evaluated: budding, rot, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> weight, texture, <b>flesh</b> color, moisture, external and internal appearance, aroma, soluble solids, titratable acidity, vitamin C, protein, starch and glucose.

40|$|Changes in {{the state}} of water of {{cherimoya}} (Annona cherimola Mill.) fruit during ripening were monitored using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. The stage of ripening was determined by analyzing the changes in titratable acidity, firmness and total soluble solids contents. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of solutes such as proline, sucrose, glucose and fructose were also studied. The significant increase in the transverse relaxation time (T 2) values and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> firmness during the initial stage of ripening are consistent with the sustained drop in the unfreezable water weight fraction according to the DSC data. The ripe stage of the fruit was marked by minimum longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) values and a rapid upsurge in the unfreezable water weight fraction, greatly influenced by the osmotic adjustments prompted by the significant accumulation of soluble sugars, proline and carboxylates. Changes in structure and solute concentration associated with ripening can be analyzed simultaneously, determining fruit water status by DSC. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa, C. F. Liang and A. R. Ferguson) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{commercial}} varieties grown in New Zealand. The long shelf-life of the ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit along with its inherent properties such as flavour, colour, texture and high content of vitamin C has allowed the development of New Zealand kiwifruit exports. However, the quality of the fruit can be affected by factors such as storage time and temperature along the supply chains to different markets. This study investigated changes in physiochemical parameters of kiwifruit along three supply chains to Indian markets, as well as development of predictive mathematical models for the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> firmness and storage potential of ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit along the supply chains. At each analysis point along the three supply chains, the ‘On arrival’ and ‘At departure’ quality of twenty kiwifruit were analysed for flesh firmness (kgf), soluble solids content (% Brix) and core temperatures (°C). The variation in the environmental temperature during storage and transportation along the supply chains were recorded. Three firmness loss models: Simple Exponential, Boltzmann and Inverse Exponential Polynomial were used to characterise the flesh firmness data collected along each supply chain. Three storage potential models: Reciprocal, Power and Reciprocal Quadratic, were fitted to the flesh firmness and core temperature data collected along each supply chain. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) test was used to determine the most suitable model that characterised the flesh firmness loss along the supply chains. The flesh firmness decreased (P< 0. 05) in all the grower lines along the three supply chains, while the soluble solids content increased (P< 0. 05) with temperature variation during storage and transportation. The Simple Exponential model best characterised the firmness data collected along supply chains 1 and 3. Changes in flesh firmness of fruit along supply chain 2 were best characterised by the Boltzmann model. The Reciprocal model best fitted the data on flesh firmness and core temperature. The Power model was the second best storage potential model that characterised the data collected along the three supply chains. The developed storage potential models may be used to determine the shelf-life of kiwifruit along similar supply chains in other markets...|$|E

Two experiments were carried out with fruits harvested in a commercial orchard located in Fraiburgo (State of Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil) in April of 2003 (experiment 1) and April of 2004 (experiment 2). For experiment 1, fruit were treated with different doses of 1 -MCP (0. 0; 0. 5 or 1. 0 µL L- 1) and stored in controlled atmosphere (CA, with 2. 0 kPa O 2 + 4. 5 kPa CO 2, at 0 ºC ± 0. 5 ºC/ 92 ± 3 % RH, and ethylene in the atmosphere < 40 &# 951;L L- 1). For experiment 2, fruit were treated with 0. 0 or 0. 7 µL L- 1 of 1 -MCP and stored in ambient atmosphere (AA; with 21. 0 kPa O 2 + 0. 03 kPa CO 2, at 0 ± 0. 5 ºC/ 90 ± 3 % RH, and 200 - 250 &# 951;L L- 1 of ethylene in the atmosphere) or CA (2. 0 kPa O 2 + 4. 5 kPa CO 2, at 0 ºC ± 0. 5 ºC/ 92 ± 3 % RH, and ethylene in the atmosphere < 40 nL L- 1). For experiment 1, fruit were evaluated after 90 and 120 days of storage at 0 ºC, followed by seven days at 23 ºC. For experiment 2, fruit were evaluated after 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of storage in AA, and after 60, 90, 120 and 150 days of storage in CA, plus one and seven days at 23 ºC. The benefits of 1 -MCP treatment on fruit quality preservation were observed for fruit stored in both, AA and AC. For experiment 1, there was no difference between 0. 5 and 1. 0 µL L- 1 of 1 -MCP on fruit ripening and postharvest quality preservation of kiwifruit stored in CA. For experiment 2, the treatment with 1 -MCP delayed the increase of ethylene production rate after removal from cold storage. The reduced ethylene production in fruit treated with 1 -MCP delayed the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>flesh</b> firmness in AC and AA, and reduced the incidence of pericarp translucency in AA.
