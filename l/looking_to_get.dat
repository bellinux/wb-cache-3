He won over half his bouts by a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out. In his later career he suffered increasingly from injuries, and he retired in January 2003 at the age of 30. He is now the head coach of Takanohana stable and {{a senior member of the}} Japan Sumo Association.|$|E
5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share of stock in the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. <b>Looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E

5|$|Black {{began the}} 1946 Cleveland Indians {{season as a}} member of the roster, <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> playing time in an {{established}} starting rotation. His season began inauspiciously when he was hit on the chin with a ball, causing him to miss a week during spring training. The 1946 season marked the first time that Black did not finish on the major league roster. After pitching in 18 games for the Indians, he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. While with the Brewers, Black failed to win any games, and at one point was suspended after he disappeared during a road trip. At the conclusion of the season, Indians owner Bill Veeck had a talk with Black, who admitted he had a problem with drunkenness. He agreed to spend the winter with Alcoholics Anonymous with Veek's help, and by the time the 1947 Cleveland Indians season began, Black was sober.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{proposed}} dockless bike sharing for the Citi Bike network, {{which would}} allow bikes to be rented without being tethered to docks. This was proposed after several bike sharing companies announced their intent to operate in New York City. In early August, the dockless bike-sharing company Spin had started a dockless operation in the Rockaways, but {{had been told to}} cease and desist operations by the NYCDOT, which had licensed Citi Bike as the only official bike-share operator in New York City. By the end of the month, Citi Bike started designing a dockless prototype that could still lock its own wheels based on whether the customer had paid. Meanwhile, Spin—a viable competitor to Citi Bike with lower per-half-hour pricing—was still <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a permit to start operations in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{first shot}} on goal was {{registered}} by Bonaventure Kalou, who forced a save out of Jens Lehmann. After 10 minutes, Shinji Ono spotted Lehmann off his line but sent his lofted shot wide of the target. This sparked Dortmund into life; they were thwarted when Patrick Paauwe intercepted Jan Koller {{just as he}} was <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his shot away. On 15 minutes, they came even closer to breaking the deadlock, when Amoroso picked out Tomáš Rosický; however, he shot straight at Edwin Zoetebier. On 19 minutes, Pierre van Hooijdonk came close to scoring with a free kick, which hit the right-hand post. Feyenoord's Tomasz Rząsa was then booked for dissent on 23 minutes, and following the resulting free kick, Evanílson came close to scoring, though his shot went over the crossbar after Ewerthon's pass had sent him through.|$|E

25|$|Until Ocean Grove's {{municipal}} authority was folded into Neptune Township in 1981, it boasted {{a set of}} unique laws, including one that made it illegal on Sundays to have cars {{on the streets of}} Ocean Grove. This had a significant effect on the development of a close-knit community. People <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away for the weekend typically avoided the Grove (the beach was closed on Sunday, too).

25|$|Argentina's lead forced England into a double-attacking substitution, {{bringing}} on Barnes and Waddle, and {{it nearly}} paid off: as the Argentine team began to tire after their earlier efforts, England began to push further up the pitch, <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{back into the}} game. Driven by Glenn Hoddle and John Barnes, they created chances, and Gary Lineker scored his sixth goal of the tournament in the 80th minute from a Barnes cross.

25|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} day <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as close as {{possible}} to Australia's score in the hope of bowling them out cheaply in the second innings, and set up an easy chase. Lamb moved on from his overnight 103 in much the same fashion as he had done the previous day. Smith joined in and the pair looked quite comfortable throughout the morning. Lamb was batting confidently and the pair took their partnership past 50. A short time later however, Lamb was undone by a brilliant trade-mark bat-pad catch by David Boon off Alderman's bowling. A short time later Derek Pringle, out LBW, became debutant Greg Campbell's first ever Test wicket, and his only victim of the whole tour.|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats cruised {{to their}} 11th Grand Final {{appearance}} with a 2–0 Semi Final series {{win over the}} Wollongong Hawks. After knocking out the Hawks in straight sets, the Wildcats faced historical rivals the Adelaide 36ers in the 2014 Grand Final. After winning Game 1 in Perth {{on the back of}} a 30-point effort from James Ennis, the team headed to Adelaide <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the job done in two. But it wasn't to be, as the 36ers forced a deciding third game with an 89–84 win in Game 2. Returning to Perth Arena less than 48 hours later for Game 3, the Wildcats crushed the 36ers with a 93–59 win in front of 13,498 fans, as their 2–1 series victory saw them claim their sixth NBL Championship. Jermaine Beal was subsequently named the series MVP after Ennis struggled to make an impact in Games 2 and 3. Beal averaged 17.6 points per game during the Grand Final series, hitting 11 three-pointers at an efficient 48%.|$|E

25|$|The England cricket team {{arrived in}} Australia in late-October <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the tour {{off to a}} good start but, the Chairman's XI were more than a match for them. Chris Lynn was loaned to WA by Queensland, {{overlooked}} for their Sheffield Shield clash being played at the same time. This move paid off as Lynn made a blistering 104, only his third first-class century as each of WA's top four batsmen made half centuries. England's fast-bowling trio of Chris Tremlett, Boyd Rankin and Steven Finn struggled for line and length on the WACA wicket and Chairman's XI declared at 5-451. England began to fight back however as Michael Carberry made 78 and both Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell made centuries, the former didn't get out and made 113 and the latter retired on 115. England were eventually bowled out for 391 and half-centuries to Mitchell Marsh and Lynn meant that the game ended in a draw.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps, {{the biggest}} upset {{in the history}} of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the {{scoreboard}} – and it was to set the tone of the match. Most people would have expected Australia to swamp Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some hope, at least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.|$|E
