5000|$|A <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> is {{a device}} used to deinterlace video signals prior to display.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of a <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> is to take an interlaced video source which consists of a two-field frame and create a progressive scan (single non-interlaced frame) output. This can produce a smoother, higher-resolution picture. The additional lines provide greater light output and makes for an image that is smoother and more film like. CRT-based displays (both direct-view and projection) are capable of directly displaying both interlaced and progressive video, and therefore the line-doubling process is an optional step to enhance picture quality. Most other types of display, including LCD, plasma and DLP, generally cannot accept an interlaced signal directly, and therefore some kind of <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> must be used. This is usually built in and transparent to the user. Progressive scan DVD players also feature a <b>line</b> <b>doubler.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1991 {{the company}} {{created the first}} {{professional}} grade <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> (480p) (deinterlacer) which incorporated this technology, for use with large CRT projectors used in Hollywood screening rooms and large home theaters. The highly acclaimed LD1 <b>Line</b> <b>Doubler</b> takes standard definition signals and converts them to higher resolutions with improved image quality, free of the usual NTSC artifacts (cross-color and cross luminance). At the same time, Faroudja started manufacturing products {{based on the same}} technologies, including adaptive comb filters and video quality improvement products for use with Sony’s U-Matic video recorders. This technology was a key factor in the growth of the home theater industry. Faroudja’s adaptive comb filter technology was recognized with a Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in 1991.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{players have}} a feature called [...] "3:2 {{pulldown}} detection" [...] or [...] "inverse telecine" [...] which attempts to better handle the artifacts which result from differing {{film and video}} rates in conjunction with interlaced scanning of the film. However most line doublers used in these players {{are not able to}} achieve the anticipated inverse telecine functionality, refer to <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> for details.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most basic}} and literal way to double lines is to repeat each scanline, though {{the results of}} this are {{generally}} very crude. Most line doublers use digital interpolation to recreate the missing lines in an interlaced signal, and the resulting quality depends on the technique used. Generally a <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> will only interpolate within a single field, rather than merging information from adjacent fields, to preserve the smoothness of motion, resulting in a frame rate equal to the field rate (i.e. a 60i signal would be converted to 60p.) Some line doublers are capable of using the former technique in moving areas and the latter in static areas (to avoid bob effect), which improves overall sharpness. It is worth noting that even if a <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> employs the merging method it cannot be considered an inverse telecine device if a frame rate of 60p other than the original 24p is obtained. From this aspect of view some hyped progressive scan technologies (including Pioneer's PureCinema Progressive Scan) bearing an inverse telecine insignia are thus overstated.|$|E
50|$|Improvements in {{display device}} {{technologies}} drove {{the requirement for}} more advanced video processing and scaling. This included {{the introduction of a}} new product type called the VP400 Line Quadrupler (480i upconverted to 960p). In 2000 Faroudja introduced the industry’s first <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> for HDTV (1080i upconverted to 1080p). The LD1, the VP400, the DVP5000, DVP3000 and Native Rate Series have made Faroudja the benchmark by which all other video processing is compared. For his lifetime’s work, Yves Faroudja was awarded the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Emmy in Technology and Engineering, presented in 1998.|$|E

50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>doubling</b> {{takes the}} <b>lines</b> of each {{interlaced}} field (consisting of only even or odd <b>lines)</b> and <b>doubles</b> them, filling the entire frame. This {{results in the}} video having a frame rate identical to the field rate, but each frame having half the vertical resolution, or resolution {{equal to that of}} each field that the frame was made from. <b>Line</b> <b>doubling</b> prevents combing artifacts but causes a noticeable reduction in picture quality since each frame displayed is doubled and really only at the original half field resolution. This is noticeable mostly on stationary objects since they appear to bob up and down. These techniques are also called bob deinterlacing and linear deinterlacing for this reason. <b>Line</b> <b>doubling</b> retains horizontal and temporal resolution at the expense of vertical resolution and bobbing artifacts on stationary and slower moving objects. A variant of this method discards one field out of each frame, halving temporal resolution.|$|R
50|$|This rough {{animation}} compares {{progressive scan}} with interlace scan, also demonstrating the interline twitter effect associated with interlacing. On the left {{there are two}} progressive scan images. In the middle there are two interlaced images and on the right there are two images with line doublers. The original resolutions are above and the ones with spatial anti-aliasing are below. The interlaced images use half the bandwidth of the progressive ones. The images in the center column precisely duplicate the pixels of {{the ones on the}} left, but interlacing causes details to twitter. Real interlaced video blurs such details to prevent twittering, but as seen in the pictures of the lower row, such softening (or anti-aliasing) comes at the cost of image clarity. A <b>line</b> <b>doubler</b> shown in the bottom center picture cannot restore the previously interlaced image to the full quality of the progressive image shown in the top left one.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is shown}} that the {{metallic}} <b>line</b> <b>doubling</b> phenomenon is well visible when the Blazhko effect is maximum while only a line broadening takes place when it is minimum. At this last phase, the hydrogen emission is very weak (under the continuum) but its intensity increases progressively towards the Blazhko maximum. The hydrogen <b>line</b> <b>doubling</b> does not present a noticeable Blazhko phase variation. The wavelength position of the metallic <b>double</b> <b>line</b> system attests that the ballistic motion of the atmosphere has a weaker amplitude when the Blazhko effect is minimum than at its maximum intensity. We detect {{a variation of the}} γ-velocity deduced from metallic absorption lines during the Blazhko period but additional accurate observations are required to determine its amplitude. The acceleration of the shock wave, inducing <b>line</b> <b>doubling</b> phenomena, is extremely large at all Blazhko phases (from a Mach number around 5 to 25) between the metallic and hydrogen formation regions. Thus a high hypersonic regime always exists in the high atmosphere of RR Lyr. These observational results show that the radial pulsation is manifestly maximum at the maximum Blazhko effect and its intensity is more and more reduced up to its minimum. Finally it emerges that high quality line profiles, well distributed over the Blazhko period, can provide some decisive tests to determine the relevant mechanism at the origin of the Blazhko effect...|$|R
