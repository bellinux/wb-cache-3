40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the number and characteristics of US State Registrars of Vital Statistics (Vital Registrars) and State Systems Development Initiative (SSDI) Coordinators that <b>link</b> birth <b>certificate</b> and hospital discharge data as well as using linkage processes. MethodsVital Registrars and SSDI Coordinators in all 52 vital records jurisdictions (50 states, District of Columbia, and New York City) were asked to complete a 41 -question survey. We examined frequency distributions among completed surveys using SAS 9. 3. ResultsThe response rate was 100 % (N = 52) for Vital Registrars and 96 % (N = 50) for SSDI Coordinators. Nearly half of Vital Registrars (n = 22) and SSDI Coordinators (n = 23) reported that their jurisdiction <b>linked</b> birth <b>certificate</b> and hospital discharge records at least once in the last 4 years. Among those who link, the majority of Vital Registrars (77. 3 %) and SSDI Coordinators (82. 6 %) link both maternal and infant hospital discharge records to the birth certificate. Of those who do not link, 43 % of the Vital Registrars and 55 % of SSDI Coordinators reported an interest in <b>linking</b> birth <b>certificate</b> and hospital discharge data. Reasons for not linking included lack of staff time, inability to access raw data, high cost, and unavailability of personal identifiers to link the two sources. ConclusionsResults of our analysis provide a national perspective on data linkage practices in the US. Our findings can be used to promote further data linkages, facilitate sharing of data and linkage methodologies, and identify uses of the resulting linked data.

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{proprietary}} certificates [7] was recently introduced {{in an attempt}} to discourage sharing of access rights to subscription-based resources. A proprietary certificate is a certificate on a public key – the so-called proprietary key – that contains some information related to another (so-called collateral) certificate and has the property that if the owner of the proprietary public key reveals the corresponding (so-called proprietary) secret key, then the collateral secret key (corresponding to the public key in the collateral certificate) is automatically released. Thus, if a service provider requires all users to use proprietary <b>certificates</b> <b>linked</b> with collateral <b>certificates</b> corresponding to resources the users always wish to keep private – such as access to 401 (k) accounts, the user’s criminal history, etc – then this will discourage the access rights sharing. However, the original solution for proprietary certificates overlooks the possibility of accidental sharing, namely, sharing caused by theft of the proprietary secret key which would lead to immediate loss of the collateral secret key, making wide-scale deployment of proprietary certificate approach unlikely. In this paper we discuss what steps can be taken towards making proprietary certificates approach more practical...|$|R

The ratio of mortality by marital status (1. 77) was in part due to survival (ratio 1. 44) and in part due to incidence (ratio 1. 32). The ratio of mortality by social class (1. 44) seemed to be due more to differences in incidence (ratio 1. 36) than to differences in survival (ratio 1. 18).
