5|$|More {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 2007. Replacing the bridge would cost $7–8 million and take two years to complete. Rehabilitation would require bringing the bridge up to code so it could carry loads of up to 40 tons (36 tonnes). A preservation group formed to oppose a replacement. Its founder compared the bridge to the Dingmans Ferry Bridge on the Pennsylvania–New Jersey border, which carries similar traffic loads. One possibility is to replace the bridge, and move the antique structure elsewhere in Sullivan County, since it is a popular tourist attraction. In June 2008, a compromise was made defining {{the possibility of a}} $12 million bridge to replace the 104-year-old deteriorating structure. PennDOT has suggested that they will <b>let</b> <b>anyone</b> preserve the bridge by taking it somewhere else.
