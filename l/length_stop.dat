40|$|Multiple-births {{is one of}} {{the most}} animals {{important}} trait. Many genetic and environmental factors affect on multiple-births. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor IB (BMPR-IB) {{is one of the}} genetic factors affecting this trait in sheep. In this study, 72 different sequences were extracted from NCBI and then some bioinformatics analysis were investigated such as CDS <b>length,</b> <b>stop</b> codon variation, homology search, molecular mass, signal peptide, isoelectric point, tertiary structure, transmembrane, motifs and phylogenetic tree. This gene has been had 4 motifs such as Activin_recp, transmembrane, GS motif and STYKc Protein kinase. Also the results were indicated that BMPR 1 B in sheep has closely relationship with goat and cow. Multiple alignment showed high conservation of motifs which indicate constancy of this gene during evolution. The results of this study can be used to better recognition of BMPR- 1 B gene structure in different animals which would be helpful for animal breeding plans...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRoundabout {{metering}} signals help {{to create}} {{gaps in the}} circulating stream {{to solve the problem}} of excessive queuing and delays caused by unbalanced flow patterns and high demand flow levels. This paper gives a brief summary of the control of roundabouts using metering signals and describes the basic concepts of an analytical model of the operation of roundabouts with metering signals. The model estimates capacities and performance measures (delay, queue <b>length,</b> <b>stop</b> rate, and so on) of the metered and controlling approaches of the roundabout as well as other approaches which operate as normal roundabout entries. Timing of roundabout metering signals is discussed and a case study is presented demonstrating the application of the model to a real-life roundabout in Melbourne, Australia. Alternative timing strategies are explored. It has been found that the model gives lower cycle times than those used in practice for roundabout metering signals. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|White Paper (~ 55 %) : Teams of 3 - 5 {{students}} {{will provide a}} comprehensive report describing a particular threat, assessing possible losses {{in the event of}} an attack, assessing current vulnerabilities, presenting possible responses, and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of each. The report should be a well-written, thoughtful, coherent analysis, 20 - 30 pages in <b>length.</b> (<b>Stop</b> writing when you have nothing left to say on your topic! The goal is to produce something interesting, not to fill pages!) Due date: The White Paper will be due by class (6 : 30 p. m.) on Wednesday December 7. Team formation and structure, and topic selection: If you like, you may use your “Red Team Project ” grouping. Or you may form a new team – perhaps utilizing the Wiki to coalesce around a topic. Each team should include at least one “policy ” student. Although each team can structure itself as it desires, our recommendation is that each team divide the topic into subtopics (“chapters ” of the report) with each team member (or a small group of team members) acting as the “lead author ” for that portion. (However, all team members should review and suggest changes for the entire report – the overall report must be “smooth and integrated ” – not a “staple job ” on 3 - 5 independent sections.) Please send the TA (Jeff Bigham) a list of tea...|$|E

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} {{measuring}} and interpreting the theoretical performance capabilities of transit modes. Line capacity and other performance and efficiency measures related to line capacity are given particular emphasis. The analysis {{is done in}} the context of a hypothetical transit system with assumed operating and design characteristics (station spacing, line <b>length,</b> <b>stop</b> schedule, etc.). By this approach, certain limits to transit system performance, cost factors, and service quality variances are observed. ^ The analysis demonstrates that the maximizing of line capacity has certain limitations as an objective function and as an operational performance measure, both from the perspective of the system operator as well as from that of the system user. A new performance measure concept, productive capacity, is introduced and is tested as an alternative objective function. Productive capacity is defined as the product of line capacity and operating speed. A fleet efficiency measure based on productive capacity is also defined and studied. ^ In the process of this analysis, expressions for vehicle, way, and station capacity are derived and variables affecting these measures and the performance and efficiency measures defined are studied. Additionally, new methods for measuring line capacity under varying stopping policies are outlined. ^ It is concluded that the maximizing of line capacity is coincident with the maximizing of work output (space-kilometers per hour); however, these objectives are attained at sacrifice of other system efficiencies and at higher costs of operation, the latter being measured by a surrogate, fleet size. The maximizing of productive capacity, on the other hand, is generally achieved at much higher optimal speeds than maximum capacity and with superior operational efficiencies and costs than are possible under the capacity objective. The relatively small diminution of line capacity attendant with the productive capacity objective (as compared with the line capacity objective) is generally outweighed by the service quality benefits, the cost reductions, and the fleet efficiency gains accrued. ^ It is also observed that vehicle dynamic characteristics and transit line characteristics (such as station spacing) impose limits on station capacity, productive capacity, and system efficiency which are not perceived when analysis of line capacity is studied isolated from these factors. ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{introduce}} a new stopping rule for computerized adaptive testing (CAT). The predicted standard error reduction (PSER) stopping rule uses the predictive posterior variance to determine the reduction in standard error that would result from the administration of additional items. The performance of the PSER was compared with that of the minimum standard error stopping rule and {{a modified version of the}} minimum information stopping rule in a series of simulated adaptive tests, drawn from a number of item pools. Results indicate that the PSER makes efficient use of CAT item pools, administering fewer items when predictive gains in information are small and increasing measurement precision when informa-tion is abundant. Keywords computerized adaptive testing (CAT), stopping rule, testing burden According to Wainer (2000), an adaptive test can be considered complete after a pre-determined number of items have been administered, when a predetermined level of measurement precision has been reached, or when a predetermined length of time has elapsed. The two most commonly used methods for determining when a computerized adaptive test is complete are the fixed length and variable <b>length</b> <b>stopping</b> rules. Under a fixed <b>length</b> <b>stopping</b> rule, an adaptive test is terminated when a predeter-mined number of items have been administered. Accordingly, all examinees ar...|$|R

Subways were too expensive to install in areas of lower density - smaller cities or the suburbs of larger ones - which often suffer the same gridlock problems as larger cities. Buses could be easily introduced in these areas, but did not offer the capacities or speeds that made them an attractive alternative to car ownership.
