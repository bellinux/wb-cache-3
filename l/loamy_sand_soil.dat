Results showed that the soil improvement was controlled by the application rate and decomposability of amendments and soil type.

Also, CO 2 emission was stimulated significantly as power functions of the total porosity and the ratio of macroporosity to microporosity.

The heterogeneity in soil properties is described by a log-normal distribution for surface saturated hydraulic conductivity. Comparisons between field-scale numerical and analytical simulation results for water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated soils show that the proposed expressions reproduce the evolution of surface soil moisture and infiltration rate with time.

40|$|Groundwater {{contamination}} by oocysts of the waterborne pathogen Cryptosporidium parvum is {{a significant}} cause of animal and human disease worldwide. Although research has been undertaken {{in the past to}} determine how specific physical and chemical properties of soils affect the risk of groundwater contamination by C. parvum, there is as yet no clear conclusion concerning the range of mobility of C. parvum that one should expect in field soils. In this context, the key objective of this research was to determine the magnitude of C. parvum transport in a number of soils, under conditions in which fast and preferential transport has been successfully prevented. C. parvum oocysts were applied at the surface of different soils and subjected to artificial rainfall. Apparently for the first time, quantitative PCR was used to detect and enumerate oocysts in the soil columns and in the leachates. The transport of oocysts by infiltrating water, and the considerable retention of oocysts in soil was demonstrated for all soils, although differences in the degree of transport were observed with soils of different types. More oocysts were found in leachates from sandy loam soils than in leachates from <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> <b>soils</b> and the retention of oocysts in different soils did not significantly differ. The interaction of various processes of the hydrologic system and biogeochemical mechanisms contributed to the transport of oocysts through the soil matrix. Results suggest that the interplay of clay, organic matter, and Ca 2 + facilitates and mediates the transfer of organic matter from mineral surfaces to oocysts surface, resulting in the enhanced breakthrough of oocysts through matrices of sandy loam soils compared to those of <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> <b>soils.</b> Although the number of occysts that penetrate the soil matrix account for {{only a small percentage of}} initial inputs, they still pose a significant threat to human health, especially in groundwater systems with a water table not too distant from the soil surface.

Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis showed that the dominant compounds were aromatic acids, short chain dicarboxylic acids (C 4 -C 9), sugars and esters of stearic and palmitic acids. Aromatics and dicarboxylic acid contents increased upon saponification due to cleavage of ester bonds of high molecular weight and polar compounds.

40|$|Research has {{suggested}} that streambank seepage {{can be an important}} mechanism of bank instability; however, limited information is available on the level of soil characterization necessary to accurately predict seepage gradient forces and erosion. The objective of this research was to quantify the expected range of predicted seepage gradients for various degrees of site characterization. Uncertainty analysis on seepage gradient predictions was performed relative to variability in soil hydraulic properties. A two-dimensional unsaturated/saturated groundwater flow model was used to simulate a homogeneous <b>soil</b> layer for <b>sand</b> and <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> <b>soils</b> packed at various bulk densities, ρb. A pedotransfer function (ROSETTA), designed to estimate unsaturated hydraulic properties from surrogate soil data (i. e., texture and bulk density), was used to derive the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, and water retention parameters for various levels of site information (i. e., only textural class; percent sand, silt, and clay (%SSC); %SSC and ρb; and %SSC, ρb, and Ks). Statistical distributions were derived for each soil hydraulic parameter and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to generate distributions of maximum seepage gradient. The deviation in predicted seepage gradient was calculated using assumed baseline conditions. Ranges in predicted soil hydraulic parameters and maximum seepage gradients were considerably reduced when using %SSC as compared to soil texture. Therefore, at a minimum, soil samples should be taken for particle size analysis. For ρb between 1450 and 1500 kg m- 3, soil hydraulic parameters could be derived using ROSETTA and inputting %SSC, with little additional benefit provided by measuring ρb and/or Ks. When the ρb was less than 1450 – 1500 kg m- 3, inputting ρb and/or Ks consistently reduced the magnitude of deviations from the baseline and therefore should be measured from undisturbed soil samples. The opposite was observed for ρb greater than 1450 – 1500 kg m- 3 due to discrepancies between ROSETTA-derived and actual values of soil hydraulic parameters other than Ks. Considerable deviations (i. e., around 20 %) were observed in seepage gradients under this scenario. When ROSETTA-derived and actual values of soil hydraulic parameters more closely matched, inputting ρb and/or Ks benefitted seepage gradient predictions as deviations in seepage gradients were less than 5 % for the <b>sand</b> and <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> <b>soils.</b> Therefore, it is vital to quantify all soil hydraulic parameters for high ρb soils and textures with a wide range in %SSC...|$|R

Four-row implements were used on a Norfolk <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> (Typic Kandiudults; FAO classification Luxic Ferralsols). The implements tested were two in-row subsoilers (a KMC-Kelly 7 Ripper and a Brown-Harden Ro-Till 7) and a Kinze 7 planter.

40|$|Depleting {{groundwater}} {{resources in}} Indian Punjab call for diversifying from rice to crops with low evapo-transpiration needs and adopting water-saving technologies. Soybean offers a diversification option in coarse- to medium-textured soils. However, its productivity in these soils is constrained by high soil mechanical resistance and high soil temperature during {{early part of}} the growing season. These constraints can be alleviated through irrigation, deep tillage and straw mulching. This 3 -years field study examines the individual and combined effects of irrigation, deep tillage, and straw mulching regimes on soybean yield and water productivity (WP) in relation to soil texture. Combinations of two irrigation regimes viz., full irrigation (If), and partial irrigation (Ip) in the main plot; two tillage regimes viz., conventional-till (CT) -soil stirring to 0. 10 Â m depth, and deep tillage (DT) -chiseling down to 0. 35 Â m depth followed by CT in the subplot; and two mulch rates viz., 0 (M 0) and 6 Â tÂ ha- 1 (M) in the sub-subplot on two soils differing in available water capacity were evaluated. Seed yield was greater in the sandy loam than in the loamy sand reflecting the effects of available water capacity. Irrigation effects were greater on loamy sand (40 %) than on sandy loam (5 %) soil. Deep tillage benefits were also more on loamy sand (14 %) compared to sandy loam (5 %) soil. Yield gains with mulching were comparable on the two soils (19 %). An evaluation of interaction effects showed that mulching response was slightly more in Ip (20 %) than in If regimes (17 %) in the sandy loam; while in the loamy sand, mulching gains were comparable (18 - 19 %) in both irrigation regimes. Benefits of deep tillage in the <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> <b>soil</b> were more in Ip (20 %) than in If regimes (17 %). Deep tillage and straw mulching enhanced WP (ratio of seed yield/water use) from 1. 39 to 1. 97 Â kgÂ ha- 1 Â mm- 1 in Ip regime, and from 1. 87 to 2. 33 Â kgÂ ha- 1 Â mm- 1 in If regime in the <b>loamy</b> <b>sand</b> <b>soil.</b> These effects on WP were less in the sandy loam soil with greater available water capacity. Yield and WP gains are ascribed to deeper and denser rooting due to moderation of soil temperature and water conservation with straw mulching and tillage-induced reduction in soil mechanical resistance.
