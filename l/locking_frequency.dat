Following their magnitude, many phenomena can be observed such as phase <b>locking,</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>locking,</b> <b>frequency</b> generation, push-pull effects, hysteresis phenomena and chaos, [...] . We show here that the spectral signature of the slave laser enables {{a better understanding of the}} the nonlinear interaction between the two competing sources: the spontaneous emission and the external field for which spectra are equally amplified through the active medium. This amplification is then strongly dependent on their coherency. We describe the role of the injected laser as a filter and an amplifier.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} between a nano-contact spin torque oscillator (STO) and injected radio-frequency and microwave currents. Modulation of the STO signal is observed over a wide frequency range from 100 MHz to 3. 2 GHz. The modulation sidebands agree well with macrospin simulations. When the injected microwave frequency approaches that of the STO, we observe injection <b>locking,</b> <b>frequency</b> pulling/pushing, and intermodulation peaks. While the intermodulation peaks are reasonably well reproduced by macrospin simulations, they do not follow the Adler's model.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a hybrid device {{based on a}} long Josephson {{junction}} (JJ) coupled inductively to an external ferromagnetic (FM) layer. The long JJ in a zero-field operation mode induces a localized AC magnetic field in the FM layer and enables a synchronized magnetostatic standing wave. The magnetostatic wave induces additional dissipation for soliton propagation in the junction and also enables a phase locking (resonant soliton synchronization) at a frequency of natural ferromagnetic resonance. The later manifests itself as an additional constant voltage step on the current-voltage characteristics at the corresponding voltage.

40|$|A novel high {{sensitive}} fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain sensing technique using lasers locked to relative frequency reference is proposed and analyzed theoretically.

Usage of relative frequency reference avoids all complexities involved in the usage of absolute frequency reference, hence, making the system simple and economical.

40|$|Within the RSJ model, we {{performed}} a theoretical analysis of phase-locking in elementary strongly coupled Josephson junction cells. For this purpose, we developed a systematic method allowing the investigation of phase-locking in cells with small but non-vanishing loop inductance. The voltages across the junctions {{are found to be}} locked with very small phase difference for almost all values of external flux. However, the general behavior of phase-locking is found to be just contrary to that according to weak coupling. In case of strong coupling there is nearly no influence of external magnetic flux on the phases, but the locking-frequency becomes flux-dependent. The influence of parameter splitting is considered as well as the effect of small capacitive shunting of the junctions. Strongly coupled cells show synchronization even for large parameter splitting. Finally, a study of the behavior under external microwave radiation shows that the frequency locking-range becomes strongly flux-dependent, whereas the <b>locking</b> <b>frequency</b> itself turns out to be flux-independent.
