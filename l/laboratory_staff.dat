The first eight <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> arrived in Montreal {{at the end of}} 1942. These were Bertrand Goldschmidt and Pierre Auger from France, George Placzek from Czechoslovakia, S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, Friedrich Paneth and Hans von Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Canadian contingent included George Volkoff, Bernice Weldon Sargent and George Laurence, and promising young Canadian scientists such as J. Carson Mark, Phil Wallace and Leo Yaffe.|$|E
5|$|Kistiakowsky {{was unhappy}} {{with the state of}} American {{knowledge}} of explosives and propellants. Conant established the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL) near the laboratories of the Bureau of Mines in Bruceton, Pennsylvania in October 1940, and Kistiakowsky initially supervised its activities, making occasional visits; but Conant did not formally appoint him as its Technical Director until the spring of 1941. Although initially hampered by a shortage of facilities, the ERL grew from five staff in 1941 to a wartime peak of 162 full-time <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> in 1945. An important field of research was RDX. This powerful explosive had been developed by the British before the war. The challenge was to develop an industrial process that could produce it on a large scale. RDX was also mixed with TNT to produce Composition B, which was widely used in various munitions, and torpex, which was used in torpedoes and depth charges. Pilot plants were in operation by May 1942, and large-scale production followed in 1943.|$|E
5|$|To {{handle this}} new, {{considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive task, {{it was decided that}} a new organisation was needed. The Mary Rose Trust, a limited charitable trust, with representatives from many organisations would handle the need for a larger operation and a large infusion of funds. In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12m (40ft) catamaran Roger Greenville which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel Sleipner, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the Vasa. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities. During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man-years.|$|E
40|$|Qatar Council for Healthcare Practitioners (QCHP) {{launched}} the current continuous professional program (CPD). According to the QCHP regulations, <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffs</b> and nurses {{are obligated to}} comply with the requirements for their annual license renewal. In this study, <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffs</b> and nurses employed by Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) were surveyed to identify their current CPD practice and the number of CPD credit hours obtained so far. In addition, it examines their preferences towards future CPD activities, motivational aspects or challenges the face in pursuing CPD goals. A total response counts of 201 was achieved from both groups across HMC. Results showed that nurses where more aware of the new requirements and almost completed the annual required CPD credit hours. However, <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffs</b> where seen falling behind and having insufficient numbers of CPD credit hours. Both groups of <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffs</b> and nurses were favorable of CPD activities within working hours and during weekdays. In general, responses showed that HMC were meeting the needs of <b>laboratory</b> <b>staffs</b> and nurses for their CPD credit hours. However, workload and shortage of time were barriers that prevented staffs from both groups to achieve their CPD goals. Sufficient time off from work was considered important, whereas responses regarding the importance of cash incentives to achieve CPD goals varied between the two groups...|$|R

[...] He was protective of individuals in his laboratory, but even more protective of {{the reputation of the}} laboratory. He was forced to defend Radiation <b>Laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> members like Robert Serber who were investigated by the University's Personnel Security Board. In several cases he issued character references in support of staff. However, Lawrence barred Robert Oppenheimer's brother Frank from the Radiation Laboratory, damaging his relationship with Robert. An acrimonious loyalty oath campaign at the University of California also drove away faculty members. When hearings were held to revoke Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance, Lawrence declined to attend on account of illness, but a transcript in which he was critical of Oppenheimer was presented in his absence. Lawrence's success [...] in building a creative, collaborative laboratory was undermined by the ill-feeling and distrust resulting from political tensions.|$|E

2500|$|Laboratory {{identification}} of B. pseudomallei can be difficult, especially in Western countries {{where it is}} rarely seen. [...] The large, wrinkled colonies look like environmental contaminants, so are often discarded as being of no clinical significance. [...] Colony morphology is very variable and a single strain may display [...] multiple colony types, so inexperienced <b>laboratory</b> <b>staff</b> may mistakenly believe the growth is not pure. The organism grows more slowly than other bacteria that may be present in clinical specimens, and in specimens from nonsterile sites, is easily overgrown. [...] Nonsterile specimens should, therefore, be cultured in selective media (e.g., Ashdown's or B. cepacia medium). For heavily contaminated samples, such as faeces, {{a modified version of}} Ashdown's that includes norfloxacin, amoxicillin, and polymyxin B has been proposed.

40|$|Background and aims: Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} {{are the most}} prevalent occupational injuries and disabilities in the world. One {{of the most important}} risk factors of these disorders is awkward posture. Previous studies reported high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in medical laboratory personnel. This study was carried out to determine Prevalence and postural risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders among medical laboratory personnel in Kashan in 2012. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried on 168 clinical <b>laboratories</b> <b>staff</b> in Kashan. Standard Cornell questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders and quick exposure check (QEC) method was used for analyzing posture. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods and logistic regression analysis. Results: 155 of studied personnel (92. 3) suffered from pain and had disorder at least 1 - 2 times per week. The incidence of neck disorders was more than other limbs. There is no significant deference between musculoskeletal disorders with age and sex. Only 47 percent {{of the participants in the}} overall level of risk had acceptable posture. There is significant relationship between prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and awkward posture. Conclusion: Prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in clinical <b>laboratories</b> <b>staff</b> is high. Awkward posture is one of the main causes of the disorders and ergonomics interventions for improvement of work station in medical laboratory is essential...|$|R
