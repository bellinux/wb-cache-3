40|$|In this study, the {{decentralized}} {{common reference}} frame estimation problem for multiagent {{systems in the}} absence of any common coordinate system is investigated. Each agent is deployed in a 2 -D space and can only measure the relative distance of neighboring agents and the angle of their line of sight in its <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame; <b>no</b> relative attitude measurement is available. Only asynchronous and random pairwise communications are allowed between neighboring agents. The convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are characterized, and its sensitiveness against additive noise on the relative distance measurements is investigated. An experimental validation of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is provided...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{automatically}} determining an uncalibrated camera’s motion through space solely from {{its view of}} the static surroundings has only recently received attention. In this work, we present a new direct method for computing camera egomotion from optical flow data in the particular case of a camera having unknown and possibly varying focal length. Here, egomotion refers to motion that is expressed {{with respect to the}} camera’s <b>local</b> frame of <b>reference.</b> <b>No</b> restrictions are placed {{on the nature of the}} camera’s motion other than that its translational and rotational components vary smoothly. Essential to the approach is the derivation of a differential form of the time-dependent epipolar equation for a single moving camera. The method requires that two special matrices be computed from optical flow data. Closed-form expressions, presented in terms of the entries of the two matrices, are then given for the egomotion parameters, the focal length and its derivative. This self-calibration process constitutes an essential prerequisite to obtaining a reconstruction of the viewed scene from optical flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{anticipated}} {{improvement in}} precision and proliferation of GNSS and GIS {{is dependent upon}} consistency between ITRF and a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame which defines fixed land boundaries, services, physical infrastructure and machine control (e. g. precision agriculture, automated mining and navigation). This is only achievable through use of a suitable transformation and deformation model to relate the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) and closely aligned GNSS reference frames such as WGS 84 to a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame at any epoch. Regional reference frames are typically defined as a regional densification of the ITRF. These reference frames are necessarily kinematic in nature to account for tectonic and site specific deformation. GNSS data processing (e. g. point positioning and baseline processing) are performed within these kinematic reference frames {{in order to maintain}} consistency with GNSS orbit products. Time dependent transformations and deformation models are subsequently required to relate these ITRF coordinates to a specified fixed epoch of realisation of a <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame. This paper compares several different approaches to kinematic reference frame transformations and deformation models. The method and strategy used depends upon the precision required and the tectonic setting of the <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> frame.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} MR-targeted TRUS {{prostate biopsy}} using a novel <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> augmentation method. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tracker-based MR-TRUS fusion was applied using <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> augmentation. In contrast to conventional whole gland fusion, <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> augmentation focuses the highest registration accuracy {{to the region}} surrounding the lesion to be biopsied. Pre-acquired multi-parametric MR images (mpMRI) were evaluated using PIRADS classification. T 2 -weighted MR images were imported on an ultrasound machine to allow for MR-TRUS fusion. Biopsies were targeted to the most suspicious lesion area identified on mpMRI. Each target was biopsied 1 - 5 times. For each biopsied lesion the diameter, PIRADS and Gleason scores, visibility during fusion, and representativeness were recorded. RESULTS: Included were 23 consecutive patients with 25 MR suspicious lesions, of which 11 patients had a previous negative TRUS-guided biopsy and 12 were biopsy naive. The cancer detection rate was 64 % (Gleason score >/= 6). Biopsy was negative (i. e., no Gleason score) in seven patients confirmed by follow-up {{in all of them}} (up to 18 months). After MR-TRUS fusion, 88 % of the lesions could be visualized on TRUS. The cancer detection rate increases with increasing lesion size, being 73 % for lesions larger than 10 mm. CONCLUSION: Tracker-based MR-TRUS fusion biopsy with <b>local</b> <b>reference</b> augmentation is feasible, especially for lesions with an MR maximum diameter of at least 10 mm or PIRADS 5 lesions. If this is not the case, we recommend in-bore MR-guided biopsy...|$|R
