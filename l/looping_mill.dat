Listed in the Mid-America Walking Atlas, the award-winning Gorge Trail is a two-mile <b>loop</b> along <b>Mill</b> Creek {{that consists of}} a boardwalk bordered on one side by the stream {{and on the other}} side by a massive wall of sandstone.|$|R

50|$|The {{design of}} the pull-tight seal {{configured}} of plastic {{in the form of}} arrows. They have a surface for marking individual number and latching mechanism on the one hand, and a plastic cable on the other. Like a zip tie, the cable forms a <b>loop</b> during <b>mill</b> threading into the collet, which can not be separated without damaging the cable or the locking mechanism. Its integrity is monitored through a transparent cover.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} a single track, and most {{services}} (which began from Hulme End, where the locomotive sheds were) only involved the use of one engine in steam. There was passing <b>loop</b> at Wetton <b>Mill,</b> {{but it was never}} used as such.|$|R
50|$|Two county roads {{passing through}} the refuge {{are open to the}} public {{throughout}} the year. Similar access is also provided at four viewpoints (kiosks and bulletin boards) and two trails (Woodpecker <b>Loop</b> and <b>Mill</b> Hill). To provide a quiet resting area, waterfowl habitat is closed to public entry while the geese are in residence, from November 1 through March 31. This winter waterfowl closure includes all portions of the refuge except the two trails, kiosks, bulletin boards, and headquarters building.|$|R
5000|$|Prices Mill is an unincorporated {{community}} in Simpson County, Kentucky, United States. It lies along Route 591 on the Little West Fork of the Red River, {{southwest of the}} city of Franklin, the county seat of Simpson County. [...] Its elevation is 574 feet (175 m). [...] The old mill from which the community took its name was on the south bank of the river, just across a small street from the Prices Mill Store. The old Prices Mill Store was located just off the Adairville Road on a short and then-unnamed street now called The Prices <b>Mill</b> <b>Loop.</b> The Prices <b>Mill</b> Store was operated at one time by (among many others) Val and Pauline Donnell, parents of noted Simpson County historian Dorothy Donnell Steers of Franklin, KY.|$|R

The conventional tuning procedureswhich useclosed loop cycling testsand openloopstep response tests were found to havelimitations. Asimple model allows process performance in the pan feed controlloop to be quantified. This enables meaningful comparisons between controlloopsto bemadeand simplifies trouble-shooting. The model provides {{the basis of a}} quick method for pan controlloop tuning which is presented in the paper as a step by step technique...|$|R
5000|$|Thompsonville was {{established}} in the 19th century as a carpet-manufacturing community. Orrin Thompson, from whom the community takes its name, built a dam across Freshwater Brook in 1828 and opened the first carpet mill in 1829. Thompson's first mill, named [...] "White Mill", employed skilled weavers brought from Scotland. Initially its product was largely flat-woven ingrain carpeting, an inexpensive type of carpeting, but over time it added more expensive weaves, such as three-ply ingrain and <b>loop</b> brussels. The <b>mill</b> had 230 looms in operation as of 1846.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{advantage}} to the 6mm cartridge was in the reduced weight of the ammunition: 220 6mm cartridges weighed approximately the same as 160 cartridges in [...]30 Army caliber. [...] The basic combat ammunition load of an 1898 naval bluejacket or marine was 180 rounds of 6mm ammunition packed five-round chargers (clips), and carried in black leather ammunition pouches. [...] Outfitted in this manner, a navy bluejacket or marine could carry considerably more ammunition {{than that of the}} typical Army trooper of the day, who usually carried 100 rounds of [...]30 Army ammunition in individual cartridge <b>loops</b> on his <b>Mills</b> canvas cartridge belt.|$|R
