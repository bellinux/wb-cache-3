When the company first chose to introduce a bottled water product, it chose Nestlé's Poland Spring brand over Coke's Dasani. When the contract expired in 2003, BK moved to Pepsi's Aquafina, the top-selling brand at the time. In 2008 Burger King renewed its relationship with Nestlé by entering into an agreement to sell Pure Life bottled water products. BK moved away from Pepsi's Tropicana brand juices in 2001 when it went with Coca-Cola's Minute Maid brands for the North America market. With the introduction of its Positive Steps nutrition program for children, the company turned to the Hershey Company to provide Hershey's branded <b>low-fat</b> <b>milk</b> in its North American stores. BK is utilizing a popular brand name to promote its products in a move to draw customers' attention to itself and its meal programs.|$|E

Key Words: fluld milk, household purchases, market participation Household expenditure patterns on whole-fat versus <b>low-fat</b> <b>milks</b> have changed markedly over the last several decades.

During this same time period, per capita consumption of <b>low-fat</b> <b>milks</b> increased by about 31 pounds (Putnam and Almshouse).

25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, <b>low-fat</b> <b>milk</b> layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the effect of milk fat substitution by (W 1 /O/W 2) multiple emulsions based on olive oil in comparison with full and <b>low-fat</b> <b>milks</b> on milk behavior during rennet coagulation. Therefore, based on the turbidimetric and conductivimetric methods, a follow up of enzymatic coagulation is realized. Drainage of renneted gels was followed by syneresis study and cheese yield. The comparison between the coagulation aptitude of low fat milk and milk-olive oil emulsion showed that the hydrolysis phase extended up to 35 minutes for full fat milk and up to 38 minutes for milk-olive oil emulsion. The transition phase solid/gel was shorter {{in the case of the}} whole milk. The reticulation phase was shorter in the case of milk-olive oil emulsion. The milk conductivity depended on the milk richness in fat content. Milk-olive oil emulsion showed the lowest cheese-making yield compared to its full and low-fat counterpart...|$|R

The experiment reported here sought to test whether qualities other than taste may also be acquired. Participants received pairings between odour A and <b>low-fat</b> unsweetened <b>milk</b> (LFUN), odour B and <b>low-fat</b> sweetened <b>milk</b> (LFSW), odour C and high-fat unsweetened milk (HFUN) and odour D and high-fat sweetened milk (HFSW). On test, participants reported that odours paired with milks perceived as being fattier (i. e. LFSW, HFUN, HFSW) were judged to smell fattier than they did prior to conditioning. In a further test, {{participants were asked to}} sample each of the four odours in a slightly fatty-sweet milk target. Odours previously paired with high-fat milks enhanced perceived fattiness of the target, whilst odours previously paired with sweetened milks enhanced perceived sweetness. These results were not well accounted for by participants’ explicit knowledge of the odour-milk pairings and suggest that fat-like qualities may be acquired. 9 page(s...|$|R
