6000|$|Two {{days after}} Mr. Brumley's visit Susan Burnet reached Black Strand. She too had been baffled for a while. For some {{week or more}} she couldn't {{discover}} the whereabouts of Lady Harman and lived in the profoundest perplexity. She had brought back her curtains to the Putney house in a large but <b>luggable</b> bundle, they were all made and ready to put up, and she found the place closed and locked, in the charge of a caretaker whose primary duty it was to answer no questions. It needed several days of thought and amazement, and {{a vast amount of}} [...] "I wonder," [...] and [...] "I just would like to know," [...] before it occurred to Susan that if she wrote to Lady Harman at the Putney address the letter might be forwarded. And even then she almost wrecked the entire enterprise by mentioning the money, and it was by a quite exceptional inspiration that she thought after all it was wiser not to say that but to state that she had finished the curtains and done everything (underlined) that Lady Harman had desired. Sir Isaac read it and tossed it over to his wife. [...] "Make her send her bill," [...] he remarked.|$|E
50|$|CatChum is a text-only clone of Pac-Man {{written for}} the CP/M {{operating}} system and made to be operated on the early Kaypro line of <b>luggable</b> computers.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} {{the name of an}} older <b>luggable</b> {{computer}} from the early 1980s, distinguished by being able to run both the MS-DOS and CP/M-80 operating systems.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Bondwell sold {{a line of}} Z80, CP/M-80 based Osborne-like <b>luggables</b> such as the models Bondwell-12, Bondwell-14 (1984) and Bondwell-16 (1985). An {{exceptional}} feature in these was an inbuilt speech synthesizer. Their prices were exceptionally affordable for the time, although significant trade-offs were made in regard to durability, for instance the chassis was rather flimsy plastic, falling {{far short of the}} ruggedness usually expected of <b>luggables.</b> The fanless power supply unit, located under the motherboard, often caused trouble. The choice of peripheral I/O devices made the use of interrupts virtually impossible.|$|R
25|$|Bill Gates {{claimed that}} the Apple II family with a Z-80 SoftCard was the single most-popular CP/M {{hardware}} platform. Many different brands of machines ran the operating system, some notable examples being the Altair 8800, the IMSAI 8080, the Osborne 1 and Kaypro <b>luggables,</b> and MSX computers. The best-selling CP/M-capable system of all time was probably the Amstrad PCW. In the UK, CP/M was also available on Research Machines educational computers (with the CP/M source code published as an educational resource), and for the BBC Micro when equipped with a Z80 co-processor. Furthermore, it was available for the Amstrad CPC series, the Commodore 128, TRS-80, and later models of the ZX Spectrum. CP/M 3 was also used on the NIAT, a custom handheld computer designed for A.C. Nielsen's internal use with 1Mbytes of SSD memory.|$|R
40|$|When the ENIAC was {{launched}} in 1946, no one could ever have imagined that the giant thinking machine would one day find itself inside the anthropos. However the continuing quest for miniaturisation has made this possible: from <b>luggables</b> to wearables, and now, ultimately to implantable devices. This paper explores the potential for RFID transponder implants in humans for emerging mobile commerce applications. Three usability contexts have been defined to explore the applications which are projected to become mainstream service offerings. This paper is significant because it dispels the common misconception that microchip implants for humans are still some time away. In fact, the findings indicate that implants are set to make a universal entry into the marketplace due to the additional convenience and level of control they promise. Owing to this, a point of urgency is made {{at the conclusion of}} the paper that more cross-disciplinary discourse has to now take place to ensure that adequate considerations have been made for the longer term especiall...|$|R
50|$|Ladder is a barrel-jumping game (like Donkey Kong) {{written for}} the CP/M {{operating}} system and made to be operated on the early Kaypro line of <b>luggable</b> computers.|$|E
50|$|The Seequa Chameleon was {{an early}} 1980s <b>luggable</b> {{personal}} computer; it was capable of running both the DOS and CP/M-80 operating systems. It did so by having both Zilog Z-80 and Intel 8088 microprocessors.|$|E
50|$|The Compaq Portable has {{basically}} the same hardware as an IBM PC, transplanted into a <b>luggable</b> case (specifically designed to fit as carry-on luggage on an airplane), with Compaq's BIOS instead of IBM's. All Portables shipped with 128k of RAM and 1-2 double-sided disk drives.|$|E
5000|$|The Compaq Portable was {{announced}} in November 1982 and first shipped in March 1983, priced at US $2,995 (...) with a single half-height 5¼" [...] 360 kB diskette drive or $3,590 for dual diskette drives. The 28 lb Compaq Portable folded up into a <b>luggable</b> case {{the size of a}} portable sewing machine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1984, Otrona {{introduced}} the [...] "2001" [...] model which had an Intel 8086 CPU as its primary microprocessor. This model {{was meant to}} be a lighter weight and technologically superior alternative to the mainstream IBM and Compaq <b>luggable</b> products of the day. Otrona engaged in a ground up development effort of the more, but not yet fully, PC compatible 2001 computer, incorporating a PC BIOS written by Steve Gray.|$|E
5000|$|The Portable was an XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style <b>luggable</b> case. The system {{featured}} 256 kilobytes {{of memory}} (expandable to 512 kB), an added CGA card connected {{to an internal}} monochrome (amber) composite monitor, {{and one or two}} half-height 5.25" [...] 360K floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA board and a composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television.|$|E
5000|$|The Vixen had a 4 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor, with 64 KB {{dynamic random-access memory}} (DRAM). It had a 7-inch {{diagonal}} {{amber display}} that could show 24 lines by 80 columns of memory mapped video. It used two 400 KB disk drives, utilizing double-density double-sided 5.25" [...] diskettes. As a <b>luggable,</b> it weighed about 18 pounds. Contemporary advertising pointed out that it could fit under the seat in an airplane, with dimensions of 12 by 16 by 6 inches (321 by 413 by 159 mm).|$|E
50|$|First, in the 1980s, the {{increasing}} availability of personal computers lowered {{the barriers to}} software development and made computers increasingly available to more managers. But it's worth remembering that even in 1987, selling strategic planning software often required selling a manager a computer and training them how to use productivity software (i.e. word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, outlining, etc.) Laptops were initially nonexistent {{and the state of}} art in portability was a sewing machine sized <b>luggable</b> computer. Previously, report creation often required hand writing or dictation which was then typed up by a secretary or word processing pool.|$|E
5000|$|The Portable was {{basically}} a PC/XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style <b>luggable</b> case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 512 kB on the motherboard), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome amber composite monitor, {{and one or two}} half-height 5¼" [...] 360 kB floppy disk drives. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA card and a 9" [...] amber monochrome composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could, however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television. A separate 83-key keyboard and cable was provided.|$|E
50|$|The Compaq Portable was {{the first}} {{portable}} computer created in 1982 {{which one of the}} first 100% IBM PC compatible systems. The first shipment was in March 1983 and was priced at $2,995. The Compaq Portable folded up into a <b>luggable</b> case the size of a portable sewing machine. The third model of this development, Compaq Portable II, featured high resolution graphics on its tube display. It {{was the first}} portable computer ready to be used on the shop floor, and for CAD and diagram display. It established Compaq as a major brand on the market.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{being the}} first model to be {{released}} commercially, the original system was branded as the Kaypro II (one {{of the most popular}} microcomputers at the time was the Apple II). The Kaypro II was designed to be portable like the Osborne. (When battery-powered laptop computers became available, the larger machines came to be called transportable [...] or <b>luggable,</b> rather than portable.) Set in an aluminum case with a keyboard that snapped onto the front covering the 9" [...] CRT display and drives, it weighed [...] and was equipped with a Zilog Z80 microprocessor, 64 kilobytes of RAM, and two 5¼-inch double-density floppy disk drives. It ran on Digital Research, Inc.'s CP/M operating system, and sold for about US $1,795 (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|I {{can confirm}} {{that this is}} one of the first ten {{prototype}} units built, known as the [...] "metal case" [...] units. I don't think they had serial numbers. The cases were made by Galgon Industries in Hayward, California but their quote for production was prohibitive, so work immediately commenced on the plastic cases. The circuit board was ready in January 1981 and these were built shortly thereafter. They were used in the first ads ("the guy on the left doesn't stand a chance") in which the veins on the hand of the guy on the right bulge as he struggles with the 30-pound weight of his transformer-powered <b>luggable.</b> These were the units we took to the West Coast Computer Faire and the National Computer Conference in early 1981.|$|E
5000|$|Westfalia-Werke also {{converted}} non-Volkswagen vans, {{and produced}} trailers and other products, {{but they were}} best known for their Volkswagen camper conversions. Westfalia began converting Volkswagen buses in 1951. Their famous [...] "pop-top" [...] package was added later, and became very popular on the second-generation VW Bus from 1968 to 1979, its successor the Vanagon, the Sven Hedin and Florida conversions on the Volkswagen LT, and then the T4 EuroVan, which was discontinued in 2003. This design also inspired many imitators, with dozens of other companies worldwide offering pop-top van conversions. Therefore, not all pop-top Volkswagens are Westfalia conversions, although in the United States, the Westfalia conversion {{was by far the}} most common. Conversely, not all Volkswagen Westfalia conversions had pop-tops or cooking facilities. Volkswagen offered a [...] "Weekender" [...] package in the 1970s with a Westfalia interior, but no pop-top. Later, some Vanagon conversions were offered with a pop-top and interior table, but lacked cooking facilities and instead included a <b>luggable</b> 12 volt refrigerator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{portable}} micro computer Portal of the French company R2E Micral CCMC officially {{appeared in}} September 1980 at the Sicob show in PARIS. It was a portable microcomputer designed and marketed by the studies and developments department of R2E Micral {{at the request}} of company CCMC specializing in payroll and accounting. It was based on an Intel 8085 processor, 8-bit, clocked at 2 MHZ. It was equipped with a central 64K bite Ram, a keyboard with 58 alpha numeric keys and 11 numeric keys ( [...] separate blocks [...] ), a 32-character screen, a floppy disk : capacity = 140 000 characters, of a thermal printer : speed = 28 characters / second, an asynchronous channel, a synchronous channel, a 220V power supply. It weighed 12Kg and its dimensions were 45cm x 45cm x 15cm. It provided total mobility. Its operating system was Prologue. The Osborne 1, released in 1981, was a <b>luggable</b> computer that used the Zilog Z80 and weighed 24.5 lb. It had no battery, a 5 in CRT screen, and dual 5.25 in single-density floppy drives. Both Tandy/RadioShack and HP also produced portable computers of varying designs during this period. The first laptops using the flip form factor appeared in the early 1980s. The Dulmont Magnum was released in Australia in 1981-82, but was not marketed internationally until 1984-85. The US$8,150 (US$ today) GRiD Compass 1101, released in 1982, was used at NASA and by the military, among others. The Sharp PC-5000, Ampere and Gavilan SC released in 1983. The Gavilan SC was described as a [...] "laptop" [...] by its manufacturer, while the Ampere had a modern clamshell design. The Toshiba T1100 won acceptance not only among PC experts but the mass market as a way to have PC portability.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic Resonance in {{its various}} {{implementations}} {{has proven to be}} among the most powerful, and certainly most general, analytical techniques available to modern science. Following several decades of development, {{the state of the art}} for clinical MRI and liquid/solid state spectroscopy instruments is very highly evolved, generally featuring expensive high field superconducting magnets. While low field permanent magnet based MR instruments feature inherently low SNR, with thermal polarization, the ideas of unilateral magnetic resonance (also termed ex situ NMR or single sided NMR) have captured the imagination of many researchers worldwide. These instruments are attractive and exhilarating because the development work is very hands-on and still very early stage- which means that new, simple, physical ideas are readily translated to new designs. Low field portable magnets (which includes <b>luggable</b> magnets), instruments, and associated measurement developments, over the last decade, will be reviewed in this tutorial lecture. Our emphasis will remain true single-sided instruments rather than the more general topic of low field magnetic resonance. Instrument developments over the last decade already demonstrate a number of trends, which permit reasonable extrapolation to future instruments and measurements. The tutorial will therefore conclude with judicious speculation on future unilateral MR instruments and measurements...|$|E
