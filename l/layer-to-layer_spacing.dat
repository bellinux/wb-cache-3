30|$|Because of a {{hydrophilic}} {{nature of}} the MMT, the organo-modification of the MMT {{is an important step}} in the preparation of MMT/HMDA composite. The organo-modification could change the hydrophilicity of Na-MMT to be more hydrophobic to generate a microchemical environment appropriate to the intercalation of MMT. Furthermore, the increase in the <b>layer-to-layer</b> <b>spacing</b> in the MMT is also desired. Primary aliphatic amines such as hexamethylenediamine and quaternary ammonium salts have been the most effective modifying reagents in the preparation of MMT/HMDA composite. Findings from the SEM images show that OMMT and clay-CNTs nanocomposite have uniform disperse and unique morphology. The clay-CNTs nanocomposite is favorable for many applications such as nanosponges for oil split remediation.|$|E

Two local nanoclays and a commercial, cation exchanged, reference were used {{in order to obtain}} the hybrid products. The local sodium and calcium nanoclays were first homoionized and then ion ex-changed with surfactants, being the main purpose to obtain similar reaction precursors as the commercial clay. Both local clay precursors and commercial clay showed similar crystallographic structure and <b>layer-to-layer</b> <b>spacing</b> after all phys-icochemical treatments. The best reaction conditions were first determined and then a simple infra-red based technique was implemented with the purpose to obtain the molecular weight of the hybrid products. It was determined that, sodium, calcium, and commercial nanoclays render relatively similar molecular weights of nanoclay hybrids using identical syn-thesis conditions. Thermal analyses indicated the formation of two and three melting endotherms in all cases depending on the isothermal crystallization temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns displayed crystal plane truncation which is usually observed in nanoclay hybrids. Plane truncation depended on the nanoclays nature, although the highest truncation was ob-served with commercial and sodium nanoclays. X-rays dispersion results allowed to infer the partial formation of non-hybrid polymer {{depending on the type of}} clay, sodium nanoclay showing the lesser proportion, and as a consequence the highest hybridization. Transmission electron microscopy results corroborated the relative degree of exfoliation and nano...|$|E
