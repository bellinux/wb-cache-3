40|$|The {{etiologic}} {{agent of the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III), has recently been shown to morphologically resemble and share sequence homology with visna virus, a pathogenic lentivirus. Molecular hybridization, heteroduplex mapping, and DNA sequence analyses were used to compare HTLV-III to other lentiviruses of domestic animals, including visna, caprine arthritis encephalitis, and equine infectious anemia viruses. Hybridization results showed that {{a substantial amount of}} sequence homology exists between each of these viruses and HTLV-III. In addition, a closer relationship was found between visna and caprine arthritis encephalitis viruses than for any of the other lentiviruses studied. These results, along with nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, have been used in a comprehensive effort to derive a systematic relationship for lentiviruses and to provide further evidence for classifying HTLV-III with the <b>Lentivirinae</b> <b>subfamily</b> of retroviruses. This relationship predicts that similarities in biology and disease process can be expected between HTLV-III and other Lentivirinae members...|$|E
40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is classified as a retrovirus because of its RNA genome {{and the fact that}} it requires reverse transcriptase to convert it into DNA. This virus belongs to the <b>lentivirinae</b> <b>subfamily</b> and is able to infect quiescent cells but is better known for its association with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and can be described as one of the most effective vectors for gene transfer. Biosafety concerns are present whenever viral vectors are employed but are particularly pertinent to the development of HIV-based vectors. Insertional mutagenesis and the production of new replication-competent viruses (RCV) have been pointed to as major problems, but experimental data have shown that safe protocols can be developed for their production and application. Virological, evolutionary, immunological and cell biology studies must be conducted jointly to allow the clinical use of HIV vectors. This review will focus on the general properties, production and applications of retrovectors in gene therapy, with particular emphasis on those based on HIV systems...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-I and HIV- 2), the causative agents of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans, {{are members of}} the <b>Lentivirinae</b> <b>subfamily</b> of the Retroviridae family. The lentivirus subfamily also includes related members from other species, like monkeys (simian {{immunodeficiency virus}}es [SIV]), cats (feline immunodeficiency viruses [FIV]), and the ungulates sheep, goats, horses and cattle. Mature lentiviruses are spherical to ellipsoid particles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm consisting of a lipid envelope surrounding a cone shaped core (Gelderblom et al 1989) (Fig. I). In HIV-I the core is formed by a 24 kd capsid protein (p 24). It contains two identical strands of positive-sense genomic RNA closely associated with the nucleocapsid proteins (p 7 and p 9) and several copies of the reverse transcriptase. A membrane associated matrix protein p 17 is situated between the core and the envelope. In the envelope a 41 kd transmembrane glycoprotein (gp 41) is anchored. The transmembrane protein is non-covalently attached to the 120 kd surface glycoprotein (gpI 20). The other lentiviruses have a similar structure, with slightly different molecular weights of their proteins...|$|E

Sensitive nzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot immunoassay were employed to confirm the specificity of these MAbs. Western blot analysis also indicated that MAbs to p 26 reacted with another EIAV protein of 55 000 apparent Mr (designated here as Pr 55 oÂ°o) present in density gradient-purified virus preparations. Rabbit antiserum prepared against p 26 as well as MAbs to p 26 detected Pr 55 gag and several other intermediate cleavage products in detergent-soluble lysates of virus-infected cells in Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays.

40|$|Maedi-visna (MVV) is a {{retrovirus}} of the <b>subfamily</b> <b>lentivirinae</b> {{which includes}} HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Infection of its natural host, the sheep, {{does not cause}} overt immunodeficiency, but rather a chronic inflammatory disease. However, subtle immunological changes following infection have been reported including a sheep IgG 1 subclass-restricted MVV-neutralizing antibody. Here we demonstrate by Western blotting {{that there is no}} IgG 2 serum antibody response to any MVV antigen after MVV infection, in contrast to infection with the parapox virus Orf, when serum IgG 2 anti-Orf antibody is readily detected. By ELISA, the IgG 1 antibody titres to Orf are higher than to MVV, but the minimum MVV serum antibody IgG 1 /IgG 2 ratio is significantly raised compared with that for Orf virus antibody in the same sheep, indicating that the IgG 2 defect in MVV infection cannot be accounted for by differences in the sensitivity of the Orf and MVV ELISA. Serum IgG 2 anti-MVV gag p. 25 can be detected in both normal and MVV-infected sheep following immunization with purified recombinant MVV gag p 25 protein in Freund's complete adjuvant. The failure to make an IgG 2 MVV-specific antibody indicates that immunological dysfunction can arise with macrophage tropic lentiviruses, and it may aid viral persistence...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. Since its {{discovery}} in 1983, {{millions of people}} worldwide have been infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is a singlestranded retrovirus belonging to the <b>Lentivirinae</b> <b>subfamily</b> of retroviruses and {{is responsible for the}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Haslett et al, 2002). The infection results {{in a wide range of}} clinical manifestations related to defective cell-mediated immunity (Beers and Berkow, 1999). At the end of the twentieth century, over 21 million individuals worldwide had died from AIDS, over 34 million were living with the HIV infection, and over 95 % of HIV-infected persons resided in developing nations (Klatt, 2005). At present, 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV/AIDS of which more than 26 million reside in Africa (Treatment Access, 2005). Sutherlandia frutescens, a medicinal plant from South Africa has documented anti-cancer and antiviral activity. One of the active compounds of this plant is L-canavanine, a cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor (Van Wyk and Gericke, 2000). In minute doses, the iNOS inhibitor may stimulate nitric oxide (NO) release to counteract retrovirus replication. This study aimed to ascertain the effect of Sutherlandia frutescens 200 CH on CD 4 cell counts and symptomatology in persons infected with HIV. Study parameters involved recording of vital signs, symptomatology and CD 4 analysis at three separate consultations over a ten-week period. All information was collected and collated for statistical or descriptive analysis. The research study was carried out on a random sample size of twenty-six participants, between the age of seventeen and fifty years over a period of ten weeks. Participants included both genders and had been previously diagnosed HIV-positive. Persons using antiretroviral treatment or falling into Category C as specified in the Centres for Disease Control Classification (Appendix B), were excluded from the sample group. Participants acted as own controls for the study with the use of a CD 4 analysis baseline reading at the first consultation. Participants were then assessed at mid-term (week 5) and final consultations (week 10) during the study. Sutherlandia frutescens 200 CH, in granule form, was taken sublingually once a day for two weeks, with participants then taking no medication for three weeks until the mid-term consultation. The treatment regimen was repeated in the second half of the study. Physical examinations to assess vital signs and opportunistic infections, completion of a health status questionnaire and report-back sessions were conducted at all consultations to determine a general symptomatic picture of research participants. Blood samples taken at all consultations were analysed for CD 45 + white cell count, CD 4 percentage of lymphocytes and absolute CD 4 cell count. The McNemar test and a One Factor Repeated Measure (ANOVA) test were used to give statistical results and to form a profile analysis. Analysed results show that treatment with Sutherlandia frutescens 200 CH significantly improves several common signs and symptoms experienced by HIV positive people, including oral candidiasis, fever and skin rashes; a number of other pathologies showed improvement, but not to a statistically significant level. The analysis of CD 4 cell counts demonstrated a significant decrease of absolute CD 4 cell counts during the course of the study, even in the presence of a stable CD 4 percentage. Statistical analysis also indicated a lack of consistency in change of CD 4 percentage and absolute CD 4 between participants, as well as a lack of correlation between change of CD 4 percentage and absolute CD 4 changes. As NO was not tested directly no assumption can be made as to how these results might have been influenced. Further research into the use of Sutherlandia frutescens in the treatment of HIV is none the less to be recommended given its reported large number of medicinal properties and its extensive use as an herbal supplement in HIV treatment in South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) {{is classified as}} a member of the genus Lentivirus (<b>subfamily</b> <b>Lentivirinae)</b> of the Retroviridae family on basis of its morphology, biochemical characteristics, genomic organization, Mg'+ dependent reverse transcriptase, and nucleotide sequence homology with other members of this genus. Lentiviruses cause chronic, lifelong infections in their respective host species, which may be followed by a slowly progressive and degenerative disease. FIV was first isolated from a domestic cat suffering from an immunodeficiency syndrome reminiscent of AIDS in humans. Subsequently it was shown that upon FIV infection, domestic cats may develop an immunodeficiency syndrome, hallmarked by secondary and opportunistic infections. The clinical stages preceding the final stage of feline AIDS, are similar to those observed in humans with HIV infection: the acute stage is followed by the asymptomatic carrier (AC) stage, after which a persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) gradually leads to the stage of AIDS related complex (ARC). Then the animal develops full blown AIDS. The different stages of F 1 V infection of cats may often not be quite distinct and rapid transitions between the respective stages may be observed (see below). FIV infections occur virtually worldwide in domestic cats and to date three viral clades (A, B, and C) with partially overlapping geographical distributions have been identified on basis of env sequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Â  Equine {{infectious}} anemia (EIA) {{is caused}} by the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), which infects the animals in the family Equidae and is classified in the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Lentivirinae</b> of the family Retroviridae. The disease leads to fever, hemolytic anemias, icterus, depression and chronic weight loss. This study was conducted on 287 horses (200 male and 87 female) in Tabriz area in Iran {{in order to determine the}} seroprevalence of equine infectious anemia. Blood was collected from all horses and the sera were analyzed for the presence of antibodies to equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) using an ELISA test with IDEXX kit. The mean of Optical Density (OD) was 0. 372 Â± 0. 016. Â  In these samples the lowest and highest levels were 0. 273 and 0. 511 respectively. There was no positive case according to the observed results. Mean OD was 0. 381 Â± 0. 014 in male horses and 0. 387 Â± 0. 010 in female horses, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P= 0. 356).

40|$|Previous {{results from}} our {{laboratory}} {{have demonstrated that}} equine infectious anemia virus displays structural variations in its surface glycoproteins and RNA genome during passage and chronic infections in experimentally infected Shetland ponies (Montelaro et al., J. Biol. Chem. 259 : 10539 - 10544, 1984; Payne et al., J. Gen. Virol. 65 : 1395 - 1399, 1984). The present study was undertaken to obtain an antigenic and biochemical characterization of equine infectious anemia virus isolates recovered from an experimentally infected pony during sequential disease episodes, each separated by intervals of only 4 to 8 weeks. The virus isolates could be distinguished antigenically by neutralization assays with serum from the infected pony and by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against the major surface glycoprotein gp 90, thus demonstrating that novel antigenic variants of equine infectious anemia virus predominate during each clinical episode. The respective virion glycoproteins displayed different electrophoretic mobilities on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, indicating structural variation. Tryptic peptide and glycopeptide maps of the viral proteins of each virus isolate revealed biochemical alterations involving amino acid sequence and glycosylation patterns in the virion surface glycoproteins gp 90 and gp 45. In contrast, no structural variation was observed in the internal viral proteins pp 15, p 26, and p 9 {{from any of the}} four virus isolates. Oligonucleotide mapping experiments revealed similar but unique RNase T 1 -resistant oligonucleotide fingerprints of the RNA genomes of each of the virus isolates. Localization of altered oligonucleotides for one virus isolate placed two of three unique oligonucleotides within the predicted env gene region of the genome, perhaps correlating with the structural variation observed in the envelope glycoproteins. Thus these results support the concept that equine infectious anemia virus is indeed capable of relatively rapid genomic variations during replication, some of which result in altered glycoprotein structures and antigenic variants which are responsible for the unique periodic disease nature observed in persistently infected animals. The findings of envelope specific differences in isolates of visna virus and of human T-cell lymphotropic virus III (acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related virus) suggest that this variation may be a common characteristic of the <b>subfamily</b> <b>Lentivirinae...</b>|$|R
