5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet authorities to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not been}} available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, a cinema {{owner in}} Brighton persuaded Hendry to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> the films, {{so as to}} screen the episodes for profit while the Panopticon VI {{convention}} was being held in the town. Saied Marham, an associate of Hendry's, visited Panopticon to generate interest in the showing, only to be dismissed as a hoaxster, and the screening did not go ahead.|$|E
5|$|By {{now it was}} mid-August, {{more than}} three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> Yelcho, a small steam tug that had {{assisted}} Emma during the previous attempt. The Government agreed, and on 25 August Yelcho, captained by Luis Pardo, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{decides to}} invest in pumpkins, but loses his entire investment. Late on a {{mortgage}} payment and short on money, he tries to borrow some, but to no avail. Homer keeps his money troubles secret from Marge. Meanwhile, Patty and Selma have received a promotion at the DMV. As a last resort, Homer asks the two if they will <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> the money, and they agree {{on the condition that}} he become their loyal servant. Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{began to}} make common cause with the Optimates, the former enemies of Caesar. In September, the leading Optimate orator Marcus Tullius Cicero began to attack Antony {{in a series of}} speeches portraying him {{as a threat to the}} Republican order. With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of {{consular}} power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> control over Cisalpine Gaul, which had been assigned as part of his province, from Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus, one of Caesar's assassins.|$|E
5|$|In 1088, Robert's {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of England began to falter, {{and he turned to}} Henry, proposing that his brother <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> some of his inheritance, which Henry refused. Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000. Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the Cotentin, but it extended across the Avranchin, with control over the bishoprics of both. This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, Hugh d'Avranches and Richard de Redvers, and the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, whose lands spread out further across the Duchy. Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.|$|E

5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to <b>lend</b> <b>him,</b> the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E
5|$|The {{colony of}} Ubangi-Shari {{received}} its autonomy in 1958 as the Central African Republic and this became independent from France in 1960. In 1970, President Jean-Bédel Bokassa inaugurated the University of Bangui. He established the national airline Air Centrafrique {{the following year}} and ordered the construction of two new luxury hotels in Bangui. With tensions mounting between Bangui and Paris {{as a result of}} Bokassa's uncontrollable expenditures, western banks refused to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> any more money. Relations with the French worsened still further in April 1974, when Brigette Miroux's body was discovered in a hotel room in Bangui. It was reported in the French media that she had been Bokassa's mistress and that he was responsible for her murder. As a result, Bokassa banned imports of French newspapers and assumed control of the Agence France-Presse office in Bangui. By 1975, Bangui had a population of 300,723.|$|E
5|$|Though it had {{operated}} {{mainly as}} a ground-attack unit with its Mustangs, No.77 Squadron's primary {{role in the}} RAAF was interception, and {{it was hoped that}} with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties, particularly as the USAF had only two squadrons of Sabres in Korea. Cresswell therefore arranged for the USAF to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> a Sabre to simulate a MiG-15 in combat training with the Meteors at Iwakuni; he determined that the Meteor's manoeuvrability and rate of climb allowed it to match the swept-wing jet below , so that the best air-to-air tactic would be to work in concert with USAF Sabres operating at high level while the Australians flew at lower altitudes. On 20July, No.77 Squadron began moving to Kimpo, South Korea, where it was tasked by the USAF's 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing.|$|E

25|$|When Sutter’s {{oldest son}} John Augustus Sutter, Jr. arrived from Switzerland in September, Sutter, Sr. asked Lienhard to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> his {{half of the}} gold he had mined, so that Sutter could impress his son with {{a large amount of}} the {{precious}} metal. However, when Lienhard later went to the Fort, Sutter, Jr., having taken charge of his father’s debt-ridden business, was unable to return his share of the gold to him. Lienhard finally accepted Sutter’s flock of sheep instead and spent the following winter with Jacob Dürr, also a Swiss, at the sheep farm not far from the Fort.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Álvaro de Luna {{immediately}} initiated {{contact with}} Charles of Viana, to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> {{aid in the}} civil war then brewing in Navarre between Charles and his stepfather, the king of Aragon. John II of Aragon ultimately defeated his stepson, and, in retaliation for de Luna's aid, in 1449 he again invaded Castilian territory, this time laying siege to Cuenca {{with the help of the}} city's chief warder, the traitor Diego de Mendoza. Barrientos was by this time the Bishop of Cuenca, and faithful to John II of Castile. Accordingly, he personally organized the defense of the city. With the help of the locals, they held back the enemy long enough for Constable de Luna to arrive with reinforcements. The invaders were eventually repelled.|$|E
25|$|On {{his way to}} Batavia to ask for Dutch's help, Amangkurat I died in {{the village}} of Tegalarum near Tegal just after his expulsion, making Amangkurat II king in 1677. He too was nearly helpless, having fled without an army nor {{treasury}} to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), who then went to war to reinstate him. He promised to give VOC the port town of Semarang if they <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> some troops. For the Dutch, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favourable terms. They were willing to lend their military might to keep the kingdom together.|$|E

25|$|The Catual sees {{a number}} of {{paintings}} that depict significant figures and events from Portuguese history, {{all of which are}} detailed by the author. Bacchus appears in a vision to a Muslim priest in Samorin's court and convinces him that the explorers are a threat. The priest spreads the warnings among the Catuals and the court, prompting Samorin to confront da Gama on his intentions. Da Gama insists that the Portuguese are traders, not buccaneers. The king then demands proof from da Gama's ships, but when he tries to return to the fleet, da Gama finds that the Catual, who has been corrupted by the Muslim leaders, refuses to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> a boat at the harbor and holds him prisoner. Da Gama manages to get free only after agreeing to have all of the goods on the ships brought to shore to be sold.|$|E
25|$|Although {{another plane}} was {{prepared}} for the passengers, Gleason {{had had enough of}} flying. He went into downtown Tulsa, walked into a hardware store, and asked its owner to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> $200 for the train trip to New York. The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation. The store owner said he would lend the money if the local theater had a photo of Gleason in his latest film. But the publicity shots showed only the principal stars. Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; {{he would be able to}} see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, and he took the next train to New York. There he borrowed $200 to repay his benefactor.|$|E
25|$|During the Revolutionary War, Revere {{continued}} {{his efforts to}} move upwards in society into the gentry. After his failed efforts to become a military officer he attempted to become a merchant, but was hindered {{by a number of}} factors: while he was a fairly well-off member of the artisan class, {{he did not have the}} resources to afford the goods he would have sold as a merchant, nor were lenders in England willing to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> the required startup capital. Other American merchants of the time collaborated with colleagues in England. However, Revere's inexperience as a merchant meant that he had not yet established such relationships and was not able to communicate as effectively on unfamiliar matters. Another factor preventing Revere’s success as a merchant was the economic climate of the time period after the war known as the Critical Period; while the colonies had seen a time of economic growth before the war, the colonies experienced a severe post-war depression, constraining the overall success of his business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] Cuthbert exclaimed. [...] "Some {{traveler}} {{coming after}} us is attacked by these horrible beasts. Let us sally out, Cnut. We cannot hear a Christian torn to pieces by these beasts, without <b>lending</b> <b>him</b> a hand." ...|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} 1920, Macleod was {{approached}} by Frederick Grant Banting, a young Canadian physician who had the idea of curing diabetes using an extract from a pancreas whose functioning had been disrupted. Macleod was not enthusiastic, because (unlike Banting) he knew about unsuccessful experiments in this direction by other researchers. He thought {{it more likely that}} the nervous system had a crucial role in regulating blood glucose concentration. Even though Banting had virtually no experience of physiology, he managed to convince Macleod to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> laboratory space during a vacation in Scotland that summer. In addition to the laboratory, Macleod provided experimental animals and his student Charles Herbert Best, who worked as a demonstrator. Macleod also advised on project planning and the use of analytical techniques, and assisted with the operation on the first dog. While Macleod was away, Banting and Best achieved a breakthrough: they isolated an internal secretion of the pancreas and succeeded in reducing the blood sugar level of another dog, whose pancreas had been surgically removed.|$|E
25|$|In Lucis, Noctis and {{his friends}} Gladiolus, Ignis, and Prompto are en route to Accordo's capital city of Altissia, where Noctis’ wedding to Lunafreya is to take place. Along the way, they receive news of the empire's attack on Insomnia and theft of the Crystal, and that Noctis’ father King Regis has been assassinated. They meet up with Crownsguard {{commander}} Cor Leonis, who tasks Noctis with retrieving the weapons of the Lucii—the ancient kings of Lucis—in order to rescue the Crystal and reclaim his throne. The party also comes across Niflheim's chancellor Ardyn Izunia, who guides them to the Astral Titan at the Disc of Cauthess. After he fulfills Titan's trial and fights off imperial forces attacking the Astral, Noctis learns that Lunafreya persuaded Titan to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> his power. They continue to travel across Lucis, retrieving Noctis’ ancestral relics and meeting the Astral Ramuh with assistance from Gentiana, Lunafreya's spirit attendant. Over {{the course of their}} journey, they discover days are steadily growing shorter, accompanied by the Daemons increasing in number. These phenomena are part of the Starscourge, which if left unchecked, will see Eos plunged into eternal darkness and overrun by Daemons.|$|E
25|$|When Sigismund {{found out}} about what had {{happened}} in Finland he lost his patience. The King could not accept Duke Charles's disrespectful actions and decided to use force. This decision eventually would cost him the Swedish crown. In February 1598 Sigismund assembled an army consisting of merely 5,000 men, mostly Hungarian and German mercenaries. A larger army had been proposed but had been dismissed because Sigismund expected Swedish forces to join him, and he also wished to avoid conflict with them. The advisers and the King expected military support from Finland and Estonia (homes of the Swedish gentry formerly commanded by Fleming). They also wanted help from Denmark–Norway and pro-Sigismund parts of Sweden. The diplomat Laski was dispatched, but Denmark did not show any interest. In May, Sigismund's men started to advance northwards. The army gathered in Marienburg (Malbork), where the Livonian Jürgen Farensbach was appointed commander. The army was to be transported from Danzig (Gdańsk) to Sweden on Swedish ships, but the Swedish Estates declined. They refused to <b>lend</b> <b>him</b> ships as long as he stayed with a foreign army. There was widespread suspicion against Sigismund and his Catholic warriors. Thus the Estates promised to protect Duke Charles and the others who rebelled against the King.|$|E
