40|$|Abstract A new {{technique}} of designing multilevel <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> is presented. Distance-preserving mappings from binary sequences to permutation sequences are used, where the permutation sequences also have spectral nulls properties. The resultant <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> use {{the structure of}} the convolutional codes and thus have certain advantages compared to other published <b>line</b> <b>codes...</b>|$|R
50|$|For this reason, {{most modern}} <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> are {{designed}} to produce DC-balanced waveforms. The most common classes of DC-balanced <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> are constant-weight codes and paired-disparity codes.|$|R
50|$|Bit-sequence-independence allows only <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> {{that have}} {{the same number of}} {{transitions}} per bit, otherwise, the <b>line</b> <b>code</b> is dependent on the bit sequence and, therefore, bit-sequence dependent.|$|R

50|$|Some {{communication}} systems omit {{one or more}} of these steps,or use techniques that combine several of these steps together.For example, a Morse code transmitter combines source coding, channel coding, and <b>line</b> <b>coding</b> into one step, typically followed by an amplitude modulation step.Barcodes, on the other hand, add a checksum digit during channel coding, then translate each digit into a barcode symbol during <b>line</b> <b>coding,</b> omitting modulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Line</b> <b>coding</b> {{consists}} of representing the digital signal to be transported, by an amplitude- and time-discrete signal, that is optimally tuned {{for the specific}} properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital signal on a transmission link is called line encoding. After <b>line</b> <b>coding,</b> the signal can directly be put on a transmission line, {{in the form of}} variations of the current. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar and Manchester encoding.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, {{the hybrid}} (H-) ternary <b>line</b> <b>code</b> is a <b>line</b> <b>code</b> that {{operates}} on a hybrid principle combining the binary non-return-to-zero-level (NRZ-L) and the polar return-to-zero (RZ) codes.|$|R
40|$|A {{verification}} for {{the accurate}} {{calculation of the}} power specfral density of the H-Ternary <b>line</b> <b>code</b> is carried ouf in this paper. The power spectral density is evaluated {{through the use of}} a Matlab simulation model. The model considers the generation of a P-N sequence and encodes it to the Hternary code. The FFT techniques are used to determine the power spectral density of the <b>line</b> <b>code.</b> The results obtainedfi-om the simulation model reveal a total agreement with that of the theoretical model. Both results show a favourable spectrum of the proposed <b>line</b> <b>code</b> compared with other <b>line</b> <b>codes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Unipolar {{encoding}} is a <b>line</b> <b>code.</b> A {{positive voltage}} represents a binary 1, and zero volts indicates a binary 0. It is the simplest <b>line</b> <b>code,</b> directly encoding the bitstream, and {{is analogous to}} on-off keying in modulation.|$|R
50|$|A {{line code}} (also called digital {{baseband}} modulation or digital baseband transmission method) is a code chosen for use within a communications system for baseband transmission purposes. <b>Line</b> <b>coding</b> {{is often used}} for digital data transport.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Line</b> <b>coding</b> {{should make}} it {{possible}} for the receiver to synchronise itself to the phase of the received signal. It is also preferred for the line code to have a structure that will enable error detection.|$|E
50|$|The aim {{of digital}} {{baseband}} modulation methods, {{also known as}} <b>line</b> <b>coding,</b> is to transfer a digital bit stream over a baseband channel, typically a non-filtered copper wire such as a serial bus or a wired local area network.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> are {{designed}} to be self-clocking.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> {{designed to be}} polarity insensitive -- whether the data stream is inverted or not, the decoded data will always be correct.The <b>line</b> <b>codes</b> with this property include differential Manchester encoding, bipolar encoding, NRZI, biphase mark code, coded mark inversion, and MLT-3 encoding.|$|R
40|$|A new slope <b>line</b> <b>code</b> for {{information}} transmission and storage has been proposed. The <b>line</b> <b>code</b> operates {{on the principle}} of slope coding. Two alternative slopes are used to transmit or store the binary information 1 s and 0 s. The decoder extracts the binary information from the received multilevel signal using slope comparison technique with slope violation detector from the incoming symbols. The encoder and decoder operation is described. A simulation of the encoder and decoder has been carried out using MultiSIMÂ® software. The simulated results are in thorough agreement with the theory. The slope <b>line</b> <b>code</b> also meets the many desirable features of other <b>line</b> <b>codes.</b> This makes it attractive and suitable for data transmission and storage on different types of telecommunication networks and multimedia systems...|$|R

5000|$|... 10G-EPON uses 64B/66B <b>line</b> <b>coding,</b> thus {{encoding}} overhead is just 3.125% {{compared to}} 25% encoding overhead that 1G-EPON has {{due to its}} use of 8b/10b encoding.The usable bandwidth in 10G-EPON is 10 Gbit/s out of a raw bandwidth of 10.3125 Gbit/s.|$|E

50|$|The BER may be {{improved}} by choosing a strong signal strength (unless this causes cross-talk and more bit errors), by choosing a slow and robust modulation scheme or <b>line</b> <b>coding</b> scheme, and by applying channel coding schemes such as redundant forward error correction codes.|$|E
