40|$|Abstract—The {{frequency}} {{dependence of the}} phase field model(PFM) is studied. A simple PFM is proposed, and is tested in a <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer.</b> The Blasius’s <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer</b> solution on a flat plate {{is used for the}} flow pattern, and several frequencies are imposed on the PFM, and the decay times of the interfaces are obtained. The computations were conducted for three cases: 1) no-flow, and 2) a half ball on the <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer,</b> 3) a line of mass sources in the <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer.</b> The computations show the decay time becomes shorter as the frequency goes larger, and also show that it is sensitive to both background disturbances and surface tension parameters. It is concluded that the proposed simple PFM can describe the properties of decay process, and could give the fundamentals for the decay of the interface in turbulent flows.

50|$|Another {{example is}} the flow of air over an {{aircraft}} wing. The boundary layer is a very thin sheet of air lying {{over the surface of}} the wing (and all other surfaces of the aircraft). Because air has viscosity, this layer of air tends to adhere to the wing. As the wing moves forward through the air, the boundary layer at first flows smoothly over the streamlined shape of the airfoil. Here, the flow is laminar and the boundary layer is a <b>laminar</b> <b>layer.</b> Prandtl applied the concept of the laminar boundary layer to airfoils in 1904.|$|E
50|$|The flow over a body {{may begin}} as laminar. As a fluid flows over a surface shear {{stresses}} within the fluid slow additional fluid particles causing the boundary layer {{to grow in}} thickness. At some point along the flow direction, the flow becomes unstable and becomes turbulent. Turbulent flow has a fluctuating and irregular pattern of flow which are made obvious by the formation of vortices. While the turbulent layer grows, the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer</b> thickness decreases. This results in a thinner laminar boundary layer which, relative to laminar flow, depreciates the magnitude of friction force as fluid flows over the object.|$|E

5000|$|The coffin bone, {{also known}} as the pedal bone (U.S.), is the bottommost bone in the equine leg and is encased by the hoof capsule. Also known as the distal phalanx, third phalanx, or [...] "P3". The coffin bone meets the short pastern bone or second phalanx at the coffin joint. [...] The coffin bone is {{connected}} to the inner wall of the horse hoof by a structure called the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer.</b> The insensitive laminae coming in from the hoof wall connects to the sensitive laminae layer, containing the blood supply and nerves, which is attached to the coffin bone. The lamina is a critical structure for hoof health, therefore any injury to the hoof or its support system can in turn affect the coffin bone.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{protection}} {{provided by the}} hoof, the coffin bone can be injured and fractured. [...] For example, inflammatory conditions such as laminitis may lead to rotation of the coffin bone and associated permanent damage due to the coffin bone pulling away from the hoof wall as the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer</b> tears apart. Pedal osteitis is another common inflammatory condition. Fractures can also occur to coffin bones and, depending on the fracture, can cause severe lameness. [...] Other conditions linked to the conformation of the horse, such as flexural contractures may also affect the coffin bone. For example, the coffin joint can become deformed and lead to changes of the coffin bone within the hoof capsule if the horse has an untreated club foot. [...] Contracted heels can also affect {{the shape of the}} coffin bone, making it grow away from its normal, healthy shape. [...] X-rays can diagnose injury, determine the position of the bone, and verify the type of damage that may have been received. Once injured, remedial shoeing can help protect the coffin bone from further trauma. Treatment of assorted disorders may also involve use of shoe pads, anti-inflammatory medication, and management changes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Isotopic {{fractionation}} is {{the basic}} study of isotope tracer method. The most common fractionation {{of water in the}} natural is diffusion controlled kinetic fractionation in the process of evaporation. This process is now commonly represented by Cappa equation. In Cappa’s concept model, the atmosphere was divided into two layers, the free atmosphere and the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer</b> above the surface of evaporating water. In this article, a modified three layer model was used to represent experiments of Cappa (2003). It was shown that there was a third layer between free atmosphere and the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer,</b> the mixing layer. The simulated results also indicate that: (1) in test one, in which dry air was used as the inlet air, all vapor in the free air was from evaporating. Cappa Model can represents the experiment as well as the three layer model; (2) in test two, in which 50 % humidity of air was used as the inlet air, results calculated by Cappa Model showed apparent depleted deviation from measured data; (3) the best fit result of test two supports the exist of the third layer, the mixed layer. It was also indicates that the vapor of mixed layer is made up of partial vapor from free atmosphere and all vapor from <b>laminar</b> <b>layer.</b> The modified Cappa model can represent all tests...|$|E

40|$|Lately it {{has been}} {{proposed}} to reduce the friction drag of a body in a flow for the technically important large Reynolds numbers by the following expedient: the boundary layer, normally turbulent, is artificially kept laminar up to high Reynolds numbers by suction. The reduction in friction drag thus obtained is {{of the order of}} magnitude of 60 to 80 percent of the turbulent friction drag, since the latter, for large Reynolds numbers, is several times the laminar friction drag. In considering the idea mentioned one has first to consider whether suction is a possible means of keeping the boundary <b>layer</b> <b>laminar.</b> This question can be answered by a theoretical investigation of the stability of the <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer</b> with suction. A knowledge, as accurate as possible, of the velocity distribution in the <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer</b> with suction forms the starting point for the stability investigation. E.

40|$|The rate of heat {{transfer}} between a fluid stream in turbulent flow and a smooth, solid wall is largely {{controlled by the}} relatively high resistance of the laminar sublayer next to the wall. Although this <b>laminar</b> <b>layer</b> ii extremely thin, heat can be transferred through it only by molecular diffusion. Hence the resistance of this layer is very much greater than for a layer the same thickness farther out in the stream where turbulent exchange is the controlling factor. The thickness of the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer</b> is difficult to define precisely, since there is a gradual transition to the turbulent flow outside, but for the usual scale of many engineering applications almost half the temperature difference between the fluid and the wall occurs in a layer of a few thousands of an inch in thickness. When the wall is made of porous material and a coolant gas is forced through the wall into the stream, {{it has been found}} that a very small flow rate of the coolant is remarkably effective in keeping the wall at a low temperature. The coolant flow rate required is such as to give an average velocity normal cooling wall of the order of 1 per cent of the main stream velocity. This flow rate is so low that clearly the injected gas must act as an insulator rather than as a normal coolant. Because of its relatively low velocity, the injected gas can have very little influence on heat convection or momentum transfer in the turbulent stream, and its effect must be confined to the laminar sublayer. The possible influence of the coolant flow on the thickness of the <b>laminar</b> <b>layer</b> will be discussed in Section V...|$|E

As a result, {{the flexibility of the}} plate becomes a source of early transition. The <b>laminar</b> boundary <b>layer</b> at {{the leading edge of the}} plate reacts to small, upstream, unsteady disturbances due to a streamwise pressure gradient.
