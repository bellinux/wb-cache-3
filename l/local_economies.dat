5|$|Everglades National Park {{reported}} in 2005 {{a budget of}} over $28million. Of that, $14.8million is granted from the National Park Service, and $13.5million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for vehicles in 2006 ranged from $10 to $200 for bus tours. Of the nearly one million visitors to Everglades National Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a night for backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48million in <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b> More than 900jobs were sustained or created within or by the park, and the park added value of $35million to <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{outlying}} {{areas around the}} bay remain semi-rural. Cattle ranching and agriculture remain staples of some <b>local</b> <b>economies</b> as well as shrimp fishing and oyster farming.|$|E
5|$|Larger <b>local</b> <b>economies</b> in {{the more}} populous {{counties}} {{to the east and}} west offer additional employment and commerce, particularly in the cities of Lafayette and West Lafayette in Tippecanoe County and the city of Danville in Vermilion County, Illinois.|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{currencies}} {{are reported}} {{to work as a}} counterbalance for the <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b> They increase in activity if the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> slows down, and decrease in activity if the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> goes up.|$|R

5|$|There is a {{rich history}} of {{settlements}} on the bay, including: ancient Native American campgrounds dating back millennia; 19th-century European immigrant towns such as Lamar and Aransas; and the present day cities of Rockport, Fulton and Aransas Pass. Resources such as shrimp, fish, oysters and oil are found {{in or near the}} bay, and contribute to the <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} annually {{cause damage}} to infrastructure and <b>local</b> <b>economies</b> {{as well as}} loss of life. In 2004 Cyclone Gafilo became the strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Madagascar. The storm killed 172 people, left 214,260 homeless and caused more than US$250million in damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Local</b> <b>economies</b> near major {{coral reefs}} {{benefit from an}} {{abundance}} of fish and other marine creatures as a food source. Reefs also provide recreational scuba diving and snorkeling tourism. These activities can damage coral but international projects such as Green Fins that encourage dive and snorkel centres to follow a Code of Conduct have been proven to mitigate these risks.|$|E

50|$|The <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> {{was based}} on {{agriculture}} and herding in the alpine meadows. In recent decades the services sector dominated the <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b> After 1960, {{a number of new}} houses were built in the village.|$|R
5|$|Most {{settlers}} in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed {{within a few}} decades {{as varied as the}} settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply. Cities eventually dotted the coast to support <b>local</b> <b>economies</b> and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west.|$|E
5|$|Several notable and {{damaging}} medicanes {{are known to}} have occurred. In September 1969, a north African Mediterranean tropical cyclone produced flooding that killed nearly 600individuals, left 250,000homeless, and crippled <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b> A medicane in September1996 that developed in the Balearic Islands region spawned six tornadoes and inundated parts of the islands. Several medicanes have also been subject to extensive study, such as those of January1982, January1995, September2006, November2011, and November2014. The January1995 storm is one of the best-studied Mediterranean tropical cyclones, with its close resemblance to tropical cyclones elsewhere and availability of observations. The medicane of September2006, meanwhile, is well-studied due to availability of existing observations and data. In November2011, the NOAA's Satellite Analysis Branch monitored a medicane, named Rolf by the Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin), though it ceased doing so the following month. In 2015, the NOAA resumed issuing advisories for tropical systems in the Mediterranean region.|$|E
5|$|Sheep are an {{important}} part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. China, Australia, India, and Iran have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many <b>local</b> <b>economies,</b> which may be niche markets focused on organic or sustainable agriculture and local food customers. Especially in developing countries, such flocks may be a part of subsistence agriculture rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in barter economies.|$|E
50|$|McKenzie's {{contribution}} to the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> and the <b>local</b> business sector has been recognised by stakeholders across the island, as she is frequently asked to contribute to crucial discussions impacting the <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b> McKenzie is {{a regular contributor to}} discussions hosted by the BBC, Ulster Bank and UTV amongst others, and as such has helped shape local understanding of the labour market and the contributions the business sector makes to the <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|R

5|$|To {{promote the}} {{missions}} {{as a tourist}} destination, travel agencies, chambers of commerce and industry, the towns' mayors, native communities and other institutions organized the , a five-day tourist event lasting from March 23–27, 2006. Journalists and international tour operators were shown the important tourist attractions, and introduced to the culture through visits to museums, local workshops, various concerts, native dances, high masses, processions, crafts festivals, and local cuisine. The organisers’ goal initially was to raise the number of tourists from 25,000 to 1 million per year over a ten-year period, which would have represented US$400 million of income. Subsequently, {{in the face of}} lack of support from the Bolivian government and the downturn of the national and <b>local</b> <b>economies,</b> a more modest goal of attracting between 200,000 and 250,000 people per annum was established.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, the Texas Railroad Commission, {{which had}} been given {{regulatory}} control of the Texas oil industry, managed to stabilize American oil production and eliminate most of the wild price swings that were common during the earlier years of the boom. Many small towns, such as Wortham, which had become boomtowns during the 1920s saw their booms end in the late 1920s and early 1930s as their <b>local</b> <b>economies</b> collapsed, resulting from their dependence on relatively limited petroleum reservoirs. As production peaked {{in some of these}} smaller fields and the Great Depression lowered demand, investors fled. In the major refining and manufacturing centers such as Beaumont, Houston, and Dallas, the boom continued to varying degrees until the end of World War II. By the end of the war, the economies of the major urban areas of the state had matured. Though Texas continued to prosper and grow, the extreme growth patterns and dramatic socioeconomic changes of the earlier years largely subsided as the cities settled into more sustainable patterns of growth. Localized booms in West Texas and other areas, however, continued to transform some small communities during the post-war period.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the bay {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered whooping crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b> Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E

40|$|The author {{explains}} {{mechanism of}} <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> functioning and distinguishes three sets in this mechanism: decentralized, centralized and mixed sets. Taking into account conditions of <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> functioning, in which local authorities are decisive subjects (local administration and people's councils) the author formulates an opinion that postulates on decentralization, which are stated in discussions, practically refer to substitution of centralized set with mixed set — and not decentralized one — of <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b> Centralized set {{can not be}} fully abolished even when mixed set is a predominating set of <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> functioning. Anyway it does not eliminate the possibility of competence expansion of leading local authorities. In such situation decentralized set of <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> functioning, in strict meaning of the word, can play a marginal role only. The author considers in a broad way the role played by financial factor in <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> functioning. A special attention is paid to dissimilarity of financing principles in particular sets of this economy, because efficiency of the reform considerably depends on proper knowledge about these principles.

5|$|Industry {{is heavy}} along the bay, with an {{abundance}} of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b> Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and <b>local</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{economic}} advantages in farming on a small-scale land. Local farmers generate a <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> in their rural communities. An American {{study showed that}} small farms with incomes of $100,000 or less spend almost 95 percent of their farm-related expenses within their local communities. The same study took in comparison the fact that farms with incomes greater than $900,000 spend less than 20 percent of their farm-related expenses in the <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b> Thus, small-scale agriculture supports <b>local</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|R
40|$|Local economy' {{concept is}} often {{present in the}} Northern Sweden rural setting as a common {{objective}} that sub-regional actors, especially LEADER (one of the four initiatives financed by EU structural funds to help local rural actors while providing direct support) programs want to reach. Same actors in the meantime express {{a lack of knowledge}} and interest by local inhabitants. That reveals the question of how <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> is understood by different actors. Using “perspective” and “meaning attribution” concepts of symbolic interactionism and <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> debate led by social movements such as Woods, Transition Towns - TT and New Economics Foundation - NEF, this paper investigates understandings and practices of <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> in Åres Gröna Dalar LEADER area, Jämtland, in Sweden. It argues that a) observed actions and experienced happenings of key actors towards <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> are widely approved by local inhabitants. But the level of approval decreases when the <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> perspective is tried to be communicated through rhetorical, verbal and ideological symbols, b) there are four main meanings attributed to <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> : “buy local” and “support for small-scale entrepreneurs and tourism” compose the narrow approach while “individual empowerment and community mobilization” and “decentralization and new way of thinking” are of the wide approach, c) local actors' proposals for actions towards <b>local</b> <b>economy</b> can be analyzed in four categories: “support for small-scale business”, “raising awareness and participation”, “networking and collaboration” and “local saving company...|$|R
