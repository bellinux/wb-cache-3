Libman noted that for recording her lines as the hyperactive Pinkie Pie, [...] "I <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can go as over the top as I want and they [...] rarely pull me back." ...|$|E

Disliked because of his pranks ("which I for one found spirited"), he was moved to the 7th Artillery Regiment in Călărași, and, because once there he complained about the mistreatment of regulars by the officers, spent several months in the disciplinary barracks. He notes: [...] "Just as I was ending my term as a volunteer, the captain, having <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had donned a civilian's outfit for a private party, ordered me in lockdown.—Lockdown meant no stove and no windows, so that's how I ended up with pneumonia." ...|$|E

He said that a doctor prescribed the drug to alleviate back pain and headaches, but that he would take more than he was prescribed: [...] "I was only given a fourth of , but no more, because of course my doctor <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was using the whole patch because I felt better". Fentanyl is described by the US National Institute on Drug Abuse as [...] "a powerful synthetic opioid analgesic that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent". Duterte later denied that he was a drug addict, and a spokesman stated that he was not affected by side-effects of the drug, which include confusion, anxiety and hallucinations.|$|E

2500|$|Financially {{secure from}} his writing, Voelker {{resigned}} from the Michigan Supreme Court, telling Governor Williams, [...] "other people can write my opinions, but none can write my books. I have <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't do both so regretfully I must quit the court." [...] He continued writing, publishing several books on fishing or legal themes. The first wasTrout Madness in 1960, followed by the political drama Hornstein’s Boy in 1961. He returned to fishing with Anatomy of a Fisherman in 1964, a picture book that included the soliloquy [...] "Testament of a Fisherman", which to {{a vast number of}} trout anglers, Voelker’s piece best exemplifies the love of this sport. Voelker continued to write about fishing or the courtroom through 1960s and 1970s. He authored a column called “The Traver Treatment” in the Detroit News Sunday Magazine in 1967-68. His last book was People Versus Kirk in 1981, and the last short story of his that was published was titled “Dangling Angling Genes” and appeared in the May–June 1990 issue of Rod & Reel magazine. Several of his fishing books were anthologies of short stories he had written, some of which had already been printed in magazines like Field & Stream.|$|E
