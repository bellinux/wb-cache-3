40|$|A {{theoretical}} basis and example calculations are given that demonstrate {{the relationship between}} the Matched Filter Theory approach to the calculation of time-correlated gust <b>loads</b> and Phased <b>Design</b> <b>Load</b> Analysis in common use in the aerospace industry. The relationship depends upon the duality between Matched Filter Theory and Random Process Theory and upon the fact that Random Process Theory is used in Phased <b>Design</b> <b>Loads</b> Analysis in determining an equiprobable <b>loads</b> <b>design</b> ellipse. Extensive background information describing the relevant points of Phased <b>Design</b> <b>Loads</b> Analysis, calculating time-correlated gust loads with Matched Filter Theory, and the duality between Matched Filter Theory and Random Process Theory is given. It is then shown that the time histories of two time-correlated gust load responses, determined using the Matched Filter Theory approach, can be plotted as parametric functions of time and that the resulting plot, when superposed upon the design ellipse corresponding to the two loads, is tangent to the ellipse. The question is raised of {{whether or not it is}} possible for a parametric load plot to extend outside the associated design ellipse.

50|$|Unit loads can be {{used both}} for in-process {{handling}} and for distribution (receiving, storing, and shipping). Unit <b>load</b> <b>design</b> involves determining the type, size, weight, and configuration of the load; the equipment and method used to handle the load; and the methods of forming (or building) and breaking down the load. For in-process handling, unit loads should not be larger than the production batch size of parts in process. Large production batches (used to increase the utilization of bottleneck activities) can be split into smaller transfer batches for handling purposes, where each transfer batch contains one or more unit loads, and small unit loads can be combined into a larger transfer batch to allow more efficient transport.|$|E
50|$|After a {{preliminary}} {{analysis of the}} site, initial designs of the soil nail wall can be begin. This begins with a selection of limit states and design approaches. The two most common limit states used in soil nail wall design is strength limit and service limit states. The strength limit state is the limit state that addresses potential failure mechanisms or collapse states of the soil nail wall system. The service limit state is the limit state that addresses loss of service function resulting from excessive wall deformation and is defined by restrictions in stress, deformation and facing crack width under regular service conditions. The two most common design approaches for soil nail walls are limit state design and service <b>load</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose. A {{drive is}} one of the basic {{elements}} of belt conveyers. To determine the drive power it is necessary to conduct calculations by standard methodologies expounded in modern technical literature. Such calculations demand a fair amount of time. The basic design parameters of a belt conveyer include type of <b>load,</b> <b>design</b> efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. The article aims to build the parametric dependence of belt conveyer drive power on its design parameters, that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, idlers and pulleys. Methodology. The work examines a belt conveyer with two areas: sloping and horizontal. Using the methodology for pulling calculation by means of belt conveyer encirclement, there are built parametric dependences of pull forces in the characteristic conveyer path points on the type of <b>load,</b> <b>design</b> efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. Findings. For the belt conveyers of the considered type there are built parametric dependences of drive power on type of <b>load,</b> <b>design</b> efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions, taking into account the belt standard dimensions and corresponding assumptions in relation to idler and pulley types. Originality. This is the first developed parametric dependence of two-area (sloping and horizontal) belt conveyer drive power on type of <b>load,</b> <b>design</b> efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, idlers and pulleys. Practical value. Use of the built drive power dependences on design parameters for the belt conveyers with sloping and horizontal areas gives an opportunity of relatively rapid determination of drive power approximate value at the design stage. Also it allows quality selection of its basic elements at specific design characteristics and requirements. The offered dependences can be used for determination of general character of drive power dependence on the project efficiency. ...|$|E

The objective is to link the time-average performance of a low pressure turbine blade with the flow unsteadiness accompanying a separation of the suction side boundary layer. Specifically, this is accomplished using a time-accurate, two-dimensional, incompressible direct Navier-Stokes simulation of flow in three low pressure turbine blade designs for Reynolds numbers ranging from 20, 000 to 120, 000. Comparisons of the three geometries reveal that the separated region for the aft <b>loaded</b> blade <b>design</b> {{is characterized by a}} time-average separation bubble that is shorter in length than the forward loaded blade. The difference in design translates into a "lagging " of the shear layer roll-up process on the suction side for the forward loaded blade as compared to the aft loaded blade; for a given Reynolds number, the aft <b>loaded</b> <b>design</b> is closer to a point of periodic boundary layer re-attachment relative to the forward <b>loaded</b> <b>design.</b> Forward <b>loading</b> produces greater profile loss due to the higher velocities in the forwar...|$|R

40|$|A {{new class}} of spread slab beam bridge {{superstructure}} has recently been developed and implemented in Texas. In order to investigate its structural performance in general, and load distribution behavior in particular, comprehensive static and dynamic tests are performed on an in-service spread slab beam bridge, the US 69 Bridge located in Denison, Texas. Different computational techniques including the historic grillage analysis and the more rigorous finite element method (FEM) are utilized to model the moment and shear actions for this new bridge system. Satisfactory agreements are obtained with comparisons between experimental and computational results. Current service <b>load</b> <b>design</b> practice reveals that the asymmetric AASHTO HS 20 truck load and complicated LRFD LDF formulas bring unnecessary inconvenience to the design process. Alternative symmetric live load models and new design models with a familiar ?S/D? format are developed in this dissertation {{for the purpose of}} providing bridge engineers a more straight-forward option to determine the moment and shear demands at the service <b>load</b> <b>design</b> or for the rapid checking of computer output. The applicability of the proposed design models for the prestressed concrete girder bridges commonly used in Texas and elsewhere is evaluated by comparing accuracy with more exacting FEM analysis results. Comparative results show that the proposed design formulas are mostly conservative for these bridge types. Following service <b>load</b> <b>design,</b> the adequacy under factored ultimate strength conditions requires checking. Due to their expediency and ease of use, plastic limit analysis methods are used to evaluate the reserve strength capacity of slab-on-beam bridge systems. It is shown that by taking a holistic view of several different potential failure modes the ?balance? of the design can be judged in terms of a hierarchy of failure mechanisms. Therefore, it is possible to make minor adjustments to the design in order to obtain a preferred outcome. The proposed design methods are adopted in the service <b>load</b> <b>design</b> of a multi-span spread slab beam bridge to explore the potential for extending the span length of this low profile bridge system. The design results indicate that span lengths up to 21. 3 m are viable with only four spread slab beams. To achieve this span it is necessary to make at least three spans continuous and use load balancing principles along with some supplementary post-tensioning...|$|E
