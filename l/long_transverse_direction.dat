40|$|The {{elevated}} temperature tensile, stress-rupture and creep properties and residual tensile properties after creep straining have been determined for two cast superalloys and several wrought Ni- 16 Cr- 4 Al-yttria oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloys. The creep {{behavior of the}} ODS alloys {{is similar to that}} of previously studied ODS nickel alloys. In general, the longitudinal direction is stronger than the <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction,</b> and creep is at least partially due to a diffusional creep mechanism as dispersoid-free zones were observed after creep-rupture testing. The tensile properties of the nickel-base superalloy B- 1900 and cobalt-base superalloy MAR-M 509 are not degraded by prior {{elevated temperature}} creep straining (at least up to 1 pct) between 1144 and 1366 K. On the other hand, the room temperature tensile properties of ODS nickel-base alloys can be reduced by prior creep strains of 0. 5 pct or less between 1144 and 1477 K, with the <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> being more susceptible to degradation than the longitudinal direction...|$|E

At strain rates greater-than-or-equal-to 1 s- 1, both sets of specimens exhibited adiabatic shear bands, but the intensity of shear bands was found to be higher in the rolling direction specimens than in the <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> specimens. At strain rates - 0. 1 s- 1, the material deformed in a microstructurally inhomogeneous fashion. For the rolling direction specimens, cracking was observed at 100 -degrees-C and at strain rates - 0. 1 s- 1. This is attributed to dynamic strain aging. Such cracking was not observed in the long transverse specimens. The differences in the intensity of adiabatic shear bands and that of dynamic strain aging between the two sets of test specimens are attributed to the strong crystallographic texture present in these plates...|$|E

The relationship between K sub ISCC and sigma sub TH was also studied. The work showed that 2124 -T 851 aluminum alloy in plate gage has a moderately high resistance to stress corrosion attack. Experimental results showed that no SCC occurred in the longitudinal and <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>directions</b> {{in any of the}} tests. Some SCC was found by smooth tests in the short <b>transverse</b> <b>direction,</b> and the data were confirmed by two test methods-sigma sub TH = 275 MN/sq m (40 ksi). No SCC was found from compact specimen tests in any direction: surface flaw and center notch specimens evaluated in the short <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> exhibited SCC. The data indicate that stress corrosion behavior is defect, size, and stress dependent, but not entirely in accordance with a stress intensity controlled mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some of the results from an {{examination}} of sample die forgings in aluminium-lithium alloys 2091 and 8090. Whilst direct comparison of properties of the two forgings is complicated by the differing configurations, useful data has, nevertheless, been generated which will provide useful background information for further programmes about to commence. The present study has revealed density reductions of ~ 8 % and ~ 10 % respectively for the 2091 and 8090 compositions, compared to current 2 xxx series alloys. With regard to microstructure, the 2091 forging exhibited predominantly unrecrystallised grains which contained linear features postulated to originate from a mechanical/deformation twinning type of mechanism. In contrast, the 8090 component showed extensive recrystallisation. Microhardness measurements indicated lithium and magnesium depletion at surface locations while optical and electron microscopy suggested that apparent porosity bands on the polished microsections were due to the presence of the equilibrium δ-AlLi phase, particles of which fragment and are removed during metallographic preparation. Mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy in the 2091 forging and were attributed to texture effects. Highest strengths were obtained in the longitudinal direction, while the lowest appeared at ~ 30 ° and ~ 70 ° to the longitudinal <b>direction</b> : <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> strengths were intermediate. The resulting failure modes are briefly discussed. In contrast, mechanical properties in the 8090 component exhibited a gradual increase in strength from longitudinal to <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>directions,</b> in keeping with the recrystallised nature of this forging...|$|R

High strength aluminum alloys are often elongated and anisotropic, with the fastest nominal IGC growth {{rate in the}} longitudinal direction (L) or <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction</b> (T) and the slowest in the short transverse direction (S).

40|$|International audienceFracture {{properties}} {{of a mother}} plate for API grade X 100 line pipe were investigated using tensile notched bars, CT and SENB pre-cracked specimens. The material had an anisotropic plastic behaviour due to the thermo-mechanical control rolling process. In addition, anisotropic rupture properties were also observed. Specimens tested along the rolling direction were more ductile and more crack growth resistant than those tested along the <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>direction.</b> Unit cell calculations were used to show that this fracture behaviour {{is not related to}} plastic anisotropy. Assuming that fracture is controlled by internal necking between anisotropically spaced voids, a model combining GTN and Thomason models is proposed which enables describing rupture anisotropy.

40|$|Fatigue {{crack growth}} rates of Ti 6 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 as a {{function}} of stress ratio, temperature (24 or 177 C), tensile orientation and environment (laboratory air or ultrahigh vacuum) are presented. Fatigue crack {{growth rates of}} Ti 6 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 are also compared with two more widely used titanium alloys (Timetal 21 S and Ti 6 Al- 4 V). The fatigue crack growth rate (da/dN) of Ti 6 - 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 in laboratory air is dependent upon stress ratio (R), particularly in the near-threshold and lower-Paris regimes. For low R (less than approximately 0. 5), da/dN is influenced by crack closure behavior. At higher R (> 0. 5), a maximum stress-intensity factor (K max) dependence is observed. Fatigue crack growth behavior is affected by test temperature between 24 and 177 C. For moderate to high applied cyclic-stress-intensity factors (DK), the slope of the log da/dN versus log DK curve is lower in 177 C laboratory air than 24 C laboratory air. The difference in slope results in lower values of da/dN for exposure to 177 C laboratory air compared to room temperature laboratory air. The onset of this temperature effect is dependent upon the applied R. This temperature effect has not been observed in ultrahigh vacuum. Specimen orientation has been shown to affect the slope of the log da/dN versus log DK curve in the Paris regime. The damaging effect of laboratory air is more pronounced for specimens with the applied load oriented 45 to the longitudinal and <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>directions</b> compared to fatigue crack growth in the T-L or L-T orientations...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of two hot rolled magnesium alloys, namely the AZ 31 and AZ 61, has been evaluated experimentally under both monotonic and cyclic loading. Both longitudinal (L) and <b>long</b> <b>transverse</b> (LT) <b>directions</b> were evaluated. The tensile behaviour of the L and LT directions is similar and differs {{only in the}} offset 0. 2 % yield strength for both materials. This difference is attributed to the angular spread of basal poles toward the rolling direction and is more pronounced for the case of AZ 31. A distinct hardening response is obvious in both directions. Twinning formation was observed; it is more pronounced in the longitudinal direction while the fracture mode is intergranular and equiaxed facets {{are present in the}} fracture surfaces of the specimens. The S-N curves exhibit a smooth transition from the low to high cycle fatigue regime. AZ 61 exhibits an overall better fatigue behaviour compared to AZ 31. A transgranular crack initiation mode is observed in all tested specimens while the propagation of the cracks is characterized as intergranular...|$|R
40|$|Anisotropic Post-Yield Behavior of the Tissue A {{finite element}} model was {{developed}} for numerical simulations of nanoindentation tests on cortical bone. The model allows for anisotropic elastic and post-yield behavior of the tissue. The material model for the post-yield behavior was obtained through a suitable linear transformation of the stress tensor components to define {{the properties of the}} real anisotropic material in terms of a fictitious isotropic solid. A tension-compression yield stress mismatch and a direction-dependent yield stress are allowed for. The constitutive parameters are determined on the basis of literature experimental data. Indentation experiments along the axial (the longitudinal direction of <b>long</b> bones) and <b>transverse</b> <b>directions</b> have been simulated with the purpose to calculate the indentation moduli and the tissue hardness in both the indentation directions.

40|$|Similar to {{in-plane}} strand deviations, strand undulation {{through a}} panel thickness could adversely affect the mechanical behavior and failure mechanism of a wood-strand panel subjected to compression loads and repeated moisture cycling. The {{goal of this}} study was to characterize the out-of-plane strand devia-tions in an oriented strand composite to better characterize its three-dimensional structure. The results indicate that random and incidental strand undulations in the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>directions</b> are significant; these inherent attributes of oriented strand composites influence the physical and mechanical behavior of composite panels. Strand orientations through the thickness of oriented strand panels in the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> <b>directions</b> were quantified, and the effects of strand geometry and vane spacing on these out-of-plane deviations were investigated. Discrete Fourier expansions accurately rep-resented strand undulations through composite thickness. Location through composite thickness and length of a strand influence the distribution of undulation angles. Strands closer to the faces and shorter in length tend to result in larger undulation angles. In the <b>transverse</b> <b>direction,</b> strand deviation angles ranged between 0 and 60 degrees for the core strands and between 0 and 50 degrees for surface strands.
