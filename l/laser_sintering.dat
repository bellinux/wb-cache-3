25|$|Selective <b>laser</b> <b>sintering</b> is an {{additive}} {{rapid manufacturing}} technique {{that uses a}} high power laser to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass representing a desired 3-dimensional object. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part {{on the surface of}} a powder bed. Selective <b>laser</b> <b>sintering</b> was invented and patented by Dr. Carl Deckard at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Many, perhaps most, {{threaded}} parts {{have potential}} to be generated via additive manufacturing (3D printing), {{of which there are}} many variants, including fused deposition modeling, selective <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> direct metal <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> selective laser melting, electron beam melting, layered object manufacturing, and stereolithography. For most additive technologies, it has not been long since they emerged from the laboratory end of their historical development, but further commercialization is picking up speed. To date, most additive methods tend to produce a rough surface finish and tend to be restricted in the material properties that they can produce, and thus their earliest commercial victories have been in parts for which those restrictions were acceptable. However, the capabilities are continually growing.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} weld-line {{reduction}} {{by using the}} <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold {{and the effect of}} hot air supply on the mold surface just before the injection have been investigated. The depth of the weld-line groove in the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold is smaller than that in the conventional steel mold. Mold pressure increase in the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold is faster than that in the steel mold and the peak pressure in the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold is higher than that in the steel mold. This must be due to the low thermal conductivity of the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold. As a preheating effect of the mold surface before the injection, hot air has been supplied on the mold surface using an air jet bulb. The reduction of the weld-line groove has been promoted in the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold whereas few effects appeared in the steel mold. Surface temperature increase by the hot air supply in the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold is larger than that in the steel mold. By this higher temperature increase, temperature of the resin on the weld-line area must be higher and the hardness of the resin must be lower in the <b>laser</b> metal <b>sintered</b> mold so that the resin is deformed well reducing the weld-line groove...|$|R

This study was performed with the aim of comparing the marginal accuracy and internal fit of Co-Cr alloy copings fabricated by casting, CAD/CAM (Computer-aided design/Computer-assisted manufacture) milled, and 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> techniques. A total of 36 Co-Cr alloy crown-copings were fabricated from an implant abutment. The marginal and internal fit were evaluated by measuring the weight of the silicone material, the vertical marginal discrepancy using a microscope, and the internal gap in the sectioned specimens. The data were statistically analyzed by One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance), a Scheffe’s test, and Pearson’s correlation at the significance level of p = 0. 05, using statistics software. The silicone weight was significantly low in the casting group. The 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> group showed the highest vertical discrepancy, and marginal-, occlusal-, and average- internal gaps (p < 0. 05). The CAD/CAM milled group revealed a significantly high axial internal gap. There are moderate correlations between the vertical marginal discrepancy and the internal gap variables (r = 0. 654), except for the silicone weight. In this study, the 3 -D <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> group achieved clinically acceptable marginal accuracy and internal fit...|$|R
40|$|Industry {{has a great}} {{demand for}} {{metallic}} prototypes to speed up product development At present there are several RP-technologics for direct fabrication of metal components in development. Today secondary processing of polymer or wax models, like investment casting, or sand casting, is a very common way {{for the production of}} metallic prototypes. There are, however, several problems in investment casting resulting from <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> models made of wax or polycarbonate. Recently a polymer mixture consisting of nylon material and a second polymer has been tested with the <b>laser</b> <b>sinter</b> process in a newly developed sinter machine (E 0 SINT 350 - 60). Shells for investment casting could be prepared easily with the models in a conventional assembly-line. Several castings of <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> models in Al were successfully realized. In future, integration of modeling based on FEM calculations with RP for casting will become more important.

25|$|AM {{processes}} for metal sintering or melting (such as selective <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> direct metal <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> and selective laser melting) usually went {{by their own}} individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that we now call non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), {{the idea of a}} tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.|$|E

2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. <b>Laser</b> <b>sintering</b> techniques include selective <b>laser</b> <b>sintering,</b> with both metals and polymers, and direct metal <b>laser</b> <b>sintering.</b> Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective <b>Laser</b> <b>Sintering,</b> but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

The bonding of porcelain to metal is an important point {{to be considered for}} the success of the restoration. Aim: To compare and evaluate the shear bond strength of porcelain fused to metal substructure fabricated using conventional and contemporary techniques. Methods and Material: Thirty sample discs were fabricated – 10 of cast nickel chromium alloy, 10 of cast cobalt chromium alloys and 10 of <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> cobalt chromium alloy. Conventionally used feldspathic porcelain was used and fired over the metal discs. These samples were placed in a specially fabricated jig, which was held in a universal testing machine. The samples were subjected to shear stress until they fractured and the readings were noted. The fractured surface of the sample was then viewed under stereomicroscope. Results: The mean shear bond strength was highest in group C (porcelain fused to <b>laser</b> <b>sintered</b> cobalt chromium), followed by group A (porcelain fused to cast nickel chromium) and group B (porcelain fused to cast cobalt chromium) which was the least. The level of significance was fixed at p < 0. 05.
