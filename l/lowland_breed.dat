500|$|The {{domestic}} sheep is a multi-purpose animal, {{and the more}} than 200 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes. Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources. However, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time: e.g. 863 breeds as of 1993, 1314 breeds as of 1995 [...] and 1229 breeds as of 2006. (These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is [...] "either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity." [...] Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed. Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the topography for which the breed has been developed. This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or <b>lowland</b> <b>breeds.</b> A sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.|$|R
6000|$|We {{know little}} on this head. But as animals kept by savages {{have to provide}} {{throughout}} the year their own food either entirely or to a large extent, it can hardly be doubted that in different countries, varieties differing in constitution and in various characters would succeed best, and so be naturally selected. Hence perhaps {{it is that the}} few domesticated animals kept by savages partake, as has been remarked by more than one writer, of the wild appearance of their masters, and likewise resemble natural species. Even in long-civilised countries, at least in the wilder parts, natural selection must act on our domestic races. It is obvious that varieties having very different habits, constitution, and structure, would succeed best on mountains and on rich lowland pastures. For example, the improved Leicester sheep were formerly taken to the Lammermuir Hills; but an intelligent sheep-master reported that [...] "our coarse lean pastures were unequal to the task of supporting such heavy- bodied sheep; and they gradually dwindled away into less and less bulk: each generation was inferior to the preceding one; and when the spring was severe, seldom {{more than two-thirds of the}} lambs survived the ravages of the storms." [...] (21/1. Quoted by Youatt on 'Sheep' page 325. See also Youatt on 'Cattle' pages 62, 69.)

To identify genes underlying such adaptation, we genotyped genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of four major sheep breeds living at different altitudes in Nepal and downloaded SNP array data from additional Asian and Middle East breeds. Using a di value-based genomic comparison between four high-altitude and eight <b>lowland</b> Asian <b>breeds,</b> we discovered the most differentiated variants at the locus of FGF- 7 (Keratinocyte growth factor- 7), which was previously reported as a good protective candidate for pulmonary injuries.

Second, the SNP showed an increasing allele frequency with the elevated altitude in Nepalese sheep. Third, the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) analysis using human lung cancer cells revealed the allele-specific DNA-protein interactions. We thus hypothesized that FGF- 7 gene potentially enhances lung function by regulating its expression level in high-altitude sheep through altering its binding of specific transcription factors. Especially, FGF- 7 gene was not implicated in previous studies of other high-altitude species, suggesting a potential novel adaptive mechanism to high altitude in sheep at the Himalayas.

Sheep genotype represented two synthetic fecund-meat lines (BCP and SCP), two groups of three-bred hybrids (LB and LS) as well as Suffolk and <b>lowlands</b> sheep <b>breed.</b> In this study 1875 sheep originating from flock in middle eastern part of Poland were serum sampled. The presence of specific antibodies to p 25 and gp 40 proteins of MVV was determined by ELISA assay. It was shown that 17. 3 % of the tested animals were serologically positive during three-year-study. The highest susceptibility to MVV infection was noted in Suffolk breed (23. 6 %) and its three-bred hybrids (31. 7 %). However, in the other genetic groups this index ranged from 11. 3 to 20. 6 %. Further analysis showed that MVV seroprevalence increased with sheep age, mainly between 2 to 5 years of age. Along with the population aging a downwards tendency of infection increase was observed that may have resulted from the breeding practices followed by the sheep selection. These results provide evidence that susceptibility and resistance of sheep to MVV is associated with age and genotype of animals. The breeds or native lines are characterized by a higher resistance against MVV infection compared to the imported pedigrees...|$|R
40|$|The lungs undergo {{changes that}} are {{adaptive}} for high elevation in certain animal species. In chickens, animals bred at high elevations (e. g., Tibet chickens) {{are better able to}} hatch and survive under high-altitude conditions. In addition, <b>lowland</b> chicken <b>breeds</b> undergo physiological effects and suffer greater mortality when they are exposed to hypoxic conditions during embryonic development. Although these physiological effects have been noted, the mechanisms that are responsible for hypoxia-induced changes in lung development and function are not known. Here we have examined the role of a particular microRNA (miRNA) in the regulation of lung development under hypoxic conditions. When chicks were incubated in low oxygen (hypoxia), miR- 15 a was significantly increased in embryonic lung tissue. The expression level of miR- 15 a in hypoxic Tibet chicken embryos increased and remained relatively high at embryonic day (E) 16 – 20, whereas in normal chickens, expression increased and peaked at E 19 – 20, at which time the cross-current gas exchange system (CCGS) is developing. Bcl- 2 was a translationally repressed target of miR- 15 a in these chickens. miR- 16, a cluster and family member of miR- 15 a, was detected but did not participate in the posttranscriptional regulation of bcl- 2. Around E 19, the hypoxia-induced decrease in Bcl- 2 protein resulted in apoptosis in the mesenchyme around the migrating tubes, which led to an expansion and migration of the tubes that would become the air capillary network and the CCGS.

The lambs on the lowland pasture had the lowest proportions of linoleic and α-linolenic acid in the lipid fraction of these tissues. Additionally, {{there was a clear}} differentiation in these proportions when lambs grazed different alpine vegetation types. This was related to the content of phenolic compounds rather than the fatty acid contents of the swards, and an increasing phenolic level probably resulted in a higher ruminal protection of the native plant fatty acids.

The breed is characterised by its good adaptability to different climate and breeding conditions and overall good health. The ewes are known for their high fertility rate, shorter oestrus cycle, excellent maternal instincts, and high milk production. As a result of these characteristics, the Suffolk has become a very popular breed around the world. This thesis focuses on the breeding of Suffolk sheep {{as one of the best}} breeds for the production of slaughter lambs. The thesis also looks at reproduction as a part of sheep breeding, as well as at the factors that have an effect on pregnancy, the birthing process, and the newborn lamb. The main objective of this thesis was to process the lambing data for a specific herd of Suffolk sheep, including performing an evaluation of the basic reproductive indicators, calculating the birth weight of lambs, and determining the ideal age for including ewes in the breeding herd. The basic reproductive indicators include fertility, fertilisation, breeding intensity, and weaned lamb production. In the studied herd of sheep, these indicators were calculated as follows: fertility 182 %; fertilisation 91 %; breeding intensity 155 %; and weaned lamb production 159 %.

40|$|The rugged {{beauty of}} the Iveragh {{peninsula}} has fascinated many a passing visitor and never fails to make some of us linger or stay for good. For those who need proof of the area’s uniqueness, a variety of national and European designations provide ample attestation of the splendour of Iveragh’s scenery, the diversity of its landscape and its heritage. Being surrounded on three sides by the Atlantic, Iveragh is {{the largest and most}} geographically isolated peninsula in Ireland whose western extremity, the Great Skellig, forms the westernmost point of Europe. Despite its maritime location, Iveragh’s character is fundamentally determined by the mountains, valleys and streams that form the peninsula’s interior—the bequest of a landscape sculpted by ice thousands of years ago (Crowley and Sheehan, 2009). Distinctive mountain scene in the Bridia Valley, Glencar Perhaps most distinctive, however, are the extensive blanket bogs and upland heather moorlands that cover most of the peninsula and captivate the imagination with the wild and austere appeal of an area where life did not change much for man and beast until relatively recently. Having come into existence in the wake of woodland clearances, the cutting of vegetation for fuel and the harvesting of crops for food and fiber by Neolithic farmers in the first and second millennium BC, this unique cultural landscape continues to be managed by traditional farmers and their animals to the present day. The value of areas such as Iveragh as repositories of a unique flora and fauna has long been recognized, but they have entered a period of major transformation as the agricultural economy that lay behind them no longer exists (Webb, 1998). The single largest danger is that farming communities may not survive the present discussion of how competitive European agriculture should be, as under present market conditions they are unable to compete without fundamentally changing their way of farming (Luick, 1998). The last 10 years have seen a growing debate over the future of areas like the Iveragh peninsula that may be ‘marginal’ in agricultural terms, but that are quite essential to life in Europe as we know and cherish it. Upland farmed landscapes provide clean water, maintain a rich plant and animal life and help to keep families in regions that offer few alternative employment opportunities – {{at the same time as}} attracting millions of tourists each year. The Caragh in Glencar—one of Europe’s cleanest rivers. Such areas, also termed high nature value farmland, cover about 25 % of all agricultural land in Ireland and include, besides Iveragh, other parts of Kerry, Connemara, Mayo, Donegal, the Comeraghs, Wicklow, the Burren and the offshore Islands. The farming systems of these areas are characterised by extensive mixed livestock grazing and little agro-chemical inputs combined with labour-intensive management practices. Without dedicated farmers and their families, the character of these areas would change completely leading to the disappearance of unique cultural landscapes with effects such as rural depopulation and the loss of local communities. Already farming systems have changed substantially with livestock being concentrated on better quality land while marginal areas are being abandoned. Along with this, there are changes in the animals being farmed. The traditional Scotch Blackface sheep are increasingly crossed with or replaced by <b>lowland</b> <b>breeds</b> to satisfy market demands for heavy lamb. This has led to a softening in sheep and the fear among farmers that the traditional grazers of the uplands may be extinct in years to come. Going, too, is the use of the native rustic Kerry cow that grazed the rough Farming the Iveragh Uplands grasses, bracken, gorse and soft rushes in the winter - growth that sheep cannot control. Unsurprisingly, this disruption over a relatively short time, in what was formerly a sustainable relationship between farming and nature, will have implications for the area’s flora and fauna. Some of the repercussions are obvious; others need to be researched in more depth if appropriate solutions are to be formulated. It is now a stated objective of EU environment and rural development policy to maintain and conserve traditional farming systems like the one practised on Iveragh. Beyond acknowledging the importance of traditional farming for nature conservation and local livelihoods, it is necessary to understand how such farming systems function and to determine how the inevitable process of change can be redirected to provide a way of life that is socially and economically rewarding for farm families while preserving the farming practices necessary for Iveragh’s unique landscape to persist into the future. In this light, University College Cork (UCC) in conjunction with the Environmental Research Institute (ERI) and funded by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) initiated BioUp, a 3 year research programme to investigate the upland farming system and rich biodiversity associated with it. Managing rural change in the uplands calls for the active involvement of many stakeholders, including farmers and agricultural advisory groups, land owners, conservation groups, forestry, tourism, and local authorities. In the BioUp project, researchers and stakeholders worked closely together. It is hoped that this will help to obtain a better understanding of the social, economic and environmental challenges facing Iveragh and promote greater public appreciation of the indispensable contributions made by farm families to maintaining our unique heritage - a service that has gone unappreciated too long...|$|R
40|$|Goat {{constitute}} some 22 % of the ruminant {{livestock population}} in Ethiopia {{and are a}} valuable source of milk and milk products, meat, manure, skin and security and {{play a role in}} certain traditional and ceremonial functions. Goats in Ethiopia are kept {{in a wide range of}} production systems reflecting the diversity of the environment. To use these national goat resources in sustainable and rational development programs, a systematic, reliable and comprehensive breed characterization is essential. Characterization at the genetic level is the objective way to identify and quantify the available genetic diversity. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic variation among some goat populations in Ethiopia by means of blood protein polymorphisms. A total of 298 animals from four indigenous goat types (Afar, Hararghe Highland, Western Highland and Western <b>Lowland),</b> two exotic <b>breeds</b> (Toggenburg and Anglo-Nubian) and three crossbreed populations (crosses between the exotic breeds and Hararghe Highland and Somali goat types) were investigated. The red cell lysates and plasma proteins were analyzed by starch gel electrophoresis. From a total of five loci studied, two were polymorphic in, at least one population. Two alleles were detected in the loci Haemoglobin (Hb) and Transferrin (Tf). Only one allele was detected in the loci Carbonic anhydrase (CA), Albumin (Al) and Post Transferrin (PTF) in all populations of goats studied. In most cases, the observed genotypic frequencies were not significantly different from that expected under the Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P) varied between 20. 0 % and 40. 0 %, mean number of alleles per locus were between 1. 2 and 1. 4, mean expected heterozygosities (HE) were between 0. 030 and 0. 177 while mean observed heterozygosities (Ho) were between 0. 032 and 0. 217. From the three populations of goats, higher variability was found in crossbred populations. Afar goat type was found to be more variable (H 0 = 6. 7 %) among the indigenous goat types. Cluster analysis based on Neiâ€™s (1972) standard genetic distance and the UPGMA dendrogram revealed low level of genetic distance among populations. The results indicated that a larger proportion of the genetic variation was between populations and there was high genetic similarity within populations in general but more so in indigenous goat types...|$|R
5000|$|The {{bar-headed goose}} {{is one of}} the world's highest-flying birds, having been heard flying across Mount Makalu [...] - [...] the fifth highest {{mountain}} on earth at 8,481 m [...] - [...] and apparently seen over Mount Everest [...] - [...] 8,848 m [...] - [...] although this is a second-hand report with no verification. This demanding migration has long puzzled physiologists and naturalists: [...] "there must be a good explanation for why the birds fly to the extreme altitudes... particularly since there are passes through the Himalaya at lower altitudes, and which are used by other migrating bird species." [...] In fact, bar-headed geese have never been directly tracked (using GPS or satellite logging technology) flying higher than 6,540 m, and it is now believed that they do take the high passes through the mountains. The challenging northward migration from <b>lowland</b> India to <b>breed</b> in the summer on the Tibetan Plateau is undertaken in stages, with the flight across the Himalaya (from sea-level) being undertaken non-stop in as little as seven hours. Surprisingly, despite predictable tail winds that blow up the Himalayas (in the same direction of travel as the geese), bar-headed geese spurn these winds, waiting for them to die down overnight, when they then undertake the greatest rates of climbing flight ever recorded for a bird, and sustain these climbs rates for hours on end, according to research published in 2011.The 2011 study found the geese peaking at an altitude of around 6,400 m (21,000 ft). In a 2012 study that tagged 91 geese and tracked their migration routes, it was determined that the geese spent 95% of their time below 5784 m, choosing to take a longer route through the Himalayas in order to utilize lower-altitude valleys and passes. Only 10 of the tagged geese were ever recorded above this altitude, and only one exceeded 6500 m, reaching 7290 m. All but one of these high-altitude flights were recorded at night, which along with the early morning, is the most common time of day for geese migration. The colder denser air during these times may be equivalent to an altitude hundreds of meters lower. It is suspected by the authors of these two studies that tales of the geese flying at 8000 m are apocryphal.|$|R
