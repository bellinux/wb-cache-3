2500|$|HSVs may {{persist in}} a {{quiescent}} but persistent form known as latent infection, notably in neural ganglia. HSV-1 tends {{to reside in}} the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 tends to reside in the sacral ganglia, but these are tendencies only, not fixed behavior. During latent infection of a cell, HSVs express latency associated transcript (LAT) RNA. LAT regulates the host cell genome and interferes with natural cell death mechanisms. By maintaining the host cells, LAT expression preserves a reservoir of the virus, which allows subsequent, usually symptomatic, periodic recurrences or [...] "outbreaks" [...] characteristic of non-latency. Whether or not recurrences are symptomatic, viral shedding occurs to infect a new host. A protein found in neurons may bind to herpes virus DNA and regulate latency. Herpes virus DNA contains a gene for a protein called ICP4, which is an important transactivator of genes associated with <b>lytic</b> <b>infection</b> in HSV-1. Elements surrounding the gene for ICP4 bind a protein known as the human neuronal protein Neuronal Restrictive Silencing Factor (NRSF) or human Repressor Element Silencing Transcription Factor (REST). When bound to the viral DNA elements, histone deacetylation occurs atop the ICP4 gene sequence to prevent initiation of transcription from this gene, thereby preventing transcription of other viral genes involved in the lytic cycle. Another HSV protein reverses the inhibition of ICP4 protein synthesis. ICP0 dissociates NRSF from the ICP4 gene and thus prevents silencing of the viral DNA.|$|E

Immunoprecipitation of [32 P]phosphate-labeled extracts of SV 40 -infected CV- 1 African green monkey kidney cells with antibodies specific for large-T or the 53 K protein revealed that the large-T- 53 K protein complex was formed during <b>lytic</b> <b>infections.</b> Only a minor fraction of the large-T present was associated with 53 K protein, and large-T and the 53 K host protein cosedimented during centrifugation through sucrose gradients. We used monospecific sera and monoclonal antibodies to study the rate of synthesis and phosphorylation of the 53 K protein during <b>lytic</b> <b>infections.</b> Infection of CV- 1 cells with SV 40 increased the rate of synthesis of the 53 K protein fivefold over that in mock-infected cells. At the same time, the rate of phosphorylation of the 53 K protein increased more than 30 -fold compared with control cultures. Monkey cells {{transformed by}} UV-irradiated SV 40 (Gluzman et al., J. Virol. 22 : 256 - 266, 1977) also contained the large-T- 53 K protein complex.

40|$|The near {{universal}} {{presence of}} EBV in certain tumors suggests that new EBV-based therapies {{could be developed}} for these malignancies. We have explored one EBV-based therapy that involves the purposeful induction of <b>lytic</b> EBV <b>infection</b> in tumors. Induction of <b>lytic</b> EBV <b>infection</b> in tumors activates expression of EBV-encoded kinases that convert the prodrug, ganciclovir, to its active cytotoxic form. In mouse models for EBV-positive tumors, the combination of lytic-inducing chemotherapy and ganciclovir is much more effective than either agent alone for treating tumors. Another potential EBV-based target is the cellular protein, CD 70. EBV-positive tumors commonly express CD 70, while CD 70 expression in normal cells is restricted to a few highly activated B cells and T cells. Anti-CD 70 monoclonal antibody inhibits the growth of CD 70 -positive (but not CD 70 -negative) Burkitt’s lymphomas in SCID mice. Finally, while completely <b>lytic</b> EBV <b>infection</b> is clearly incompatible with tumor cell growth, we recently discovered that small numbers of lytically-infected cells actually promote the growth of EBV-immortalized lymphocytes in SCID mice, through the release of paracrine growth factors as well as angiogenic factors. Thus, agents that prevent the earliest stage of <b>lytic</b> EBV <b>infection</b> (such as fatty acid synthase inhibitors), rather than the later stage of viral replication, might also be useful {{in the treatment of}} early-stage EBV-positive tumors...|$|R
40|$|The {{foamy virus}} (FV) genome {{contains}} two promoters, the canonical {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) promoter, containing three consensus AP- 1 binding sites, and an internal promoter (IP) within the env gene. We investigated the regulation of the two promoters in <b>lytic</b> and persistent <b>infections</b> and found that {{in the presence of}} a constitutive source of the viral transactivator protein Tas, transactivation of the LTR promoter and that of the IP differ. In <b>lytic</b> <b>infections,</b> both the LTR promoter and the IP are efficiently transactivated by Tas, while in persistent infections, the IP is efficiently transactivated by Tas, but the LTR promoter is not. Analysis of proteins expressed from the LTR promoter and the IP during infection indicated that IP transcription is more robust than that of the LTR promoter in persistently infected cells, while the opposite is true for lytically infected cells. Coculture experiments also showed that LTR promoter transcription is greatest in cells which support lytic replication. Replacement of much of the LTR promoter with the IP leads to increased viral replication in persistent but not <b>lytic</b> <b>infections.</b> We also found that the induction of persistently infected cells with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) greatly enhanced viral replication and transcription from the SFVcpz(hu) (new name for human FV) LTR promoter. However, mutation of three consensus AP- 1 binding sites in the FV LTR promoter did not affect viral replication in lytically or persistently infected cells, nor did the same mutations affect LTR promoter transactivation by Tas in PMA-treated cells. Our data indicate that differential regulation of transcription is important in the outcome of FV infection but is unlikely to depend on AP- 1...|$|R

50|$|Bacteriophages are {{parasitic}} {{because they}} infect their hosts, use bacterial machinery to replicate, and ultimately lyse the bacteria.

Nonetheless, a temperate phage can escape repression to replicate, produce viral particles, and lyse the bacteria. The temperate phage escaping repression would be a disadvantage for the bacteria. On the other hand, the prophage may transfer genes that enhance host virulence and resistance to the immune system.

40|$|SummaryPrimary {{infection}} {{with the human}} oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can result in infectious mononucleosis (IM), a self-limiting disease caused by massive lymphocyte expansion that predisposes {{for the development of}} distinct EBV-associated lymphomas. Why some individuals experience this symptomatic primary EBV infection, whereas the majority acquires the virus asymptomatically, remains unclear. Using a mouse model with reconstituted human immune system components, we show that depletion of human natural killer (NK) cells enhances IM symptoms and promotes EBV-associated tumorigenesis mainly because of a loss of immune control over <b>lytic</b> EBV <b>infection.</b> These data suggest that failure of innate immune control by human NK cells augments symptomatic <b>lytic</b> EBV <b>infection,</b> which drives lymphocyte expansion and predisposes for EBV-associated malignancies...|$|R
40|$|Like all herpesviruses, {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 (HSV 1) is able to produce <b>lytic</b> or latent <b>infections</b> {{depending}} on the host cell type. <b>Lytic</b> <b>infections</b> occur in {{a broad range of}} cells while latency is highly specific for neurons. Although latency suggests itself as an attractive target for novel anti-HSV 1 therapies, progress in their development has been slowed due in part to a lack of agreement about the basic biochemical mechanisms involved. Among the possibilities being considered is a pathway in which DNA repair mechanisms play a central role. Repair is suggested to be involved in both HSV 1 entry into latency and reactivation from it. Here I describe the basic features of the DNA repair-centered pathway and discuss some of the experimental evidence supporting it. The pathway is particularly attractive because it is able to account for important features of the latent response, including the specificity for neurons, the specificity for neurons of the peripheral compared to the central nervous system, the high rate of genetic recombination in HSV 1 -infected cells, and the genetic identity of infecting and reactivated virus...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{is capable}} of lytic {{replication}} in most cells, such replication in epithelial cells resulting in the mucocutaneous lesions observed following in vivo infection. In addition however, the virus also establishes asymptomatic latent infections in sensory neurons which serve as a reservoir for further cycles of peripheral <b>lytic</b> <b>infections.</b> These latent infections are dependent upon the inhibition of viral immediate-early (IE) gene expression via the octamer-related TAATGARAT motif in the IE promoters resulting in {{the failure of the}} viral lytic cycle. Here we show that the ectopic expression of neuronal isoforms of the octamer/TAATGARAT-binding transcription factor Oct- 2 in permissive BHK cells represses IE gene expression following HSV infection and inhibits the viral lytic cycle whereas the B lymphocyte isoform of Oct- 2 does not have this effect. These results suggest that the neuronal isoforms of Oct- 2 {{play a critical role in}} rendering neuronal cells non-permissive for the viral lytic cycle thereby allowing the establishment of latent infection. Moreover, this is the first time that the ectopic expression of a cellular transcription factor has been shown to inhibit infection with any virus, raising the possibility of therapeutically inhibiting <b>lytic</b> viral <b>infections</b> by inducing such ectopic expression...|$|R
50|$|This {{control over}} the {{chromatin}} is brought about and maintained by recruited transcriptional repressors. These complexes, which are composed of enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), bind to the major immediate-early promoter (MIEP) of CMV and condense the DNA and prevent any remodeling. HDACs appear to be important for the continued maintenance of latency as HDAC inhibitors induce a <b>lytic</b> <b>infection.</b> It is also of {{not to mention that}} while chromatin methylation is utilized in this control mechanism, methylation of the DNA has not been observed. This is important {{due to the fact that}} HDACs do not function on their own but instead are part of larger co-repressor complexes that are recruited by methylated DNA or transcription factors which bind to specific sequences on DNA. Since there is no methylated DNA, it is likely that transcription factors are used to recruit these co-repressor complexes.|$|E
50|$|Unlike HSV 1 and 2, {{there has}} not been any LAT found in the VZV latent cells. Instead, it appears that the main way that {{expression}} of viral transcripts is maintained at a lower level during latency is through chromatin structure. There are 5 transcripts identified during latent infection of VZV. Open reading frames (ORFs) 21, 29, 62, 63, and 66 are all expressed with 62 and 63 being the most abundant. The promoters of these two genes, ORFs 62 and 63, contain large amounts of acetylated H3K9, which makes these genes euchromatic. This contrasts other genes normally found in <b>lytic</b> <b>infection</b> that are not associated with acetylated H3K9 histones during latency. This means that these genes are controlled through a mechanism affecting the chromatin structure that allows them to be expressed in the latent phase.
