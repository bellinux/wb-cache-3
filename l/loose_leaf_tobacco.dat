5000|$|Chewing {{tobacco is}} {{typically}} manufactured as several varieties of product - most often as loose leaf (or scrap), pellets (tobacco [...] "bites" [...] or [...] "bits"), and [...] "plug" [...] (a form of <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tobacco</b> condensed with a binding sweetener). Nearly all modern chewing tobaccos are produced via {{a process of}} leaf curing, cutting, fermentation and processing or sweetening. Historically, many American chewing tobacco brands (which were popular during the American Civil War era) were made with cigar clippings.|$|E

It consists of shredded <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> usually sweetened and sometimes flavored, and often sold in a sealed pouch weighing on average 3oz. <b>Loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>tobacco</b> has a sticky texture due to the sweeteners added.

50|$|Twist {{chewing tobacco}} is a rope-like piece of tobacco twisted together. Unlike most <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tobaccos,</b> twist chewing tobacco {{is usually not}} sweetened. Pieces of twist are either bitten off or cut and then chewed. Some brands of twist include Cotton Boll, Cumberland, and Warren County. Twist chewing tobacco is not widely {{available}} and is mostly found in Appalachia. Historically, twists could also be smoked in a pipe, or ground up into nasal snuff.|$|R

50|$|Levi Garrett is a {{brand of}} chewing tobacco {{produced}} by the American Snuff Company. Levi Garrett has a noticeably sweet flavor, with a larger cut and more stems than Red Man, Beechnut and other brands of <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>tobacco.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{brands of}} chewing plug include [...] "rustic" [...] and simple packaging, {{as is the}} case with popular plugs like Apple Sun Cured, Brown's Mule, Cannon Ball, Cup, Days Work, and Days O Work.

5000|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>tobacco,</b> {{also known}} as scrap, {{is perhaps the most}} common {{contemporary}} form of chewing tobacco. It consists of cut or shredded strips of <b>tobacco</b> <b>leaf,</b> and is usually sold in sealed pouches or bags lined with foil. Often sweetened, <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chew may have a tacky texture. (Though there are also unflavored or [...] "natural" [...] <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chews. However, these are far less common.) Popular, modern brands of scrap sold in North America include Red Man, Levi Garrett, Jackson's Apple Jack (made by Swisher International), Beech-Nut (formerly made by Lorillard; now Reynolds American), and Stoker's.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of chewing tobacco {{and the associated}} spittoon reached its height in the American Midwest during the late 19th century; however, as cigarettes became the predominant form of tobacco consumption the spittoon gradually fell into disuse. While spittoons are often a rarity in modern society, <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>tobacco</b> can still be purchased at many convenience stores or from tobacconists throughout the United States and Canada.|$|R
50|$|Plug {{chewing tobacco}} is pressed tobacco leaves into a square, brick-like mass of tobacco. From this, bites {{are taken from}} the plug, or can also be cut off and then chewed. Plug tobacco is declining in popularity, and thus is less readily {{available}} than <b>loose</b> <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>tobacco.</b> Some brands include Cannon Ball, Days Work, and Levi Garrett Plug. Historically, plug tobacco could be either smoked in a pipe or chewed, but today these are two distinct products.|$|R
