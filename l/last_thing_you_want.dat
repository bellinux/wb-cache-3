500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Post {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone praised the album for providing a [...] "much-needed escape route" [...] from the alternative rock offerings {{of the early}} 1990s, and for successfully merging disparate styles. She concluded: [...] "When Post comes to an end, it feels like getting back from a good vacation: the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is re-enter the real world". Comparing it to Björk's previous studio album Debut, Slant Magazines Eric Henderson felt Post [...] "upped the ante by plugging listeners into the diverse pop mixtape playing inside her mind". In the end, he argued that it [...] "will likely always remain the Björk album that most successfully sustains her winning balance of experimental whimsy and solid pop magic". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jim Farber stated that despite Posts [...] "bizarre" [...] combination of diverse genres, the conviction of Björk's delivery and assuring hooks [...] " [...] her most surreal passages as relatable as moon-June standards". Ultimately, {{he felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] that tradition, constructing standards for the cyber age".|$|E

[...] "But I'll tell you what: the old man can't expect it of everybody. If he keeps this thing up much longer, it's going to be talked about. You can't have a woman walking into your place of business, and trying to bulldoze you before your porter, without setting your porter to thinking.

5000|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} on its release, and has retained its critical {{standing over the}} years. NME said, [...] "In days when the pop song {{has been reduced to}} the reiteration of catch-phrases, Matt Johnson flexes a rare literary flair. More importantly he has the command of music's immense possibilities to carry them through without self-indulgence. Ignore this LP if you must, but you'll be ignoring one of the year's rare heart-stopping moments." [...] Melody Maker said, [...] "As you return to Soul Mining again and again, there will be times when you discover it was the <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> really <b>wanted</b> to do. It will sound mawkish, almost absurd, like a voice crying wolf over and over ... Then again, there'll be times when it will sound obscenely close to the bone, as if Johnson were invading and defiling your most private thoughts and emotions ... In other words, you'll use Soul Mining as a barometer to your day and if that's the principal function of great pop, then surely Soul Mining is great pop." ...|$|R

5000|$|Recent {{years have}} seen many new {{property}} development projects, especially in water frontage or harbour view locations, and often earlier buildings have been replaced entirely.

5000|$|Temporary tax {{measures}} {{adopted in the}} 2000s, {{commonly referred to as}} Bush tax cuts, though extended in 2011, are scheduled to expire at the end of 2012. The uncertainty surrounding changes to tax rates, as well as the availability of certain tax deductions and credits, have led to many businesses holding off on hiring and reducing spending. Honeywell CEO David Cote cites tax uncertainty as the reason why Honeywell has replaced only one quarter of departing employees in 2012 saying, [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> is to hire {{a lot of people and}} then have to lay them off." ...|$|E

5000|$|It wasn’t at all planned {{from the}} {{beginning}} that I would make two films with Jean-Claude Van Damme back-to-back. I was approached to do Timecop, and I loved the auspices. (Producer) Larry Gordon was involved with it; Moshe Diamant was a terrific producer; Sam Raimi was involved... It was a really clever story, and I thought it was a chance to make the best movie Van Damme ever made. I said yes and we made it, and it was clear {{that it was going to}} be a hit because it previewed through the roof every time. It’s still his biggest hit. So Universal and Moshe Diamant wanted to team us again as soon as possible, so they put Sudden Death together. There was never any question that we would just do Timecop 2. I would never have agreed to that. The <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do is repeat yourself. That would be awful. Peter Hyams, Empire Magazine ...|$|E
