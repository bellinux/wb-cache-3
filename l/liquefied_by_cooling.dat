50|$|Water gas is {{compressed}} to 20 bar {{and pumped}} into the Linde-Frank-Caro reactor. A water column removes most of the carbon dioxide and sulfur. Tubes with caustic soda then remove the remaining carbon dioxide, sulphur, and water from the gas stream.

The remaining gas is pumped to the next vessel where the nitrogen is <b>liquefied</b> <b>by</b> <b>cooling</b> to −205 °C, resulting in hydrogen gas as an end product.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Canvey Island Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) import terminal, further NGL storage sites were constructed from the late 1960s. These were peak-shaving facilities used to support the NTS at times of high demand, and to ensure security of gas supplies at strategic locations. When demand was high liquefied natural gas was pumped from storage tanks, heated in vapourisers to a gaseous state and delivered into the NTS. When demand was low, gas was withdrawn from the NTS and <b>liquefied</b> <b>by</b> cryogenic <b>cooling</b> to minus 162 °C to replenish the storage tanks.|$|R
50|$|In 1980 British Gas {{constructed}} a LNG peak-shaving facility {{on the south}} west of the refinery site. The facility was used to support the NTS at times of high demand, and to ensure security of gas supplies in SE England. During periods of high demand liquefied gas was pumped from storage tanks and heated in vapourisers to a gaseous state for delivery into the NTS. There are four tanks each of 50,000 m3 (total storage capacity of 200,000 m3), constructed of 9% nickel-steel alloy insulated with perlite, each with a containment bund to half the tank height. At times of low demand gas could be withdrawn from the NTS and <b>liquefied</b> <b>by</b> cryogenic <b>cooling</b> to minus 162°C to replenish the storage tanks.

40|$|Japan {{produces}} less natural resoures, {{so it is}} {{the most}} important problem for Japan to develop a perennial natural energy. One of them, an electrical power generated by temperature difference of a ocean wather (EPTD) has been exploited for practical use. The EPTD is generated <b>by</b> expansion of <b>liquefied</b> ammonia, but electrical power produced by wather vapor (EPWV) is generated by thermal expansion of water vapor. Therefore, the EPTD system has an extra equipment for liquefaction of ammonia, comparing with the EPWV system, because an ammonia of b. p. - 33. 5 ℃ can not be <b>liquefied</b> <b>by</b> only <b>cooling</b> the ammonia gas which is vaporized from the liquid ammonia, using the bottom water (～ 4. 5 ℃) of deep ocean. The thermodynamics says that the thermal engine can not obtain 100 % efficiency with every efforts, because of the energy loss which is inevitable to the thermal engine. The thermodynamic calculation of the thermal energy which is necessary for obtaining some electrical energy shows that the ratio of the energy for the EPWV system to the energy of the EPTD is 1 : 17. It means that the EPTD system wastes more fossil fuels than the obtained perennial natural energy...|$|R
30|$|The risk of {{explosion}} {{most notably}} exists for transportation of gases that are <b>liquefied</b> <b>by</b> <b>cooling</b> or high pressure. An explosion {{occurs when the}} energy stored in the gas is released in a short time. In a full vessel almost all gas will be in liquid phase. A rupture in a full vessel leads to a sudden pressure drop to ambient causing the liquid to boil. The quick change from liquid to gas phase cause an increase in volume. Depending on the vessel temperature a blast wave can occur, if the evaporation is fast enough. This process is called, boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE). In an almost empty vessel much fuel {{will be in the}} gas phase. In this case a rupture causes an expansion of the pressurized vapour. The resulting blast depends on the temperature, type and amount of gas, and the dimensions of the tunnel. These two bursting vessel scenarios, without ignition, lead to high explosion loads in the zone around the bursting vessel (200 – 500 kPa), but is reduced after a couple of metres when the blast is directed along the tunnel axis, at around 100 kPa. Once the gas has expanded, ignition, e.g. by a spark or a hot surface, can occur if the gas-air mixture is within flammability limits. Depending on the speed of the flame front and expansion from combustion, a deflagration (10 – 800 kPa for HC-air mixtures) or detonation (1500 – 2000 kPa for HC-air mixtures) can take place. Of these, a deflagration in the order of 100 kPa is the most plausible scenario. Detonation is less likely as it requires instantaneous release of an almost empty tank. A pressure of 100 kPa or larger will cause direct casualties from the blast (Weerheijm 2014).|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The Dutch {{government}} has set sustainability {{goals for the}} year 2020. In that year, 16 % of the energy use must come from renewable sources and the emissions of greenhouse gasses must be reduced by 20 % with respect to 1990. These goals {{are part of a}} plan which must eventually reduce the Dutch dependence on fossil fuels and the related emissions of greenhouse- and other harmful gasses. LNG fuel usage is internationally considered as a viable option to replace oil products in the transport sector. LBM is the “green” variant of LNG and can expand {{in the wake of the}} LNG market development. LBM usage may be an option to achieve the government goals. The central research question is: ‘What is needed to maximise the use of LBM in the Dutch transport sector and what is the optimum from an economic, environmental and organisational perspective?’ To maximise LBM use in the Netherlands a strong growth of the LNG sector is necessary along with government support for producing LBM. The organisation of an LBM infrastructure is preferably fully integrated with the LNG infrastructure. From an economic point of view LBM is more advantageous for the government than grid injected green gas, but the environmental benefits only become apparent after 2020. LNG is natural gas which is <b>liquefied</b> <b>by</b> <b>cooling</b> it to a temperature of - 162 °C. This is then transported by bunker ship to well isolated LNG storage terminals in Zeebrugge and Rotterdam. LBM is produced by upgrading biogas and then liquefying it. LBM is an option to extract energy from biomass, next to green gas and CHP. An analysis of the production costs of LBM shows that these are about 2 times higher than the market price of LNG and what LNG distributors are willing to pay. In the total picture however, LBM is probably a cheaper option than green gas injected in the natural gas grid. Therefore LBM should be incorporated in the SDE+ scheme. To create a level playing field between LBM and green gas, the excise taxes for these fuels have to be equalised. The price of LNG at the pump is currently lower than that of diesel, but it is uncertain how these prices develop when the LNG market grows. The Dutch availability of biomass for the production of energy is limited to about 8 % of the primary energy use. Gasification is not expected to take-off before 2020, but has the most potential. Anaerobic digestion has less potential and, on top of that, is used for different forms of energy generation. Moreover, the current government policies are focussed on stimulation the production of green gas instead of LBM. LBM production thus has limited potential and can only fuel a part of the transport sector. LBM fuel is best suited for use in heavy duty vehicles and shipping. For shipping, large storage bunkers have to be realised along harbours. A network of refilling stations has to be created to service heavy duty vehicles. The properties of an LNG truck are comparable to diesel and investments pay themselves back in three years. LNG and LBM are most likely offered as single fuel at the filling stations. If all heavy duty vehicles in the Netherlands would run on LBM, CO 2 emissions would be reduced by 3 % with respect to 1990 levels. The energy usage would then be about 2 % of the Dutch primary energy use. This scenario is unlikely, given the limited availability of biomass. The shipping sector approximately has the same environmental potential but LNG use develops even more slowly there. The contribution to the 2020 goals is almost nothing, mainly because the number of LNG trucks grows slowly in the coming years. The conclusion must be that, although LBM is an interesting option to reduce the CO 2, NOx and PM 10 emissions in a part of the transport sector, the total potential is limited. Moreover, the development of the LNG market is in a too early stage to already start introducing LBM next to it. Short term introduction of LBM thus means a high risk compared to other forms of biomass conversion and generates relatively little advantages. Replacing LBM with LNG is preferably done when LNG has established itself firmly as a transport fuel in the Netherlands. ...|$|E
