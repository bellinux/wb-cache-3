60|$|Chris, {{who could}} now <b>lash</b> the wheel, <b>covered</b> the tired man with {{blankets}} from below, and went {{fishing in the}} lazaretto for something to eat. But by the day following he found himself forced to give in, drowsing fitfully by the wheel and waking ever and anon {{to take a look}} at things.|$|R
60|$|Maxwell did {{not speak}} for a while. Again an impulse which {{appeared}} wholly illogical in face of the girl's confession prompted him to tell her all; but very much lay at stake, {{and he did not}} usually act on impulse. Meanwhile his companion watched him from under the dark <b>lashes</b> which half <b>covered</b> her eyes; while, unobserved, the sleepy aunt watched them both. Bonita Castro looked bewitchingly pretty in her filmy draperies, perhaps the more so because of her curiously heightened color; but though Maxwell knew that she was a woman who would do much when prompted by passion, she did not look like a traitress.|$|R
60|$|He unlashed the {{fastenings}} {{of the cover}} of the circular hole above him, reached his hand forward and got hold of Luka's paddle, and passed it with his own out through the hole. Then he sat up himself. Confident as he felt in the canoe, he was almost frightened at the wild aspect of the sea. The wind was literally howling, driving the rain before it with a force that stung Godfrey's neck as it struck it. He got out a strip of deer-skin lashing, of which there was a supply always close at hand under the deck, lashed the paddles together, and then, leaning aft, lashed them at the centre firmly to the tow-rope. Then with some difficulty he got out his knife and cut the rope close to its fastening; the paddles flew overboard, and the boat drifted rapidly astern, the drag of the paddles being, as Godfrey observed with satisfaction, sufficient to keep her head to wind. Then he wriggled himself down underneath the apron again and <b>lashed</b> down the <b>cover</b> of the hole.|$|R
