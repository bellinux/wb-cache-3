Paananen has demonstrated that “all the signs of forgery Carlson unearthed in his analysis of the handwriting”, such as a “forger’s tremor”, is only visible in the images Carlson used for his handwriting analysis. Carlson chose “to use the halftone reproductions found in [...] Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark” where the images were printed with a <b>line</b> <b>screen</b> made of dots. If the “images are magnified to the degree necessary for forensic document examination” the dot matrix will be visible and the letters “will not appear smooth”.

5000|$|Anilox rolls were {{originally}} made using {{a process of}} mechanical engraving, utilizing hardened steel tools of various cell counts and cell shapes diamond pecking machine, but modern rolls are laser engraved.The characteristics of an anilox roll {{determine the amount of}} ink that will be transferred to the plate: angle of the cells, cell volume, and <b>line</b> <b>screen.</b> A 60 degree angle ensures maximum density in a given space. Lower volume makes for less ink. Low line numbers will allow for a heavy layer of ink to be printed, whereas high line numbers will permit finer detail in printing. Both cell volume and <b>line</b> <b>screen</b> are closely correlated.|$|E
50|$|In printing, anilox is {{a method}} used to provide a {{measured}} amount of ink to a flexo printing plate An anilox roll is a hard cylinder, usually constructed of a steel or aluminum core which is coated by an industrial ceramic whose surface contains millions of very fine dimples, known as cells. ==Usage== Depending on the detail of the images to be printed, the press operator will select an anilox roll with a higher or lower <b>line</b> <b>screen.</b> Low <b>line</b> <b>screen</b> rolls are used where a heavy layer of ink is desired, such as in heavy block lettering. Higher line screens produce finer details and are used in four-color process work such as reproducing photographs. Often a job will require a different <b>line</b> <b>screen</b> for each color to be printed. Experienced press operators are skilled at determining the appropriate rolls for a given print job.Depending {{on the design of}} the printing press, the anilox roll is either semi-submerged in the ink fountain, or comes into contact with a so-called metering roller, which is semi-submerged in the ink fountain. In either instance, a thick layer of typically viscous ink is deposited on the roll. A doctor blade is used to scrape excess ink from the surface leaving just the measured amount of ink in the cells. The roll then rotates to contact with the flexographic printing plate which receives the ink from the cells for transfer to the printed material.|$|E
5000|$|On December 5, 1901 American {{inventor}} Frederic Eugene Ives {{presented his}} [...] "parallax stereogram" [...] at the Franklin Institute of the State of Pennsylvania.

At the time he didn't think it was important enough to spend his time on. In 1901 Ives realized that he could easily adapt his Kromolinoskop color photo camera to create the stereogram and thought it would be an interesting scientific novelty worthy of presentation at the Franklin Institute. The [...] "parallax stereogram" [...] was a photo shot through two apertures behind the lens with a [...] "transparent-line screen, consisting of opaque lines with clear spaces between them" [...] in front of the sensitive plate, slightly separated from it. The <b>line</b> <b>screen</b> had 200 parallel lines per inch (...) and was contact-printed from an original factory halftone screen.

5000|$|Many {{inventor}}s {{tried to}} expand the amount of images {{that could be used}} in <b>line</b> <b>screen</b> technology, which was mostly limited to how wide the lines could be without making the image too dark. French inventor Maurice Bonnet (1907-1994) made several patented improvements with his Relièphographie system of the same name. He used a camera with a horizontal row of eleven lenses (French patent N° 774145, June 5, 1934), followed by one with 33 lenses in 1937 (French patent n°833891, July 2, 1937). The darkness of the images is remedied with a lightbox frame. While the pictures of Estanave could only be seen from the right viewpoint, the multiple images that formed the Relièphographs ensured a clear 3D image when viewed from different angles. Bonnet was the only creator of autostereograms with line sheet technology who managed to successfully market his technique, for which he founded his [...] "La Relièphographie" [...] company in 1937. About 13 extant Relièphographie pictures by Bonnet are known, including three advertisements, two portraits and eight medical subjects. With their 30x40 cm format these are the largest preserved line sheet autostereograms. Despite the success Bonnet abandoned line sheet technology after he developed a lenticular sheet around 1940.|$|E

In 2010, two further handwriting analyses of the Mar Saba MS were undertaken by two Greek graphologists at the behest of Biblical Archaeology Review. The first, Venetia Anastasopoulou, a forensic handwriting expert witness with experience in many Greek court cases, compared the Mar Saba photos with known samples of Morton Smith's Greek handwriting, and concluded that it was most probably not written by Morton Smith. However the second graphologist, Agamemnon Tselikas, a paleographer, director of the National Bank of Greece Cultural Foundation and also of the Mediterranean Research Institute for Paleography, Bibliography and History of Texts, concluded it was a 20th-century forgery of 18th century script, and that the most likely forger was either Smith or someone in Smith's employ.|$|E
