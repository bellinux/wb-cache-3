25|$|The {{length of}} time a wine spends in the barrel is {{dependent}} on the varietal and finished style the winemaker desires. The majority of oak flavoring is imparted in the first few months the wine is in contact with oak, while longer term exposure adds <b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> aeration, which helps precipitate phenolic compounds and quickens the aging process. New World Pinot noir may spend less than a year in oak. Premium Cabernet Sauvignon may spend two years. The very tannic Nebbiolo grape may spend four or more years in oak. High end Rioja producers will sometimes age their wines up to ten years in American oak to get a desired earthy cedar and herbal character.|$|E
50|$|Because of its weight, the AH4 {{can be used}} in {{mountain}} warfare, which traditionally had to use pack howitzers like the OTO Melara Mod 56, but that proved to be ineffective because of its short range, and reliability due to its <b>light</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The M1919A1 {{featured}} a <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel</b> and a bipod. It was {{distinguished from the}} [...] "M1919" [...] because it also had sights, which the M1919 did not.|$|R
50|$|Mks I-V {{were limited}} {{by a short}} range and high weight, being 4-5 tons heavier than the {{succeeding}} Mk VI which {{was designed as a}} howitzer and hence had a much <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although the sPzB 41 was {{classified}} as a heavy anti-tank rifle, its construction was much more typical of an anti-tank gun. Like the latter, it had a recoil mechanism, carriage and shield. The only significant feature the weapon had in common with anti-tank rifles {{was a lack of}} elevation and traverse mechanisms—the <b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> could be easily manipulated manually.|$|E
50|$|The Uk vz. 59 fires 7.62×54mmR {{ammunition}} (although a Vz. 59N variant for 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition also exists), delivered via an ammunition belt. The weapon {{can serve}} as a light (<b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> and bipod, vz. 59L model) and medium machine gun (heavy barrel and tripod), and can also be used as a co-axial mounted weapon (Vz. 59T version).|$|E
50|$|FAL rifles {{have also}} been {{manufactured}} in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with bipods, although some <b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.|$|E
50|$|The SU-16B has {{the same}} {{features}} of the A model, but has a <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel,</b> an M-16-type adjustable-post front sight, and a windage adjustable rear sight. The B model has been criticized by some users for the light construction of its barrel, which {{is said to be}} too light for sustained firing.|$|R
50|$|Air-cooled {{aircraft}} {{version of the}} M1917. Developed during the First World War, the M1918 arrived too late, but became the dominant weapon of its type in US service until {{the development of the}} M1919. It features a heavier <b>barrel,</b> but <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel</b> jacket as compared to the M1917. A sub-variant, the M1918M1, was developed as a flexible version of the fixed M1918.|$|R
50|$|The Vulcan's {{rate of fire}} is {{typically}} 6,000 rounds per minute, although some versions (such {{as that of the}} AMX and the F-106 Delta Dart) are limited to a lower rate, and others (A-7 Corsair) have a selectable rate of fire of either 4,000 or 6,000 rounds per minute. The M61A2's <b>lighter</b> <b>barrels</b> allow a somewhat higher rate of fire, up to 6,600 rounds per minute.|$|R
50|$|A {{more visible}} {{difference}} is the much lighter barrel fitted to the Tabuk. The M72's barrel is finned at the rear near the hand guards and is far heavier {{than that of the}} Tabuk (or that of a standard AKM). The thickness of the M72's barrel exists to facilitate heat distribution via mass and cooling via surface area. Since the option to fire full-auto has been omitted (and it is not typical of eastern bloc long range precision rifles to use heavy barrels for accuracy) the Tabuk, like the SVD and the PSL, has a relatively <b>light</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} Luger, the Mauser C96 pistol was {{modified}} to {{fire in a}} fully automatic mode. It was produced in 1896, {{and was one of}} the first commercially successful and practical semi-automatic pistols. In the late 1920s, Spanish gunmakers introduced [...] "selective fire" [...] copies of the C96 with detachable magazines, and in the early 1930s Mauser engineers introduced the model 711 and 712 Schnellfeuer variants, which included a fire selector mechanism allowing fully automatic fire at a rate of 1000 rounds/minute. Due to the weapon's <b>light</b> <b>barrel,</b> the fully automatic rate of fire could only be used for short bursts.|$|E

50|$|The Savage’s LE {{series of}} rifles all include heavy barrels that are button-rifled and {{free-floating}} which provides high accuracy. Thicker barrels are generally stiffer, and thus deflect less when a force is applied, {{such as when}} a forearm touches a barrel. A heavier barrel also tends to vibrate less when fired, thus sending bullets more consistently in the same direction. Their greater weight (within reason) {{makes it easier to}} hold the rifle steady. For all of these reasons, heavy barrels are generally more accurate than <b>lighter</b> <b>barrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M1919A6 was {{an attempt}} to combine the {{portability}} and low profile of the M1918 BAR with the sustained firing capability of the M1919A4. The M1919A4 was given a <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel,</b> buttstock, pistol grip, carrying handle, flash suppressor, and bipod to achieve the conversion. Even though it was reliable, it proved impractical for combat. While the 31 lb M1919A4 had a crew of two or more to carry the gun and the 14 lb tripod, one M1919A6 gunner was expected to carry and deploy the 32.5 lb gun by himself.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{part of the}} {{definition}} of a [...] "varmint" [...] {{is that it is a}} nuisance, varmints are not stalked, but rather they are hunted from a fixed position. This makes weight of little consideration in a varmint rifle, so heavy barrels are common. Varmints are also not subject to the same bag limits as game animals are, so far more shots may be fired. The heavier barrel is, in general, more accurate than a <b>light</b> <b>barrel,</b> plus the extra mass helps reduce the felt recoil and absorb the heat from more shots before expanding and potentially reducing accuracy. Folding shooting benches and sandbag rests help provide a stable base for the shooter, allowing the maximum accuracy to be extracted from the rifle.|$|E
50|$|As {{a company}} or {{battalion}} support weapon, the M1919 required {{at least a}} two-man machine gun team. But, in practice, four men were normally involved: the gunner (who fired the gun and when advancing carried the tripod and box of ammo), the assistant gunner (who helped feed the gun and carried the gun, and box of spare parts and tools), and two ammunition carriers. The original idea was to allow the gun to be more easily packed for transport, and featured a <b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> and bipod when first introduced as the M1919A1. Unfortunately, it quickly {{became clear that the}} gun was too heavy to be easily moved, {{while at the same time}} too light for sustained fire. This led to the M1919A2, which included a heavier barrel and tripod, and could be continuously fired for longer durations.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the rifle}} had been {{produced}} in sufficient numbers every platoon of Warsaw Pact troops included {{at least one}} Dragunov rifle marksman. In the German Democratic Republic arsenals alone, there were almost 2,000 Dragunov rifles. In Warsaw Pact troop formations, the Dragunov marksmen were widespread among the regular units. To fulfill this role, the SVD is relatively light for a sniper rifle, but well balanced, {{making it easier to}} use in a dynamic battle. It is also semi-automatic, a trait it shares with the German Heckler & Koch PSG1 and US M21, so as to allow rapid fire and quicker engagement of multiple targets. As with all precision-oriented rifles, the user has to take care not to overheat the barrel and limit the use of rapid fire. In order to fire effective API ammunition, its accuracy potential was slightly downgraded by shortening the twist rate, another uncommon priority for a pure sniper rifle. It has a relatively <b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> profile; its precision is good, but not exceptional. Like an infantry rifle, there are mounts on the barrel to fix a bayonet. The standard AKM bayonet can even be used to cut electrified barbed wire. Lastly, the rifle {{was meant to be a}} relatively cheap mass-produced firearm.|$|E
50|$|In {{the years}} after World War I, the {{tendency}} of guns and howitzers to acquire each other's characteristics led to the renaissance {{of the concept of}} the gun-howitzer. This was a product of technical advances such as the French invention of autofrettage just before World War I, which led to stronger and <b>lighter</b> <b>barrels,</b> the use of cut-off gear to control recoil length depending on firing elevation angle, and the invention of muzzle brakes to reduce recoil forces. Like the gun-howitzers of the 19th century, those of the 20th century replaced both guns and howitzers.|$|R
50|$|The {{inherent}} {{difficulty of}} adequately <b>lighting</b> <b>barrel</b> vaulted structures {{has been widely}} acknowledged.The intrinsic engineering issue {{is the need to}} avoid fenestration punctures in stonework barrel vaults. Such openings could compromise the integrity of the entire arch system. Thus the Romanesque medieval builders had to resort to techniques of small windows, large buttresses, or other forms of interior wall cross-bracing to achieve the desired lighting outcomes. In many of the monasteries, a natural solution was cloisters which could have high barrel-vaulted construction with an open courtyard to allow ample lighting.|$|R
50|$|The SU-16C has a true folding stock {{as it can}} {{be fired}} with the stock folded, rather than the folding stock and trigger group design of the other weapons. The C has a medium-weight barrel, presumably in {{response}} to the criticism against the <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel</b> of the B model. The barrel is threaded at the muzzle, and can be mounted with accessories, such as a flash-hider. The front sight, which is an M-16 adjustable-post type, is incorporated over the gas block and is not removable. The C also includes a reciprocating dust cover over the ejection port and a case-deflecting charging handle.|$|R
50|$|The modele 1931 {{machine gun}} is a gas {{operated}} weapon which fires from open bolt and in full automatic only. It {{is derived from}} the French FM 24/29 Fusil-Mitrailleur (light machine gun) also designed by Lt Colonel Reibel, and based on the Browning Automatic Rifle. The FM 24/29 was developed into a heavier machine gun capable of relatively sustained fire, by giving it an extremely thick and massive barrel, to act as a heat sink. This was necessary, since the FM 24/29 lacked a quick-change barrel or water-cooling and its normal <b>light</b> <b>barrel</b> would rapidly overheat and wear out, if fired in more than short bursts, with cooling rests between. The long stroke gas piston is located below the barrel and operates the vertically tilting bolt group. Ammunition is fed from side-mounted multi-layer 150-round pan magazines (with bullets pointing {{to the center of the}} round magazine). The gun can be modified to take magazines on either the left or right side, to ease magazine changes while mounted in the standard side-by-side JM twin-mount. Ejection is straight down, through the short chute attached to the base of the receiver, which in fortifications, usually led into a longer tube or chute that directed the spent cases into the ditches outside. The gun was fitted with a forward-curved pistol grip to aid control and a standard rifle-style trigger. When mounted in fortifications, the twin-mount included an adjustable twin-shoulder stock, a tubular metal bar that extended from the rear of the mounting frame, which mounted a horizontal crossbar, with shoulder pads on each end. The operator would face the breeches of the guns and place these pads against his shoulders. He would then use his body to control traverse, while his hands would grip the pistols grips to fire one or both guns. Elevation was controlled by a brass crank underneath the weapon. Twin mountings came in T and F configurations; F types used standard triggers and stocks and were used for embrasure mounts in casemates and cupolas, while the T featured a trigger operated by Bowden cable and was intended for remote use in retractable turrets.|$|E

50|$|The {{new weapon}} {{emphasised}} reliability and rapid response to fire first round from shutdown state (particularly for defence against missiles) over {{a high rate}} of fire, allowing a switch to a <b>lighter,</b> single <b>barrel</b> mounting and ammunition of a one-piece design.|$|R
5000|$|Some historians {{believe that}} {{a small number of}} early 1803 type rifles were {{produced}} for the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is also possible that contract rifles of 1794 were modified at the arsenal at Harper's Ferry, by shortening the barrels and reboring and rerifling them to [...]54 caliber. The records at the arsenal are not exact on the matter, as it appears the first 1803 prototype was produced six months after Lewis departed Maryland. The later 1803 rifles had a slightly <b>lighter</b> <b>barrel</b> than the first production run version, and had other slight differences such as a thinner lock plate and a narrower trigger guard. The barrel was 36 inches in length on the second version.|$|R

50|$|Light {{machine guns}} were {{introduced}} as lighter, more portable automatic weapons. They still fired the same full-power rifle caliber ammunition, but used <b>lighter</b> <b>barrels</b> without extra cooling and were {{fired from a}} bipod. Light machine guns were {{not intended to be}} fired for extended periods of time. The lightest of the new designs were not capable of sustained fire, as they did not have extra cooling features and were fed from a comparatively small magazine. Essentially a machine rifle with a bipod, weapons like the Chauchat or the Madsen 1902 were the most mobile, but were made for single and burst fire. These were used in assaults to great effect by infantry, but were less effective in vehicle-mounted and other applications.|$|R
5000|$|The 110 BA {{includes}} a fluted heavy barrel that is free-floating which provides high accuracy.
