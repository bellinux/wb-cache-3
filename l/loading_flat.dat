40|$|OFDM) {{has been}} {{thoroughly}} investigated as an enabling technology for future broadband multimedia communication. In this paper, we suggest adaptive bit allocation algorithms that {{operate in a}} frequency selective fading channel environment by exploiting channel state information obtained through a feedback channel. The proposed algorithms try to maximize the overall throughput of the system with significantly reduced complexity while guaranteeing that mean bit error rate (BER) of all sub-channels remains below the pre-defined BER threshold. To do that, the first proposed algorithm divides all sub-channels into several groups according to their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The grouping criteria are adaptive to the current channel state and BER constraint. The second algorithm tries to find the appropriate constellation size for each sub-channel. The proposed algorithms were compared with existing algorithms through simulation. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed algorithms are close to optimum solution with significantly lower complexity.

40|$|There {{is often}} a need for using large test {{databases}} for benchmarking of DBMS query optimizers, performance tuning, and testing queries and database programs. One seemingly obvious alternative is {{to use one of}} the many publicly available databases. Such databases are, however, by their very nature domain-specific and, in addition, have their own data distributions that render them inappropriate for controlled experimentation. In this work, we have developed SDG (Synthetic Database Generator), which is capable of generating very large (millions of records) synthetic databases. SDG can generate one or more related relations according to use-defined parameters that specify such characteristics as number of relations in the schema, relation sizes, value distributions, selectivity factors, and key/foreign-key relationships. The domain of a generated application is specified to SDG by a small (about a dozen rows) sample from the desired domain whereby the sample acts as a seed for the generated synthetic database. SDG is written in SQL and generates relational data directly. Therefore, {{there is no need to}} go through the extra steps of <b>loading</b> <b>flat</b> files into a database...|$|E

One purpose of muscle contractions is to generate blood flow within skeletal tissues. The present study aimed to investigate the pulsatile patellar bone blood flow after low and high intensity leg extension exercises. Forty-two healthy individuals volunteered for the study. Dynamic isotonic one leg extension/flexion exercises were performed in a leg extension machine. Randomly, the exercises were performed with {{the left or right}} leg with either 10 repetition maximum (10 RM) continuously without any resting periods (high intensity muscle work), or 20 RM with a 2 second rest between contractions (low intensity muscle work). The work load, expressed in kilograms totally lifted, was identical in both legs. The pulsatile patellar blood flow was recorded continuously using a photoplethysmographic technique. Blood pressure was measured continuously during muscle work by a non-invasive method (Finapress). The patellar pulsatile bone blood flow increased significantly more after high intensity muscle work (61 %) compared to the same work load performed using a lower intensity (22 %), p = 0. 000073. Systolic blood pressure changed equally during and after both interventions. Post-exercise bone hyperaemia appears to be correlated to the intensity of muscle contractions in the muscle compartment attached to the bone...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the residual denting {{in the face}} sheet and corresponding core damage in a locally <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> sandwich structure with foam core. The problem is analytically considered {{in the context of}} elastic bending of the face sheet accompanied by non-linear deformation of the crushed foam core. The plane and axisymmetric formulations are studied. The obtained solutions allow for the estimation of the magnitude of the residual face dent through the size of the crushed core zone (or vice versa). Thus, the analytical background is proposed for a non-destructive inspection of locally indented/impacted sandwich structures. The solutions are verified experimentally...|$|R

40|$|A {{control volume}} method is {{presented}} for predicting the displacement and rotation of thin transversely <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> plates. The new procedure uses discrete Kirchoff triangle (DKT) elements but introduces a dual mesh of interconnected control volumes (CVs) centred on the finite element (FE) vertices. Discrete equations for the unknown {{degrees of freedom}} are subsequently derived by enforcing equilibrium on these CVs; as such this implementation is a quadrature free routine. To allow a comparison, a quadrature free implementation of the DKT element, using the standard finite element procedure, was developed using symbolic methematics. The CV based procedure is validated by patch tests for a state of pure bending and twist. Convergence tests for various loading types show enhanced performance for coarse meshes over the equivalent FE method...|$|R

A special test rig was constructed for superimposing fretting corrosion onto constant amplitude and spectrum loading of the specimen.

40|$|Strengthening {{of steel}} {{structures}} using externally-bonded carbon fibre reinforced polymers ‘CFRP’ is a rapidly developing technique. This paper describes the behaviour of axially <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> steel plates strengthened using carbon fibre reinforced polymer sheets. Two steel plates were joined together with adhesive {{and followed by}} the application of carbon fibre sheet double strap joint with different bond lengths. The behaviour of the specimens was further investigated by using nonlinear finite element analysis to predict the failure modes and load capacity. In this study, bond failure is the dominant failure mode for normal modulus (240 GPa) CFRP bonding which closely matched the results of finite elements. The predicted ultimate loads from the FE analysis {{are found to be}} in good agreement with experimental values...|$|R

The distant signal was only 902 yards from Knowle's up main home signal, insufficient distance for the express to stop from 80 mph.

40|$|Fiber {{reinforced}} {{composite materials}} {{are being used}} in an increasingly wide range of structural applications. However, many types of composite laminates are extremely susceptible to impact damage [1, 2]. Relatively low energy impacts may induce significant internal damage, generally {{in the form of}} matrix cracks and delaminations, which are not accompanied by visual evidence [3 – 5]. This damage has been shown to significantly reduce the strength, stiffness and fatigue life of compression <b>loaded,</b> <b>flat</b> composite laminates [1, 2, 4 – 7], as well as the strength of thin walled composite tubes [8]. Residual strength and life are closely related to {{the nature and extent of}} damage [6, 7]; thus, the capability to perform detailed nondestructive evaluation of damage represents a critical component in the damage tolerant design of composite structures...|$|R

The design parameters included {{the number of}} layers (2 or 3), the level of prestress (annealed, heat strengthened, thermally tempered), and laminate type (PVB of SG). Additionally, steel reinforced glass beams were tested. Three different methods were applied to obtain complete redundancy curves (development of residual strength under increasing levels of damage) : 4 -point bending after no, partial, or full damage. The damage was applied by a custom made impact device consisting of a spring <b>loaded</b> <b>flat</b> steel head that impacted {{the edges of the}} glass layers of the beams. The resulting Element Safety Diagrams of each design is discussed. Relativized curves are used to compare the safety of the designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{pressure}} proof testing of fuselage structures with fatigue cracks to insure structural integrity was evaluated from a fracture mechanics viewpoint.

The results revealed that the remaining fatigue life after a proof cycle was longer than that without the proof cycle because of crack growth retardation due to increased crack closure. However, based on a crack length that is slightly less than the critical value at the maximum proof stress, the minimum assured life or proof test interval must {{be no more than}} 550 pressure cycles for a 1. 33 proof factor and 1530 pressure cycles for a 1. 5 proof factor to prevent in-flight failures...|$|R
