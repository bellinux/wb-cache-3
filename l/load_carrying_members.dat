Some important steps in earlier stages of research were focused on using metallic reinforcement, including steel bars, prestressed stranded cables, and bonded steel and aluminum plates. A disadvantage of the metallic reinforcement was the poor compatibility between the wood and the reinforcing materials.

40|$|When a {{building}} gets exposed to any natural hazards say Tsunami or Earthquake or due to manmade hazards such as fire, explosion of gases, impact of vehicles,etc., it effects {{the behavior of}} structure and causes collapse of a portion of structure or entire building. Progressive collapse implies a phenomenon of sequential failure of part of the structure or the complete structure initiated by sudden loss of vertical <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>member</b> (mostly column). In this present study, the behavior of RC framed buildings with 5 stories and 8 stories to progressive collapse located in different seismic zones (zone ii and zone v) is investigated. A linear static analysis is worked out using ETABS Software Ver. 15. 0 respectively. The demand capacity ratio is assessed in the critical region of the RC portion associated with the column removed, as per the provisions of GSA guidelines. The paper concluded that with the additional reinforcement in beams there is less susceptibility of progressive collapse, and also {{a building}} designed to resist earthquake loading has intrinsic capacity against progressive collapse...|$|R
40|$|A higher-order {{theory is}} {{developed}} to model composite box beams with arbitrary wall thicknesses. The theory, {{based on a}} refined displacement field, represents a three-dimensional model which approximates the elasticity solution. Therefore, the cross-sectional properties are not reduced to one-dimensional beam parameters. Both inplane and out-of-plane warping are automatically included in the formulation. The model accurately captures the transverse shear stresses through the thickness of each wall while satisfying all stress-free boundary conditions. Several numerical results are presented to validate the present theory. The developed theory is then used to model the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>member</b> of a tilt-rotor blade which has thick-walled sections. The composite structural analysis is coupled with an aerodynamic analysis to compute the aeroelastic stability of the blade. Finally, a multidisciplinary optimization procedure is developed to improve the aerodynamic, structural and aeroelastic performance of the tilt-rotor aircraft. The Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function is used to formulate the multiobjective function problem and a hybrid approximate analysis is used to reduce the computational effort. The optimum results are compared with the baseline values and show significant improvements in the overall performance of the tilt-rotor blade...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the optimum {{design of a}} composite box-beam structure subject to strength constraints. Such box-beams are used as the main <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members</b> of helicopter rotor blades. A computationally efficient analytical model for box-beam is used. Optimal ply orientation angles are sought which maximize the failure margins {{with respect to the}} applied loading. The Tsai-Wu-Hahn failure criterion is used to calculate the reserve factor for each wall and ply and the minimum reserve factor is maximized. Ply angles are used as design variables and various cases of initial starting design and loadings are investigated. Both gradient-based and particle swarm optimization (PSO) methods are used. It is found that the optimization approach leads to the design of a box-beam with greatly improved reserve factors which can be useful for helicopter rotor structures. While the PSO yields globally best designs, the gradient-based method can also be used with appropriate starting designs to obtain useful designs efficiently. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{progressive}} collapse of reinforced concrete structures is initiated when {{one or more}} vertical <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members</b> are removed due to man-made or natural hazards.

The purpose of this note is to determine whether this modification affects the safety and the rated load of the platform. Three of the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members</b> were analyzed; the gusset supports, the hinge supports, and the hinge pins. The long and short beams which make up the platform's flooring were not analyzed. The long beams will not be affected by this modification because there is no change in the length of their moment arms. The short beams will be affected, but will see a smaller bending stress because of the decrease in the length of their moment arms. Any weld results previously found will also not be affected...|$|E

However, attention {{is needed to}} strengthen these members where transverse impact force is expected to occur due to vehicle collisions. In this work, finite element (FE) model of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) strengthened CFST columns are developed {{and the effect of}} CFRP bond length is investigated under transverse impact loading. Initially the numerical models have been validated by comparing impact test results from literature. The validated models are then used for detail parametric studies by varying the length of externally bonded CFRP composites. The parameters considered for this research are impact velocity, impact mass, CFRP modulus, adhesive type, and axial static loading. It has been observed that the effect of CFRP strengthening is consistent after an optimum effective bond length of CFRP wrapping. The effect of effective bond length has been studied for above parameters. The results show that, under combined axial static and transverse impact loads CFST columns can successfully prevent global buckling failure by strengthening only 34 % of column length. Therefore, estimation of effective bond length is essential to utilise the CFRP composites cost effectively...|$|R

Structures may be designed to safely transmit a given system of forces using the least weight of material [...] They may also be designed to have maximum stiffness of a certain type for a given weight or alternatively to have the greatest possible fundamental frequency of vibration. These problems, although in general distinct from one another, are closely related and much can be achieved towards maximisation of stiffness and frequency {{by the use of}} minimum weight designs. In fact it can be shown that a minimum weight framework is the stiffest structure of that weight for the force system, which it is designed to carry. x The present report is concerned exclusively with the problem of the design of structures of minimum weight, which are required to transmit specified forces.

Finite Element Analysis of Ansys 12. 0 software is used to design the ten model of the build-up column. In order to study the effect of section of lacings, steel plate and L-angles are used.

40|$|Structures are {{assemblies}} of <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members</b> {{capable of}} safely transferring the superimposed loads to the foundations. Their main and most looked after property is {{the strength of}} the material that they are made of. Concrete, as we all know, is an integral material used for construction purposes. Thus, strength of concrete used, is required to be ‘known’ before starting with any kind of analysis. In the recent past, various methods and techniques, called as Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques, are being used for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). The concept of nondestructive testing (NDT) is to obtain material properties of in place specimens without the destruction of the specimen nor the structure from which it is taken. However, one problem that has been prevalent within the concrete industry for years is that the true properties of an in-place specimen have never been tested without leaving a certain degree of damage on the structure. For most cast-in-place concrete structures, construction specifications require that test cylinders be cast for 28 -day strength determination. Usually, representative test specimens are cast from the same concrete mix as the larger structural elements. Unfortunately, test specimens are not an exact representation of in-situ concrete, and may be affected by variations in specimen type, size, and curing procedures...|$|E

The sensitivities of the flow variables and the grid coordinates are numerically calculated using direct differentiation of the respective discretized governing equations. The {{sensitivity analysis}} techniques are adapted within a parabolized Navier Stokes equations solver. Aerodynamic design sensitivities for high speed wing-body configurations are calculated using the semi-analytical sensitivity analysis procedures. Representative results obtained compare well with those obtained using the finite difference approach and establish the computational efficiency and accuracy of the semi-analytical procedures. Multidisciplinary design optimization procedures {{have been developed for}} aerospace applications namely, gas turbine blades and high speed wing-body configurations. In complex applications, the coupled optimization problems are decomposed into sublevels using multilevel decomposition techniques. In cases with multiple objective functions, formal multiobjective formulation such as the Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser function approach and the modified global criteria approach have been used. Nonlinear programming techniques for continuous design variables and a hybrid optimization technique, based on a simulated annealing algorithm, for discrete design variables have been used for solving the optimization problems. The optimization procedure for gas turbine blades improves the aerodynamic and heat transfer characteristics of the blades. The two-dimensional, blade-to-blade aerodynamic analysis is performed using a panel code. The blade heat transfer analysis is performed using an in-house developed finite element procedure. The optimization procedure yields blade shapes with significantly improved velocity and temperature distributions. The multidisciplinary design optimization procedures for high speed wing-body configurations simultaneously improve the aerodynamic, the sonic boom and the structural characteristics of the aircraft.

40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} in a structure occurs when major structural <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members</b> are removed suddenly, {{and the remaining}} structural elements cannot support {{the weight of the}} building and fail. This failure usually occurs in a domino effect and leads to a progressive collapse failure in the structure. A building must have sufficient strength, ductility and redundancy to resist collapse and ensure life safety. Extreme loading events, such as earthquakes and explosions, may cause severe local damage that triggers a chain reaction of large-scale structural failure or progressive collapse such as in the Oklahoma City building and the World Trade Centre. The bombing of the Murray Federal Building in Oklahoma City is a typical example of progressive collapse failure. The initial bomb blast caused only 10 % of the structure’s damage, and the resulting progressive collapse failure lead to 90 % of the structure’s damage.

30|$|One of {{the major}} causes for {{failures}} of many high profile structures took place in last decade, around the world, is extreme loading effects generated due to hurricane, flood, earthquake, explosion, and terrorist attacks on buildings. This type of event imposes abnormal loading on the building structure. Generally members of building {{are not able to}} resist this type of abnormal loading and result into failure. One of the mechanisms of failure during such event is referred to as “Progressive Collapse”. Progressive collapse is a situation where local failure of a primary structural component leads to the collapse of adjoining members, which in turn leads to spread of collapse. Progressive collapse is defined as “the spread of an initial local failure from element to element resulting in the collapse of an entire structure or a disproportionately large part of it” (GSA 2003). It is a chain reaction failure of building members to an extent disproportionate to the original localized damage (DoD 2013). Progressive collapse of building structures is initiated when one or more vertical <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members</b> are seriously damaged or collapsed during any of the abnormal events. Once a local failure takes place the building’s gravity load transfers to neighboring members in the structure. If these members are not properly designed to resist and redistribute the additional load that part of the structure fails. As a result, a substantial part of the structure may collapse, causing greater damage to the structure than the initial impact. Thus, it is necessary to provide sufficient redundancy, ductility and continuity, which helps structure to find alternate paths for load distribution during undesired failure event and thus to reduce progressive collapse.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{enormous}} strides {{have been made}} in creating engineered cementitious composites (ECC) with extreme tensile ductility, on the order of several hundred times that of normal concrete or fiber reinforced concrete (FRC). Current ECC investigations include <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> structural <b>members</b> in new infrastructure systems, as well as for repair and retrofitting of existing structures. ECC design has been built on the paradigm of the relationships between material microstructures, processing, material properties, and performance. This paradigm has worked very well in creating various versions of ECC that can be processed by self-consolidated casting, spraying, and extrusion. This paper describes preliminary results of an initial attempt at creating green ECCs, ECCs that maintain the tensile ductility characteristics, but which also incorporate sustainability considerations in the design of these materials for infrastructure applications. Sustainable material design integrates microstructure tailoring with life cycle analysis based on social, environmental, and economic (SEE) indicators.

40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} is {{a situation}} when local failure is followed by collapse of adjoining members, which in turn causes global collapse, threatening life. Local failure of a vertical <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>member,</b> {{can be caused by}} abnormal loading such as explosion, bombing, sudden vehicle impact and design errors. The design of structures against progressive collapse has not been an integral part of structural design. It is difficult to predict the structural behaviour of building members during progressive collapse because of the dynamic nature of the event and the limited experimental tests conducted {{to understand the nature of}} progressive collapse. An experimental program comprising eight reinforced concrete (RC) beam-column sub-assemblages is presented to investigate the structural behaviour and progressive collapse resistance of RC frame members subjected to column removal scenario (CRS). The specimens were tested under quasi-static loading. Mitigation of progressive collapse has become a primary concern of engineers in recent years. A new mitigation scheme is proposed in this study to increase the resistance of RC beams against progressive collapse using modified detailing of reinforcement. The effect of the proposed scheme on the structural behaviour of sub-assemblages is investigated through testing some of the specimens with modified detailing. The test results showed that the proposed scheme was able and efficient to increase progressive collapse capacity. A finite element (FE) model was developed using the software package ANSYS in order to numerically simulate the structural behaviour of RC beam-column sub-assemblages under CRS. A macro-model based approach was used in the analysis using beam elements and a series of non-linear springs to capture the real behaviour of structural members associated with the redistribution of loads under CRS. Numerical results were compared with those obtained from the experimental program, and showed a good agreement. An analytical model was developed to predict the structural behaviour of RC structures under CRS. The development of the model equations was based on the concepts of equilibrium, compatibility, and material properties. Steel bar fracture and the reduction in the effective beam depth due to concrete crushing were included in the model. The model was validated by comparing the results with the experimental results. The comparison shows that the model was able to capture the structural behaviour of RC beams under CRS. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of different factors on the progressive collapse capacity...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} century, {{the design for}} shear in {{reinforced}} concrete beams has been uncertain. The reason for this uncertainty {{is the lack of}} clear understanding of the true nature of <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> mechanism. Researchers around the world have developed several shear design procedure as a remedy to this uncertainty. Most of them are empirical and some are rational which use various mathematical representations of <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> mechanism. Almost all of these mathematical models are complicated and accuracy of is rather low compared to empirical methods. With the advancement of concrete technology and introduction of new methods, the improvement of accuracy of shear design methods is rather unmatchable when compared with flexural design. However, some of the new shear design methods were adopted by codes of practice and the design formulae were modified by introducing various empirical factors based on test. So the shear design has now become very much empirical. Some of the developed rational methods give good representation of the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> mechanism of beams. The method proposed here with the objective of developing a rational yet simple method, also assumes the <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> mechanism of a beam as a truss. The tension <b>carrying</b> <b>member</b> represents the stirrups and the concrete portion is represented by compression member. For this proposed method, the compression <b>carrying</b> concrete <b>member</b> is idealized as a cylindrical element applied with axial compression. The behavior of this idealized cylinder is modeled by using mathematical techniques like Isotropic and Anisotropic analysis. This developed method is compared with several key codes of practice using available test data for accuracy.

According to the comparison, it is clear that this method is only second to Japanese code of practice...|$|R

These methods, which can be used in conjunction with the 2005 NBCC, were {{based on the results of}} shear wall tests carried out using lateral loads alone. The research program was extended to determine the influence of gravity loads on the lateral performance of the shear wall. An initial series of stud column tests was completed to determine an appropriate predication method for the axial capacity of the principal vertical <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members.</b> Recommendations for appropriate effective length factors and buckling lengths were derived from the results of 40 tests. A subsequent series of five single-storey shear wall configurations were designed using capacity based methods. These shear walls were tested under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading, where two of three shear walls were also subjected to a constant gravity load. In total, 32 steel frame/wood panel shear walls composed of 1. 09 [...] 1. 37 mm thick steel studs sheathed with DFP, CSP or OSB panels were tested and analyzed. The equivalent energy elastic-plastic analysis approach was used to determine design values for stiffness, strength, ductility and overstrength. The data from this most recent series of tests indicates that the additional gravity loads do not have a detrimental influence on the lateral behaviour of a steel frame/wood panel shear wall if the chord studs are designed to carry the combined lateral and gravity forces following a capacity based approach. A resistance factor of 0. 7 was found to be in agreement with previous tests that did not include gravity loads. The calculated seismic force modification factors also agreed with the previous test results, which suggest that Rd = 2. 5 and Ro = 1. 7...|$|E

The first {{type of material}} studied is a discontinuously reinforced composite material. This type of material has a microstructure that consists of stiff,brittle particles surrounded by a compliant matrix.

The model {{is based on the}} dilute approximation which models the composite material as sn inclusion of the finite size embedded in an infinite material. The matrix material is assumed to obey the J 2 flow theory with isotropic hardening. The finite element method is utilized to solve the nonlinear boundary value problem. Results are presented which illustrate the effect of reinforcement shape on the evolution of the local matrix state variables. A volume averaging scheme is then employed to obtain dilute estimates for the macroscopic response. Results showing the effect of reinforcement shape and volume fraction on the predicted stress-strain response of the composite are presented. It is shown that the reinforcement shape can {{have a significant effect on}} the effective properties of the composite material. The second type of material studied is a material which has a granular and/or fiberous microstructure. The microstructures of these types of materials are often modeled by a latticelike arrangement of <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members.</b> Within the framework of the finite element method, a general technique is presented to compute the effective properties of materials which are modeled by these latticelike microstructures. The equivalency between the continuum and microstructural stiffness matrices is utilized to produce an over-determined system of equations which is solved using the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse procedure. Although the resulting solution is not exact, it is unique in the least squares sense. The effective properties are reported in the form of a continuum constitutive matrix which approximates the behavior of the latticelike microstructure. Several specific examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the method...|$|E
40|$|For {{buildings}} {{which are}} stabilized by core or shear walls, the vertical members are generally subjected to compressive normal forces N and certain imposed angles of rotation θ. Similar {{in this respect}} are non slender bridge piers. These rotations originate from, on one hand, the length variations of the horizontal elements (beams, slabs) due to shrinkage, temperature and prestressing, while {{on the other hand}} the bending of these elements due to the vertical loading. Thus, in this case, it is a problem of imposed deformations. However, the usual methods of calculation do not take this fact into account and bring the computation back to a question of forces. In this case, the design is mostly based on the resistance of individual sections, with the use of moment-axial load interaction diagrams MR-NR. In this thesis, a different method is proposed which takes account of the problem of imposed deformations, which concerns equally well the real behaviour of the structure. This proposal is limited to the cases where the slenderness ratio λcr is {{less than or equal to}} 50 (λcr ≤ 50). The analysis of a column is carried out considering the vertical load N and the imposed end rotations θ, due to the interaction of horizontal <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>members.</b> This method allows one to create structures with a greater performance, thanks to the larger distance between expansion joints and to a reduction in the overall dimensions of the columns. This equally has the consequence that the columns are almost always able to be fixed ended by the horizontal members, thus permitting a reduction in their slenderness λcr and which eliminates the costs of the hinge devices. However, it is mostly necessary to resort to high percentages of reinforcement to transmit the elevated vertical loads. This concept of the association of N and 0 is applied to both the examination of the ultimate limit state (loading capacity and deformability) and to serviceability (aptitude of service). The first verification consists of assuring that the column possesses the required deformability to permit the imposed rotations, while transferring the normal force, with the required security. It is possible to obtain this by using adequate transverse reinforcement at the fixed ends of the column, in such a fashion that plastic hinges would be able to form there. The first part of this work concentrates on the development of a method which allows the determination of the characteristics of such a transverse reinforcement (shape and configuration, spacing and diameter of stirrups), as well as an investigation of the numerous parameters influencing the behaviour of columns at the ultimate limit state. In the second part, an explanation is given on how to control the behaviour of a column, when it is subjected to service loading and imposed rotations, in order to verify its serviceability. This explanation takes into account the nature of the rotations, caused by the variations in temperature or by long term phenomena, such as shrinkage and creep. Its application is easy as it is given in the form of charts. Finally, a method for the practical cases is proposed to the designer. It contains the notes and charts to design and verify reinforced concrete columns with different levels of reinforcement...|$|E

40|$|The {{encounter}} with the sailing yacht concept Exo raised the question whether {{it is possible to}} develop a hull structure inspired by nature that is strong enough to cope with the global loads of a 46 m sailing yacht. The concept was developed by Claydon Reeves and Dykstra Naval Architects with the main objective that views below deck match those above by integrating huge glass windows into the hull structure. This is most challenging, as these windows are supposed to be located in an area of the sailing yacht which experiences the highest global loads. In order to answer this question, the present master thesis project was initiated in a cooperation with Dykstra Naval Architects in Amsterdam and the Bremerhaven based Alfred Wegner Institute. In the framework of this master thesis the hull structure of the Exo concept was further developed and evaluated. To enable the integration of huge glass windows and removing major loadings from the glazed areas an unconventional truss structure design was requested with the ability to carry these major global loads acting on the yacht hull. Source of inspiration to achieve this was the beauty and functionality of nature’s lightweight designs. Therefore, topology optimizations were implemented to reveal the most advantageous load paths in the yacht hull, ensuring the development of an interwoven truss structure network which {{is directly related to the}} forces acting on the yacht. The evaluation of the concept shows that the developed hull structure with <b>load</b> <b>carrying</b> truss <b>members</b> resembling organic forms is able to cope with the global loads acting on the 46 m sailing yacht Exo. Furthermore, this master thesis presents a feasible new approach to integrate huge glass windows into a yacht structure...|$|R
