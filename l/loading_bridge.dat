25|$|The Westport Country Playhouse has a {{counterweight}} fly system currently employing 22 battens, {{with space}} for future installations. The height {{from the stage}} to the grid is 40 feet (12.19m), with an effective fly range from 3 feet 10inches (1.17m) to 38 feet (11.58m). Each arbor is 6 feet tall with a capacity for 1200 pounds (544kg). The locking rail is on the stage right wall, and the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> is 32 feet 3inches (9.83m) above the stage floor.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011 {{work was}} {{completed}} on a $6.2 million remodeling of the 58-year-old terminal building. The City of Sioux City received {{federal and state}} funds that picked up 78 percent of the $6.2 million cost to renovate the terminal building. The city received a Federal Aviation Administration grant for the new passenger <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> plus $3.97 million in federal stimulus funds and a state Airport Vertical Infrastructure grant. The city's share was $1.4 million, which was about {{twice as much as}} originally estimated caused construction problems due to termite and drainage damage.|$|E
25|$|To {{prepare for}} the arrival of the Airbus A380, the airport put into place {{modifications}} works costing S$60million, which it has planned for since the late 1990s. These included the building of 19 gates capable of handling the large aircraft, eight of which are in Terminal 3. Baggage claim carousels, runways, and taxiways were expanded, and two new freighter aircraft stands and two remote aircraft parking stands built. Two aircraft taxiway bridges spanning Airport Boulevard leading to the terminals also had shields installed on either side to shield the road from the jet blast. On 11 November 2005, the airport became the first outside Europe to receive the A380 for airport compatibility verification tests, and was the first in the world to have an operational triple-passenger <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> fit for trials.|$|E

50|$|The cab of the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> {{is raised}} and lowered to dock with {{aircraft}} of differing sill heights. The {{height of the}} cab is matched to {{the height of the}} aircraft door sill height. This often results in a slope {{along the length of the}} <b>loading</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Specific to a {{stage house}} using a {{counterweight}} system, the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> or loading gallery, is a catwalk vertically positioned below the headlock beam, {{and above the}} fly gallery. The <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> is used to add or remove counterweights from arbors. The floor of the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> is also typically used as a storage area for uncommitted counterweights that are available for loading onto counterweight arbors. Stage houses with especially tall fly towers, or double-purchase systems, may have two loading bridges, one stacked over the other to facilitate the loading of relatively tall arbors.|$|E

50|$|In addition, the British Airports Authority {{had just}} {{completed}} {{the first phase of}} a major refurbishment and extension of BCal's Gatwick base. The centrepiece of this revamp was a completely refurbished centre pier featuring 11 telescopic, widebody-compatible <b>loading</b> <b>bridges.</b> These were the first <b>loading</b> <b>bridges</b> to be installed at Gatwick, which was a single-terminal airport at the time. For {{the first time in its}} history, BCal also gained a dedicated check-in area for all its flights.|$|R
50|$|<b>Loading</b> <b>bridges</b> {{restrict}} aircraft parking to spots immediately {{adjacent to}} the terminal. Thus, airports use mobile staircases to facilitate disembarking at hardstands (remote parking positions).|$|R
50|$|In Wiek the {{construction}} of a <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> was started before the First World War for the shipping from Kreide. The bridge is still there today, albeit in a state of decay.|$|E
50|$|By using a {{retractable}} tunnel design, loading bridges may retract {{and extend}} varying lengths. Some airports use fixed walkways to effectively extend {{the reach of}} a <b>loading</b> <b>bridge.</b> The fixed walkway extends out from the terminal building and connects to the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> rotunda. Occasionally, fixed bridges lead to multiple loading bridges. There are some jetways (such as several older bridges on the north terminal at Edmonton International Airport) that sit directly on the ground, as opposed to supports. These jetways are often used by small airlines or airplanes that are sometimes too low for conventional jetways (such as the Dash 8 and CRJ).|$|E
50|$|Loading bridges {{may pose}} hazards to {{aircraft}} if handled improperly. If {{the bridge is}} not retracted fully before departure, it may contact protruding parts of the taxiing aircraft (e.g., a pitot tube), requiring repair and delays. Furthermore, during cold weather, the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> may become frozen to the aircraft. In this case, when the jet bridge retracts, it could damage the aircraft if that area has not been properly de-iced.|$|E
50|$|Short/low <b>load</b> <b>bridges</b> can be {{constructed}} using just top deck components. Bracing with the additional lower deck dramatically strengthens the <b>bridge</b> allowing heavier <b>loads</b> and longer spans. Single spans can reach 48 metres.|$|R
25|$|The airport {{recently}} completed a US$22 million renovation, including, among other things, larger gates, new plumbing, and building jetway <b>loading</b> <b>bridges</b> as previous boarding and deplaning required all passengers to walk across the tarmac to their gates.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{electronic}} amplifiers can {{be connected}} {{such that they}} drive a single floating <b>load</b> (<b>bridge)</b> or a single common load (parallel), {{to increase the amount}} of power available in different situations. This is commonly encountered in audio applications.|$|R

50|$|The {{airport site}} was {{developed}} in 1928-30. A terminal building was built in 1940. Scheduled airline service was initially provided by Moose Jaw-based Prairie Airways (in 1938) and then Trans-Canada Air Lines (in 1939). A new terminal building was erected in 1960. Major renovations to this terminal building were conducted in 1983-86. A $24-million expansion started in January 2004, increasing its capacity to 1.2 million passengers per year. The first stage of the expansion included {{the expansion of the}} terminal and includes a larger post-security holding room, another passenger <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> an expansion to the international arrivals area and more baggage carousels. The first phase was completed in August 2005.|$|E
50|$|The {{passenger}} terminal {{is one of}} three terminals in South Dakota that boasts a moving jet bridge, the other two being Sioux Falls Regional Airport and Rapid City Regional Airport. The <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> allows passengers to board the aircraft from directly inside the terminal and right onto the aircraft, without having to walk outside, which is a key deciding factor for travelers who choose to fly out of the airport. As of March 2015, Delta Connection is the only commercial airline currently operating out of Aberdeen Regional Airport, providing jet only service on daily flights to Minneapolis/St. Paul on their Canadair Regional Jet 200.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of loads that {{structure}} engineering must encounter in the design. First type of load is called Dead loads that consist of the weights of the various structural members and the weights of any objects that are permanently attached to the structure. For example, columns, beams, girders, the floor slab, roofing, walls, windows, plumbing, electrical fixtures, and other miscellaneous attachments. Second type of load is Live Loads which vary in their magnitude and location. There are many different types of live loads like building <b>loads,</b> highway <b>bridge</b> <b>Loads,</b> railroad <b>bridge</b> <b>Loads,</b> impact loads, wind loads, snow loads, earthquake loads, and other natural loads.|$|R

There were 222 build most of them with a <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> while some were made with a fixed structure as a van. The vehicles are right-hand driven. A winch was optional. The Saurer CM2 was also built by Berna and FBW (Franz Brozincevic Wetzikon) under their own names (FBW AX / Berna 2). The Saurer CM 2 {{formed the basis for}} other vehicles with more powerful engine and a larger payload capacity like Saurer 4CM 5t, Saurer 4CM driving school cars, Saurer Woodcarrier 4CM, 5CM 6t Saurer trucks and a mobile command center of the flab.One is on display at the Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full.|$|E

The locking rail is on the stage right wall, and the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge</b> is 32 feet 3 inches (9.83m) above the stage floor. Although the fly system and grid are designed for loads to be hung parallel to the proscenium, smaller loads can be hung perpendicular using cables independent of the actual arbor system. These have to be flown in and out manually from the grid, so perpendicularly hung loads are generally stationary during performances.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fly gallery}} is a catwalk {{running from the}} {{proscenium}} wall to upstage wall to which a pinrail and/or locking rail may be mounted used by the fly crew to operate the fly system. The fly gallery elevation is typically at about proscenium height, providing {{a good view of}} the stage and fly loft. Fly galleries may be provided stage left and right, or at just one side. Where provided at both sides of the stage they may be connected by a cross-over catwalk at the upstage wall. It is possible to load arbors (add or remove counterweights) at the fly gallery, but standard practice is to load arbors at the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge.</b> (A vertical cinematic montage from the deck to the fly gallery is a striking feature of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.) ...|$|E

50|$|Metal {{counterweights}} are lead, cast iron, or flame-cut steel. Flame cut steel bricks {{are most}} common. In any particular fly system all counterweights typically share a common, standardized footprint {{that matches the}} system's arbors, which in turn are sized to conform to line set spacing. Counterweight systems are most often designed to use either 4 or 6 in wide weights. Weights vary in thickness, typically in half-inch increments ranging from 1/2 to 2 in, with each thickness corresponding to a different mass. 1 in thick weights are most common. Counterweights are sometimes also known as bricks or simply steel. Often a rigging worker {{will be asked to}} load a number of inches of steel, which correlates to a specific mass. Weights are usually loaded from the <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> but can also be loaded from the fly gallery or stage deck in some circumstances.|$|E
50|$|A new {{terminal}} had been needed for many years, {{as the old}} terminal building was plagued {{by a number of}} problems, primarily space constraints. Construction on the {{new terminal}} began in late Spring, 2011. Denver-based Coover-Clark & Associates, Inc. designed the building and Kadrmas Lee & Jackson's Rapid City office handled the construction administration. A jet bridge was to be installed at the terminal, but airport officials decided to wait until a scheduled commercial airline could use the jet bridge, as Great Lakes Airlines aircraft are not jet bridge capable. As noted above, Pierre has not had scheduled passenger jet service operated with mainline aircraft in 30 years; however, a jet bridge could be used with the current generation of regional jet aircraft. In the past three years, the airport has pursued several airlines that are boarding bridge capable, and the new airport terminal has the space set aside for a <b>loading</b> <b>bridge,</b> so it would require very little effort to install one. The airport hopes to have a jet bridge by 2018. The new terminal was completed in September, 2012.|$|E
50|$|The airline {{terminal}} {{has been}} expanded and modified several times since 1955.
