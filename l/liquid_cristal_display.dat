Therefore, by combining polymer and dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) has emerged as a new composite material for switchable diffractive optical elements (DOEs). Parallel to the material advances some techniques have been proposed to record very low spatial frequencies DOE’s. Different researchers have reported proposes to record DOE like fork gratings, photonics structures, lenses, sinusoidal, blazed or fork gratings. In this work we have studied the behavior of a PDLC material to record DOE’s with different spatial periods: from 1 μm, using holographic technique, to more than 200 μm, <b>Liquid</b> <b>Cristal</b> on Silicon (LCoS) display working in mostly amplitude mode as a master. Due to the improvement in the spatial light modulation technology and the pixel miniaturization, this technique permits us store gratings with spatial frequencies until few microns. Additionally, this technology permits us an accurate and dynamic control of the phase and the amplitude of the recording beam. In particular, for our case, to generate the blazed gratings, we use an LCoS-Pluto provided by Holoeye with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 (HDTV) pixels and a pixel size of 7. 7 x 7. 7 m 2.

40|$|The article {{introduces}} the “Resource Efficiency Assessment of Products” (REAPro) method {{to assess and}} improve the resource efficiency of Energy Using Products, with a special focus to their end-of-life. The method allows to identify product's hot spots relevant for the following criteria: reusability/recyclability/recoverability (in mass {{and in terms of}} environmental impacts); recycled content (in mass and in terms of environmental impacts); use of hazardous substances. The method is structured into five steps: characterization of the product; assessment against the selected criteria; identification of product's hot spots; identification of improvement measures (at the product level); assessment of policy measures for resource efficiency (at the ‘product group’ level). The method includes the calculation of a comprehensive set of lifecycle based indices, including some original indices, as the “Reusability/Recyclability/Recoverability benefits rates” and the “Recycled content benefit rate”. The method is applied to a case-study <b>Liquid</b> <b>Cristal</b> <b>Display</b> (LCD) television. Some exemplary measures to improve resource efficiency of television are discussed as: the improvement of products recyclability through the setting of thresholds of the time for dismantling; the setting of a minimum recycled content of large plastic parts; the declaration of the content of indium in the displays. Potential environmental benefits associated to these measures have been estimated.

The LCD panel is connected to the computer via parallel port. The function of LCD panel is to display the information that can be gathered by using software that have been develop called ‘LCD Panel Utilities’ to communicate with the LCD. The application has been developed by using Pascal programming language. The development process follows the six phases in systematic design are preliminary study, gathering and analyzing requirements, LCD front panel design, software design and coding, testing and maintenance. At the end of the development, the prototype of the application is come out and readily to be tested. For future researcher, some extra features can be added at an application. Some features such as the local system information can be added into the application. Future researcher also can make this application at another platform operating system such as Linux and MacOs.
