40|$|Fluctuations in the {{concentrations}} of stratospheric trace gases are often correlated over a large range {{of space and time}} scales, an observation frequently used to infer the existence of various chemical processes. Three-dimensional models provide a tool to examine the causes and variations of trace gas relationships, because they can realistically simulate the interplay between stratospheric photochemistry and meteorology. Thus such models can aid the interpretation of observed trace gas relationships. We use the general circulation model of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies to simulate the evolution and distribution of N 2 O, CO 2, and O 3  over a year. In the modeled lower stratosphere the constituents N 2 O and CO 2  have well-correlated spatial variations, but the slope of the regression line depends on both the season and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> This departure from a universal form is due both to the annual cycle in tropospheric CO 2  and to transport of air from the upper stratosphere photochemically depleted in N 2 O. Due to the short photochemical lifetime of tropical O 3, its relationship with N 2 O is still more varied. In particular, the slope of the O 3 −N 2 O regression line changes significantly from middle to high latitudes, behavior relevant to the use of N 2 O for estimating the rate of polar winter O 3  depletion. In general, a tight correlation between two trace gases such as N 2 O and O 3  is often observed, but this datum cannot be used to infer a similar universal relationship because a different <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> may change the slope and the scatter about it...|$|R

Detailed description of autooscillating phenomena is obtained in interphase of conductor-electrolyte in permanent magnetic field. It is a new example of nonlinear self-organization in system that is dissimilar to thermodynamic equilibrium. It is shown that dependence of mass of etched steel on time has quasi-periodic character that in particular depends on complex configuration of electrolyte vortexes which are formed in the etch processes {{as well as on}} the geometry <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> arrangement. The dependences of oscillating characteristics are obtained on value of external permanent magnetic field, electrolyte concentration, temperature of corrosion. The influence <b>of</b> the <b>sample</b> prehistory on oscillating characteristics is also studied, in particular, of such factors as preliminary annealing and demagnetizing. The influence of magnetic field orientation with respect to dedicated <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> is also researched. Characteristic statistical parameters of autooscillating process of steel plate etching are calculated, in particular, average speed of etch, mean square speed of etch, maximum and minimum speeds of etch, as well as average period of autooscillating process at various electrolyte concentrations. Scientific novelty of the results of research is based on the idea to involve to research the such parameters of influence on reaction as mutual bracing characteristic <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sample</b> and external magnetic field as well as combination of this influence with one of Earth gravitation.
