5000|$|... vi is a modal editor: it {{operates}} in either <b>insert</b> <b>mode</b> (where typed text {{becomes part of}} the document) or normal mode (where keystrokes are interpreted as commands that control the edit session).

A perceived advantage of vi's separation of text entry and command modes is that both text editing and command operations can be performed without requiring the removal of the user's hands from the home row. As non-modal editors usually have to reserve all keys with letters and symbols for the printing of characters, any special commands for actions other than adding text to the buffer must be assigned to keys that do not produce characters, such as function keys, or combinations of modifier keys such as , and [...] with regular keys. Vi has the property that most ordinary keys are connected to some kind of command for positioning, altering text, searching and so forth, either singly or in key combinations.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} to generate quantitative genetic variation by insertional mutagenesis in a vertebrate, lines of mice in which many provirus vector inserts segregated at a low initial frequency on an inbred background (<b>insert</b> <b>lines)</b> were subjected to divergent artificial selection on body weight at 6 weeks and responses and heritability estimates compared to control <b>lines</b> lacking <b>inserts.</b> Heritability estimates were more than 1. 5 times greater in the <b>insert</b> <b>lines</b> than in the controls, but because the phenotypic variance was substantially higher in the <b>insert</b> <b>lines</b> the genetic variance was about 3 times greater. Realized heritability estimates tended to be lower than heritabilities estimated by an animal model which utilizes information in covariances between all relatives in the data set. A surprisingly large response to selection occurred in the inbred control <b>line.</b> <b>Insert</b> <b>lines</b> were about 20 % less fertile than controls. Division of the selection lines into inbred sublines in the later generations of the experiment revealed substantially greater variation among sublines of the <b>insert</b> <b>lines</b> than among the controls.

40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} scheduling is {{not suitable}} for manufacture in most case, because it cannot fully utilize {{the experience of the}} operator and effectively response the disturbance events from the production progress. In order to solve these problems the manual scheduling technology using the pattern of human-computer collaborative is proposed. The graphical scheduling block has been discrete through applying the kernel methods including the combination of multi-layer displaying of Gantt-Chart, the model of machine calendar, mouse selected mechanism and auxiliary function for manual scheduling. By building multi-layer normative modular manual scheduling operations, we divide the manual scheduling operation into three steps: the selection of manual scheduling process, the selection of the inserting base, and the <b>inserting</b> <b>mode.</b> At the same time constrains transferring mode provoked by the three kinds of <b>inserting</b> <b>mode</b> is analyzed. By controlling constrains in the progress of the manual adjustment makes sure that the manual scheduling result meets the demand of job shop production. Finally, the algorithms in this paper are validated by the software developed with C++...|$|R
