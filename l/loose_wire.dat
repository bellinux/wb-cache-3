50|$|In electromagnetics, the {{catapult}} {{effect is}} a phenomenon occurring when a current is passed through two wires connected by a <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> in a magnetic field. The <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> is then catapulted horizontally away from the magnetic field. This occurs due to the magnetic forces acting in the wires and in the magnetic field itself.|$|E

50|$|Music on hold {{was created}} by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy {{discovered}} {{a problem with the}} phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> and could be heard when calls were put on hold. Levy patented his work in 1966. While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.|$|E

5000|$|The Clapham Junction rail {{crash of}} 1988 was caused {{in part by}} the lack of double {{switching}} (known as [...] "double cutting" [...] in the British railway industry). The signal relay in question was switched only on the hot side, while the return current came back on an unswitched wire. A <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> bypassed the contacts by which the train detection relays switched the signal, allowing the signal to show green when in fact there was a stationary train ahead. 35 people were killed in the resultant collision.|$|E

50|$|While the New End {{was still}} {{running as a}} theatre, it was an open joke and a superstition amongst both actors and office staff that the {{backstage}} passages (including a now-sealed tunnel {{into the rest of}} the old hospital) were haunted. The lights often flickered, and the building was unusually noisy, even for one of its age. Although no one took this too seriously—it was sometimes said that any lingering spirits from the mortuary hung around to appreciate the artistic endeavours—and most 'unexplained' activity could be linked to <b>loose</b> <b>wiring</b> and expanding floorboards, the stories endured and were solemnly passed onto incoming staff during induction into the company.|$|R
50|$|The {{left-hand}} rule {{helps to}} explain why the <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> moves as it does in the catapult effect. The left hand rule naturally takes its name from the left hand anemyl the thumb and the next two fingers. If you arrange the fingers in a three-dimensional shape so the first finger and thumb are perpendicular to one another and the second finger is perpendicular to the first aiming downwards then this is the way magnetic fields with addition of flowing current will act. The thumb represents the direction of motion. The first finger represents the direction of the magnetic field while the second finger represents the direction of the current. Therefore, as long as you know the direction of one of these three variables {{you will be able to}} predict the other two using the left hand rule. This is used in electric motors.|$|E

He also keeps a blog dedicated for technology issues. In 2012, he rejoined Thomson Reuters as Chief Technology Correspondent for Asia.|$|E
5000|$|A Hampshire gate {{occupies}} a gateway in a fence {{similar to that}} used for a conventional gate. However, instead of a rigid gate, a short section of <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> fence fits into the gap [...] - [...] this may consist of wire netting or barbed wire, and it usually matches the adjacent fence. One end of the wire is attached permanently to the main fence, and two or more short posts or battens keep it upright and flat [...] - [...] one of these is at the loose end. When the [...] "gate" [...] is closed, this end post fits into a loop of wire {{at the base of the}} fixed fence, and the top is then pulled tight to tension it. The top of the post may be held by another loop of wire, or additional tension may be provided by a length of chain looped around the post and hooked onto a nail. Proprietary closures are also available which give still greater tension, usually by means of an over-centre mechanism (see photo below).|$|E

50|$|Mariner 2 was {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 12 at 06:53:14 UTC on August 27, 1962 by a two-stage Atlas-Agena rocket.The two-stage Atlas-Agena rocket carrying Mariner 1 had veered off-course during its launch on July 22, 1962 {{due to a}} defective signal from the Atlas and a bug in the program equations of the ground-based guidance computer, and subsequently the spacecraft was destroyed by the Range Safety Officer. Two days after that launch, the backup probe and booster (Atlas vehicle 179D) were rolled out to LC-12. Mariner 2 nearly met the same fate as its predecessor {{when one of the}} Atlas's verniers moved to maximum stop shortly before BECO. This caused a rapid roll of the launch vehicle that quickly approached one revolution per second and also made it impossible for ground guidance to lock onto the Atlas and issue a counteracting command. With the structural integrity of the booster in jeopardy, the Range Safety officer prepared to issue the destruct command, but after a few tense moments, the rolling motion stopped and the launch proceeded uneventfully. The incident was traced to a <b>loose</b> <b>wire</b> in the Atlas programmer which was pushed back into place by the centrifugal force of the roll, which also by fortunate coincidence left the Atlas only a few degrees off from where it started and within the range of the Agena's horizontal sensor.|$|E

Lucille also escapes and the police tails her. Meanwhile, Hannah continues to beg Alex for mercy and release her and Rebecca. Alex continues to blame Hannah for all of her misfortunes. The police arrive at their hideout and Lucille and Alex's henchman escape leaving Alex to fight the battle alone. Alex holds Rebecca and Hannah as hostage for an exchange for her son. Sebastian and Kara refuse to hand over the baby. Just then Sara arrives with her child. Unbeknownst to Alex that the child she is fighting is no other than a doll. The two exchange and Sara throws the doll which causes Alex to get electrocuted because of a <b>loose</b> <b>wire.</b> Later, Rebecca's illness starts getting worse and they race against time in order to save Rebecca.

50|$|A {{major fire}} {{accident}} {{took place on}} 8 February 1990, in the Premier Studios of Mysore where the drama was being shot.

50|$|Commonly used in automobiles, {{as well as}} {{construction}} machinery, cable harnesses provide {{several advantages}} over <b>loose</b> <b>wires</b> and cables. For example, many aircraft, automobiles and spacecraft contain many masses of wires which would stretch over several kilometres if fully extended. By binding the many wires and cables into a cable harness, the wires and cables can be better secured against the adverse effects of vibrations, abrasions, and moisture. By constricting the wires into a non-flexing bundle, usage of space is optimized, {{and the risk of}} a short is decreased. Since the installer has only one harness to install (as opposed to multiple wires), installation time is decreased and the process can be easily standardized. Binding the wires into a flame-retardant sleeve also lowers the risk of electrical fires.|$|R
50|$|A {{coaxial line}} (coax) has a central signal {{conductor}} {{surrounded by a}} cylindrical shielding conductor. The shield conductor is normally grounded. The coaxial format was developed during World War II for use in radar. It was originally constructed from rigid copper pipes, but the usual form today is a flexible cable with a braided screen. The advantages of coax are a theoretically perfect electrostatic screen and highly predictable transmission parameters. The latter {{is a result of}} the fixed geometry of the format which leads to a precision not found with <b>loose</b> <b>wires.</b> Open wire systems are also affected by nearby objects altering the field pattern around the conductor. Coax does not suffer from this since the field is entirely contained within the cable due to the surrounding screen.|$|R

In cases where there is either not enough time to make the repair, or if the equipment is damaged beyond repair, the guitar tech is often responsible for finding a replacement instrument or part, either by purchasing or renting it from a local music store or by borrowing it from another band. While another member of the road crew may be dispatched to pick up the item(s), the guitar tech usually writes down which models or brands are acceptable replacements.|$|R
