500|$|The {{cause of}} Edward VI's {{death is not}} certain. As with many royal deaths in the 16th century, rumours of {{poisoning}} abounded, but no evidence {{has been found to}} support these. [...] The Duke of Northumberland, whose unpopularity was underlined by the events that followed Edward's death, was widely believed to have ordered the imagined poisoning. [...] Another theory held that Edward had been poisoned by Catholics seeking to bring Mary to the throne. The surgeon who opened Edward's chest after his death found that [...] "the disease whereof his majesty died was the disease of the lungs". [...] The Venetian ambassador reported that Edward had died of consumption—in other words, tuberculosis—a diagnosis accepted by many historians. Skidmore believes that Edward contracted tuberculosis after a bout of measles and smallpox in 1552 that suppressed his natural immunity to the disease. [...] Loach suggests instead that his symptoms were typical of acute bronchopneumonia, leading to a [...] "suppurating pulmonary infection" [...] or <b>lung</b> <b>abscess,</b> septicaemia, and kidney failure.|$|E
