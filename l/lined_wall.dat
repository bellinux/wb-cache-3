Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of <b>wall</b> <b>lining</b> material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, calcium silicate board lining is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF <b>walls</b> <b>lined</b> with calcium silicate boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional gypsum plasterboard <b>lined</b> LSF <b>walls.</b> This paper presents {{the details of this}} experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate board lining are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF <b>wall</b> <b>lined</b> with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide board <b>lined</b> LSF <b>walls.</b> The results showed that the fire performance of calcium silicate board <b>lined</b> <b>walls</b> was similar to that of conventional gypsum plasterboard <b>lined</b> <b>walls,</b> but was superior to that of magnesium oxide board <b>lined</b> <b>walls.</b> The failure criterion of these calcium silicate board <b>lined</b> <b>walls</b> was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAcoustic lining {{is widely}} used to reduce sound. However, for {{specific}} liners and under particular flow conditions, some experiments have shown that a convective hydrodynamic instability may grow on the liner {{and is likely to}} lead to a sound amplification. In this paper, such a phenomenon is studied through a direct optimal growth analysis of the linearized Euler equations in a two-dimensional flow duct with the bottom wall which is partly lined. A Discontinuous Galerkin scheme is used for spatial discretization, which proved to be quite efficient in handling the acoustic impedance discontinuity at the interface between the lined and hard wall. The optimal perturbation exhibits a spatial amplification similar to the one predicted by a local stability analysis. Moreoever, we can observe a mechanism of conversion of the hydrodynamic surface mode, which appears above the <b>lined</b> <b>wall,</b> into a high amplitude acoustic wave which travels downstream of the liner...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} mode-matching techniques to model sound propagation in lined ducts with flow.

But with a base flow the behaviour of the solution at the transition between, say, a hard wall and a <b>lined</b> <b>wall</b> is not well understood. For this reason different assumptions can {{be made on the}} behaviour of the acoustic field and these lead to different models. This paper presents a comparison of different models and illustrates that significant differences can be observed. A modified mode-matching scheme based on conservation of mass and momentum is proposed. The conservation of sound power is investigated for different matching conditions. Finally, the link between the solutions obtained with mode-matching methods and finite element methods is discussed, and the present analysis can shed some light on the underlying assumptions used in finite element model...|$|E

Acoustic wall backings usually involve damped {{lightweight}} plates whose {{critical frequency}} locates at high frequencies (≥ 2000 Hz). Additional decoupling {{is achieved by}} using mineral wool in the cavity. Theories of Heckl, Sharp, and other authors explain sufficiently well acoustical performances of such linings, within the Heckl’s frequency interval (f 0 – fc). They are "proper acoustic materials" as its performances are nearly independent of the <b>lined</b> <b>wall.</b> In Mediterranean countries, Spain noteworthy, where ceramic products are largely used, {{there is a big}} interest on developing ceramic plates as efficient acoustic wall linings. This paper presents a phenomenological behaviour of ceramic wall linings showing a clear correlation between acoustic properties and constitutions plus mounting conditions. It is shown that important values of improvement of sound reduction index, ΔR(f), can be got, even outside the Heckl’s frequency interval. Their nearness with optimum profiles regarding reference curves of low an medium critical frequency, is used to explain its high single number rating scores, 20 dB and more.

40|$|An {{explicit}} Wiener-Hopf {{solution is}} derived {{to describe the}} scattering of duct modes at a hard-soft wall impedance transition in a circular duct with uniform mean flow.

A minimum edge condition at x = 0 requires a continuous wall streamline r = 1 + h(x, t), no more singular than h = O(x 1 / 2) for x ¿ 0. A mode, incident from x 2 ̆ 6 lt; 0, scatters at x = 0 {{into a series of}} reflected modes and a series of transmitted modes. Of particular interest is the role of a possible instability along the <b>lined</b> <b>wall</b> in combination with the edge singularity. If one of the 2 ̆ 2 upstream 2 ̆ 2 running modes is to be interpreted as a downstream-running instability, we have an extra degree of freedom in the Wiener-Hopf analysis that can be resolved by application of some form of Kutta condition at x = 0, for example a more stringent edge condition where h = O(x 3 / 2) at the downstream side. The question of the instability requires an investigation of the modes in the complex frequency plane and therefore depends on the chosen impedance model, since Z = Z(¿) is essentially frequency dependent. The usual causality condition by Briggs and Bers appears to be not applicable here because it requires a temporal growth rate bounded for all real axial wave numbers. The alternative Crighton-Leppington criterion, however, is applicable and confirms that the suspected mode is usually unstable. In general, the effect of this Kutta condition is significant, but it is particularly large for the plane wave at low frequencies and should therefore be easily measurable. For ¿ ¿ 0, the modulus tends to |R 001 | ¿ (1 + M) /(1 - M) without and to 1 with Kutta condition, while the end correction tends to 8 without and to a finite value with Kutta condition.

This is exactly the same behaviour as found for reflection at a pipe exit with flow, irrespective if this is uniform or jet flow. Although the presence of the instability in the model is hardly a question anymore since it has been confirmed numerically, a proper mathematical causality analysis is still not totally watertight. Therefore, the limit of a vortex sheet, separating zero flow from mean flow, approaching the wall has been explored. Indeed, this confirms that the Helmholtz unstable mode of the free vortex sheet transforms into the suspected mode and remains unstable. As the lined-wall vortex-sheet model predicts unstable behaviour for which experimental evidence is at best rare and indirect, the question may be raised if this model is indeed a consistent simplification of reality, doing justice to the double limit of small perturbations and a thin boundary layer. Numerical time-domain methods suffer from this instability and {{it is very important to}} decide whether the instability is at least physically genuine. Experiments based on the present problem may provide a handle to resolve this stubborn question...|$|E
