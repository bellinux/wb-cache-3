25|$|The River Wansbeck Valley is {{narrow and}} steep {{and as a}} {{consequence}} has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable flow gauge located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of rain fall is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated {{as a result of the}} wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment <b>lag</b> <b>time</b> (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a <b>LAG</b> <b>time</b> of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by throughflow. This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.|$|E

Impacts {{of changes in}} atmospheric deposition in the United States have been documented using national and regional long-term environmental monitoring programs beginning several decades ago. Consequently, time series of weekly NADP atmospheric wet deposition and monthly EPA-Long Term Monitoring stream chemistry now exist {{for much of the}} Northeast which may provide insights into <b>lag</b> <b>times.</b> In this study of Appalachian forest basins, we estimated <b>lag</b> <b>times</b> for S, N and Cl by cross-correlating monthly data from four pairs of stream and deposition monitoring sites during the period from 1978 to 2012. A systems or impulse response function approach to cross-correlation was used to estimate <b>lag</b> <b>times</b> where the input deposition time series was pre-whitened using regression modeling and the stream response time series was filtered using the deposition regression model prior to cross-correlation. Cross-correlations for S were greatest at annual intervals over a relatively well-defined range of lags with the maximum correlations occurring at mean lags of 48 months. Chloride results were similar but more erratic with a mean lag of 57 months. Few high-correlation lags for N were indicated. Given the growing availability of atmospheric deposition and surface water chemistry monitoring data and our results for four Appalachian basins, further testing of cross-correlation as a method of estimating <b>lag</b> <b>times</b> on other basins appears justified...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are three}} main reasons {{commercial}} VIO data differs from {{data from the}} US government. The first is due to variation when data is reported by states to the US government. States are required to report registrations using form FHWA-561 once per calendar year or fiscal year. Forty six states end their fiscal year on June 30 and four end in March, August or September. This data {{is due to the}} FHWA by January 1 of the following year, creating a <b>lag</b> <b>time</b> of about six months and thereby not accounting for half a year of changes. Second, the government's definitions of vehicle classifications change over time. A footnote added to FHWA datafiles states, [...] "...Data for 2007-10 were calculated using a new methodology developed by FHWA. Data for these years are based on new categories and are not comparable to previous years". Third, the government can include vehicles not in use, or double-count vehicles that have been transferred across two states. According to the FHWA Office of Highway Policy Information], [...] "Although many States continue to register specific vehicle types on a calendar year basis, all States use some form of the [...] "staggered" [...] system to register motor vehicles. Registration practices for commercial vehicles differ greatly among States. The FHWA data include all vehicles which have been registered at any time throughout the calendar year. Data include vehicles which were retired during the year and vehicles that were registered in more than one State. In some States, {{it is also possible that}} contrary to the FHWA reporting instructions, vehicles which have been registered twice in the same State may be reported as two vehicles".

Our measured <b>lag</b> <b>times</b> range from less than one month to greater than four months and can be much larger than <b>lag</b> <b>times</b> estimated from short-term variations of these same activity indices during the emergence and decay of major active regions.

40|$|We find an {{application}} of the lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) in sub- 5 -min solar irradiance forecasting using a monitoring network. Lasso is a variable shrinkage and selection method for linear regression. In addition to the sum of squares error minimization, it considers the sum of ℓ 1 -norms of the regression coefficients as penalty. This bias–variance trade-off very often leads to better predictions. One second irradiance time series data are collected using a dense monitoring network in Oahu, Hawaii. As clouds propagate over the network, highly correlated <b>lagged</b> <b>time</b> series can be observed among station pairs. Lasso is used to automatically shrink and select the most appropriate <b>lagged</b> <b>time</b> series for regression. Since only <b>lagged</b> <b>time</b> series are used as predictors, the regression provides true out-of-sample forecasts. It is found that the proposed model outperforms univariate time series models and ordinary least squares regression significantly, especially when training data are few and predictors are many. Very short-term irradiance forecasting is useful in managing the variability within a central PV power plant. </p...|$|R
