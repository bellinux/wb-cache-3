40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that unilaterally enucleated observers demonstrate better luminance-defined form perception compared to monocularly <b>viewing</b> <b>controls,</b> and similar performance to <b>control</b> observers <b>viewing</b> binocularly (Vision Res. 37 (17) (1997) 2465). In Experiment 1 we asked whether the perception of form, where form is defined by other attributes than luminance, is also improved compared to monocularly <b>viewing</b> <b>controls.</b> We tested 16 enucleated observers and 25 <b>controls</b> <b>viewing</b> monocularly and binocularly for their ability to detect and recognize form from texture (texture-defined (TD) form) and form from motion (motion-defined (MD) form). There was no difference between the three groups for TD form perception. However, enucleated observers had significantly poorer MD form perception than did binocularly <b>viewing</b> <b>controls.</b> In Experiment 2 we asked whether poor performance on the perception of MD form might be due to a general reduction in motion processing abilities. To examine this possibility, we used a motion coherence task. We tested eight unilaterally enucleated and 14 monocularly and binocularly <b>viewing</b> <b>control</b> observers on a horizontal coherent motion discrimination task. The monocularly <b>viewing</b> <b>controls</b> showed no naso-temporal asymmetry in direction discrimination for coherent motion. In contrast, the enucleated group showed an asymmetry in direction discrimination where temporalward motion coherence thresholds were significantly higher than those for nasalward motion. These latter findings are discussed in terms of the absence of binocular competition during the development of motion processing path...|$|R

Here we measured contrast letter acuity in normally sighted binocular control subjects and compared these results to previously published results of eye enucleated subjects and monocular <b>viewing</b> <b>control</b> subjects. We found equivalent performance between enucleated subjects and binocular control subjects, suggesting that performance of enucleated subjects {{might be due to}} some form of neural summation...|$|R

As a result users must differentiate between workflows to choose the most suitable one for their task. We present Delta, an interactive workflow visualization and comparison tool that helps users identify the tradeoffs between workflows. We conducted an initial study to identify the set of attributes users attend to when comparing workflows, finding that they consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and {{the efficiency of the}} workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities: a highlevel, clustered view; an intermediate-level <b>list</b> <b>view</b> that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate <b>list</b> <b>view</b> provided the best information density. We conclude with thoughts on how such a workflow comparison system could be scaled up to larger corpora in the future...|$|R
