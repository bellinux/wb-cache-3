50|$|A touchstone {{is a small}} tablet of dark stone such as fieldstone, slate, or <b>lydite,</b> {{used for}} {{assaying}} precious metal alloys. It has a finely grained surface on which soft metals leave a visible trace.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century within Choachí the Choachí Stone has been found, {{possibly}} in a grave. The stone, carved in <b>lydite</b> may represent the Muisca calendar, a complex lunisolar calendar used by the Muisca. Also petroglyphs have been discovered in Choachí.|$|E

50|$|The La Frontera Formation (Formación La Frontera, K2F, Ksf) is a {{geological}} formation, {{part of the}} Villeta Group, of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense and neighbouring {{areas of}} the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The sequence of limestones and <b>lydites</b> dates to the Late Cretaceous period; Turonian epoch and has a maximum thickness of 206 m. Fossils of Yaguarasaurus columbianus {{as well as a}} high diversity of ammonites have been found in the La Frontera Formation.|$|R
50|$|The term basanite has {{occasionally}} {{been used}} to refer to a variety of jasper, a black flinty or cherty jasper found in several New England states of the US. Such varieties of jasper are also informally known as lydian stone or <b>lydite</b> and have been used as touchstones in testing the purity of precious metal alloys.|$|E
5000|$|The tooling {{is simple}} and {{consists}} mainly of scrapers and denticulates, the execution is often incomplete and irregular. The main production method is the discoid bifacial breakdown. Tools and products of full Levallois debitage, debris, by-products and retouching shards are present in large numbers, as are sandstone and granite hammering tools, although in smaller numbers. The Levallois technique is also attested on quartzite, schist or <b>lydite</b> cutting devices, regular parallel surface products and faceted heels. Noteworthy is {{the discovery of a}} two-sided cleaver.|$|E
50|$|The Oberkirchen Formation’s sediments are {{markedly}} {{distinguished from}} the strata both above and below them. They can be found north and northwest of Abtweiler, towards the Hühnerhof. Prevailing here are beds of red to grey-red, coarsely sandy to conglomeratic arkoses up to several metres thick. Interstratified therein are horizons of reddish fine sandstone {{and to some extent}} also grey siltstones and claystones. These fine-grained horizons are mostly only thinly developed. The arkoses, which exist as detritus (particularly vein quartz, quartzite, <b>lydite,</b> metamorphic rocks and volcanic rocks) as well as bits more than a centimetre across, almost always containing weathered feldspars, are deposits in channels of a many-branched river system that flowed across the Saar-Nahe Basin from southwest to northeast. The fine-grained sediments mainly represent floodplain and horseshoe lake deposits. The Oberkirchen Formation, named after an outlying centre of the municipality of Freisen in the Saarland, contains minerals that are exposed in the Saar-Nahe Basin {{on both sides of the}} Palatine Saddle from southwest to northeast.|$|E
50|$|During the Mississippian black <b>lydites</b> were sedimented in the Rhenish Massif in Germany. The Lower Permian of Sicily hosts radiolarites in {{limestone}} olistoliths, at {{the same}} period radiolarites have been reported from northwestern Turkey (Karakaya complex of the Pontides). Radiolarites from the Phyllite Zone of Crete {{date back to the}} Middle Permian. The radiolarites from the Hawasina nappes in Oman closed the end of the Permian. Towards the end of the Paleozoic radiolarites formed also along the southern margin of Laurasia near Mashad in Iran.|$|R
5000|$|The stone tool {{industry}} of local raw {{materials from the}} alluvial formations of the Neste river, such as quartzites, <b>lydites,</b> cinerites, and schists {{is considered to be}} of a mediocre quality. Flint, as found in the cultural sediments is naturally absent in the immediate environment and must have been imported from several sources. The most exploited flint quarry is the Montagaillard flysch, located 40 km away in the Hibarette community of the Montgaillard region. This ﬂysch ﬂint is of good quality and is found in slabs of different sizes. The presence of Lepidorbitoid fossils in some flints indicates even more distant sources located in the Béarn province, more than 100 km away. Apparently, the ﬂint outcrops of the Petites Pyrénées to the northeast were not used ...|$|R
40|$|The {{uppermost}} {{layers of}} the Ayineburnu member of the Büyükada Formation in the Istanbul-Gebze area are represented by Griotte-type pelagic nodular limestones. They yielded conodont elements (Bispathodus stabilis and Siphonodella lobata) that can identify the interval from {{the upper part of}} the sandbergi Zone through the isosticha - Upper crenulata Zone - middle Tournaisian - Early Carboniferous. This is the first middle Tournaisian conodont record published from an autochthonous succession in the Istanbul Terrane, NW Turkey. This level characterizes the very last carbonate deposition and is followed by <b>lydites</b> and black siliceous shales and finally by the accumulation of flysch-type deposits during the late Tournaisian and early Visean, that mark the onset of Variscan events to the north of the Istanbul Terrane. A correlation with the Lower Carboniferous successions in the easterly-located Zonguldak area suggests that Istanbul and Zonguldak terranes were in quite different palaeogeographic positions during this time interval. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} project Images in rock {{investigates the}} role of rock features in individual and social worlds of past and contemporary societies. They are often perceived as spiritual beings/ powers, their dwelling places or products (so called pseudo-artefacts). Their ability to attract attention and stimulate the imagination {{has been used in}} imagination survey aimed to gather drawings of respondents images. This paper presents a case study focused on a <b>lydite</b> rock feature within prehistoric hillfort at Tuhošť near Švihov (Klatovy district, West Bohemia, fig. 1). One hundred respondents externalized 122 motifs, which were analyzed and classifi ed into interpretation categories (humans, beings, animals, natural features/artefacts). Further, structural graphic features in pictures were searched and 50 % of motifs were divided into 6 graphic groups (core imaginations; figure 4). It has been shown, that also rock feature diff erent from menhir-like stones resembling figure/body (e. g. Na Špičáku near Hroznětín, see Chroustovský 2010) or without apparent anthropomorphic head/face (see footnote 10) can represent important symbolic feature...|$|E
40|$|Carbonates in Early Paleozoic {{complexes}} {{appear in}} {{the upper part of}} the thick black phyllites forma-tion (Betliar Formation). They are present in the Holec Beds containing black metapelites with <b>lydite</b> and the upper carbonatic horizon with a slight admixture of basic volcanism. From the genetic point of view the stratiform and ankerite deposits of Gemericum are regarded to be f the hydrothermal - metasomatic origin. Owing to the positive results of the geological survey, the Nižná Slaná region has become the most important basis of Fe - ore in the Spiš - Gemer Ore Mts. but in Western Carpathinas as well. The potential of industrial siderite was 63 mil ton. Mano deposit surfaces on the southeren slope of Rimberg hill, where are the superficial parts of forma-tion of black phyllites with carbonatic bodies. The formation, thick to 450 m,contains carbonatic and lyditic ho-rizons with carbonates metasomatically changed to ankerite and siderite. The biggest siderite bodies have maxi-mal directional length of 300 m and thikness of 100 m. The accumulation of metasomatic siderite near obe-liarovo is located in the northern limb of anticline in Betliar Formation. Ore bodies are a typical example of the blind deposit. The average quality of economic ores is following: Fe 33, 5 %, Mn 2, 18 %, SiO 2 8, 5 %, As 0, 001 – 0, 2 %, Pb 0, 001 - 0, 03 %, Zn 0, 002 - 0, 009 %, S 0, 5 - 1, 5 %.

40|$|On {{request of}} the Soprintendenza {{in charge of the}} Museo Egizio of Turin, a quite large number of tests have been {{performed}} on four statues of the museum to assess their integrity both for practical (moving the statue) and archaeological purposes. Ultrasonic tomography and georadar have been used with fine results on sub-decimeter scale. In this paper we present the main results on the statues of the Pharaons Ramses II (Fig. 1 left) and Tuthmosis I. (Fig. 2 left). Both the statues belong to the collection set up by Bernardino Drovetti, Console Generale of France in Egypt in the early XIX century. Ramses II statue was restored {{in the first half of}} the XIX century. Few documents can be found on these restoration works: very likely the statue arrived broken to Turin and was reassembled with cement mortar (Hartleben, 1909) No news can be found neither on the type of mortar nor on the quantity of mortar actually used. The statue of Ramses was probably found at Tebe in 1818. It is made by basanite exploited from a quarry in Uadi Hammamat. The basanite is a basaltic extrusive rock also known as Lydian stone or <b>lydite.</b> It was almost exclusively reserved to the crafting of statues of pharaons or divinities. In many parts of the statue the mortar (as dark as the stone) is clearly visible (Fig. 1 right). The statue of Tutmosis I was found by J. J. Rifaud, a Drovetti 's agent, in 1818 in Tebe, very likely in the Karnak temple. The king sits on a throne with many scripts on both the sides of the seat. The statue is made by a dark diorite with some light pink plagioclase crystals sizing few centimeters. Its conservation seems fairly goo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} Paleozoic stratigraphy, palaeogeography and geo-historical {{evolution}} of the intra-Alpine terrains outcropping in the Betic Cordillera (Malaguide Complex) and in the equivalent Alpine domains of the Calabria-Peloritani Terrane (Stilo and Longi-Taormina units). Field, stratigraphic and biostratigraphic studies have allowed {{the division of the}} Malaguide Complex outcropping in all the three studied areas in three Alpine tectonic units, which are, from bottom to top, Epimetamorphic Malaguide Unit, Lower Malaguide Unit and Upper Malaguide Unit. The succession recorded in the lower units contains turbiditic deposits as those of the Morales and Santi Petri formations, with a probably pre-Devonian and Devonian ages, respectively. On the contrary, the succession recorded mainly in the Upper Malaguide Unit (that crops out to the N of the other units in present-day coordinates) includes Silurian-Devonian limestones, nodular in some places, with several types of fossil remains. Facies included in the lower Alpine Malaguide units correspond to siliciclastic-carbonatic distal (slope and basin) environments, typical of a divergent (passive) continental margin. On the contrary, pre-Carboniferous facies of the Upper Malaguide Unit point to less deep and less distal environments in the pelagic areas of the same margin during Silurian and Devonian times. Therefore, this margin opened to the SE, according to present coordinates, towards regions related to the Paleotethys ocean. The Paleozoic sequence of the Stilo Unit includes pre-Devonian pelites with intercalated metabasites, black shales and limestone beds, and Devonian pelites with limestone intercalations, which show significant lateral and vertical changes of facies. This fact allows to characterize the pelagic areas of a continental margin with similar features to those of the more proximal environments of the palaeomargin recorded in the Malaguide Complex. Lower Devonian deposits studied in the Aspromonte Massif include thicker pelitic intercalations and carbonate facies typical of deeper enviroments. This indicates that the deposition of the southern succession of the Stilo Unit in progresivelly more distal regions of the margin. The rest of the Paleozoic sequence is characterized by Carboniferous <b>lydites</b> and synorogenic siliciclastic (Culm type) deposits, as in the Malaguide Complex, and points to a equivalent tectono-stratigraphic evolution. The abundance of pre-Devonian basic volcanics and volcano-sedimentary formations {{and the nature of the}} Silurian-Devonian facies recognized within the Longi-Taormina Unit point to a palaeogeographic location of this unit in more distal realms in a continental margin than that of beds of equivalent age of the Stilo Unit. This location was closer to the intraoceanic rift axis that probably corresponded to the western sector of the Paleotethys. However, the intracontinental features of the mafic vulcanism of the Longi-Taormina Unit exclude the existence of real oceanic crust in the Paleozoic terrains here studied. This indicates that the Paleotethys was closed gradually towards its western sector. The lateral evolution of facies in the Silurian-Devonian successions of the Malaguide Complex and of the Calabria-Peloritani Terrane reveals a proximal-distal equivalent zonation, from NW to SE and N to S (respectively and in present coordinates). Both sections constitute two transects in the same continental margin located to the N and to the NW of the Paleotethys. To sum up, Paleozoic intra-Alpine terrains studied in the Malaguide Complex and in the Stilo and Longi-Taormina units of the Calabria-Peloritani Terrane make part of the northern margin of a narrow and elongated continental crust plate (ribbon continent) incompletely detached from Gondwana in its western end, during the Silurian-Devonian opening of the Paleotethys. This evolution fits well with that known for other nord-Gondwanic intra-Alpine regions during the opening of the Paleotethys. This caused the separation of this ribbon continent from Northern Gondwana, from which most of the Paleozoic terrains further involved in the Alpine belt are derived. Tesis Univ. Granada.

40|$|Excavations {{were carried}} out in a Late Palaeolithic site in the {{community}} of Bad Buchau-Kappel between 2003 and 2007. Archaeological investigations covered a total of more than 200 m** 2. This site is the product of what likely were multiple occupations that occurred during the Late Glacial on the Federsee shore in this location. The site is situated on a mineral ridge that projected into the former Late Glacial lake Federsee. This beach ridge consists of deposits of fine to coarse gravel and sand and was surrounded by open water, except for a connection to the solid shore on the south. A lagoon lay between the hook-shaped ridge and the shore of the Federsee. This exposed location provided optimal access to the water of the lake. In addition, the small lagoon may have served as a natural harbor for landing boats or canoes. Sedimentological and palynological investigations document the dynamic history of the location between 14, 500 and 11, 600 years before present (cal BP). Evidence of the deposition of sands, gravels and muds since the Bølling Interstadial is provided by stratigraphic and palynological analyses. The major occupation occurred {{in the second half of}} the Younger Dryas period. Most of the finds were located on or in the sediments of the ridge; fewer finds occurred in the surrounding mud, which was also deposited during the Younger Dryas. Direct dates on some bone fragments, however, demonstrate that intermittent sporadic occupations also took place during the two millennia of the Meiendorf, Bølling, and Allerød Interstadials. These bones were reworked during the Younger Dryas and redeposited in the mud. A 14 C date from one bone of 11, 600 years ago (cal BP) places the Late Palaeolithic occupation of the ridge at the very end of the Younger Dryas, which is in agreement with stratigraphic observations. Stone artifacts, numbering 3, 281, comprise the majority of finds from the site. These include typical artifacts of the Late Palaeolithic, such as backed points, short scrapers, and small burins. There are no bipointes or Malaurie-Points, which is in accord with the absolute date of the occupation. A majority of the artifacts are made from a brown chert that is obtainable a few kilometers north of the site in sediments of the Graupensandrinne. Other raw materials include red and green radiolarite that occur in the fluvioglacial gravels of Oberschwaben, as well as quartzite and <b>lydite.</b> The only non-local material present is a few artifacts of tabular chert from the region near Kelheim in Bavaria. A unique find consists of two fragments of a double-barbed harpoon made of red deer antler, which was found in the Younger Dryas mud. It is likely, but not certain, that this find belongs to the same assemblage as the numerous stone artifacts. Although not numerous, animal bones were also found in the excavations. Most of them lay in sediments of the Younger Dryas, but several 14 C dates place some of these bones in earlier periods, including the Meiendorf, Bølling, and Allerød Interstadials. These bones were reworked by water and redeposited in mud sediments during the Younger Dryas. As a result, it is difficult to attribute individual bones to particular chronological positions without exact dates. Species that could be identified include wild horse (Equus spec.), moose or elk (Alces alces), red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), aurochs or bison (Bos spec.), wild boar (Sus scrofa), as well as birds and fish, including pike (Esox Lucius) ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{study area}} is {{situated}} in Germany in the federal state Hesse at the eastern margin of the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge within the Lahn syncline. It {{is part of the}} former Variscan geosyncline. In 1910 and 1921 AHLBURG developed a new concept for the interpretation of the geological situation in the Lahn region between Marburg and Limburg: the syncline-theory. Within this "Lahn-syncline" an idealised symmetrical succession of structural and facies features - most obvious within Middle Devonian strata - was proposed. He recognised a general trend to a basinal facies from Emsian to Upper Devonian times within the "syncline", which was divided from the Middle Devonian onwards by the build-up of volcanoes and reefs in its middle part. The syncline was thus 3 -fold divided into: a) the "Southern Marginal Facies", b) a zone of volcanic ridges and reefs in the middle and c) the "Northern Marginal Facies" which nowadays is called Hörre-facies. Small remnants of proposed Upper Devonian basinal facies within the middle volcano-and-reef facies were attributed by him to the Northern Marginal Facies; but since no direct contact to the latter was observable, he gave them a separate name: "Gaudernbacher Schichten (layers) ". Within this study the struggle which persisted over 80 years about the nature, origin, spatial distribution and palaeogeographic setting of the "Gaudernbacher Schichten" sensu AHLBURG (1918) will be settled: The Gaudernbach layers as a separate stratigraphic unit does not exist! It will be shown in this study that this conclusion can be, in the first instance, verified solely by logical inferences and historical contradictions. But what else - if not the occurrence of a "special facies" - could have forced AHLBURG to recognise something unique in this region? In order to solve this problem the following methods have been applied: a) reconstruction of palynostratigraphy and palynofacies, b) applied argument analysis, c) compilation of new correlation charts and historical analysis, d) analysis of Milankovitch cycles, e) fractal analysis, f) petrographic analyses, g) drill core descriptions. RESULTS: 1) The Gaudernbach layers do not exist. 2) Remnants of the Giessen nappe have been encountered in the area between Weilburg and Holzheim. 3) The Giessen nappe in the middle Lahn-syncline comprises a) late Viséan Kulm-slates (Kulmtonschiefer), b) the Viséan Bruchberg sandstone north of Limburg, c) Viséan light flinty-slates, d) Tournaisian dark flinty-slates, e) Tournaisian dark slates, f) Deckdiabas and Erdbach limestone, g) newly encountered early Famennian debris flow sediments and small occurrences of greywacke. 4) The clasts of the Viséan Bruchberg sandstone were derived from the north (Laurussia), whereas the components of the Famennian greywackes came from a southerly situated source region. 5) Milankovitch cycles have been detected within the background sediments of the Bruchberg sandstone formation and the Helle <b>Lydite</b> (Light flinty slate) formation. Sedimentation rates in the order of less than 10 mm/ka have been derived for both analysed sediments with the obtained data. 6) Autochthonous and allochthonous lithologies show no differences in their fractal properties. But apart from that, fractal analysis proved to be a valuable tool for the quantification of tectonic trends. 7) A new Lower Carboniferous correlation chart (LCC 2003) is presented. 8) Applied argument analysis has been introduced to geology for the first time. In exemplary analyses the reliability of the Giessen-Harz Nappe concept is analysed and a scheme to make appropriate judgements on the speculative nature of two palaeogeographic texts is presented. 9) A scheme for the structured registration of biostratigraphic results in electronically processable data sets is presented. 10) 18 drill cores from mostly Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous lithologies, drilled north of Limburg, have been analysed and their strata graphically rotated to zero dip for palaeofacies analysis. 11) The palynostratigraphy has been - for the first time - successfully applied in the area between Weilburg and Holzheim. Palynofacies determinations have been undertaken. For the first time reliable statistical data about to what extent reworked fossils could be comprised in greywacke-bearing Upper Devonian debris flow sediments become available. 12) Special attention has been paid on the description of occurrence and formation of framboidal pyrite in pelites and in phycomata of acritarchs therein. 13) A geological sketch map 1 : 25000, featuring the area between Weilburg and Holzheim, is presented in enclosure 4. 14) Hypothetical reconnaissance maps showing the northern Gondwana 9 ̆ 7 southern Laurussia topography during the Middle Devonian and Lower Carboniferous are presented...|$|E
