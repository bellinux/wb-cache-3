Additional modifications and rules were added to successive versions. Pitman New Era (1922–1975) had the most developed set of rules and abbreviation lists. Pitman 2000 (1975–present) introduced some simplifications and drastically reduced the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>abbreviations</b> to reduce the memory load, officially reduced {{to a list of}} 144 short forms. The later versions dropped certain symbols and introduced other simplifications to earlier versions. For example, strokes [...] "rer" [...] (heavy curved downstroke) and [...] "kway" [...] (hooked horizontal straight stroke) are present in Pitman's New Era, but not in Pitman's 2000.|$|E

The connection is right-handed (RH) and must be turned clock-wise to tighten. The threading is external, so the connections of the cylinder and the attached equipment must be fixed together using a nipple, which is signified by NGO. A nipple is a bolt which fits together two male connections. Internal (Int) threading allows for equipment to be screwed directly onto the cylinder outlet.|$|E
