50|$|Task Force <b>Libeccio</b> was the air {{detachment}} {{participating in}} {{the enforcement of the}} no-fly zone in Libya authorized by Resolution 1973, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on 17 March. The task force was named for the strong southwesterly wind that blows all year in the Mediterranean Sea. Task Force <b>Libeccio</b> comprised six CF-18 Hornet fighter aircraft, two Boeing CC-177 Globemasters, two CP-140 Auroras and about 200 Canadian Forces personnel, including aircrews and ground technicians from 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron at 3 Wing CFB Bagotville and 409 Tactical Fighter Squadron at 4 Wing CFB Cold Lake and other locations across Canada. The force also included two CC-150 Polaris air-to-air refuelling detachment from 437 Transport Squadron at 8 Wing Trenton, Ontario. Task Force <b>Libeccio</b> reached the region on 18 March.|$|E
50|$|The main winds blow {{from the}} south-east, the <b>Libeccio</b> and the Ponente which batter the coast {{for two to}} three days in a row and cause severe storms.|$|E
50|$|In 1941, the CAP {{participated in}} the Peruvian-Ecuadorian War. At that time, the CAP were {{equipped}} with Caproni Ca.114 and North American NA.50 Torito fighters, Douglas DB-8A-3P attack aircraft, and Caproni Ca.135 Tipo Peru and Caproni Ca.310 <b>Libeccio</b> bombers, among others.|$|E

50|$|The Royal Navy's Force K annihilated the convoy, sinking all the {{merchant}} ships and the destroyer Fulmine with no loss {{and almost no}} damage. The next day, the Maestrale class destroyer <b>Libeccio</b> was sunk, while picking up survivors, by British submarine HMS Upholder.|$|E
50|$|In Greek mythology, it is {{believed}} that the cliffs above the Tyrrhenian Sea housed the four winds kept by Aeolus. The winds are the Mistral from the Rhône valley, the <b>Libeccio</b> from the southwest, and the Sirocco and Ostro from the south.|$|E
50|$|Ostro (Migjorn, Oštro, Όστρια, Oštrijal), or Austro, is a southerly {{wind in the}} Mediterranean Sea, {{especially}} the Adriatic. Its name {{is derived from the}} Latin name Auster, which also meant a southerly wind. It is a warm and humid wind that often carries rain, but it is also sometimes identified with the <b>Libeccio</b> and Scirocco.|$|E
50|$|Lebeche (Llebeig or Garbí in Catalan; <b>Libeccio</b> in Italian) is the Spanish {{name for}} a warm {{southwest}} wind in parts of coastal Mediterranean Spain, either a foehn wind or a hot southerly wind in advance of a low pressure area moving from the Sahara Desert. Called by other names {{in other parts of}} the Mediterranean area.|$|E
50|$|The eight compass {{winds are}} evidently from the Italian-tinged lingua franca in the Mediterranean Sea during the High and Late Middle Ages Of the eight winds, only two {{can be traced}} to prior Classical winds - Ostra (S) from the Latin Auster, and <b>Libeccio</b> (SW) from the Greek Lips - but the others seem to be largely {{conceived}} autonomously.|$|E
50|$|Humidity is high {{all year}} round, {{with a minimum}} of 72% in June and July and a maximum of 84% in November and December. Prevailing winds blow from W, S, E and NE. Southwesterly winds, known as <b>libeccio</b> or garbino, are foehn winds, which may bring warm {{temperatures}} in each season. On average, there are over 2,040 sunshine hours per year.|$|E
50|$|The Caproni Ca.310 <b>Libeccio</b> (Italian: {{southwest}} wind) was an Italian monoplane, twin-engine {{reconnaissance aircraft}} used in World War II. Derived from the similar Ca.309, {{it had its}} combat debut during the Spanish Civil War and {{took part in the}} earlier phases of World War II in Libya. Some were used in attack groups as a temporary replacement for the unsatisfactory Breda Ba.65. The last Ca.310 was retired by the Italian Air Force in 1948.|$|E
50|$|Under northeasterly winds Pescara suffers {{precipitation}} {{which is}} generally weak, but can be much more intense if accompanied by a depression. Also from the north east comes winter weather from Siberia that, on average, brings abundant snowfalls every 3-4 years. In summer the weather is mostly stable and sunny with temperatures that, thanks to the sea breeze, rarely exceed 35 degrees unless a southwesterly <b>Libeccio</b> is blowing. Particularly in summer, but also in winter, the high humidity leads to morning and evening mist or haze.|$|E
5000|$|Littorio was {{repaired}} {{with all}} available resources and was fully operational again within four months, while {{restoration of the}} older battleships proceeded at a much slower pace (repairs took seven months for Caio Duilio, and the repairs for Conte di Cavour were never completed). In all, the Swordfish attack was made with just 20 aircraft. Two Italian aircraft were destroyed on the ground by the bombing, and two unexploded bombs hit the cruiser [...] and the destroyer <b>Libeccio.</b> Near misses damaged the destroyer Pessagno.|$|E
50|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} family, {{originally}} hailing from Terni, Caraciotti entered the Italian Naval Academy in Livorno in 1911 and graduated as an Ensign in 1915, {{participating in the}} First World War initially on board battleships and later (1916), after promotion to Lieutenant, in command of torpedo boats. After the war, {{he was promoted to}} Lieutenant Commander and became an aide to Eugene of Savoy, Duke of Ancona, as well as honorary ordinance officer of Thomas of Savoy, Duke of Genoa. In 1932, after promotion to Commander, he was given command of the destroyer Antonio Da Noli and later <b>Libeccio.</b>|$|E
50|$|Just 36 hours later, Wanklyn {{witnessed}} the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. Captain William Gladstone Agnew led Force K—a flotilla of several destroyers—into a surface battle. Speeding up to attack any stragglers, Wanklyn torpedoed and sank the Italian Maestrale-class destroyer <b>Libeccio,</b> {{that had just}} finished rescuing survivors from the ships sunk during the battle. Wanklyn attempted to engage a cruiser and claimed an Avieri-class destroyer as damaged, but actually the torpedoes missed their target. During the battle the gyro failed {{on one of the}} Upholder torpedoes, which ran in circles and came close to the Upholder before sinking.|$|E

The prison is situated behind the mountain ranges of Madonie and {{is a very large}} structure and of reinforced concrete (RC), for both men and woman, in the chief town of the island. Pagliarelli is divided into 8 departments: Scirocco (Maestrale and <b>Libeccio),</b> South (or “Mari”: Tirreno, Adriatico and Ionio), and Est (or “Pianeti”: Marte, Plutone and Giove) with a total of almost one thousand inmates. Some rules of the institute seem to be very punitive as regards improped and prohibited behaviours.|$|E
5000|$|Meso-Mediterranean level: from 100 to 1000 m {{above sea}} level on the south-facing slope and 0 to 700m on the north slope. This level, with cooler temperatures, is {{characterized}} mainly by the holm oak, Maquis shrubland and arbutus but also by cork oak and maritime pine (on the sunny side), the downy oak (on the shady side), chestnut, lavender, broom, cistus, and lentisk. On the heights, between bare rocks, vegetation is stubbly - swept by frequent and violent westerly and south-westerly winds (the <b>Libeccio)</b> which become stronger after crossing the ridge of the Serra di Pigno and blow down along the valleys to the sea. The winds form remarkable lenticular clouds off Bastia.|$|E
5000|$|Thirteen demons {{known as}} the Malebranche, [...] "Evil Claws", guard the fifth bolgia of the Malebolge. Their leader is Malacoda ("evil tail"), while the others are Scarmiglione ("ruffle-haired"), Barbariccia ("curly beard"), Alichino (derived from Arlecchino, the harlequin), Calcabrina ("one who walks on the frost"), Cagnazzo ("bad dog"), Libicocco (a {{possible}} mix of <b>libeccio</b> and sirocco), Draghignazzo (maybe from drago, [...] "dragon", and sghignazzo, [...] "guffaw"), Ciriatto (possibly [...] "little pork"), Graffiacane ("scratch dog"), Farfarello (possibly [...] "goblin") and Rubicante (possibly [...] "red" [...] or [...] "rabid"). One of the thirteen was thus not named. They try to trick Virgil and Dante by telling them of a path which does not really exist.|$|E
50|$|The northwestern Mediterranean and the Gulf of Genoa in particular, are {{not only}} a {{transition}} area for passing cyclones, but are frequently areas of cyclogenesis. Low pressure areas move into or are formed {{as a result of}} North Atlantic air entering the Mediterranean Sea between the Alps and the Massif Central, via the Rhone Valley, or via the Carcassonne gap between the Pyrenees and Massif Central. This cold and moist air enters the Mediterranean basin, and is deflected by the high mountains of northwest Corsica, which divert the air mass to the northeast, triggering cool and wet <b>Libeccio</b> winds in response into to the Ligurian Sea, which in turn hit the western Apennines located in the immediate vicinity of the sea.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{origin of}} the mariner's eight-wind rose is obscure. Only two of its point names (Ostro, <b>Libeccio)</b> have Classical etymologies, {{the rest of the}} names seem to be {{autonomously}} derived. Two Arabic words stand out: Scirocco (SE) from al-Sharq (الشرق - east in Arabic) and the variant Garbino (SW), from al-Gharb (الغرب - west in Arabic). This suggests the mariner's rose was probably acquired by southern Italian seafarers not from their classical Roman ancestors, but rather from Norman Sicily in the 11th to 12th centuries. The coasts of the Maghreb and Mashriq are SW and SE of Sicily respectively; the Greco (a NE wind), reflects the position of Byzantine-held Calabria-Apulia to the northeast of Arab Sicily, while the Maestro (a NW wind) is a reference to the Mistral wind that blows from the southern French coast towards northwest Sicily.|$|E

50|$|As {{for other}} communes in the Nebbio region and those {{along the western}} coast of Cap Corse, Barbaggio enjoys a Mediterranean climate with {{moderate}} temperature changes. The snow only reaches the heights of Pigno a few days a year, rarely dropping below 400 metres. Snowfall disrupts traffic in the Col de Teghime (536 m above sea level) only rarely. Rainfall that should refresh the Serra di Pigno is low in summer and so the flanks of the mountain are arid, sunny, and exposed, being the sulana (or sunny-side) of the mountain and subject to frequent <b>libeccio</b> - the prevailing westerly wind: dry, violent, and often mixed with the punente, the other westerly wind. Because of its geographical position and its area of plain, Barbaggio is relatively well protected from the north winds - the Tramuntana in winter: a healthy, dry, violent and icy wind; and the wet winter north-Easter which brings cold and snow from Italy.|$|E

5000|$|As the {{commander}} of the 3rd Division, Brivonesi was the protagonist of the Italian defeat in the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. On 8 November 1941, Brivonesi sailed from Messina with Trieste, Trento and the 13th Destroyer Flotilla (Granatiere, Bersagliere, Fuciliere, Alpino) as distant escort of the [...] "Beta" [...] convoy (later known as the [...] "Duisburg" [...] convoy), which consisted in 7 merchant ships (the Italian cargo ships Maria, Sagitta and Rina Corrado, the Italian tankers Conte di Misurata and Minatitlan and the German cargo ships Duisburg and San Marco, laden with 389 vehicles, 34,473 long tons of munitions and matériel and 17,281 long tons of fuel) with a close escort of six destroyers (under the command of Captain Ugo Bisciani on Maestrale). The convoy was spotted by a British reconnaissance plane, and Force K (light cruisers Aurora and Penelope and destroyers Lance and Lively) sailed from Malta to intercept. The attack happened during the following night; Force K took the close escort by surprise, sank one destroyer (Fulmine) and disabled another (Grecale), then proceeded to sink all the seven merchants, while the confused and disarticulated reaction of the other destroyers (left without orders, as Maestrales radio antenna was shot away) was unable to stop or damage the British ships. Brivonesi's 3rd Division, {{at the time of the}} attack (00:57 on 9 November), was sailing at 12 knots about three miles astern and to the east of the convoy. The Division only realized that the convoy was being attacked when they spotted the flash of the British guns; shortly before, at 00:30, Trieste had intercepted a coded message of unknown source and meaning (the source was Force K), and Brivonesi was about to send a general alert to all his ships, when the battle started. Trieste and Trento opened fire on Force K at 1:03, from a distance of 9,000-10,000 meters; Brivonesi's subsequent manoeuvre later drew heavy criticism: instead of turning southeast, where Force K was, to close in on the British ships and attack them at once, he turned starboard so that his cruisers could bring all guns to bear, which required several minutes. Brivonesi's ships briefly assumed a southerly course (thus distancing themselves from Force K even more), then turned to port and then to starboard, advancing at a speed of only 15-16 knots, less than half the speed that they could keep. Force K kept manoeuvring around the convoy so that the latter was constantly between the British ships and the Italian Division, which caused the blazing merchants and their smoke to hamper the aim of the Italian gunners. At 1:12 Brivonesi ordered to increase speed to 18 knots and at 1:25 to 24 knots, but by then the distance had risen to 17,000 meters, and he ordered to cease fire, as it was pointless. At 1:29 Brivonesi ordered to turn north, in order to intercept the Force K when the latter would turn back towards Malta (by then the convoy was completely destroyed). Meanwhile, however, Supermarina (the Italian Navy high command) had informed him that the risk of a torpedo bomber attack on his ships was high; as they were outside of Malta's aircraft's reach, Brivonesi believed that a British aircraft carrier was in the area. Upon realizing that the fires of the disabled merchant ships lighted up his ships, making them easier targets for submarines as well as aircraft, Brivonesi ordered to cease fire, leave the area and assume a northwesterly course, at 1:32. Overall, Trieste and Trento had fired 207 8-inch shells, without scoring any hits. The 3rd Division only returned to the area after a few hours, to cover the search and rescue operation, during which the destroyer <b>Libeccio</b> was sunk by HMS Upholder and Trento was narrowly missed by a torpedo.|$|E
