40|$|The three skin {{disorders}} of Lyme borreliosis in Europe include erythema migrans, an acute, self-limited lesion; borrelial <b>lymphocytoma,</b> a subacute lesion; and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, {{a chronic}} lesion. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we determined mRNA expression of selected chemokines, cytokines, and leukocyte markers in skin samples from 100 patients with erythema migrans, borrelial <b>lymphocytoma,</b> or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and from 25 control subjects. Chemokine patterns in lesional skin {{in each of}} the three skin disorders included low but significant mRNA levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL 1 and the dendritic cell chemoattractant CCL 20 and intermediate levels of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL 2. Erythema migrans and particularly acrodermatitis lesions had high mRNA expression of the T-cell-active chemokines CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 and low levels of the B-cell-active chemokine CXCL 13, whereas <b>lymphocytoma</b> lesions had high levels of CXCL 13 and lower levels of CXCL 9 and CXCL 10. This pattern of chemokine expression was consistent with leukocyte marker mRNA in lesional skin. Moreover, using immunohistologic methods, CD 3 + T cells and CXCL 9 were visualized in erythema migrans and acrodermatitis lesions, and CD 20 + B cells and CXCL 13 were seen in <b>lymphocytoma</b> lesions. Thus, erythema migrans and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans have high levels of the T-cell-active chemokines CXCL 9 and CXCL 10, whereas borrelial <b>lymphocytoma</b> has high levels of the B-cell-active chemokine CXCL 13...|$|E

40|$|In this {{communication}} our aim was {{to study}} the JK cell growth inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects of ginsenoside Rg 6 (GRg 6) from steamed notoginseng on human <b>lymphocytoma.</b> The CCK- 8 method was used to observe the anti-proliferative effect of GRg 6 on human <b>lymphocytoma</b> JK cells. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the influence of GRg 6 on cell cycle. The Annexin-V FITC/PI double-staining method was used to detect the ratio of apoptotic cells. JC- 1 staining was undertaken to observe the influence of GRg 6 on intracellular mitochondrial membrane potential. Finally, western blots were conducted to detect the expression level of apoptosis-related Bax and the Bcl- 2 proteins. The results suggested that GRg 6 can inhibit the proliferation of human <b>lymphocytoma</b> JK cells. GRg 6 blocks an S arrest in the cell cycle. With the increase in GRg 6 concentration, the potential in the cell decreased in a dose dependent manner, and Bax protein expression gradually increased, whereas Bcl- 2 protein expression gradually decreased. In conclusion, GRg 6 can inhibit JK cell proliferation in human <b>lymphocytoma</b> and induce its apoptosis. The mechanism of action may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase of Bax expression and decrease of Bcl- 2 expression caused by GRg 6...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Borrelial <b>lymphocytoma</b> is a {{relatively}} rare but typical presentation of Lyme disease. Predilection sites are the ears in children and chest/nipples in adults. It is treated like an erythema migrans and has a good prognosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16 -year-old boy presented with a swollen, red and painful right nipple since several months. An ultrasound showed normal breast tissue. The patient was referred to the pediatric surgeon who performed an incision biopsy. Histopathological examination revealed follicular hyperplasia without signs of malignancy. An infectious cause, most likely Lyme disease, was suspected. Serological analysis and PCR of the tissue confirmed the diagnosis of a borrelial <b>lymphocytoma,</b> and the patient was treated with doxycycline with good result. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of the characteristic clinical presentation of borrelial <b>lymphocytoma,</b> supported by positive results from serologic testing for Lyme disease, avoids {{the need for additional}} and invasive diagnostic tests...|$|E
40|$|Solitary <b>lymphocytoma</b> {{is a rare}} {{cutaneous}} {{manifestation of}} Lyme borreliosis that has been reported almost exclusively from Europe. This suggests that its etiologic agent may be absent or extremely rare on the North American continent. All three species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato known {{to be associated with}} human Lyme borreliosis (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. afzelii) have been isolated in Europe, whereas only B. burgdorferi sensu stricto has been found in North America. This suggests that either B. garinii or B. afzelii might be the etiologic agent of borrelial <b>lymphocytoma.</b> To investigate this hypothesis we characterized five strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolated from <b>lymphocytoma</b> lesions of patients residing in Slovenia. The methods used included: large restriction fragment pattern analysis of restriction enzyme MlnI-digested genomic DNA, plasmid profiling, protein profiling, ribotyping using 5 S, 16 S and 23 S rDNA probes and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rrf (5 S) -rrl (23 S) inter-genic spacer region. Molecular subtyping showed that four of the five isolates belonged to the species B. afzelii; however, this species is the predominant patient isolate in Slovenia and therefore, may not represent a preferential association with <b>lymphocytoma.</b> The fifth isolate appeared to be most closely related to the DN 127 genomic group of organisms. Further characterization of the isolate revealed that it possessed a unique molecular “fingerprint. ” The results not only show that borrelial <b>lymphocytoma</b> can be caused by B. afzelii but also demonstrate an association with another genomic group of B. burgdoiferi sensu lato that is present in North America as well...|$|E

40|$|The {{difficulties}} {{created by}} the lack of generally accepted views on classification, diagnostic criteria and natural history of the cutaneous lymphomata are discussed. Only the lymphomata which remain confined to the skin throughout the major part of their development are considered. It is emphasized that these are extremely radiosensitive and that there must be some factors as yet unknown which play a part in their unique natural history and response to treatment. The cutaneous lymphomata are considered under three headings: (1) <b>lymphocytoma,</b> (2) lymphosarcoma and reticulum cell sarcoma, (3) mycosis fungoides. The characteristics of the first two are discussed briefly and illustrative examples are given. The relatively benign nature of the <b>lymphocytoma</b> is stressed. It is suggested that the solitary lymphosarcoma of the skin should be treated by radical radiotherapy since long-term survival or cure may be achieved. The treatment of mycosis fungoides is considered in greater detail. The physical advantages of electron therapy are described and details given of whole body surface treatment with electrons produced by a 6 MeV linear accelerator and slowed down with carbon decelerators of appropriate thickness. The results in 73 patients treated by electrons are analysed. The early and late side-effects are mentioned and the necessity for investigating other forms of treatment is stressed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cutaneous}} T cell lymphomas (CTCL), {{typified by}} mycosis fungoides, and several chronic T cell mediated dermatoses {{are characterized by}} the migration of T lymphocytes into the epidermis (epidermotropism). Alternatively, other types of cutaneous inflammation (malignant cutaneous B cell lymphoma, CBCL, or <b>lymphocytoma</b> cutis, non-malignant T or B cell type) do not show evidence of epidermotropism. This suggests that certain T lymphocyte subpopulations are able to interact with and penetrate the epidermal basement membrane. We show here that T lymphocytes derived from patients with CTCL (HUT 78 or HUT 102 cells), adhere to the detergent-insoluble extraceilular matrix prepared from cultured basal keratinocytes (HFK ECM). HUT cell adhesion t...|$|E

40|$|Serologic {{follow-up}} examinations {{are frequently}} performed {{in patients with}} erythema migrans, borrelial <b>lymphocytoma,</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (the 3 dermatoborrelioses) to evaluate treatment efficacy. There is, however, substantial proof in the literature that antibody titer development after therapy is unpredictable and variable, and moreover it is largely uncorrelated with the clinical course and mode of antibiotic treatment. For example, persistent positive IgG and/ or IgM antibody titers do not indicate treatment failure. Thus, repeated serologic testing is of very limited value for assessing therapy efficacy, and therefore not recommended in the follow-up of dermatoborrelioses patients. Since cultivation of the etiologic agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and polymerase chain reaction are also inadequate for this purpose, the assessment of patients with cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in the follow-up rests primarily on the clinical picture...|$|E
40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of Borrelia burgdorferi infection, {{hampered by the}} absence of detectable antibodies in most patients with erythema chronicum migrans is important to prevent late-stage neurologic, rheumatologic, and skin disorders. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi has been claimed to be the causative agent in localized scleroderma (morphea). We used PCR amplification to search for B. burgdorferi outer surface protein OspA–specific sequences in DNA obtained from lesional skin biopsies on Finnish patients with clinically suspect erythema chronicum migrans, <b>lymphocytoma,</b> morphea, or with diverse skin manifestations and persistent high antibodies to B. burgdorferi flagellar antigen. Seronegative patients with other skin lesions served as controls. The amplicons obtained with primers specific for B. burgdorferi type strain B 31 ospA sequence did not hybridize to the corresponding probes, and thus the DNA amplified from a Finnish B. burgdorferi erythema chronicum migrans skin isolate was sequenced. This 98 -nucleotide sequence of ospA (332 – 429) showed 11 % to 14 % nucleotide divergence compared with the North American type strain (B 31), several European strains, and an East Siberian tick strain. The sequence was almost identical (99 %) to a Swedish isolate from acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Using oligonucleotides specific for the Finnish strain, a positive polymerase chain reaction – based hybridization was obtained in six of seven untreated erythema chronicum migrans patients infected in Finland or in Estonia, and in the <b>lymphocytoma</b> patient. Only two of the erythema chronicum migrans patients had IgG or IgM antibodies to flagellin. However, all seven morphea lesions {{as well as the other}} lesions were polymerase chain reaction negative. Polymerase chain reaction – based hybridization ofB. burgdoferi OspA gene from skin-derived DNA thus provides a sensitive and specific diagnostic tool. In conditions not unequivocally known to be caused by B. burgdorferi in morphea, this assay was negative. We also demonstrate that peri-Baltic B. burgdorferi isolates show homology in their OspA genes but differ from geographically more distant isolates...|$|E

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a multisystem illness which {{is caused by the}} strains of {{spirochete}} Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and transmitted by the tick, Ixodes. Though very commonly reported from the temperate regions of the world, the incidence has increased worldwide due to increasing travel and changing habitats of the vector. Few cases have been reported from the Indian subcontinent too. Skin manifestations are the earliest to occur, and diagnosing these lesions followed by appropriate treatment, can prevent complications of the disease, which are mainly neurological. The three main dermatological manifestations are erythema chronicum migrans, borrelial <b>lymphocytoma</b> and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Many other dermatological conditions including morphea, lichen sclerosus and lately B cell lymphoma, have been attributed to the disease. Immunofluorescence and polymerase reaction tests have been developed to overcome the problems for diagnosis. Culture methods are also used for diagnosis. Treatment with Doxycycline is the mainstay of management, though prevention is of utmost importance. Vaccines against the condition are still not very successful. Hence, the importance of recognising the cutaneous manifestations early, to prevent systemic complications which can occur if left untreated, can be understood. This review highlights the cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and its management...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis is {{transmitted}} by tick bites. Approximately every fifth local tick (Ixodes ricinus) is infected. Transmission, therefore {{does not occur}} with every bite, and disease doesn't always follow infection. The goal {{of the study was}} to investigate the risks of infection and disease after tick bites in the area of Erlangen/Germany. METHODS: Between April 1989 and October 1991 seventy-one of our out-patients (30 females, 41 males) aged 6 months to 29 years had a tick bite and were enrolled into the study. After the ticks had been removed, a blood specimen for a specific Borrelia burgdorferi antibody assay (IFT) was collected. An interview by phone was performed 4 weeks later and an appointment for a second blood collection was arranged. RESULTS: In 69 patients the initial titer was negative, in two patients it was 1 : 32. Sixty patients could be reached by phone, and in 43 a second blood sample was available. There was seroconversion detectable in 4 instances, two of whom were asymptomatic, one had unspecific symptoms and one developed <b>lymphocytoma.</b> There were no manifestations of late stage disease in the study population. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the current recommendation of the Bundesgesundheitsamt (German Federal Health Institute) that generally antibiotic treatment after a tick bite is not necessary...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the number of cases and the {{clinical}} aspects of Lyme borreliosis in French-speaking Switzer- land. From July 1996 to December 1997, all laboratories performing serological tests for Lyme borreliosis sent a questionnaire to the treating physicians whenever the tests were positive. In addition, the physicians who diagnosed a case on clinical grounds only were also asked to report these cases. During this period, 1460 positive serological tests were recorded among approximately 10 360 performed (14 %). A total of 775 questionnaires were returned (53 %). In 3 ⁄ 4 of the cases, the test was ordered because of an acute clinical manifestation or a tick bite. The rest related to chronic symptoms or follow-up. In 504 cases (65 %), diagnosis was considered certain or probable. These were erythema migrans in 46 %, clinical manifestations of stage II in 33 % (26 facial palsy, 20 acute arthritis, 5 benign cutaneous <b>lymphocytoma)</b> and chronic symptoms in 21 % (23 acrodermatitis, 26 neuropathies, and 8 arthritis). The adjusted incidence, estimated on the basis of the treating physician’s place of residence, ranged from 9 / 100 000 in Valais to 95 / 100 000 in Neuchâtel.
