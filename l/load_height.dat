40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the influence of three significant parameters, namely, swirl flow, <b>loading</b> <b>height,</b> and semi-confined combustion flame, on thermal efficiency and CO emissions of a swirl flow gas burner. We focus particularly on the effects of swirl angle and inclination angle on the performance of the swirl flow burner. The results showed that the swirl flow burner yields higher thermal efficiency and emits lower CO concentration than those of the conventional radial flow burner. A greater swirl angle results in higher thermal efficiency and CO emission. With increasing <b>loading</b> <b>height,</b> the thermal efficiency increases but the CO emission decreases. For a lower <b>loading</b> <b>height</b> (2 or 3 [*]cm), the highest efficiency occurs at the inclination angle 15 °. On the other hand, at a higher <b>loading</b> <b>height,</b> 4 [*]cm, thermal efficiency increases with the inclination angle. Moreover, the addition of a shield can achieve a great increase in thermal efficiency, about 4 - 5 %, and a decrease in CO emissions for the same burner (swirl flow or radial flow) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the thermal {{efficiency}} {{of a conventional}} domestic burner is studied both experimentally and numerically for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and piped natural gas (PNG) fuels. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling of the steady-state flow, combustion and heat transfer to the vessel is reported {{for the first time}} in such burners. Based on the insights from the CFD model concerning the flow and heat transfer, design modifications in the form of a circular insert and a radiant sheet are proposed which are observed to increase thermal efficiency for LPG. For PNG, predictions showed that <b>loading</b> <b>height</b> was a much more important factor affecting efficiency than these design modifications and an optimal <b>loading</b> <b>height</b> could be identified. Experiments confirm these trends by showing an improvement in burner thermal efficiency of 2. 5 % for LPG with the modified design, and 10 % for PNG with the optimal <b>loading</b> <b>height,</b> demonstrating that the CFD modeling approach developed in the present work is a useful tool to study domestic burners.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a detailed investigation of effect of <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on buckling resistance of steel beams. Shapes that {{are intended to}} be used primarily as a beam are generally proportioned so that moment of inertia about the principal axis is considerably larger than that about minor axis. Hence monosymmetric sections are preferable. The lateral stability of beam subjected to transverse loading is very complicated in monosymmetric sections. The distance of transverse load from shear centre axis may significantly affect the buckling resistance of a simply supported beam. When transverse concentrated load W acts at (Yq-Yo) below the shear centre and moves with the beam it acts as an additional torque W(Yq-Yo) about shear centre which opposes twist and increases resistance to buckling. Conversely, when load above shear centre, additional torque increases the twist rotation and reduces buckling resistance of beam. To verify the effect of <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on buckling resistance, a simply supported beam subjected to concentrated and uniformly distributed load is considered. The effect of <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on buckling resistance has been plotted...|$|E

The effects of moment distribution between supports and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> {{with respect to}} shear center are examined using numerical and analytical methods.

A code comparison is performed comparing numeric results with those produced by AISC 360 to illustrate situations where issues occur in terms of strength prediction. A reliability analysis is performed from this data to quantify the difference in terms of the reliability index using a Monte Carlo Simulation. The results of the analysis show large discrepancies between the results produced by the code and those produced by the numerical analysis in circumstance where reverse curvature bending is apparent. Further, large discrepancies result when the load is positioned above the shear center of the member. This difference indicates a need for the code to change to have special provisions that handle the circumstances surrounding the load types studied and the <b>load</b> <b>height</b> effect.

It is necessary to build parametric dependence of power drive of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of <b>load,</b> lifting <b>height,</b> standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of band buckets elevators, the parametric dependences of power drive of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of <b>load</b> and <b>height</b> of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the lifting <b>height,</b> <b>load</b> type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator power drive are certain in a general view.

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{capacity of}} the new hollow flange steel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is limited by lateral distortional buckling, which is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion.

40|$|The {{flexural}} {{capacity of}} the new hollow flange steel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is limited by lateral distortional buckling for intermediate spans, which is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Recent research based on finite element analysis and testing has developed design rules for the member capacity of LiteSteel beams subject to this unique lateral distortional buckling. These design rules are limited to a uniform bending moment distribution. However, uniform bending moment conditions rarely exist in practice despite being considered as the worst case due to uniform yielding across the span. Loading position or <b>load</b> <b>height</b> is also known to have significant effects on the lateral buckling strength of beams. Therefore {{it is important to}} include the effects of these loading conditions in the assessment of LSB member capacities. Many steel design codes have adopted equivalent uniform moment distribution and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> factors for this purpose. But they were derived mostly based on data for conventional hot-rolled, doubly symmetric I-beams subject to lateral torsional buckling. In contrast LSBs are made of high strength steel and have a unique crosssection with specific residual stresses and geometrical imperfections along with a unique lateral distortional buckling mode. The moment distribution and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> effects for LSBs, and the suitability of the current steel design code methods to accommodate these effects for LSBs are not yet known. The research study presented in this thesis was therefore undertaken to investigate the effects of nonuniform moment distribution and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> on the lateral buckling strength of simply supported and cantilever LSBs. Finite element analyses of LSBs subject to lateral buckling formed the main component of this study. As the first step the original finite element model used to develop the current LSB design rules for uniform moment was improved to eliminate some of the modelling inaccuracies. The modified finite element model was validated using the elastic buckling analysis results from well established finite strip analysis programs. It was used to review the current LSB design curve for uniform moment distribution, based on which appropriate recommendations were made. The modified finite element model was further modified to simulate various loading and support configurations and used to investigate the effects of many commonly used moment distributions and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> for both simply supported and cantilever LSBs. The results were compared with the predictions based on the current steel code design rules. Based on these comparisons, appropriate recommendations were made on the suitability of the current steel code design methods. New design recommendations were made for LSBs subjected to non-uniform moment distributions and varying load positions. A number of LSB experiments was also undertaken to confirm the results of finite element analysis study. In summary the research reported in this thesis has developed an improved finite element model {{that can be used to}} investigate the buckling behaviour of LSBs for the purpose of developing design rules. It has increased the understanding and knowledge of simply supported and cantilever LSBs subject to non-uniform moment distributions and <b>load</b> <b>height</b> effects. Finally it has proposed suitable design rules for LSBs in the form of equations and factors within the current steel code design provisions. All of these advances have thus further enhanced the economical and safe design of LSBs...|$|E

40|$|Attempts {{to extend}} {{practical}} advanced {{analyses of the}} in-plane behaviour of 2 -D steel frames under in-plane loading to out-of-plane behaviour have been largely unsuccessful because of difficulties in modeling the effects of yielded zones, <b>load</b> <b>heights,</b> interactions between twist and axial force and moments, and end warping restraints. Advanced analyses {{need to be able}} to account for the influences of moment and axial force distributions, <b>load</b> <b>heights,</b> and end restraints on elastic and inelastic lateral buckling, and to be consistent with the code formulations of beam and column out-of-plane strengths. This paper reviews extensions of methods of advanced analysis beyond those for the in-plane behaviour of 2 -D frames for which local buckling is prevented towards the behaviour of 3 -D frames under general loading. An early step towards this goal is the development of an advanced analysis for the out-of-plane behaviour of 2 -D frames under in-plane loading. It has been proposed that this should be simplified by first carrying out an in-plane analysis using one of the presently available plastic hinge methods, and then by using a practical advanced analysis of the out-of-plane behaviour which is based on an inelastic lateral buckling analysis which includes allowances for residual stresses and initial crookednesses and twists. This paper discusses some of the difficulties to be overcome in the development of such a method, so that future attempts to develop advanced analyses for the lateral buckling of 2 -D frames for which local buckling is prevented can systematically assess these difficulties and develop methods of overcoming them. Suggestions are also made for testing and benchmarking these analyses. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
