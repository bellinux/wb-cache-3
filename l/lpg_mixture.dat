40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) simulation {{has been carried}} out to study the fuel and air mixing characteristics of a low pressure domestic gas appliance. Three types of liquefied petroleum gases (LPG), namely pure propane, pure butane and a mixture (by weight) of 30 % propane and 70 % butane, were simulated at a fuel pressure of 300 mm WG. The CFD results show that for the same fuel supply pressure and gas orifice size, the mass flow rate of LPG fuel discharged into a burner was proportionate to its specific gravity. However, as compared to butane and <b>LPG</b> <b>mixture,</b> the propane fuel discharge velocity was the highest due to its lowest specific gravity. This subsequently produced the most negative static pressure values at a burner mixing tube throat and hence allowing the largest amount of primary air to be induced into an appliance. The amount of primary air required to initiate combustion by propane, <b>LPG</b> <b>mixture</b> and butane fuels was predicted to be approximately 72 %, 61 % and 54 % of stoichiometric requirement, respectively. These values are in good agreement with a typical range of primary air requirement for this type of atmospheric burner. The mixing rates of propane-air system were predicted to be much faster than that of LPG mixture-air and butane-air systems. However, for all three types of LPG fuel, the fuel and air mixing was found to be almost complete in the second mixing tube. In addition, the average mass fraction of fuel at a burner input was predicted to be almost identical to that of burner outlet, thus demonstrating a fully-premixed capability of this type of atmospheric gas appliance...|$|E

Different engine exhaust emissions were compared using pure diesel, diesel-kerosene blends and air-LPG mixtures. With diesel-kerosene blends minimum exhaust emissions were observed at 30 % kerosene blend, when compared with pure diesel emissions. Slight increase in the NOx exhaust emission was observed. With air-LPG mixtures, minimum exhaust emissions were observed at 11 % LPG mixing. However, increase in NOx exhaust emission was observed. Engine performance improved and Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC) was observed to be minimal at 30 % kerosene blending and decreased as compared to pure diesel value at the same brake power output. SFC was also observed to be minimum at 11 % LPG mix and decreased by about 20 % as compared to pure diesel value at the same brake power output.

40|$|Synthesis gas (syngas), mainly {{constituted}} by carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H 2), is produced mostly through biomass gasification and methane reforming. In the last decade, the thermochemical route to produce ethanol and higher alcohols from syngas {{has been gaining}} space as a possible route to produce synthetic fuels and additives. This kind of process presents a series of advantages as: short-time reaction, abundant and lower-price feedstocks, the use of lignin and the almost complete conversion of syngas, having the potential to exceed ethanol production by fermentative route. Aiming to produce ethanol through thermochemical route, a singular process (a small-scale plant with capacity to process 100 kmol/h of syngas) was proposed for a first evaluation using the commercial simulator ASPEN Plus v 7. 3. Four different Rh-based catalysts were tested in the process (RhFe, RhLa, RhLaV, and RhLaFeV), trying {{to take advantage of}} the characteristics of Rh-based catalysts as high ethanol selectivity and hydrocarbons production.

40|$|Ozone {{depletion}} {{and global}} warming require replacement of chlorouo-rocarbon refrigerants like R 12. The hydrouorocarbonR 134 a is nonammable, difcult to synthesize, has zero ozone depletion and high global warming. LPG refrigerants are highly ammable, occur naturally, have zero ozone de-pletion and negligible global warming. In Germany, most new refrigerators use R 600 a and many heat pumps and air conditioners now use R 290 with measured energy consumption 10 to 20 % lower than R 12, R 134 a or R 22. <b>LPG</b> <b>mixtures</b> have successfully replaced R 12 and R 134 a in over 100, 000 US car air-conditioners. Abboud (1994) measured the air-conditioner performance of ve popu-lar Australian cars with R 12 and then <b>LPG</b> <b>mixtures</b> in our laboratory. He recommended 60 % by mass commercial propane from Bass Strait and 40 % commercial butane. This gave typically 10 % more cooling than R 12 with satisfactory superheat and typically 8 % higher condenser pressure. Refrigerant property parameters show that R 600 a has half the leakage, pressure loss and condenser pressure and double the heat transfer properties of R 12 and R 134 a. This explains the energy consumption savings of R 600 a refrigerators. Redesign of heat pumps and car air-conditioners for R 600 a could yield greater benets. The insurance risk increment from LPG ammability for domestic re-frigerators is zero. The increment for car air-conditioners is negative {{because of the high}} cost of R 12 and R 134 a repairs. For large systems, ventilation of plantrooms and other LPG safety precautions can make insurance risk incre-ment zero or negative if required...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric ozone {{is formed}} in the {{atmosphere}} {{by a series of}} reactions involving volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}). While NOx emissions are primarily composed of only two compounds, nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO{sub 2 }), there are hundreds of different VOCs being emitted. In general, VOCs promote ozone formation, however, the rate and extent of ozone produced by the individual VOCs varies considerably. For example, it is widely acknowledged that formaldehyde (HCHO) is a very reactive VOC, and produces ozone rapidly and efficiently under most conditions. On the other hand, VOCs such as methane, ethane, propane, and methanol do not react as quickly, and are likely to form less urban ozone than a comparable mass of HCHO. The difference in ozone forming potential is one of the bases for the use of alternative fuels.

40|$|Hydrogen is a {{promising}} renewable fuel for producing energy in transportation and domestic applications. This study investigates {{the production of}} H 2 from reforming of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). LPG {{is a mixture of}} gases, mainly propane and butane, produced from petroleum or natural gas. It is a liquid under moderate pressure and therefore a favourable feedstock for distributed hydrogen production since it is easy to store and transport with a distribution network already in place. With its wide range of propane and butane compositions world wide, in this study LPG was considered as a mixture of propane and butane. H 2 production from LPG was investigated through oxidative steam reforming of propane and butane. Oxidative steam reforming (OSR) {{can be viewed as a}} combination of two reactions: partial oxidation (PO) and steam reforming (SR). By carefully controlling the steam to carbon (S/C) and oxygen to carbon (O 2 /C) ratios in the feed, OSR can produce higher H 2 yields than PO at operational temperatures lower than SR. In the first part of this study, based on the literature and preliminarily experiments, two Ni based bimetallic catalysts, Pt-Ni/Al 2 O 3 and Mo-Ni/Al 2 O 3, were selected to be compared to a monometallic 15 wt% Ni/Al 2 O 3 catalyst for OSR of a 1 : 1 propane to butane <b>LPG</b> <b>mixture</b> under different operational conditions. This catalysts screening study evaluated the performance of the catalysts on the basis of a statistical factorial experimental design. The factorial design was efficient in optimizing experimental runs, while testing the activity and product distribution of the catalysts at different operational limits. The importance of the factorial design was clearer when analyzing results for the Pt-Ni catalysts, as the catalyst showed different product compositions at the two selected loadings (0. 2 and 1 wt%) under different conditions compared to the unpromoted catalyst. However, at both loadings, the Pt-Ni catalyst did not have a significant effect on fuel conversion or catalyst selectivity to different products. On the other had, under all stable conditions in the factorial design experiments, the Ni-Mo catalyst had higher H 2 and CO yields and lower CH 4 yields compared to the unpromoted catalyst. To our knowledge these product composition variations were not reported before in the literature for hydrocarbon reforming reactions over Mo promoted catalysts. The catalyst screening study also included time on stream catalysts stability tests. These experiments illustrated the high potential for solving the Ni stability problem associated with LPG reforming as the unpromoted 15 Ni catalyst suffered from deactivation by coking and could not sustain its high conversion. On the other hand, promoting the Ni catalysts with 1 wt% Pt or 0. 1 wt% Mo improved the catalyst resistance to coking and sustained its activity and product composition throughout the 18 hours of the stability tests. However, an increase in the Mo loading to 0. 3 wt% in the Mo-Ni bimetallic catalyst, led to lower fuel conversions and loss of stability with time. Because of the interesting performance of the Mo-Ni /Al 2 O 3 catalyst observed in the catalyst screening tests, and the lack of explanations of different aspects of this performance in the literature, especially in the presence of O 2, the second part of the study was concerned with the investigation of the effect of small amounts of Mo addition on the activity, selectivity and stability of Ni catalysts when used for H 2 production from LPG OSR. Individual fuels and reactions experiments showed that butane OSR gave the highest fuel conversions and H 2 production rates. These experiments also revealed the importance of O 2 for the catalyst activity and stability as for both hydrocarbons the catalyst suffered deactivation by coking under SR conditions. However, O 2 compositions in the feed should be carefully optimized as characterization of fresh and aged catalysts showed that the loss of stability observed earlier in the catalyst screening tests for higher Mo catalysts loading, was caused by the oxidation of active Ni species to inactive Ni and Ni-Mo phases which resulted from the oxidative environment of the reaction during aging. In the last part of this study, surface and bulk properties of the monometallic Ni catalyst was compared to the Mo-Ni bimetallic catalyst using different catalyst characterization techniques (TPR, TPO, TGA, XRD, H 2 and O 2 chemisorption and DRIFTS) in order to understand the structural effect of Mo addition on the catalytic properties. It was found that the improvements in the catalytic properties of the catalyst and the change in its selectivity to different products were caused by an electronic effect of Mo and its different oxide phases on Ni species. These electronic effects enhanced the O 2 mobility over the catalysts surface leading to higher gasification rates of CHx species and hence, preventing coking of the catalyst. They also affected the stability of adsorbed reaction intermediates over the catalysts surface which affected the selectivity of the catalyst to different reaction products...|$|E

50|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (<b>LPG)</b> is a <b>mixture</b> of several hydrocarbons, mainly propane, butane and ethane. The gas mixes readily with air, allowing for more complete combustion. The fuel {{costs less than}} regular gasoline, but LPG has lower energy per unit volume, so its fuel economy and efficiency are lower. LPG gives a longer engine life due to its clean burning characteristics. The main difference between these vehicles and others is in their fuel storage systems. LPG is a gas at room temperature, but a liquid when pressurized (the required pressure varies according to {{the composition of the}} mixture). It is usually stored at around 10 bar. One drawback is that LPG fuel tanks are much heavier than conventional ones, hence two tanks would be needed, which would increase the vehicle's weight. Many automobile manufacturers make vehicles that run on LPG and gasoline. Some say that LPG is the least environmentally friendly alternative fuel, because it is derived from fossil fuels, so that greenhouse gases will inevitably be released into the atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} effects of the repeated solid obstacles on the propagation of premixed flames. Pressure, speed of the flame front as well as structure of reaction zones are studied for three fuels; hydrogen, liquefied petroleum gas, LPG and compressed natural gas, CNG. Two equivalence ratios are examined for each fuel using eighteen different configurations of three baffle plates and two obstacles with a square cross-section having blockage ratios of either 0. 24 or 0. 5. For CNG and <b>LPG</b> fuel <b>mixtures</b> two equivalence ratios of 1. 0 and 0. 8 are studied while for H 2 /air, lean mixtures of Ф = 0. 7 and 0. 8 are only used and this {{is limited by the}} excessive overpressures. The results show that the peak pressure and its rate of change can be increased by increasing the blockage ratio or by decreasing the space between successive baffles. This was found to be of use for all gases, but the peak pressure and its rate of change were an order of magnitude higher for hydrogen flames than for LPG or CNG flames. This is consistent with differences in the laminar flame speeds of these fuels. As illustrated by the high speed images of LIF-OH, the degree of wrinkling and contortion in the flame front increase as the blockages increase. The images also show how the flame front relaminarises with increasing distances between obstacles, which accounts for the pressure decrease with increasing separation. It is also found that more than one obstacle is needed to achieve a turbulent flame structure with intense corrugations. Based on the images, hydrogen flames result in less wrinkled flame fronts than CNG and LPG after propagating past the same sequence of obstacles.

The first group, considered as low-carbon-content fuels can be characterized by low CO 2 emissions. Flammability of hydrogen added in those mixtures realizes the function of the combustion process activator. Thus, hydrogen addition improves energy conversion by about 3 %.

The influence of initial temperature of the mixture (changing in the range of 293 – 473 K) on the fundamental explosion parameters was also investigated. The ignition source was an induction electrical spark. It was stated, that the increase of initial temperature of the LPG-air mixture causes a significant increase of the explosion range. From the experimental result, the concentration of <b>LPG</b> and air <b>mixture</b> just explodes at the range 2 % to 10 % of LPG in air.

40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas or LPG has well acknowledged as an attractive source of fuel in these centuries {{as it has}} provided us evidence {{to be the most}} effective and environmental friendly among all other fuel existed. However,like the other fuel,LPG also has its own benefits and drawbacks at when it is inadequately treated can be destructive to us. After knowing the characteristics of LPG and recognizing suitable ways of reducing risks in storage, handling and transportation of it, an appropriately planned experiment has been carried out. Specifically,this study is conducted to study the effect of carbon dioxide (CO 2) to the Lower Flammability Limit(LFL) and Upper Flammability Limit (UFL) of LPG. LFL and UFL create a range at which explosion may occur to any flammable substance. By adding diluents (in this case isCO 2) to the LPG-air mixture,the range was predicted to be narrowed down because the role of diluents to the mixture is to reduce the concentration of oxygen(O 2) existed in the mixture to a level where explosion can be stopped.
