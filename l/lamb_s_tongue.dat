40|$|Prenatal {{growth is}} {{sensitive}} to the direct and indirect effects of maternal dietary intake; manipulation can lead to behavioural and physiological changes of the offspring later in life. Here, we report on three aspects of how a high-salt diet during pregnancy (conception to parturition) may affect the offspring’s response to high oral salt loads: (i) dietary preferences for salt; (ii) response to salt and water balance and aldosterone and arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations after an oral salt challenge; (iii) concentrations of insulin and leptin after an oral salt challenge. We used two groups of lambs born to ewes fed either a high-salt (13 % NaCl) diet during pregnancy (S lambs; n = 12) or control animals born to ewes fed a conventional (0. 5 % NaCl) diet during pregnancy (C lambs; n = 12). Lambs were subjected to short- (5 min) and long-term (24 h) preference tests for a high-salt (13 % NaCl) or control diet, and the response to an oral challenge with either water or 25 % NaCl solution were also carried out. Weaned lambs born to ewes fed high salt during pregnancy {{did not differ in}} their preference for dietary salt, but they did differ in their physiological responses to an oral salt challenge. Results indicate that these differences reflect an alteration in the regulation of water and salt balance as the metabolic hormones, insulin and leptin, were not affected. During the first 2 h after a single salt dose, <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> had a 25 % lower water intake compared to the C <b>lambs.</b> <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> had, on average, a 13 % lower AVP concentration than the C lambs (P = 0. 014). The plasma concentration of aldosterone was higher in the <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> than in the C lambs (P = 0. 013). Results suggest that lambs born to ewes that ingest high amounts of salt during pregnancy are programmed to have an altered thirst threshold, and blunted response in aldosterone to oral salt loads.

The event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) for the mu rhythm (8 – 13 Hz) and beta (13 − 25 Hz) bands were measured. Tongue thrust observation induced mu rhythm ERD, and the ERD was detected at the left hemisphere regardless whether the observed tongue thrust was toward the left or right.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{detailed}} description of several experiments which have been previously reported in several letters: the determination of the 1 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shift in hydrogen by a comparison of the frequencies of the 1 S{ 3 S and 2 S{ 6 S or 2 S{ 6 D two-photon transitions, and the measurement of the 2 S{ 8 S/D and 2 S{ 12 D optical frequencies. Following a complete study of the lineshape of the two-photon transitions, we provide the updated values of these frequencies which have been used in the 1998 adjustment of the fundamental constants. From an analysis taking into account these results and several other precise measurements by other authors, we show that the optical frequency measurements have superseded the microwave determination of the 2 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shift and we deduce optimized values for the Rydberg constant, R 1 = 109 737. 315 685 50 (84) cm− 1 (relative uncertainty of 7 : 7 10 − 12) and for the 1 S and 2 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shifts L(1 <b>S)</b> = 8 172. 840 (22) MHz and L(2 S{ 2 P) = 1 057. 8450 (29) MHz (respectively, 8 183. 970 (22) MHz and 1 059. 2341 (29) MHz for deuterium).

40|$|Most {{research}} {{to date has}} focused on non-pregnant sheep grazing saltbush to fill the summer/autumn feed gap in temperate regions of southern Australia. However, the summer/autumn period coincides with late pregnancy for autumn- or winter-lambing ewes, and feeding saltbush may reduce the amount and cost of supplementary feed that is required to meet the energy demands of late pregnancy. The challenge of dealing with a high-salt diet may be exacerbated during pregnancy since pregnancy is a salt-retaining physiological state, yet a high-salt intake requires an increase in mechanisms to excrete salt. The effect of high dietary salt on the developing foetus(es) has been studied in rodent models, but less so in sheep. Hence the aims of this thesis were to determine whether pregnant ewes can manage a high dietary salt content resembling that found in saltbush, and whether there are consequences to the offspring’s physiological responses to ingested salt. Merino ewes were synchronized for ovulation and artificially inseminated. To mimic the concentration of salt in animals grazing saltbush-based pastures in summer and autumn, a diet of 13 % NaCl was fed from insemination through to parturition. It was found that pregnant ewes can be fed a 13 % NaCl diet and manage the physiological conflict of high salt and pregnancy by decreasing their aldosterone concentrations and increasing their water consumption. There was no effect of high dietary salt on pregnancy rates, lamb birth weights, lamb survival or milk composition (fat and protein percentages). A series of experiments were conducted to test if the high-salt intake of ewes during pregnancy {{was associated with a}} change in the dietary preference for salt and/or changes in physiological responses to ingested salt in the offspring (‘S lambs’ vs. control, ‘C lambs’). C <b>lambs</b> and <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> were exposed to short- and long-term preference testing to determine if there were differences in their voluntary selection for salt in their diet. There {{were no significant differences in}} dietary salt preference between C and <b>S</b> <b>lambs.</b> The lambs were subjected to salt 'challenges' (oral dose of 40 g NaCl in 25 % w/v solution) from 3 - 10 months of age and their water intake, urinary output, sodium excretion and hormone concentrations were measured over the ensuing 23 hours, and compared against counterparts dosed with an equal volume of water without salt. Following the initial salt challenge further experiments were conducted with slight alterations; water intake was manipulated immediately following the salt challenge; two consecutive salt challenges, 8 hours apart, were administered; and C and <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> were offered salty water (1. 5 % NaCl) over a period of two days. The results of these salt challenge experiments showed that C and <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> excreted a salt load at a similar rate, but they differed in the magnitude of changes in water intake and hormone concentrations required to achieve sodium homeostasis. <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> were able excrete sodium at the same rate as C lambs but without decreasing aldosterone concentrations to the same extent and whilst consuming 400 mL less water in the first two hours post challenge. The aldosterone results suggested a lowered responsiveness to aldosterone and the lower water consumption suggested an altered thirst threshold. The experiment in which water consumption was manipulated suggested that when the supply or access to fresh water is limited, the capacity to remove a salt load is likely to be less impaired in <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> than C lambs; <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> were able to excrete the salt load faster than the C lambs when the availability of drinking water was limited. From the experiment in which lambs were treated with two consecutive salt challenges, the rate of sodium excretion increased after the second dose, but there remained no difference in the rate of excretion between C and S lambs; all animals were able to excrete 95 % of the administered dose of sodium within 23 hours. The final experiment in which animals were given salty water (1. 5 % NaCl) for a period of two days showed consistent results with the previous experiments for water consumption and aldosterone concentrations between C and <b>S</b> <b>lambs.</b> There was no difference in sodium excretion between C and <b>S</b> <b>lambs.</b> A novel finding was a markedly lower voluntary feed intake in <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> than C lambs. Although mechanisms for this are unknown, it may have profound effects on the productivity of the animals. The experiments reported in this thesis provide new information of relevance to pregnant ewes grazing halophytic forages. It is apparent that they can withstand a high NaCl content typical, of a saltbush-based pasture. Further work is warranted to conclude whether high salt during pregnancy is (i) beneficial to the offspring in regards to a higher capacity to deal with excess salt under farming conditions and (ii) consistently associated with a lower voluntary feed intake of the offspring.
