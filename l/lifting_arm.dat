40|$|A {{transportation}} robot's <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> have {{an effect}} on the comfort and safety of patients. Improved arms have been designed through dynamic and static analyses to increase safety if a sheet not present on the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms.</b> To design the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms,</b> experimentation is very helpful, however, it is difficult and dangerous to experiment on patients; therefore, a simple human model was made and used for the dynamic analysis. Through the dynamic analysis results, a safe width and comfortable location for the <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> were determined. The thickness was then determined by static analysis and optimum design. In addition, tests have been conducted to confirm comfort and safety by deploying the designed <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> onto a transportation robot...|$|R

50|$|Problems often {{arise in}} {{incorporating}} a Walschaerts valve gear {{into the design}} of tank and narrow gauge locomotives because of space limitations. The reversing rod (with its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm),</b> needed to change between forward and reverse running, is therefore mounted {{at the same level}} as the pivot of the expansion link. This enables the lifting link (German: Hängeeisen) to be dispensed with, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> to be connected directly to the radius rod. To ensure the required horizontal movement, the back end of the radius rod is designed as a slide (the 'Kuhn slide') which fits into a rotatable crosshead (Gleitstein) in the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E

Terminal Frenzy had attempted to right itself when it earlier came up against Biohazard, but failed to do so. The next year Vlad the Impaler fought Biohazard again, and the former used its special pneumatic <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> to self-right numerous times, yet it still lost the judge's decision.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fifth}} match, The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, and Braun Strowman) faced Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose and their mystery partner, who was {{revealed}} to be Chris Jericho. In the climax, Reigns went for a Spear on Strowman but Jericho tagged himself in and performed a Lionsault on Strowman for a near-fall. Jericho attempted a Codebreaker but Strowman countered, executed a Yokosuka Cutter and then applied a <b>Lifting</b> <b>Arm</b> Triangle Choke on Jericho.

50|$|BioHazard is {{a combat}} robot built by Carlo Bertocchini. It {{was the most}} {{successful}} robot in the heavyweight division of BattleBots. It originally competed in the U.S. Robot Wars where it won 2 heavyweight division titles. It {{went on to win}} 4 BattleBots championships. BioHazard's weapon is an electric four-bar <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> (technically, an asymmetric linear actuator) used to lift other robots. For much of its reign it was notorious for being difficult to attack and get under due to hinged titanium wedge skirts on all sides and low profile (4 inches tall). BioHazard initially retired in 2002 with a record of 37 head-to-head wins and three losses.|$|E
5000|$|After Storm 2 kick-started its {{campaign}} of the Series 7 championship by throwing The Steel Avenger {{out of the}} arena in its Heat Final, Storm 2 met three times Grand Finalist Firestorm 5 {{in the second round}} of the semi-final. Storm 2 dominated the match by utilising Firestorm's poor pushing power to eventually pit its opponent. However, Storm 2 was almost disqualified on a technicality — it hadn't fired its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> once during the fight; therefore, the producers argued that Storm 2 should be put out of the competition because of it breaking the [...] "active weapons" [...] rule. The judges refused, and Storm 2 reached the Grand Final.|$|E
50|$|Flipper - Although {{mechanically}} {{resembling a}} lifter, the flipper uses much {{higher levels of}} pneumatic power to fire the <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> or panel explosively upward. An effective flipper can throw opponents end-over-end through the air causing damage from the landing impact or, in Robot Wars, toss it {{completely out of the}} arena. Flippers use a large volume of compressed gas and often have a limited number of effective attacks before their supply runs low. The two-time Robot Wars champion Chaos 2 and BattleBots superheavyweight champion Toro were flippers. While most flippers operate with the pneumatic arm hinged at the machine's rear, Robot Wars' Firestorm achieved remarkable success with a front-hinged flipper, placing third in Robot Wars on three separate occasions (Series 3, 5, and 6) and never failing to advance to the series' semifinal rounds.|$|E

The Scheepsdalebrug (Scheepsdalebridge) in Brugge and the Sint-Annabrug over the river Dender in Aalst. The former combines the working mechanisms of a rolling lift bascule bridge and a tilt bridge: the bridge is mounted on two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> which roll along racks, positioned parallel to the navigable way, tilting up the bridge leaf providing a clearance for passing ships. The latter is mounted on two <b>lifting</b> <b>arms</b> which are connected to fixed pivot points a few feet downstream from the bridge leaf.|$|R

Strowman had his first televised singles match on the August 31 episode of Raw, when he defeated Ambrose via disqualification. Strowman wrestled in his first pay-per-view event match at Night of Champions on September 20, where The Wyatt Family defeated Ambrose, Reigns and Chris Jericho in a six-man tag team match after Jericho passed out to Strowman's <b>lifting</b> <b>arm</b> triangle choke. At TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 13, The Wyatt Family defeated The ECW Originals (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley (collectively known as The Dudley Boyz), Rhyno and Tommy Dreamer) in a eight-man tag team elimination tables match.|$|E
50|$|Storm 2 (commonly {{known as}} Storm II) is a robot that {{competed in the}} British {{television}} game show Robot Wars. It was a small invertible box-shaped robot with a wedge on the front. The robot was originally built with no weapons but the team was asked to add an active weapon {{in order to take}} part in the seventh series, so the team came up with a built-in <b>lifting</b> <b>arm,</b> very similar to the American robot BioHazard. However, it was not the weapon but the immense speed and power of the robot that did the most damage to its opponents, managing to throw The Steel Avenger out of the Arena in its Series 7 heat final. The robot competed in the seventh series of Robot Wars, winning The Third World Championship at the end of the series, having won the 16th seed into the competition by being victorious in the New Blood Championship of Extreme 2.|$|E
5000|$|Storm 2's next {{battle was}} to prove {{one of the}} most {{controversial}} of all. Storm 2 charged into Typhoon 2 and used its <b>lifting</b> <b>arm.</b> Typhoon 2 ran away, before smashing part of the arena wall. The plan was to edit out this part of the fight as if it never happened, although Typhoon 2 refused to spin, so Mentorn allowed Typhoon 2 to repair. Team Storm were surprised at this, but once the wall was fixed, the fight carried on much the same (although the part of the fight showing Typhoon 2 careering into the wall was still shown in the televised fight) until, at the end of the fight, a small panel fell off Storm 2. Cease was called, and, after a difficult judges decision, Typhoon 2 was given the win. Team Storm were deeply annoyed by this, especially since Typhoon 2 was listed as [...] "no damage", despite the fact that its drive chains were scattered all over the arena floor. Team Storm were also saddened by the fact that the show concentrated on Storm 2's aforementioned panel and not Typhoon 2's drive chains, despite losing the latter having a larger difference than losing a small panel. Some Storm 2 supporters called for Gary Cairns, captain of Team Typhoon, to hand his trophy to Team Storm, but the decision stood. The booing from the crowd (save for the small group of Typhoon 2 supporters, who were cheering in delight) was so loud that Mentorn had to add canned applause to hide the booing.|$|E
5000|$|In German philosophy, {{the concept}} was used by Christian Wolff (philosopher) and Immanuel Kant to {{denounce}} illegitimate claims to empiricity of representations: I can perceive the formation of my will to <b>lift</b> my <b>arm,</b> and I can perceive the <b>lifting</b> of my <b>arm.</b> To say that I know empirically that my will <b>lifted</b> my <b>arm</b> would be a subreption in Wolff's sense.|$|R

5000|$|Coding was {{accomplished}} via mechanical <b>lift</b> <b>arms</b> and latching bails {{added to the}} typewriter's existing mechanical linkages in place for print-action. When a key was depressed, up to 8 affiliated <b>lift</b> <b>arms</b> were [...] "caught" [...] on latching bails which in turn connected 8 coding switches to the recording head. A commutator, powered by the internal drive motor, would momentarily complete the power circuit through the coding switches to the recording head before advancing the tape to the next recording position. When not encoding, a resistor balance network kept the recording head in an erase mode unless a rewind operation was commanded. This ensured a clearly defined magnetic space between bit patterns. Additional circuits prevented opening of the tape loading door once a tape was loaded.|$|R
