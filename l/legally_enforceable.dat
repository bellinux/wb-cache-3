5|$|On 10 March 1936, {{the pianist}} John Tobin gave a {{performance}} of Pars prima from Opus clavicembalisticum. This performance was highly inadequate, as it lasted {{twice as long as}} it should have. Sorabji left before it finished, and later denied having attended it. He gave his last public performance of his music on 16 December 1936 in Glasgow, when he premiered his Piano Toccata No. 2, and afterwards withdrew from the concert platform {{for the rest of his}} life. He later banned unauthorised performances of his music, but it remains unclear when he did so; Paul Rapoport has argued that it was probably in 1938 or 1939, but Sorabji's first announcement of it dates from 1944. Although the ban was not <b>legally</b> <b>enforceable,</b> Sorabji presented it so sharply and decisively that, for the most part, he achieved his aim. The shift in Sorabji's attitude to public performances of his music has generally been ascribed to Tobin's performance, but this explanation has also been described as simplistic. Apart from misleading reviews of his works by music critics, the deaths of people who were important to him (Busoni, Warlock, and Bernard van Dieren), the silence of Sibelius, the changes in Szymanowski's style, and the increasing prominence of Stravinsky and the late Schoenberg have all been put forward as catalysts for his decision to isolate himself from the world of music. The financial implications of his father's death have also been cited as an important factor.|$|E

Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a <b>legally</b> <b>enforceable</b> and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child.

Algorithm 1 detects the different types of conflict we have defined using recursive search as defined in Algorithm 2. Note that in Algorithm 2, we allow the execution of parallel actions; otherwise, we can use constraints to specify the actions which cannot be done in parallel. These constraints can be compiled into precondition axioms of these actions [22]. In this work and to simplify, we omit the use of constraints. Note that we suppose that if a situation we check is globally <b>enforceable</b> (respectively <b>legally</b> globally <b>enforceable),</b> then this situation must be executable (respectively permitted). Proving that a situation is executable (respectively permitted) can be done using regression [23], where testing is reduced to proving first-order theorem in the initial situation.|$|R

25|$|Many of {{the most}} {{important}} rights were codified in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in 2000. While the UK has opted out of direct application of the Charter, this has little practical relevance since the Charter merely reflected pre-existing principles and the Court of Justice uses the Charter to interpret all EU law. For example, in Test-Achats ASBL v Conseil des ministres, the Court of Justice held that Equal Treatment in Goods and Services Directive 2004 article 5(2), which purported to allow a derogation from equal treatment, so men and women could be charged different car insurance rates, was unlawful. It contravened the principle of equality in CFREU 2000 articles 21 and 23, and had to be regarded as ineffective after a transition period. By contrast, in Deutsches Weintor eG v Land Rheinland-Pfalz wine producers claimed that a direction to stop marketing their brands as 'easily digestible' (bekömmlich) by the state food regulator (acting under EU law) contravened their right to occupational and business freedom under CFREU 2000 articles 15 and 16. The Court of Justice held that in fact, the right to health for consumers in article 35 has also to be taken into account, and was to be given greater weight, particularly given the health effects of alcohol. Some rights in the Charter, however, are not expressed with sufficient clarity to be regarded as directly binding. In AMS v Union locale des syndicats CGT a French trade union claimed that the French Labour Code should not exclude casual workers from counting toward the right to set up a work council that an employing entity must inform and consult. They said this contravened the Information and Consultation of Employees Directive and also CFREU article 27. The Court of Justice agreed that the French Labour Code was incompatible with the Directive, but held that article 27 was expressed too generally to create direct rights. On this view, legislation was necessary to make abstract human rights principles concrete, and <b>legally</b> <b>enforceable.</b>|$|E

Available Online at: [URL] the legal documents capturing the formal agreements between people, parties or groups are often of little interest to project managers. Devised by solicitors and lawyers, they tend to emphasise the enforcement of promise-based obligations to perform a particular duty, supply certain goods, provide a given service or commit a specific act. Contracts are typically phrased in a legal language that endeavours to identify all contingencies and deliver a <b>legally</b> binding and <b>enforceable</b> agreement. The Sixth Edition of the APM Body of Knowledge focuses on contracts under the Resource Management section, which {{is concerned with the}} acquisition and deployment of internal and external resources required for delivering the project or programme. The APM Body of Knowledge defines contracts as the ???agreement made between two or more parties that creates legally binding obligations between them ??? and sets out those obligations and the actions that can be taken if they are not met??? (p. 202). Contracts are covered by contract law, governed and determined by local jurisdiction. The Body of Knowledge therefore recommends that specialist advice should be sought to interpret and understand the legal ramifications of the contract. Given that contracts are invoked when actions, goods or services are required from outside the host organisation, local legal experts need to be involved in drafting the contracts and interpreting their implications. The fifth edition of the PMI Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge includes a wider knowledge area focused on project procurement management, which is defined as the ???processes necessary to purchase or acquire the products, services or results needed from outside the project team???.

40|$|The IASB {{has issued}} a Discussion Paper on {{accounting}} for insurance and reinsurance contracts. This project {{is based on a}} prospective measurement of the insurance liabilities, the current exit value, which corresponds to a “market consistent” transfer value of insurance contracts to another market participant. This project is similar to the Elaborated Principles (the EPs) proposed by the CFO Forum in June 2006 : a single model for measuring the insurance liabilities based on a three building blocks approach: expected future cash flows, discounted at risk-free rate, plus a margin for risk and uncertainties. However, there are key major differences between the two. Those differences concern several areas: future cash flows (only cash flows which are <b>legally</b> or contractually <b>enforceable</b> would be recognized), “market consistent” approach (in particular estimation of expenses should be based on a theoretical level of efficiency rather than on the own costs of the insurer), service margin (according to the IASB, to be transferred to another market participant), and upfront profit recognition of initial margins (rather than over time as for other long-term services). The European insurers disagree with the IASB view that such service margin concept is relevant. They also disagree that the retail market and the wholesale market for insurance would be the same. They think there is a significant difference between entry and exit prices, that is, a significant initial profit. The insurers are concerned by the consequences of those proposals, which would lead to a non-economic valuation of the insurance liabilities and a flawed pattern of profit recognition. Since the measurement of assets and liabilities in Solvency II project should be based on IFRS, the IASB accounting for insurance project could jeopardize Solvency II, which is currently based on an economic balance sheet approach. The CFO Forum has been supporting a market consistent measurement of liabilities for accounting purposes that is the same as proposed under Solvency II. The CFO Forum is considering alternatives for recognition of profit over the time of contracts when the risk is released and the services rendered to policyholders; these alternatives should be consistent with recognition of the initial profit margin as available capital for solvency requirements.

40|$|During {{the past}} twenty years, few marine {{conservation}} issues have aroused as much public interest as the drowning of dolphins in purse seine nets. For a generation that grew up watching the playful antics of Flipper on television, graphic video footage of dolphins hauled to their deaths in tuna nets was simply too much to stomach. Led by American school children and their 2 ̆ 2 baby-boomer 2 ̆ 2 parents, consumer boycotts of tuna spurred tuna harvesters and Congress to adopt measures requiring 2 ̆ 2 dolphin safe 2 ̆ 2 labeling and prohibiting the importation of non-dolphin-safe tuna into the United States. Since the adoption of these measures, the number of dolphins killed in the ETP tuna fishery has dramatically declined. Curiously, however, encirclement of dolphins by tuna fishers occurs as frequently today as it did before the adoption of 2 ̆ 2 dolphin safe 2 ̆ 2 restrictions. In a remarkable display of innovation and commitment to solving an environmental problem and a public-relations nightmare, ETP tuna fishers have perfected fishing methods that allow the encirclement and safe release of dolphins while tuna are caught. Despite this progress, however, tuna caught in this manner are still not considered 2 ̆ 2 dolphin safe. 2 ̆ 2 Moreover, tuna from other nations which allow encirclement and safe release are still embargoed under U. S. law. Faced with this situation, on October 4, 1995, twelve nations adopted the Panama Declaration. This blueprint for developing a <b>legally</b> binding and <b>enforceable</b> agreement within the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) is intended to further reduce and eventually eliminate dolphin deaths caused by tuna fishing operations. The Panama Declaration forms the basis for an international agreement that will provide protection for individual dolphin stocks and species to ensure their continued growth and recovery. It will also help reduce the incidental capture of other marine life, such as sea turtles, sharks, and billfish. Finally, the Panama Declaration adopts measures designed to guarantee the sustained health of the tuna fishery and the marine ecosystem of the ETP. Impeding implementation of the Panama Declaration, however, {{is the definition of}} 2 ̆ 2 dolphin safe. 2 ̆ 2 The implementation of the Panama Declaration calls for 2 ̆ 2 dolphin safe 2 ̆ 2 to be re-defined from its current meaning of 2 ̆ 2 no encirclement of dolphins 2 ̆ 2 to a more meaningful definition of 2 ̆ 2 no dolphin mortality. 2 ̆ 2 Legislation introduced in Congress to implement the Panama Declaration, which proposes to change the definition of 2 ̆ 2 dolphin safe, 2 ̆ 2 has resulted in a heated debate-one which pits the Clinton Administration, the fishing industry, several national environmental groups, and a bipartisan coalition in Congress against an array of animal welfare and environmental organizations, Hollywood stars, and their congressional allies.
