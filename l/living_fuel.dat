6000|$|I. There being {{three great}} classes of {{mechanical}} powers at our disposal, namely, (a) vital or muscular power; (b) natural mechanical power of wind, water, and electricity; and (c) artificially produced mechanical power; {{it is the}} first principle of economy to use all available vital power first, then the inexpensive natural forces, and only at last have recourse to artificial power. And this because it is always better for a man to work with his own hands to feed and clothe himself, than to stand idle while a machine works for him; and if he cannot by all the labor healthily possible to him feed and clothe himself, then it is better to use an inexpensive machine--as a windmill or watermill--than a costly one like a steam-engine, so long as we have natural force enough at our disposal. Whereas at present we continually hear economists regret that the water-power of the cascades or streams of a country should be lost, but hardly ever that the muscular power of its idle inhabitants should be lost; and, again, we see vast districts, as the south of Provence, where a strong wind* blows steadily all day long for six days out of seven throughout the year, without a windmill, while men are continually employed at a hundred miles to the north, in digging fuel to obtain artificial power. But the principal point of all to be kept in view is, that in every idle arm and shoulder throughout the country there is a certain quantity of force, equivalent to the force of so much fuel; and that it is mere insane waste to dig for coal for our force, while the vital force is unused, and not only unused, but in being so, corrupting and polluting itself. We waste our coal, and spoil our humanity at one and the same instant. Therefore, wherever there is an idle arm, always save coal with it, and the stores of England will last all the longer. And precisely the same argument answers the common one about [...] "taking employment {{out of the hands of}} the industrious laborer." [...] Why, what is [...] "employment" [...] but the putting out of vital force instead of mechanical force? We are continually in search of means to pull, to hammer, to fetch, to carry. We waste our future resources to get this strength, while we leave all the <b>living</b> <b>fuel</b> to burn itself out in mere pestiferous breath, and production of its variously noisome forms of ashes! Clearly, if we want fire for force, we want men for force first. The industrious hands must already have so much to do that they can do no more, or else we need not use machines to help them. Then use the idle hands first. Instead of dragging petroleum with a steam-engine, put it on a canal, and drag it with human arms and shoulders. Petroluem cannot possibly be in a hurry to arrive anywhere. We can always order that, and many other things, time enough before we want it. So, the carriage of everything which does not spoil by keeping may most wholesomely and safely be done by water-traction and sailing-vessels; and no healthier work can men be put to, nor better discipline, than such active porterage.|$|E

40|$|In {{terms of}} its biodiversity, the Mediterranean area {{is one of the}} most {{important}} regions in the world. In recent years this area has often been affected by forest fires. Forest fires are the most important and most powerful environmental factor causing changes (Trabaud 1991, Casal 1985, 1993 Calvo, Le Houerou 1993, Pyne et al. 1996, Naveh, 1999). When talking about the occurrence and spread of forest fires, vegetation characteristics, fuel supplies and climate factors (mean atmospheric conditions) are the most decisive and important factors of natural origin (Rosavec 2010). Fuel is any substance or mixture of substances that can be ignited and burn. Forest fuels mostly come frompine culture, especially when speaking of younger stands. As we cannot have a direct impact on climate, geology, soil and relief factors, our efforts should be focused on potential availability of forest fuels and vegetation where we can prevent the occurrence and spread of wildfires. Accordingly, and with favorable climatic conditions for starting forest fire, fire risk can be reduced to aminimum if caremeasures are taken regulating the amount of the potential of forest fuels. Therefore, timely and according to professional standards of care measures derived stands and culture greatly influenced the reduction in the number and size of fire burn area. Testing of ignition delay, i. e. the time required to ignite the sample, and burning duration, or time elapsed from the moment of ignition to self-quenching of the sample, and determination of moisture content of dead (discarded needles) and living (green needles) fuel was carried out in the period from June 2007 to June 2009 at the educational center NPÅ O Rab, Faculty of Forestry, University of Zagreb, in a 40 -year stand of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.). Themethodology prescribed byValette (1990) was used to test the ignition delay and burning of the <b>living</b> <b>fuel.</b> Themoisture content of tested samples of living and dead fuels were obtained using a standard equation for determining the moisture content (percentage of dry weight), the drying method. Investigations were conducted on the island. It is located in the Kvarner group of islands, and along with several surrounding islands, islets and reefs makes the Rab archipelago. In the structure of the Island of Rab, Upper Paleogene Quaternary sediments are present but they are much less developed, while chalk and Paleogene sediments largely prevail.

He, among other things, shows the relationship mean monthly temperature and precipitation (Fig. 2). The frequency of certain wind directions is shown in the wind rose (Fig. 3).

Four withered surface fuels, including dead leaves and cones of Pinus densiflora, dead leaves of Quercus variabilis, and Castenea crenata burs; and six biofuel herbs, including Agsstache rugosa, Oplismenus undulatifolius, Pueraria thunbergiana, Cirsium japonicum var. ussuriense, Festuca ovina L., and Osmundaceae were selected for analysis. Also, monthly carbon emissions (Jun. -Oct. 2008) from Festuca ovina were analyzed. As a result of tests, {{it was confirmed that}} dead leaves and cones of P. densiflora and C. crenata burs were instantly ignited with flame, which lasted quite a while. The total CO_ 2 and CO emissions from the 10 different kinds of surface fuels analyzed on this study were 28 â 98 g and 0. 76 â 4. 08 g per 50 g of each fuel, respectively, indicating that the amount of carbon emissions vary {{depending on the type of}} fuel. The results also demonstrated that there is a great difference between withered fuels and biofuels in terms of carbon emissions. More specifically, the four withered types of fuels, compared to the six biofuel herbs, were found to emit more CO_ 2 and CO. In particular, dead cones of P. densiflora emitted more carbon dioxide (CO_ 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) than the rest of the surface fuels. Also, the carbon emissions were found high during the period of from August to September. Consequently, in the case of a forest fire, dead cones and leaves of P. densiflora are expected to emit up to 3. 5 times more CO_ 2 and CO than the other surface fuels. The area covered with dead leaves and pine cones is thought to have a high risk of ignition, high fire intensity because of relatively long lasting flame, and rapid fire spread. Herbs and <b>living</b> <b>fuels</b> with high moisture content are expected to elucidate the course of fire in that they produce large amount of combustion products such as smoke and carbon discharge resulting from nonflame-ignition...|$|R

40|$|Under Newcastle Science Cityâs Community Engagement programme, {{and under}} the Sustainability theme, Groundwork worked on a Collaborative Project with Northumbria University to deliver a {{targeted}} education programme of workshops on Domestic Energy Efficiency to residents of Newcastle. The projectâs aim was to engage with families with young children living in the most socially and economically deprived wards in Newcastle, that is families who are potentially <b>living</b> in <b>fuel</b> poverty, to educate people {{on the importance of}} and benefits of becoming more energy efficient. Groundwork intended to deliver the education programme via a pair of workshops, each two hours in length, to twelve different groups living in specified postcode areas of Newcastle which meet the criteria for ERDF funding (Newcastle Disadvantaged areas ERDF Post Codes). Researchers from the Sustainable Cities Research Institute in the Faculty of Engineering and Environment at Northumbria University worked with Groundwork to gather baseline data on participantsâ perceptions of fuel poverty and their approaches to energy use and energy saving before the workshops, and to evaluate how participants had benefited from the programme after attending the two workshops in terms of changing their approaches to energy use...|$|R
40|$|Household {{firewood}} consumption underwent {{significant changes}} during the industrial breakthrough. Recent literature on Sweden makes thecase that greater energy efficiency drastically reduced rural household fuel consumption, while coal substituted for firewood in cities. This article shows that although coal substituted for wood in some urban areas, rural firewood consumption was not reduced. Higher {{standards of living}} indicate contrary to previous results that fuel consumption increased during the industrialisation process. The study shows that households with higher standard of <b>living</b> consumed more <b>fuel</b> and that rural households, due to lower fuel prices, consumed relatively more fuel than urban households. The result shows contrary to previous research that the total energy intensity decreased more rapidly after and no tbefore the industrial breakthrough...|$|R
