500|$|In 1920, an {{airfield}} {{was established}} at Saint-Inglevert {{on a different}} site to the former military airfield. Facilities developed {{over the years to}} include two hangars, customs facilities and ultra short wave radio. In March 1920, a Notice to Airmen was issued stating that Saint-Inglevert was open and fuel, oil and water were available, but there were no hangars or repair facilities. A proposal to designate Saint-Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920. Facilities then in existence included hangars, repair facilities and a radio station. Later that month, it was notified that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield, flashing the Morse letter A, and Saint-Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May. By July, the provision of ground signals at Saint-Inglevert had begun. A [...] arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction. In August, it was reported that Saint-Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget. By October, aids available included a windsock and a <b>landing</b> <b>T.</b> Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively. The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the impact of different manipulation techniques applied on board fishing vessel, on the microbiological quality of the flesh of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) during storage at + 3 °C ± 1 °C for a time (T) of 10 days after <b>landing</b> (<b>T</b> 1 -T 10). Samples of fish were taken from a fishing vessel of the Adriatic Sea and from one of the Tyrrhenian Sea, treated on-board under different icing conditions: 1) a low ice/product weight ratio and 2) an optimal ice/product weight ratio, up to 1 : 3 (3). Spoilage bacteria as Total Bacterial Count (TBC) and specific spoilage bacteria as Sulphide Producing Bacteria (SPB) were enumerated in fish flesh as Colony Forming Units (CFU/g) on Plate Count Agar and Lyngby Agar at 20 °C for 3 - 5 days. TBC of the Adriatic fishes (gutted on-board) resulted 103 UFC/g at T 1 -T 6, and 104 - 105 at T 10, whereas TBC of the Tyrrhenian fishes (not gutted on-board) resulted 10 - 102 UFC/g at T 2 - T 3, 103 at T 6, and 104 - 105 at T 10. SPB resulted 10 - 102 UFC/g at T 1 -T 6, and 103 - 104 at T 10, with absolute values higher in the Adriatic fishes, in respect with the Tyrrhenian fishes, and in the low icing conditions in respect with the optimal icing condition. At the experimented condition, the lowering of the microbiological quality of fish flesh during storage, seems to be more dependent on the gutting versus not gutting on-board practice rather than on the low versus optimal icing treatment...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) farm on clay loam soil during Rabi season of 2010 - 2011. The treatments consisted of laser <b>land</b> leveling (<b>T</b> 1) and control (non-leveled) (T 2). A preliminary field survey was done using staff gage. Initially a base station was established to dispense laser ray uniformly. The laser ray erected from base station guided the sensor of the stuff gage and the leveler. Elevation data was collected from the different points {{of the field and}} made an average. The maximum gage reading were 247. 0 cm and the minimum gage reading was 219. 2 cm. Average gage readings of the laser leveled plot was 235. 66 cm that was settled for auto adjustment. Therefore, huge amount of soils (16. 46 cm high) was cut from the highest point and subsequently had to fill to the low points. Finally, an equal gage reading of 235. 66 cm was observed after leveling the plot. The laser leveler (Leica MLS 700) was used hitching with a TAFE tractor. The field was leveled with manual control initially and finally it was operated with auto adjustment. Two operators, 25 litter diesels and total 6 hours time were required during this leveling.

40|$|The Approach and <b>Landing</b> <b>Test</b> Program {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} steps leading to the demonstration of the capability of the Space Shuttle orbiter to safely approach and land under conditions similar to those planned for the final phases of an orbital flight. The tests were conducted with the orbiter mounted on top of a specially modified carrier aircraft. The first step provided airworthiness and performance verification of the carrier aircraft after modification. The second step {{consisted of}} three taxi tests and five flight tests with an inert unmanned orbiter. The third step consisted of three mated tests with an active manned orbiter. The fourth step consisted of five flights in which the orbiter was separated from the carrier aircraft. For the final two flights, the orbiter tail cone was replaced by dummy engines to simulate the actual orbital configuration. Landing gear braking and steering tests were accomplished during rollouts following the free flight landings. Ferry testing was integrated into the Approach and <b>Landing</b> <b>Test</b> Program to the extent possible. In addition, four ferry test flights were conducted with the orbiter mated to the carrier aircraft in the ferry configuration after the free-flight tests were completed...|$|R

40|$|QuestionsIs loss of {{proprioception}} or loss {{of motor}} control related to functional ankle instability? Are proprioception and motor control related? Is there any difference in proprioception or motor control between ankles with different severity of functional ankle instability?DesignCross-sectional, observational study. ParticipantsTwenty people aged between 18 and 40 years with functional ankle instability associated {{with a history of}} ankle sprain more than one month prior. Twenty age-matched controls with no functional ankle instability or history of ankle sprain. Outcome measuresFunctional ankle instability was classified using the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, proprioception at the ankle was measured as movement detection at three velocities, and motor control was measured using the <b>Landing</b> <b>Test</b> and the Hopping Test. ResultsThere was little if any relation between proprioception (r = – 0. 14 to – 0. 03, 95 % CI – 0. 40 to 0. 25) or motor control (r = – 0. 08 to – 0. 07, 95 % CI – 0. 35 to 0. 20) and functional ankle instability. There was also little if any relation between proprioception and motor control except for a low correlation between movement detection at 0. 1 deg/s and the <b>Landing</b> <b>Test</b> (r = 0. 35, 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 58).
