30|$|Another {{categorisation}} {{within the}} field of entrepreneurship is the theory of Dynamic Capitalism put forward by Bruce A. Kirchhoff. In his 1994 book, he argues that firm growth and the firm innovation rate will determine the extent of the creative <b>destruction</b> <b>effect</b> the firm has on the economy as a whole. Kirchhoff distinguishes four categories of firms contributing differently {{to the development of a}} capitalist economy. Economic Core firms have a low growth rate and a low innovation rate, while Ambitious firms have a high growth rate and a low innovation rate. Constrained Growth firms have a high innovation rate and a low business growth rate and, finally, Glamorous firms have a high business innovation rate and a high business growth rate.|$|R

We compare the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model to three alternative demand structures: oligopolistic competition in prices, oligopolistic competition in quantities, and translog preferences. Our economy is characterized by two distortions: a labor distortion due to the misalignment of markups on goods and leisure, and an entry distortion due to the misalignment of the consumer surplus effect and the profit <b>destruction</b> <b>effect</b> of entry. The two distortions interact in determining the wedge between the market-driven and optimal level of product diversity.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with the financial multiplier literature, this note explores {{a case in which}} the shock triggering a financial crisis stems from the financial sector itself; it is not a shock stemming from the real sector which gets amplified by, say, agency problems. The micro foundations are provided by the bank run literature epitomized by the seminal paper by Diamond and Dybvig (1983). Financial development is thus seen as a mechanism that endows real assets (e. g., land and capital) with liquidity. Likewise, a liquidity crunch associated with a bank run implies a brutal <b>liquidity</b> <b>destruction,</b> and a switch to an equilibrium displaying much lower liquidity. Liquidity creation enhances real asset prices, while a liquidity crunch generates asset price collapse. This bubble-looking episode is not driven by standard fundamentals but is still fully in line with rationality. In this context, devoid of other frictions like price stickiness, the note examines the effect of monetary policy. It shows that preventing price deflation is not enough to offset relative (to output) asset price meltdown, but lower policy interest rates increase relative asset prices and steady-state output. Moreover, in the neighborhood of a first-best capital allocation, an increase in the moneyness of capital may lower the welfare of the representative individual, even if the higher liquidity of capital is sustainable and, hence, not destroyed by future crash. An extension of the basic model supports the conjecture that low policy interest rates may have given incentives to the development of “shadow banking. ” This is a thoroughly revised version of a paper circulated on October 5, 2009.

In particular, they are not more likely to fail or less likely to hire.

The analysis offers two explanations for the causes of widening wage gap between skilled and less-skilled labor, and rising unemployment rate among the less skilled: technological change {{in the form of}} an increase in the size of innovations or skilled labor saving technological change in R&D activity. In addition, the model identifies two distinct effects of faster technological progress on the aggregate unemployment rate. First, it increases the rate of labor turnover and therefore increases the aggregate unemployment rate - the creative <b>destruction</b> <b>effect.</b> Second, it creates R&D jobs, which offer workers complete job security, and consequently reduces the aggregate unemployment rate - the resource reallocation effect.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} gain {{insights}} into the relationship between growth and unemployment in a setting with heterogeneous skills, human capital accumulation, on-the-job training and capital-skill complementarity. We use an endogenous job destruction framework {{in the style of}} Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) with directed search. We show that when growth accelerates, a larger share of unskilled workers seeks training, increasing firms’ incentives to update job-specific technology (rather than destroying it). By magnifying the impact of growth on employment, the introduction of human capital issues allows the model to more closely match the estimated sensitivity of unemployment with respect to growth. When calibrated, the model manages to reproduce the aggregate capitalization effect estimated using OECD data. We find that growth reduces unemployment for individuals receiving training, while it increases the unemployment rate of unskilled workers without training (creative <b>destruction</b> <b>effect)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on growth and unemployment has emphasized the effect of the increasing pace of technological progress on job instability and wage inequality. But less attention has been placed on how the changes in the very nature of work, due to technical change, affects the rate of job destruction, and hence the level of unemployment. We argue that technological progress modifies on-the-job learning and, through general equilibrium effects, unemployment and wage dispersion. In the context of the canonical Mortensen and Pissarides [1998] model, we show that, in a routine world, this 'on-the-job learning effect' can offset the creative <b>destruction</b> <b>effect</b> induced by an increase in the pace of technological change on unemployment, whereas it can amplify it as jobs become less routine. Moreover, the relationship between wage dispersion and growth can be non monotone. This finding helps explain the wage compression/expansion observed in time series data.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{theoretical}} model linking {{the openness of}} an economy to rates of innovation and technology diffusion in its developing industries. Openness to foreign trade affects {{the size of the}} market faced by domestic industries and therefore affects the optimal level of investment in innovation and efforts to prevent knowledge spillovers. We show that while an industry‟s output is small relative to the global market and imitation does not cause price <b>destruction</b> <b>effects,</b> it is optimal for innovating firms to allow imitation by other nearby firms, but as the industry grows, it becomes increasingly likely that the optimal strategy will be to conceal such knowledge. We then demonstrate that if a country adopts protectionist measures, technology diffusion typically stops before the industry develops enough to compete at world prices, so that such a policy is likely to be self-defeating. In contrast, under free trade, the diffusion of innovations will continue at least until an industry becomes globally competitive, although it may initially grow more slowly...|$|R

Then, we analyze the consequences of adoption costs in technological substitution extending the model in two ways: we let adoption costs depend on the technical growth rate, and we endogenize them, depending on the technological gap. When adoption costs depend on the technical growth rate, the effect of growth on optimal lifetime of machines is indeterminate; the creative <b>destruction</b> <b>effect</b> can be compensated by the adoption effect, and faster growth rates delay the technological substitution. Finally, when adoption costs are endogenous, we recover the typical obsolescence effect in vintage capital models and show that technological progress has a negative effect on the technological gap...|$|R
