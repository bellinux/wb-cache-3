25|$|Both Chippewa and Wesco heavily {{increased}} {{sales of}} engineer boots {{in the late}} 1940s. There was a post-war production boom for the boots, with high demand coming from returning veterans and bikers. The latter adopted engineer boots because the laceless design wouldn't interfere with motorcycle drive belts, the shafts were well insulated from heat, and they provided full lower <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> {{in case of an}} accident. The footwear's popularity was furthered by its use by celebrities such as Marlon Brando and James Dean in their respective films The Wild One (1953) and Rebel Without a Cause (1955).|$|E
50|$|<b>Leg</b> <b>protection</b> for horses {{has also}} improved. Very little {{was used in}} the early days, even on cross-country. <b>Leg</b> <b>protection</b> is now seen on nearly every horse at all levels. Boots have {{increased}} technologically, and include materials that either help absorb shock or are very hard and strong to prevent a serious injury.|$|E
50|$|In {{the sport}} {{not only is}} skill {{required}} but {{you also need to}} use the right equipment. When competing you will need a few basic items: cross-cut saws, bow saws, axes, peaveies, foot and <b>leg</b> <b>protection,</b> and climbing gear for the pole climb.|$|E

50|$|Postilions {{typically}} wore {{a special}} rigid boot on their right <b>leg</b> for <b>protection</b> from possible crushing injury due to {{contact with the}} central wooden shaft (if any) and the horses.|$|R
50|$|Knights in effigy are {{depicted}} with <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> of {{a matrix of}} disks with a diameter equal to the splints. This style appears to depict sabatons and splints on greaves, or may represent padded armour underneath splints, or the rivets on brigandine.|$|E
5000|$|Chaps are {{individual}} pant leggings made {{of leather}} and worn by farriers, cowboys, and rodeo contestants {{to protect the}} legs from contact with hooves, thorny undergrowth, and other such work hazards. May also be made of other materials for <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> against other hazards, such as [...] "rain chaps" [...] of waterproof materials, or [...] "saw chaps" [...] of Kevlar for chainsaw workers.|$|E
50|$|For {{personal}} armor, the fibres are, in general, aligned and bonded into sheets, {{which are}} then layered at various angles to give the resulting composite material strength in all directions. Recently developed additions to the US Military's Interceptor body armour, designed to offer arm and <b>leg</b> <b>protection,</b> are said to utilise a form of Spectra or Dyneema fabric. Dyneema provides puncture resistance to protective clothing in the sport of fencing.|$|E
50|$|Medieval armor often offered {{protection}} {{for all of}} the limbs, including metal boots for the lower legs, gauntlets for the hands and wrists, and greaves for the <b>legs.</b> Today, <b>protection</b> of limbs from bombs is provided by a bombsuit. Most modern soldiers sacrifice limb {{protection for}} mobility, since armor thick enough to stop bullets would greatly inhibit movement of the arms and legs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{gridiron}} football, roughing {{the kicker}} is an action {{in which a}} defender, having missed an attempt to block a kick, tackles the kicker or otherwise runs into the kicker {{in a way that}} might injure the kicker or his vulnerable extended kicking <b>leg.</b> This <b>protection</b> is also extended to the holder of a place kick. It is a separate penalty from [...] "running into the kicker." ...|$|R
50|$|Karacena Sarmatian armour (of iron scales {{riveted to}} a leather support) might have {{consisted}} of a scale helmet, cuirass, gorget, <b>leg</b> and shoulder <b>protection</b> and became popular {{during the reign of}} King John Sobieski, but perhaps due to costs and weight, remained popular mostly with the winged hussar commanding officers.|$|R
50|$|Caulkins forged {{into the}} shoe {{which are not}} {{removable}} pose {{an increased risk of}} injury to handler or horse should the horse step on or kick a person, itself, or another animal. When stabled, animals wearing caulkins need extra bedding to avoid abrasion when lying down and for protection while moving about in a confined area. When working, <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> in the form of bell boots and splint boots or polo wraps may minimize the risk of injury.|$|E
50|$|It was {{commonly}} worn over a gambeson {{and mail}} shirt {{and it was}} not long before this form of protection was commonly used by soldiers ranging in rank from archers to knights. It was most commonly used by men-at-arms. These wore brigandine, along with plate arm and <b>leg</b> <b>protection,</b> as well as a helmet. Even with the gambeson and the mail shirt, a wearer was not as well protected as when wearing plate armour. However, the brigandine was probably favored by soldiers who preferred the greater degree of mobility this armour afforded.|$|E
50|$|A rider can be disqualified {{for using}} illegal equipment, leaving the working area {{before the time}} limit is reached, and for inhumane {{treatment}} of the horse. A western saddle is required. A breast collar and back cinch are optional. A bridle is also required with varying options for bits and curb chains {{as long as they}} meet competition guidelines. A tiedown is prohibited. A saddle pad is used under the saddle. Splint boots and back or skid boots are recommended for the horse’s <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> during competition. Chaps are not required but are recommended, and commonly used in competition.|$|E

Through Kaede, they meet with Tess and Andrew [...] "Razor" [...] DeSoto, a Republic Commander {{doubling}} {{as the leader of}} the Patriots. Razor offers Day a prosthetic <b>leg</b> and <b>protection</b> in exchange for assassinating the new Elector Primo, Anden Stavropoulos, who has recently succeeded his deceased father. To execute the task, June will need an audience with Anden at Denver to falsify the time and place of the assassination and convince him to seek [...] "protection" [...] at the actual place of assassination.|$|R
50|$|The Companion cavalry of the Diadochoi (Alexandrian successor-states), {{were even}} more heavily equipped. Seleucid Companions were noted to have worn lighter, but not {{otherwise}} dissimilar, equipment to the cataphracts at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, which may have included partial horse armour and <b>leg</b> and arm <b>protection.</b> Ptolemaic Companions were also equipped with a large round aspis cavalry shield unlike the Companions of Phillip and Alexander.|$|R
50|$|Korean armor pieces, {{from top}} to bottom, {{typically}} consisted of a helmet or a cap, a heavy main armor coat with pauldrons or shoulder and underarm <b>protection,</b> <b>leg</b> coverings (supplemented by the skirting from the main coat), groin protection, and limb protection. In terms of armament, Korean militaries employed heavy infantry equipped with swords or spears along with shields, pikemen, archers, crossbowmen, and versatile heavy cavalry capable of horse archery. Korean naval warfare saw large deployments of heavy wooden shields {{as a means of}} protecting personnel on the top decks of Korean ships.|$|R

50|$|The IARU rules specify {{that the}} choice of {{clothing}} is an individual decision of the competitor, unless the meet director specifies otherwise. Although comfortable outdoor clothing {{is all that is}} required for participation, specialty clothing developed for the sport of orienteering is also worn by ARDF competitors. Nylon pants, shirts, or suits, gaiters or padded socks for lower <b>leg</b> <b>protection,</b> and specialty shoes for cross-country running through wooded terrain are popular choices. Some competitors may choose to carry food or water on course, and wear a small waist pack or hydration pack for this purpose. At large international or national events, competitors may be required by the meet director to wear identifying numbers pinned to their clothing, and many wear team uniforms in their national colors.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} an {{innovative}} approach to control compound multiswitching converter systems. The proposed modulation strategy directly controls the external current. A simple tracking algorithm working {{at very high}} frequency manages the switching of {{the system as a}} whole. Once the switching action is decided by a master routine, the choose of which leg has to be effectively switched is demanded to a separate slave routine. An acceleration algorithm and a maximum <b>leg</b> currents <b>protection</b> are also adopted. Under the proposed approach the system bandwidth is related to the global switching frequency equal to the valve frequency multiplied by the number of valves. As long as the external current is directly measured and processed by the master control, cumulative errors from acquisitions and processing of single leg currents are avoided. Consequently both system dynamics and accuracy over external current are greatly improved. Details of the proposed control and simulation results are reported...|$|R
50|$|Gaiters are {{a type of}} {{protective}} clothing for a person's ankles and legs below the knee. Gaiters are worn when walking, hiking, running (especially orienteering and rogaining) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in snow, with or without snowshoes. Heavy gaiters are often worn when using crampons, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite foot. Gaiters strap over the hiking boot and around the person's <b>leg</b> to provide <b>protection</b> from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering {{the top of the}} boot. Gaiters may also be worn as protection against snake bites.|$|R

5000|$|Many Scholars {{observe that}} {{the style of}} the figures and the bull head handles of this thirteenth century BCE vase are very similar to eighth century BCE pottery. Similar spearmen are also {{depicted}} in eighth century BCE pottery which introduces a curious 500 year gap in styles. This vase also leads to clues about post-palatial Mycenaean warriors. The knapsacks the warriors carry suggest that they may have to travel long distances to battle. Figures {{on one side of the}} vase wear helmets with horns. The other side depicts warriors in [...] "hedgehog" [...] style helmets. The latter is equipped with spears that are shorter than general spears depicted of the time. The warriors on both sides have shields, tunics, and <b>leg</b> <b>protection.</b> The warriors on either side appear to be uniform suggesting the army as a whole and not representing individual warriors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of powerful rifled firearms made {{all but the}} finest and heaviest armour obsolete. The increasing power and availability of firearms {{and the nature of}} large, state-supported infantry led to more portions of plate armour being cast off in favour of cheaper, more mobile troops. <b>Leg</b> <b>protection</b> was the first part to go, replaced by tall leather boots. By the beginning of the 18th century, only field marshals, commanders and royalty remained in full armour on the battlefield, more as a sign of rank than for practical considerations. It remained fashionable for monarchs to be portrayed in armour {{during the first half of}} the 18th century (late Baroque period), but even this tradition became obsolete. Thus, [...] of Frederick the Great in 1739 still shows him in armour, while [...] showing him as a commander in the Seven Years' War (1760s) depicts him without armour.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{physical}} type of kickboxing {{available at}} W.A.K.O. championships, Thai-boxing (more {{commonly known as}} Muay Thai) allows the contestants to kick, punch, use elbows and knees {{in an attempt to}} win their matches - often by a point’s decision or via a referee stoppage. Unlike the professional version, W.A.K.O. amateur events enforce the wearing of head, body and <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> by the competitors. In Caorle only men were allowed to participate in Thai-boxing, with twelve weight classes ranging from 51 kg/112.2 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs. Notable winners in the style included future pro world champions Vasily Shish, Dmitry Shakuta and Vitali Akhramenko, with their nation Belarus being by far the strongest nation in Thai-boxing, winning eight gold and two bronze medals. [...] Even more incredible was the fact that seven of these winners all trained together at the Kick Fighter Gym in Minsk.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{simple and}} rigorous, albeit fairly general, derivations of valuation formulae for credit default swaptions and credit default index swaptions.

5000|$|In live competition, {{handlers}} {{are required}} to wear an equestrian helmet and cannot use whips or sticks. The horse is only allowed, at most, to wear a halter, lead rope and may wear <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> such as splint boots. The lead rope must be loose and the handler cannot pull on it but must remain within a designated position with their horse. [...] Competition usually consists of a course of eight or more obstacles. Examples of obstacles may include tunnels, jumps, a seesaw, passing through a curtain, weaving between poles or cones, passing through or over poles, branches, gates, hoops, water, or tarps; entering a trailer; rolling a ball, backing between two poles, stepping onto an object, standing still, carrying a light load, crossing a bridge, navigating a small maze or labyrinth, crossing over an A-frame, and so on. Courses are often timed, particularly at higher levels.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Terminology== Confusion arises {{because of}} {{the wide variety of}} terms by which similar armors are known. Banded mail has been {{described}} as [...] "a form of mail reinforced with bands of leather", as [...] "overlapping horizontal strips of laminated metal sewn over a backing of normal chain mail and soft leather backing" [...] and as [...] "many thin sheets of metal are hammered or riveted together". The last description more closely fits splinted armor, which consists of long metal splints connected by mail/leather used for arm and <b>leg</b> <b>protection.</b> The final description of metal plates riveted to a sub-strate describe a coat of plates or brigandine, all of which consist of metal plates riveted to a leather or cloth fronting. Finally, armor constructed of rows of plates or platelets sewn or laced together, without backing/fronting, would be considered [...] "laminar". The current term for small metal plates joined together by chainmail is plated mail.|$|E
5000|$|The Exora has an {{equivalent}} 4-star EuroNCAP rating after 32 Exoras were crashed at the Applus+ IDIADA crash testing facility in Spain. Additionally, the Exora {{was awarded a}} 4-star rating by Malaysia's own MyVAP evaluation program. The Exora was given a four-star ANCAP safety rating, applicable to all variants. The MPV, which is [...] with dual frontal and side airbags with thorax and head protection for front occupants, scored 26.37 {{out of a possible}} 37 points. In the offset crash test, the Exora scored 10.55 out of 16 points - driver chest protection was acceptable and <b>leg</b> <b>protection</b> was marginal. In the side impact crash test, it managed 14.82 out of 16 points - driver chest protection was listed as acceptable. The Exora result - with testing carried out in July 2013 - reflected its performance in the 40% frontal offset test, where the risk of serious injury to the driver’s legs was high. Side impact performance was good, but overall pedestrian test results were poor, according to ANCAP. One of the key features that made these ratings possible is the use of high tensile steel for the body cage, providing better stability and increased impact absorption during a collision. Side impact bars are also installed to reinforce the door frames and to absorb impacts from both sides.|$|E
50|$|The Iron Age is broadly {{identified}} as {{stretching from the}} end of the Bronze Age around 1200 BC to 500 AD and the beginning of the Medieval period. Bodies and clothing have been found from this period, preserved by the anaerobic and acidic conditions of peat bogs in northwestern Europe. A Danish recreation of clothing found with such bodies indicates woven wool dresses, tunics and skirts. These were largely unshaped and held in place with leather belts and metal brooches or pins. Garments were not always plain, but incorporated decoration with contrasting colours, particularly at the ends and edges of the garment. Men wore breeches, possibly with lower <b>legs</b> wrapped for <b>protection,</b> although Boucher states that long trousers have also been found. Warmth came from woollen shawls and capes of animal skin, probably worn with the fur facing inwards for added comfort. Caps were worn, also made from skins, and there was an emphasis on hair arrangements, from braids to elaborate Suebian knots. Soft laced shoes made from leather protected the foot.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the standard Credit Default Swap (CDS) payoff and some alternative approximated versions, stemming from different conventions on the premium and <b>protection</b> <b>legs.</b> We consider standard running CDS (RCDS), upfront CDS and postponed-payments running CDS (PRCDS). Each different definition implies a different definition of forward CDS rate, which we consider with some detail. We introduce defaultable floating rate notes (FRN) ’s. We point out {{which kind of}} CDS payoff produces a forward CDS rate that {{is equal to the}} fair spread in the considered defaultable FRN. An approximated equivalence between CDS’s and defaultable FRN’s is established, which allows to view CDS options as structurally similar to the optional component in defaultable callable notes. We briefly investigate the possibility to express forward CDS rates in terms of some basic rates and discuss a possible analogy with the LIBOR and swap default-free models. Finally, we discuss the change of numeraire approach for deriving a Black-like formula for CDS options or, equivalently, defaultable callable FRN’s. We also introduce an analytical formula for CDS option prices under the CDS-calibrated SSRD stochastic-intensity model, and discuss the impact of the different CIR++ dynamics parameters on the related CDS options implied volatilities. Hints on possible methods for smile modeling of CDS options are given for possible future developments of the CDS option market...|$|R
40|$|Paintings {{revealed}} in the Assumption of Holy Virgin Mary church in Lubecko during the conservation works have been pre-dated {{to the beginning of}} 15 th century. However, after military parts shown on the painting were analyzed, this doens’t seem to be true anymore. All of depicted soldiers wear full plate armours, composed of plate <b>legs</b> and arms <b>protection</b> some of which have gilded protection parts on their joints. Breastplates are rounded and have radiate cannelures. Soldiers’ hips are covered with skirts with foil tassels. That type of breastplates as mentioned above appeared twice in known history of armament: in 2 nd half of 15 th century and in turn of 15 th and 16 th. Foil tassels suggest rather that second period. This is the type of armour that was popular in that time; numerous tombstones, examples of iconography and single preserved parts of armours are the proof here. There are few types of helmets shown on the painting: kettle hats, simple shallow skull caps and rare kind of helmet similar to findings from Toruń and Mielno – storczhelme/pekilhube. All pieces of weapon are depicted as schematically as armours. It is worth to notice that swords have pointy forms, good for stabbing. The most interesting one, handled by one of angels, has an even-armed cross-shaped pommel. Additionaly to swords, there are also halberds, hammer-axe and misericorde. Wholeness of the armament seems to be typical for the gothic period. It is highly likely that the author portrayed the reality he knew...|$|R
