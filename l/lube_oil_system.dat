40|$|The {{lubricating}} oil system {{provides a means}} to introduce a lubricant {{in the form of}} a film to reduce friction and wear between surfaces that bear against each other as they move. 1 The oil film which is established also cools the parts by carrying generated heat away from hot surfaces, cleans and carries dirt or metal wear particles to the filter media, and helps seal the piston to the cylinder during combustion. Most systems are pressure lubricated and distribute oil under pressure to bearings, gears, and power assemblies. Lubricating oil usually reaches main, connecting rod, and camshaft bearings through drilled passages in the cylinder block and crankshaft or through piping and common manifolds. Many parts rely on oil for cooling, so if the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> fails to perform its function the engine will overheat. Metal to metal surfaces not separated by a thin film of oil rapidly build up frictional heat. As the metals reach their melting point, they tend to weld together in spots or streaks. <b>Lube</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> failures can cause significant damage to an engine in a short period of time. Proper maintenance and operation of the {{lubricating oil}} system is essential if your engine is to accomplish its mission...|$|E

40|$|TutorialActive {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{are being}} used for {{an increasing number of}} compressors in the oil and gas industry. The applications include cryogenic compressor-expanders, subsea processing, pipeline and other process compressors. The use of AMBs allows totally sealed machines, reduced maintenance, elimination of the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system,</b> enhanced monitoring and diagnostic capability, and provides extremely high levels of reliability. Over the past several decades, these bearings have gone from unique, one-of-a-kind demonstrations to being the bearing of choice in an increasing number of applications. To address the more widespread use of AMB supported rotors, the eighth edition of API 617 includes a new annex which, for the first time, presents an extensive set of specifications that AMB supported compressors and compressor/expanders must meet for API service. The requirements of this annex cover basic design issues, rotordynamics, testing, and auxiliary bearings. This tutorial presents an overview of the new requirements and their rationale, resulting from a joint effort and balance of AMB manufacturers, turbo machinery OEMs and end user experience. Special considerations related to the unique requirements and issues related to rotordynamics are presented. Several examples will be discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{lube oil}} {{separator}} {{is widely used}} in <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> of merchant vessel. The lube oil separator functions to purify the lube oil to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The lube oil separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out. After removing the failure, the separator finally is repaired.

40|$|Increasing engine {{performance}} requirements and demanding markets pose challenges for engine manufacturers, {{which has led}} to more complex control systems. Engine control software development is expensive and time consuming process especially in marine industry. Engine modeling and rapid prototyping are proposed to shorten control system development cycles. Model in the loop simulation can be used to test control system functionality. For this purpose, a zero dimensional mean value engine model is parameterized for a Wärtsilä 6 cylinder medium speed four stroke dual fuel engine. Before parameterization, dual fuel engine operating cycle and combustion process are reviewed in order to model the processes based on physical phenomena. The Combustion Model is the most complex of all the modeled systems. Other systems of the mean value engine model are Engine Model that covers air flow through the engine, Gas System that models fuel gas admission, Fuel System that is in charge of diesel fuel injection, <b>Lube</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>System</b> that simulates heat transfer to lubricating oil and Cooling Water Circuit that handles engine and charge air cooling. These systems are modeled to a varying degree of accuracy. The equations used to model the components of each system are presented. Instrument and start air systems of the engine are not modeled. The engine model is made with Matlab/Simulink. In order to test the control system against the model and ensure their compatibility, control inputs used to influence the plant model and measurement outputs for control system feedback are processed. Test run on the actual engine is made to collect reference data of the engine’s performance. Measured data is used to parameterize the engine model via simulation on development computer. The model is then discretized for real time simulation. During real time simulation on target computer, engine controllers are parameterized to get realistic response. Engine model accuracy is validated by comparing steady-state performance and transient response of the model against measured engine data. Analysis of the results confirms that engine model accuracy is sufficient for control system functionality testing. However, the accuracy is not enough for control system calibration. Due to adequate accuracy, realistic cause and effect relationships between different engine systems and real time simulation capabilities, the engine model can be used for rapid prototyping based control system development...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn this study, the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) and the Partially Evaporating Cycle (PEC) {{have been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared to the}} Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for power production from low temperature heat sources. This study {{is a continuation of}} the work done in my project thesis fall 2013. The ORC is a well-known technology that is in use in several plants today. The TFC and PEC on the other hand are still in a state of technical development. The biggest challenge for the TFC and PEC is the required two-phase expansion. Lately, two-phase expanders with high efficiencies have been developed, which makes the TFC and PEC economically interesting. Currently, only a few studies on the TFC and PEC can be found, {{and most of them are}} theoretical considerations. All of these studies finds the TFC promising for low temperature heat sources, which was also the findings of my project thesis. The PEC is found to be promising for smaller systems where the working fluid pump efficiency is low. The TFCs main difference from the ORC is that the heating process ends at the boiling point of the working fluid, i. e. there is no evaporation and superheating. This leads to a better temperature match between the working fluid and the heat source, such that more heat can be transferred to the working fluid. Power is produced in a two-phase expander after the heating process. The cost pr. kWh for TFC systems have been estimated to be lower than for ORC systems due to the elimination of the evaporator, separator drum, gear box, <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> <b>system</b> and the fact that simpler heat exchangers can be used. In the PEC, the working fluid is allowed to be partially evaporated during the heating process. This is done in an attempt to combine the advantages of the TFC and the ORC. The ORC, TFC and PEC have been simulated in a Microsoft Excel calculation tool, using Visual Basic for Applications. The simulations include detailed heat exchanger models to calculate heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses, and two-phase expander efficiency models for the TFC and PEC. The three cycles have been simulated and optimized for maximum net power production for three cases using different heat source temperatures. Air with a mass flow of 10 kg/s and temperatures of 100, 150 and 200 &# 176;C are used for Case I, Case II and Case III respectively. Water at 20 &# 176;C is used as the heat sink. The three cases are simulated with eight different working fluids, R 123, R 134 a, R 245 fa, R 1234 ze(E), butane, pentane, isopentane and propane with maximum heat exchanger areas of 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500 and 4000 m 2. Different performance parameters are calculated and used to compare the performance of the ORC, TFC and PEC, and the different working fluids. The results show that the TFC has the lowest power production for all cases, and the largest estimated system size. Both the total heat exchanger area and expander outlet volume flow are generally higher for the TFC systems, especially for the lower heat source temperature cases. For the 100 &# 176;C and 150 &# 176;C cases the power production for the TFC and ORC is in the same range. Since TFC systems are estimated to have a lower cost than ORC systems, they can be suitable for systems with heat sources in this range when system size is not a critical factor. The PEC does not show any advantage over the ORC for the cases analyzed here. This study shows less promising results for the TFC than my project thesis and other published studies. This is mainly due to the variable two-phase expander efficiency used here, and that none of the other studies considers pressure losses in the system or calculation of heat transfer coefficients for each working fluid. A scientific paper on the main results from the study before the simulation of the PEC and inclusion of the heat exchanger models is given in Appendix C. This paper has been submitted to the journal Energy. A scientific paper on the final results of the study is given in Appendix D. This paper has been submitted to the Gustav Lorentzen Conference. </p...|$|E

Future plant capacity requirements of the hydrocracker unit at a United Kingdom site required a 25 percent increase in capacity and a three to 10 percent increase in differential pressure of the charge pump duty. After preliminary investigations, the decision was made to rerate and upgrade the existing pumps, as opposed to purchasing new equipment. In addition to the performance rerate, there was a requirement to resolve a long term vibration problem and to improve the performance of the mechanical seals. The final scope of work included major modifications to the pumps including one new barrel casing, cartridge-type double mechanical seals, new gearboxes, and new motors.

Diesel ash emissions are the non-combustible portion of diesel particulate matter and are mainly derived from metallic <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> additives such as Ca, Mg, and Zn {{as well as}} engine wear metals including Fe. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used to filter engine particle emissions and are routinely regenerated, oxidizing the material in the filter. After filter regeneration, metallic ash remains. Over time, this ash can build up in the filter, increasing the filter pressure drop and eventually plugging the filter. Ash emissions {{can also be used}} to calculate engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption. A high temperature oxidation method (HTOM) has been developed to measure ash emissions in real-time. The HTOM uses a tube oven to oxidize the combustible fraction of an engine exhaust sample. The remaining particles are then measured with real-time and near real-time particle sampling techniques. The HTOM system improvements are discussed along with validation testing and further recommendations regarding improvements in the apparatus and procedure. Atomized <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> was used as a test aerosol. Special <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> blends were formulated to determine measurement sensitivity to specific ash constituents. Ca and Mg were readily detectable by the HTOM. However, the HTOM was not very sensitive to Zn based additives. Chemical equilibrium models show that Ca and Mg formed stable oxides at oven temperatures while Zn went to a gaseous phase. Repeatability in <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> spray ash measurements was better than 10 %. Engine exhaust repeats did not show as good repeatability. However engine exhaust is a much less stable and repeatable aerosol. Steady-state engine ash emissions were sampled from two different Diesel engines (1. 9 L VW and Cummins APU) at different speeds and loads. <b>Lube</b> <b>oil</b> doped fuel was also used in the engine tests to artificially increase oil consumption and ash emissions. The engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption was predicted from known <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> ash concentrations and measured ash emissions.

Ash and soot measurements were made downstream a loading DPF. The downstream soot particle surface area concentrations tracked better with the ash than soot volume concentrations.
