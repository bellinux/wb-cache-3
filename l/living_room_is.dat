40|$|In this study, the {{reverberation}} time of apartment <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> measured {{and distribution of}} the {{reverberation time}} was analyzed. In addition, sound field characteristics of mock-up test <b>room</b> similar with <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and timber structured bedroom was investigated with addition of furniture and sound absorption material. Average reverberation time of unfurnished apartment unit was 1. 11 s, and reverberation time in 630 Hz~ 2000 Hz bands were longer than 1. 2 s. It was found that from the field measurement results, reverberation time characteristic of furnished apartment <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> uniform in most of frequency bands. Averaged reverberation time of furnished <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> 0. 48 s and the reverberation time of bedroom was 0. 44 s. Standardized sound pressure level correction values were calculated from the average reverberation time of furnished and unfurnished apartment units. The correction value of unfurnished <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> − 3. 4 dB and that of furnished <b>living</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> 0. 2 dB. Measured reverberation time of furnished and unfurnished apartment units indicated that reference reverberation time; 0. 5 s, in KS and ISO standards is reasonable also in Korean residential environment. ? ??? ??????? ???????????(???? 10040807) ? ????? ????????(???? 14 PERP-B 082204 - 01) ? ?????? ?? ???????...|$|R

25|$|The formal {{living room}} ceiling was hand painted and stenciled by Bryan Albert Painting Studio LLC located in Wauwatosa, WI. An Arts & Crafts-style {{chandelier}} {{was added to}} the room when electricity was installed in 1912. The room's hardwood floor was installed diagonally which was expensive at the time. An original Eastlake-style fireplace was brought out of storage during the 1974 reconstruction and two original ceramic dogs were placed on top.
