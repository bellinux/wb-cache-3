Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the flat tax idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E

5000|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie:Governor Chris Christie: “I {{just want}} to make clear that I have been working on this issue in my role on the {{executive}} committee of the National Governors Association because it is an important issue to all the nation’s governors.

And I think Senator Alexander’s legislation would be a great step forward in that regard. It would give states options to decide how they want to deal with this and not have to any longer deal with the federal prohibition on dealing with it. So, it would allow us to do it in a much more uniform and broader way. So, I’m with Governor Daniels on this and other Republican governors - Governor Snyder of Michigan and others who feel strongly about it. And we’ve been working on it at the National Governors Association and I know we will continue to and hope to get some type of resolution to it by the end of this year.” ...|$|R

500|$|In the US, {{wind power}} {{receives}} a production tax credit (PTC) of 1.5¢/kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW·h produced, {{for the first}} ten years; at 2.2 cents per kW·h in 2012, the credit was renewed on 2 January 2012, to include construction begun in 2013. A 30% tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC. Another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation. Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for [...] "green credits". The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines. Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs). These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices. In December 2013 U.S. Senator <b>Lamar</b> <b>Alexander</b> and other Republican senators argued that the [...] "wind energy production tax credit {{should be allowed to}} expire at the end of 2013" [...] and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations.|$|E

Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that."
