25|$|In 1939, Sukhoi was {{tasked with}} {{designing}} a high-altitude fighter, the resulting Su-1 was a conventional monoplane with a streamlined wooden semi-monocoque fuselage, low-set all-metal wing made of duralumin and un-pressurized cockpit. The key {{feature of the}} aircraft {{was a pair of}} TK-2 turbochargers driven by exhaust gases from the Klimov M-105P engine. The prototype was completed at the Sukhoi plant in Kharkov in May 1940, flying for the first time, on 15 June 1940, with A.P. Chernyavsky at the controls. Testing continued until 3 August, when Chernavskii mistakenly landed with the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted.</b> After the completion of repairs in mid-September, testing resumed, but an in-flight engine failure on 2 October resulted in a dead-stick landing. Limited flight testing continued until April 1941, with the Su-1 reaching a top speed of 641km/h (345kn, 400mph) at 10,000m (32,810ft). However, the turbochargers proved unreliable and without them the aircraft was inferior in performance to the Yakovlev Yak-1.|$|E

5|$|The first XF-104 (Lockheed 083-1001, s/n 53-7786) was {{transported to}} Edwards AFB amidst high secrecy {{during the night}} of 24–25 February, where Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was to do the initial testing. On 28 February 1954, the XF-104 made a planned hop of about five ft off the ground during a {{high-speed}} taxi, but its first official flight took place on 4 March. During that flight, the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> did not <b>retract,</b> and LeVier landed after a low-speed flight of about 20 minutes.

500|$|The Yak-19 had an {{flattened}} oval-shaped, metal semi-monocoque fuselage {{with the}} single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just {{forward of the}} [...] axial-flow RD-10F turbojet engine.

Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted</b> inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. The laminar-flow, two-spar, straight wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with modified Fowler flaps and Frise ailerons. The rudder was split into two sections by the horizontal stabilizers; the upper portion was fabric-covered while the lower half was metal-skinned. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen, a forward armor plate and an armored seat back. In addition, he was provided with an ejection seat. The Yak-19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of [...] of fuel. It was armed with two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, each with 70 rounds.|$|E

500|$|The Lavochkin OKB {{was ordered}} to design a fighter using a single Junkers Jumo 004B axial-flow {{turbojet}} in February 1945.

The wings of the all-metal aircraft had fixed leading edges and slotted flaps. The cockpit was well forward, giving the pilot good visibility, and he was protected by an armored headrest. The windscreen of the teardrop-shaped canopy was also armored. Two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon were mounted on the lower side of the fuselage with 75 rounds per gun. The tricycle <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted</b> into the fuselage which gave the 150 a very narrow track.

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid cutting the outer wing formers with outward <b>retracting</b> <b>gear,</b> Rether decided to have the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retract</b> {{directly}} to the rear. To lie flat, the wheel {{would have to be}} rotated through 90° as it retracted, with its mainwheel resting atop {{the lower end of the}} strut as with the contemporary American Curtiss P-36 Hawk fighter design. To do this, Rethel placed the main oleo strut inside a larger tube that was mounted to the pivot point on the lower leading edge of the box-spar. As the <b>gear</b> <b>retracted</b> a small arm would pull on a lever mounted to the oleo, turning the leg inside the larger tube.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} had a metal monocoque fuselage, {{while the}} wings were of corrugated metal construction. The mainwheels {{of the conventional}} <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted</b> backwards into the wing, being operated by cables driven by a handwheel turned by the pilot. The first prototype was powered by an imported 433kW (580hp) Bristol Mercury radial engine enclosed by an NACA cowling and driving a two-bladed wooden propeller. [...] It was armed with a single PV-1 machine gun, with provision for two Kurchevsky APK-37 recoilless autocannon under the wing.|$|E
2500|$|The plane {{continued}} {{to approach the}} airport [...] and leveled off with <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted.</b> At this time, Captain Noor had been in extreme anxiety, as the plane was in an active bad weather cell. However, First Officer Javid seemed to be ignorant and unaware of the extreme precipitation and bad weather, and did not recommend the Captain to discontinue the approach. As the plane continued the approach, Captain Noor became pre-occupied with anxiety, as he saw erroneous readings in flight parameters on some instruments from the effect of bad weather. At this point, the approach was still normal as usual.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Sergey Ilyushin {{started work}} on a new aircraft, the Il-1 {{armoured}} fighter, in both single- and two-seat versions. The Il-1 {{was similar to the}} Ilyushin Il-2 design, but was more modern and compact, and powered with a new Mikulin engine, the AM-42. The Il-1 used the same principle of a stress-bearing armored shell to protect the engine and pilot as did the Il-2, but protection was increased by moving the oil cooler and radiator inside the shell, cooled by wing-root ducts that exhausted through an armored slot on the underside. The <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted</b> aft and the wheels rotated to lie flat within the wings. The two VYa-23 cannon were carried over from the Il-2, but they were its only gun armament.

2500|$|The VIT-2 {{was derived}} from the VIT-1 prototype, but it was given [...] Klimov M-105 engines and its {{structure}} was revised. It was a low-winged, twin-engined aircraft with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage was made in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood and a large fuel tank was placed between the pilot and rear gunner. The fuel tank was moved to the rear and the canopy was lengthened in consequence. The wing structure was built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The empennage was redesigned as a twin tail. The main legs of the conventional <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> <b>retracted</b> aft into the engine nacelles and were given fairing to reduce drag when retracted, but the tail-wheel was fixed.

None of the 45 occupants, including the 41 passengers who were safely evacuated via the aircraft's crew entrance door by the two cabin crew members on the instructions of the flight's commander, were hurt in that accident. The subsequent investigation concluded that this accident had been caused by the <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> being <b>retracted</b> before the aircraft had been properly established in its initial climb.
