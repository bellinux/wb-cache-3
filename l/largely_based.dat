5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs and Democrats by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was particularly significant because John C. Calhoun's justification for nullification was <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Following the relief, {{most of the}} {{avalanche}} of mail and messages sent to the White House by the public supported MacArthur.

5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653. Only five {{works from the}} 1660s have a, {{partially}} obscured, year next to his signature; none from the 1670s and 1680s have a date. Dating subsequent work has therefore been <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on detective work and speculation.|$|E

5|$|The {{supposedly}} higher {{status of}} cavalry in the 4th century is also open to doubt. This view is <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on underestimating {{the importance of}} cavalry in the 2nd century. Cavalry always had higher status than infantry in the Principate: {{in the time of}} Domitian (r. 81–96), auxiliary cavalry was paid 20–40% more than auxiliary infantry.|$|E
5|$|Until the 20th century, most Norwegians {{lived and}} worked in {{buildings}} that were designed and built according to vernacular building traditions, what in Norwegian is known as byggeskikk. These practices varied somewhat by region and climatic conditions and evolved over time, but were <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on use of wood and other locally available resources.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, contractors and all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary {{falls under the}} authority of the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E
5|$|Christian IV {{undertook}} {{a number of}} projects in Norway that were <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on Renaissance architecture He established mining operations in Kongsberg and Røros, now a World Heritage Site. After a devastating fire in 1624, the town of Oslo was {{moved to a new}} location and rebuilt as a fortified city with an orthogonal layout surrounded by ramparts, and renamed Christiania. King Christian also founded the trading city of Kristiansand, naming it after himself.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century various new {{industries}} were introduced, including lime quarrying. During {{the early decades}} of the 20th century the population exceeded 1,000; but this was followed by a lengthy decline. Although resident numbers are now less than 200, there was a small increase from 2001 to 2011. About a third of the population were recorded as Gaelic speaking at the former date. The modern economy is <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on farming, fishing and tourism and the largest settlement is Achnacroish. Various shipwrecks have been recorded in the vicinity.|$|E
25|$|The port of Akureyri {{is vital}} to the town, which <b>largely</b> <b>bases</b> its {{livelihood}} on fisheries. It is the site of large fish processing plants and has docking facilities for trawlers. It is also important for freight handling and for tourism, as cruise ships stop in Akureyri during the summer months. The ice-free nature of the port has been important in the town's establishment.|$|R

5|$|In {{the same}} year of 1542, Calvin {{published}} Catéchisme de l'Eglise de Genève (Catechism of the Church of Geneva), which was inspired by Bucer's Kurze Schrifftliche Erklärung of 1534. Calvin had written an earlier catechism during his first stay in Geneva which was <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on Martin Luther's Large Catechism. The first version was arranged pedagogically, describing Law, Faith, and Prayer. The 1542 version was rearranged for theological reasons, covering Faith first, then Law and Prayer.|$|E

5|$|Most current {{scholars}} {{consider the}} Codex Vaticanus {{to be one}} of the best Greek texts of the New Testament, with the Codex Sinaiticus as its only competitor. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex was unrivaled. It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of The New Testament in the Original Greek in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek New Testament are <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on the text of the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 19th century, local {{government}} remained <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on the parochial and manorial systems in use since the Middle Ages. In the Potteries towns {{this led to}} each of the townships having varying forms of government. Tunstall was parochially within Wolstanton and manorially part of Tunstall manor; Burslem, although manorially a part of Tunstall manor, parochially was part of Burslem parish. It was through these failing regimes, such as the 1813 lapse of the manorial court of Tunstall, that the long process towards federation began.|$|E
5|$|Rapid City, with a 2010 {{population}} of 67,956, and a metropolitan area {{population of}} 124,766, is the second-largest {{city in the}} state.

Rapid City's economy is <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on tourism and defense spending, because of the proximity of many tourist attractions in the Black Hills and Ellsworth Air Force Base.|$|E
50|$|Icelanders {{also wrote}} {{extensively}} about Olaf {{and we also}} have several Icelandic sagas about him. These include: Fagrskinna (c. 1220) and Morkinskinna (c. 1225-1235). The famous Heimskringla (c. 1225), written by Snorri Sturluson, <b>largely</b> <b>bases</b> its account of Olaf on the earlier Fagrskinna. We also have the important Oldest Saga of St. Olaf (c. 1200), which is important to scholars for its constant use of skaldic verses, many of which are attributed to Olaf himself.|$|R

5|$|The 1911 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic {{during the summer}} and fall. There were three suspected tropical depressions, including one that began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Storm data is <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on the Atlantic hurricane database, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Legal {{system in}} Japan has been {{historically}} influenced by Chinese law; developing independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. It has, however, changed during the Meiji Restoration, {{and is now}} <b>largely</b> <b>based</b> on the European civil law; notably, the civil code based on the German model still remains in effect. A quasi-jury system has recently came into use, and the legal system also includes {{a bill of rights}} since May 3, 1947. The collection of Six Codes makes up {{the main body of the}} Japanese statutory law.|$|E
5|$|The Redcliffe-Maud Report (Cmnd. 4040) {{recommended}} {{the abolition of}} all the existing county, county borough, borough, urban district and rural district councils and replacement with new authorities.

50|$|Traditionally, {{from the}} times prior to Florence Nightingale, nursing {{was seen as}} an apprenticeship, often {{undertaken}} in religious institutes such as convents by young women, although {{there has always been a}} proportion of male nurses, especially in mental health services. In 1860 Nightingale set up the first nurse training school at St Thomas' Hospital, London. Nightingale's curriculum was <b>largely</b> <b>base</b> around nursing practice, with instruction focused upon the need for hygiene and task competence.
