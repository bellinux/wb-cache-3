25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; it need not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E

This technique is primarily used to correct small defects which may persist after conventional surgical treatment.|$|E
2500|$|It was the {{development}} of the knitting machine that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting. Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega knitting needles, making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. [...] Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook toward you up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{possibility}} to extend the Connes and Lott reformulation of the standard model to <b>larger</b> unified <b>gauge</b> groups. Noncommutative geometry imposes very stringent constraints on the possible theories, and remarkably, the analysis {{seems to suggest that}} no <b>larger</b> <b>gauge</b> groups are compatible with the noncommutative structure, unless one enlarges the fermionic degrees of freedom, namely the number of particles...|$|R
50|$|This subset {{is still}} too big, because some of these classes are related by <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations. In QED there are <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations which add {{integral}} multiples of two pi to Wilson loops. The p-form potentials in type II supergravity theories also enjoy these <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations, but due {{to the presence of}} Chern-Simons terms in the supergravity actions these <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations transform not only the p-form potentials but also simultaneously the (p+3)-form field strengths. Thus to obtain the space of inequivalent field strengths from the forementioned subset of integral cohomology we must quotient by these <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations.|$|E

50|$|An {{exception}} {{may occur}} when the space of configurations is itself disconnected, in which case one may {{have the freedom to}} choose to integrate over anysubset of the components. If the disconnected gauge symmetries map the system between disconnected configurations, then there is in general a consistent truncation of a theory in which one integrates only over those connected components that are not related by <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations. In this case the <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformations do not act on the system and do not cause the path integral to vanish.|$|E
25|$|Body {{piercing}} jewelry {{is often}} used for ear piercings, and is selected {{for a variety of}} reasons including the availability of <b>larger</b> <b>gauges,</b> better piercing techniques, and a disdain for mainstream jewelry.|$|R
50|$|Those {{wishing to}} stretch this {{piercing}} to accommodate <b>larger</b> <b>gauge</b> jewelry should wait {{until at least}} two weeks after the initial piercing has fully healed. It is common for a frenum piercing to start to close soon after the jewelry has been removed. A fairly recent piercing may start to close in less than an hour. Temporary removal and replacement (for example, to accommodate a partner who finds it uncomfortable) may mean reinserting with a smaller gauge and then restretching {{to get back to the}} original, <b>larger</b> <b>gauge.</b> This tendency for the piercing to close up will diminish over time.|$|R

50|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, {{a global}} anomaly {{is a type}} of anomaly: in this particular case, it is a quantum effect that invalidates a <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformation that would otherwise be preserved in the classical theory. This leads to an inconsistency in the theory because the space of configurations which is being integrated over in the functional integral involves both a configuration and the same configuration after a <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> transformation has acted upon it and the sum of all such contributions is zero and the space of configurations cannot be split into connected components for which the integral is nonzero.|$|E

50|$|For {{measurements}} of small strain, semiconductor strain gauges, so called piezoresistors, are often preferred over foil gauges.

5000|$|As {{with many}} piercings, there is {{risk of the}} jewelry {{becoming}} caught on clothing and being pulled or torn out. Very <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> or heavy jewelry can cause thinning of the tissue between the urethral opening and the healed fistula resulting in an accidental tearing or other complications with sexual experiences. Conversely, extremely thin jewelry can cause the same tearing in what is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "cheese cutter effect", either during sudden torsion or {{over a long period of}} wearing, especially if the thin jewelry bears any weight.|$|E
50|$|Further {{stretching}} to sizes 0 or 00g (8 or 9mm) and larger is not uncommon. If a sufficiently heavy barbell or ring is worn continuously, a mild form of 'auto-stretching' can be observed.

50|$|This male genital {{piercing}} is {{an extremely}} advanced procedure, and is not done using a needle. Instead a scalpel or occasionally a dermal punch is used to make an incision, which is then followed by suturing the front to the back {{in order to create}} a viable fistula. <b>Large</b> <b>gauge</b> jewelry is usually then inserted into the incision. If the bond between the front and the back of the piercing holds, healing is very quick and easy. Should a bond fail to form, healing can be lengthy and problematic.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{migration}} can vary widely. The {{most common form}} of migration is the way that heavy small gauge earrings will migrate downwards out of the earlobe, as is common in older women who have worn earrings most of their lives. This is known as the [...] "cheesecutter effect", as its action is easily compared to the method of cutting cheese with a fine wire. Contemporary body and ear piercing jewelry is much more balanced in its weight to gauge ratio, although migration is still possible with heavy jewelry, even if it is of <b>large</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{types of}} jewelry {{generally}} are worn in a septum piercing, such as: Captive bead rings (CBRs), rings that {{close with a}} bead held in the center by the tension of the ring, circular barbells (as shown in the picture), a circular bar with a bead that screws onto either end, a [...] "tusk" [...] that is a straight or shaped piece of material generally tapered on either end, or pinchers. For <b>large</b> <b>gauge</b> septums, many individuals choose to wear plugs, as the plugs do not weigh their noses down, which is helpful in healing. This measure allows the piercing not to be damaged by the sudden movement of the jewelry.|$|E
