40|$|Abstract. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) {{provide a}} {{powerful}} instrument for labeling sequences. So far, however, CRFs {{have only been}} considered for labeling sequences over flat alphabets. In this paper, we describe TildeCRF, the first method for training CRFs on <b>logical</b> <b>sequences,</b> i. e., sequences over an alphabet of logical atoms. TildeCRF’s key idea is to use relational regression trees in Dietterich et al. ’s gradient tree boosting approach. Thus, the CRF potential functions are represented as weighted sums of relational regression trees. Experiments show a significant improvement over established results achieved with hidden Markov models and Fisher kernels for <b>logical</b> <b>sequences.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Similarities and distinctions in logical {{structures}} of the Chinese and English languages are due to different but interrelated logical systems of China and the West. We may well say Logics influences translation and monitors {{the whole process of}} translation. In order to make translation more suitable to the target language’s logical system, this paper views from the aspect of logic and discusses some practical and feasible logical translation methods by analyzing examples. The paper puts forward some suggestions on logical text translation. 1) When translating texts showing the three universal laws of Logics, i. e. the law of identity, the law of non-contradiction and the law of excluded middle, and the law of space, translators should translate them according to the <b>logical</b> <b>sequence</b> of the source language. Chinese and English are different in leading inferential modes, therefore, translators should reorganize the <b>logical</b> <b>sequence</b> according to the phenomena that Chinese focus on “induction ” and English focus on “deduction”. 2) When translating texts showing the law of time and the law of cause and effect, translators should also reorganize the <b>logical</b> <b>sequence</b> according to the target language’s features...|$|R

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to improve the}} accuracy of classifications based on generative models is to combine them with successful discriminative algorithms.

Empirically, the combination of hidden Markov models with support vector machines has shown promising results. So far, however, Fisher kernels have only been considered for sequences over flat alphabets. This is mostly {{due to the lack}} of a method for computing the gradient of a generative model over structured sequences. In this paper, we show how to compute the gradient of logical hidden (Markov models), which allow for the modelling of <b>logical</b> <b>sequences,</b> i. e., sequences over an alphabet of logical atoms.
