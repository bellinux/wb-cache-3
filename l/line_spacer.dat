The top of the range was the HW 35E (Export) with a selected walnut stock, palm swell, rosewood pistol grip cap with a white <b>line</b> <b>spacer</b> and a 60mm longer barrel (the longer barrel did not increase power).

40|$|Abstract:- An {{excellent}} {{option to}} the utilities {{has been the}} utilisation of covered cable fixed to the insulator or to the <b>line</b> <b>spacer.</b> However, distribution lines located near the coast are often exposed to marine pollution and then the superficial resistance of the polymeric material can be reduced and leakage current can flow on the polymeric surface. This paper shows the results of investigation considering covered cable and line spacers. By testing the polymeric material, the behaviour of the leakage current {{and the evolution of}} degradation were analysed, aiming the on-line monitoring of the leakage current of line spacers...|$|E
40|$|A Semi-Digital Hadronic Calorimeter (SDHCAL) {{concept has}} been {{proposed}} for future leptonic collider experiments. The multigap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) {{is a candidate for}} the detector planes of this calorimeter. We have constructed three MRPCs of 1 m × 1 m size for tests of the SDHCAL. Two have 4 gas gaps and one has 5 gas gaps. To achieve high granularity for a calorimeter, the signals from the MRPC are readout by 1 × 1 cm 2 pads. The three MRPCs have similar design but the fishing <b>line</b> <b>spacer</b> has different configurations. All three MRPCs were successfully tested in the T 10 test beam facility at CERN with a gas mixture of 95 % C 2 H 2 F 4 and 5 % SF 6.

50|$|Monodisperse glass {{microspheres}} {{have high}} sphericity {{and a very}} tight particle size distribution, often with CV<10% and specification of >95% of particles in size range. Monodisperse glass particles are often used as spacers in adhesives and coatings, such as bond <b>line</b> <b>spacers</b> in epoxies. Just {{a small amount of}} spacer grade monodisperse microspheres can create a controlled gap, as well as define and maintain specified bond <b>line</b> thickness. <b>Spacer</b> grade particles can also be used as calibration standards and tracer particles for qualifying medical devices. High quality spherical glass microspheres are often used in gas plasma displays, automotive mirrors, electronic displays, flip chip technology, filters, microscopy, and electronic equipment.|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{expansion}} of {{a composite of}} epoxy (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) and solid glass microspheres was investigated. The microspheres had surfaces which were either untreated or treated with a silicone release agent, an epoxy coupling agent, or a general purpose silane coupling agent. Both room temperature (about 300 K) and elevated temperature (about 475 K) cures {{were used for the}} epoxy. Two microsphere size ranges were used, about 50 microns, which is applicable in filled moldings, and about 125 microns, which is applicable as bond <b>line</b> <b>spacers.</b> The {{thermal expansion}} of the composites was measured from 300 to 350 K or from 300 to 500 K, depending on the epoxy cure temperature. Measurements were made on composites containing up to. 6 volume fraction microspheres.

40|$|Wake-induced {{oscillations}} (WIO) in {{transmission line}} bundle conductors are simulated using finite-element nonlinear formulation. This allows obtaining the conductor oscillations {{in the line}} spans equipped either with spacers or with spacer dampers. Within this approach, the interaction of subconductors due to the wake is represented using Simpson’s aeroelastic model. A special force element is created to introduce the aerodynamic loads due to the wake. The aeroelastic properties of the wake force field are tuned to meet the wake-induced instability properties as measured by Price. Extension of the wake interaction sample onto the full line span is done {{taking into account the}} inertia-stiffness properties of the <b>line</b> fittings (<b>spacer</b> dampers). It is emphasized that in WIO the ability of spacer (spacer damper) to transfer the loads and motions plays essential role. Thus, the transfer matrix logic to simulate the spacer, established by Diana, Rawlins and other researchers, is now transferred into the finite element model of WIO. Some important structural specifics of transmission line fittings are thus highlighted by the performed simulations. All these developments are introduced into the FE package SAMCEF Mecano. Results of a series of calculations are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the established model. Comparison of FEM simulations to the benchmarking field test data is presented.

50|$|Spacer {{patterning}} is {{a technique}} employed for patterning features with linewidths smaller than {{can be achieved by}} conventional lithography. In the most general sense, the spacer is a layer that is deposited over a pre-patterned feature, often called the mandrel. The spacer is subsequently etched back so that the spacer portion covering the mandrel is etched away while the spacer portion on the sidewall remains. The mandrel may then be removed, leaving two spacers (one for each edge) for each mandrel. The spacers may be further trimmed to narrower widths, especially to act as mandrels for a subsequent 2nd spacer formation. Hence this is a readily practiced form of multiple patterning. Alternatively, one of the two spacers may be removed and the remaining one trimmed to a much smaller final linewidth. Whereas immersion lithography has a resolution of ~40 nm <b>lines</b> and spaces, <b>spacer</b> patterning may be applied to attain 20 nm. This resolution improvement technique is also known as Self-Aligned Double Patterning (SADP). SADP may be re-applied for even higher resolution, and has already been demonstrated for 15 nm NAND flash memory. Spacer patterning has also been adopted for sub-20 nm logic nodes, e.g., 14 nm and 10 nm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the ability and the safety of a series of alkylammonium C 12 -gemini surfactants to act as permeation enhancers for three model drugs, namely lidocaine HCl, caffeine, and ketoprofen. In vitro permeation studies across dermatomed porcine skin were performed over 24 h, after pretreating the skin for 1 h with an enhancer solution 0. 16 M dissolved in propylene glycol. The highest enhancement ratio (enhancement ratio (ER) = 5. 1) was obtained using G 12 - 6 - 12, resulting in a cumulative amount of permeated lidocaine HCl of 156. 5 μg cm− 2. The studies with caffeine and ketoprofen revealed that the most effective gemini surfactant was the one with the shorter spacer, G 12 - 2 - 12. The use of the latter resulted in an ER of 2. 4 and 2. 2 in the passive permeation of caffeine and ketoprofen, respectively. However, Azone was found to be the most effective permeation enhancer for ketoprofen, attaining a total of 138. 4 μg cm− 2 permeated, 2. 7 -fold over controls. This work demonstrates that gemini surfactants are effective in terms of increasing the permeation of drugs, especially in the case of hydrophilic ionized compounds, that do not easily cross the stratum corneum. Skin integrity evaluation studies did not indicate the existence of relevant changes in the skin structure after the use of the permeation enhancers, while the cytotoxicity studies allowed establishing a relative cytotoxicity profile including this class of compounds, single chain surfactants, and Azone. A dependence of the toxicity to HEK and to HDF cell <b>lines</b> on the <b>spacer</b> length of the various gemini molecules was found...|$|R
