Special positions of legs of manipulator can cause the manipulator is not rigid although usually manipulator to be non-rigid if the <b>lenghts</b> of legs are fixed. There are ways to describe self-motion by curve in projective plane given in implicit form (see [1]). To visualize trajectories of self-motion we need a parametrization of this curve.

Oradea is a locality with over two hundred thousands of inhabitants, which means the variability of some phenotipical features must be a large one. Simleu is a smaller locality (has under fifty thousands inhabitants), which means the variability of some phenotipical features is lower than in Oradea. This fact is showed in our study.

We also study the recent Cabibbo’s proposal to measure the ππ scattering <b>lenghts</b> combination a 0 − a 2 from the cusp effect in the π 0 π 0 energy spectrum at threshold for K + → π + π 0 π 0 and KL → π 0 π 0 π 0, and give the relevant formulas to describe it at NLO. For that, we use the NLO CHPT expression to fit the real part of K → 3 π to data while the ππ scattering <b>lenghts</b> are treated non-perturbatively. Using them, we make a quantitative estimate of the theoretical uncertaintity of the a 0 −a 2 determination at NLO in our approach and obtain {{that it is not}} smaller than 5 % if added quadratically and 7 % if linearly for K + → π + π 0 π 0. One gets similar theoretical uncertainties if the neutral KL → π 0 π 0 π 0 decays data below threshold are used instead. For this decay, there are very large theoretical uncertainties above threshold due to cancellations and these data cannot be used to get the scattering <b>lenghts.</b> All the numbers we present are in the isospin limit.

Uskoković serves it with monk-like humility, as if the laws of the language are stronger than the forces of life. Authentic and nonpathetic, hidden behind discreet humour, the writer does all to make sure he is seen less and his world seen more. Archaic man is alive. He came to the city, provided himself with a car, a telephone, a refrigerator. He overlasted, because his language overlasted and brought him to this day. Literature knows not for secondary languages, secondary people and secondary human destinies. Once again it showed that a man is only what can be discovered based on language. Uskoković protagonist shows himself as the one that earlier wouldn’t be fit for public, or the books, for that matter. When he was supposed to present himself, he would always groom himself, wear a disguise, put on a make-up. All that to be worthy of a memory. But by doing so, he would let himself down, stray from the life and the truth. But, just as the mountain stream carries the card box, the current of the language carries the loanword or it’s twisted form. It is enough just to guess the first word—and Uskoković’s stories are a testament to that—and other words will follow, in accordance with supreme laws and lingual habbits.” ...|$|E

One of the ways which gradually introduces those who exercise into the practise is to set the tempo of running at a level 20 % higher than the current abilities for the whole <b>lenght</b> of a distance, and the <b>lenght</b> of the running sections should be about 20 % of the entire <b>lenght</b> of the distance. Total amount of the running sections should be 20 % longer than the <b>lenght</b> of the entire distance.
