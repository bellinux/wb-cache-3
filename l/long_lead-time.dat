It was a staffing model used by the D.C. fire department in the 1960s and 1970s, and marked a change from the then-current practice of a single 24-hour shift followed by three days off (known as 24/72). Ellerbe claimed it would reduce staffing costs by $36 million a year after four years, and increase days worked per month to 22 from eight. Because about 40 percent of the city's firefighters lived 30 to 100 miles away, the plan also encouraged firefighters to move closer to Washington, D.C. This would enable the city to recall off-duty firefighters more quickly in an emergency, he said. The union, Local 36, IAFF, strongly opposed the plan. It said firefighters' salaries ($44,300 for a new hire, and $65,500 for a 20-year veteran) were too low to allow firefighters to live {{in or near the}} District of Columbia.

40|$|Jewelry retail {{companies}} like Fred Meyer Jewelers employ direct marketing such as mailing lists and catalogs {{as a primary}} means to promote products, maintain customer relationships, and drive sale growths. Most jewelry customers, however, do not purchase frequently – they make {{only a limited number}} of purchases at special times with <b>long</b> <b>lead-times</b> between purchases. This has created a series of challenging problems for the marketing team at these jewelry stores in a) predicting when and what the customer purchases, and b) deciding what customers to be targeted so as to maximize the return on investment in the design of market campaigns. This research aims to provide data analytics and mathematical models to the above market campaign optimization problem. The methodology is particularly designed to uncover the special times or events such as birthdays and anniversaries, which are unique to each customer, yet not available to the jewelry retailers. In a nut shell, the methodology is composed of several steps as follows. First, to mine these hidden intrinsic attributes, a time-based sequential pattern model is developed to discover customer shopping patterns (rules) and the lead-times between left-hand and right-hand purchases in these patterns. Second, innovative analytics have been developed to calculate each customer’s probability of purchase in various categories and expected market value or profit in future campaigns based on their purchase history and time-sequential pattern applicable to them. Third, based on the aggregation from these expected purchases, the methodology provides a quantitative customer market value that captures recency, frequency, and monetary measurements. Finally, an integer program model is developed that takes each customer’s expected market value in future campaigns as the input and optimizes the allocation of mailers to customers over multiple campaigns over the course of the year to maximize revenue. A decision support system based on the proposed methodology has been used for direct-mail marketing campaigns in Fred Meyer Jewelers since February, 2014. It has provided an effective and rationalized system and has significantly lifted customer redemption rate and increased jewelry revenues. A comparison of the same campaigns between 2013 and 2015 has shown an increase in revenue from $ 33 M to $ 44 M, or 33 %. This increase has been achieved while the number of direct mailers has dropped from 5. 6 million in 2013 to 2. 8 million in 2015. The annual redemption rate has nearly tripled from 1. 95 % to 5. 40 %. The methodology has been a significant contributor to the increase in baseline performance of Fred Meyer Jewelers and could be applicable to other industries, such as consumer electronics, where <b>long</b> <b>lead-times</b> are present...|$|R

In addition, we use the customer choice model to characterize the risk-pooling, demand-induction and-cannibalization effects; with both analytical results and numerical experiments, we demonstrate the profit improvement by allowing a dynamic inventory-commitment policy. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{background}} to this thesis is the dynamics {{and institutions of}} the fashion world. They have developed out of reasons of convenience and on the whole they work, but there are possibilities of improvement. Time from style and colour-direction to market is up to 18 months, from design to market 12 months and from forecast to market six months. With such <b>long</b> <b>lead-times,</b> {{there will be a}} few inherited problems such as matching supply and demand and offering sizes to people with non-standard body shapes. Some of the problems are related to mass and volumes, it is simply not possible to produce garments that fit everybody’s needs and to keep them in stock. The result of the <b>long</b> <b>lead-times</b> and need for mass and volume is low forecast performance, a forecast error of ± 40 % six months prior to the season is not unusual, which in turn leads to a sell-through percentage of about 60 percent. To adress some the problems of the fashion world a research initiative called Knit on Demand has been developed. It is a research project at the Swedish School of Textiles, in collaboration with the knitwear manufaturer Ivanhoe AB and the fashion retailer SOMconcept AB. The purpose of the project was to “…develop and test a new production and logistic solution for agility in customer relations. ” To fulfill the purpose of the project, a supply chain for customised knitwear was set up and then tested. Customers customised and bought their garments at SOMconcept in Stockholm; the order was then transferred to Ivanhoe who produced the garment and then delivered it to the customer within a couple of weeks. The supply chain has been analysed on supply chain performance, customer behaviour, design and technology. In addition to the Knit on Demand supply chain, SOMconcept’s other products have been analysed and a simulation of Shima Seikis Ordermade system has been performed. The methods in the thesis are mostly qualitative with elements of quantitativeness. An action research methodology was applied to develop the project and then a number of case studies and simulations. The results show that most of the customers that are purchasing mass customised garments are niche customers that would have problems finding garments that fit them in the conventional fashion outlet. Important to the customers are service in the store and the experience of customising their garments. Since a mass customisation concept works on niche markets it would benefit from the Long Tail economy that gives better access to niche customers. Sponsorship : KK-stiftelsen</p...|$|R
30|$|Community {{education}} programs are a passive educational {{process of the}} Victorian government that ostensibly fulfil requirements under the Act. The programs are designed in coordination with other educational programs run by individual councils, those programs generally targeting school-age children and their guardians. Community {{education programs}} typically focus on safety around dogs with a particular focus on preventing the human incidence of dog bite and attack in the community, together with general advice on responsible dog ownership. Importantly, the programs usually focus on human welfare rather than the prevention of dog-to-dog bites and attacks.

Due to each Plan’s four year duration and the inconsistent commitment to resourcing animal management across councils, these documented council-run education programs may bear little relation to what education programs councils actually implement. Consequently, the Victorian government’s reliance on these programs in the formulation of their community education programs inadvertently exposes the community to gaps in awareness and a heightened risk of dog bite.

The objective is to investigate inventory policy, raw material ordering policy, production planning and scheduling policy, in the face of demand uncertainty, raw material arrival uncertainty and in-process failure. The tactics being explored include segmenting the serial flow line with decoupling buffers to protect against demand and raw material arrival uncertainty, and production smoothing to reduce production-related costs and the variance in upstream processes. Key policies for each segment include a work release policy from the decoupling buffer before the segment, and a production control policy to manage work-in-process inventory level within the segment and to meet inventory targets in each downstream decoupling buffer. We also explore raw material ordering policy with fixed ordering times, <b>long</b> <b>lead-times</b> and staggered deliveries in a make-to-order setting. A tactical model has been developed to capture the key uncertainties and to determine the operating tactics through analysis and optimization.
