Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.|$|E
50|$|Although maggot {{therapy has}} been used in the US for the past 80 years, it was {{approved}} by the FDA as a “medical device” only in 2004 (along with leeches in the same year).

Maggots were used in medicine before this time, but were not federally regulated. In 1990, California internist Dr. Ronald Sherman began treating patients with maggots produced at his lab at the UC Irvine School of Medicine. Sherman went on to co-found Monarch Labs in 2005, which UC Irvine contracted to produce maggots for Sherman's own continuing clinical research on myiasis at the university. Monarch Labs also sells maggots to hospitals and other medical practices, the first US commercial supplier to do so since the last one closed in 1935.|$|E

50|$|Despite not obtaining private {{partnership}} {{funding to}} start with the renovation process, the municipality decided {{to start with}} construction and on June 6, 2016 construction workers entered the space with an excavator. The workers were confronted by users and conflict escalated into violence and clash with security guards. Through this action they established a construction site preventing their construction permit to expire. Rog users are claiming that municipality would just demolish buildings and establish a new construction pit in Ljubljana, without progressing into renovation due to lack of funding. Such construction pit would again make the space abandoned and it is unclear for how many more years it would stay like that. As a consequence, users are claiming that the conditions of them leaving have not been fulfilled, especially because the legal contract have never been made to formalize the conditions, so temporary use never got into the effect. Moreover, since 2006, when the first informal arrangement was made, the Rog factory has shown {{that there is a need}} for such alternative and grass-root space in the city, and circumstances changed.

To our surprise, DBA 1 /j mice were highly resistant to hydrosalpinx following an intravaginal {{infection with}} C. muridarum although these mice were as susceptible to lower genital tract infection as other mouse strains. A significantly lower level of C. muridarum organisms was recovered from the oviduct of DBA 1 /j mice, correlating the resistance to hydrosalpinx with reduced ascension of C. muridarum to the oviduct. The DBA 1 /j resistance to hydrosalpinx was effectively overcome by intracervical inoculation with C. muridarum. The intracervically inoculated DBA 1 /j mice developed severe hydrosalpinx with {{the highest levels of}} live C. muridarum organisms recovered from uterine tissue on day 3 and oviduct tissue on day 7 post inoculation while in intravaginally inoculated DBA 1 /j mice, the peak of <b>live</b> <b>organism</b> recovery from uterine tissue was delayed to day 7 with no rise in the amount of live organisms recovered from the oviduct.
