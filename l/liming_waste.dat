40|$|Sulphides beared in tannery {{wastewater}} are harmful pollutant which beturned to disastrous {{hydrogen sulphide}} gas under acidic circumtances. The previous study on Sulphides Oxydation System of varied catalist (MnSO 4) added has not indicated a satisfactory result yet. The main {{objective of this}} study is to verify the merit of Mn++ dosage based on the sulphides content. Futher, whether or not it will be useful to optimize the oxydation process and economize the daily cost of tannery wastewater treatment. The data of sulpides content monitored during 12 hours oxidation period showed that there was significant difference between the curve (sulpides vs time) with Mn++ and the curve without Mn++ treated as the control. When a foamy oxydated wastewater appeared such as <b>liming</b> <b>waste</b> it would be a problem and the foam should be removed in such a way that not to be harmfull to the oxidation and other chemical processes. However, anti foam substance must be provided or introduced to clean Technology in the system. The experiment, observation and chemical tests data of this study gives proves the advantages of adding Mn++ in sulphides oxidation system. The catalist adding based on the sulphides content can be considered realistic...|$|E
40|$|In soil sampled after {{a two-year}} pot experiment, the {{activity}} of urease and dehydrogenase and content of nitrogen have been determined. The experiment included three factors: 1. the amount of nickel added to the soil (0, 75, 150 and 225 mg · kg- 1 of soil), 2. liming (0 and Ca according to 1 Hh hydrolytic acidity), 3. organic materials (straw of rye and brown coal). Test plant was cocksfoot, which four cuts were collected in each growing season. It was found that nickel added to the soli in dose of 75 mg · kg- 1 activates enzymes studied, whereas higher doses cause them explicit deactivation. Both <b>liming</b> and <b>waste</b> organic materials limited the negative effect of higher doses of nickel on the activity of dehydrogenase and urease.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the influence of}} <b>liming</b> and <b>waste</b> organic materials on the yield and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents in cock’s-foot (Dactylis glomerata L.) grown on nickel-contaminated soil {{in the third year}} of a pot culture experiment. In the experiment, the following factors were taken into consideration: (1) nickel soil contamination (0, 75, 150 and 225 mg Ni·kg− 1 of soil); (2) liming (0 Ca and Ca according to 1 Hh of soil) and (3) organic materials (no waste organic materials added, brown coal from a coal mine in Turów and rye straw). Introducing nickel into the soil, regardless of its amount, caused a significant decrease in the total yield of cock’s-foot and increased the nitrogen and potassium contents. Liming caused {{a significant increase in the}} yield of cock’s-foot and decrease its potassium content, but it did not clearly differentiate the nitrogen and phosphorus content. The used organic materials (straw and brown coal) caused a decrease in the phosphorus content in the grass biomass...|$|R
30|$|In this perspective, the {{composting}} process has a big applicability potential in agriculture for being a low-cost investment and for presenting high efficiency and speed at the nutrient cycling process of several organic <b>wastes</b> (<b>Lim</b> et al. 2016). It is estimated that in each year, {{a third of all}} food produced in the world to human consumption is lost or wasted before being consumed (FAO 2011). Besides this, the agricultural sector produces high amounts of animal manures, and frequently does not reused. According to Cordell et al. (2009), on the 2000 s, more than 7 million tons of phosphorus were released annually in the environment through animal manures, likely to cause serious environmental problems.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{composition}} of organic waste (OW) {{and its effect}} on soil processes may change soil fertility and electrical conductivity (EC). The side effects of waste use in crop fertilization are poorly understood for Brazilian soils. This study examined the effect of the addition of 15 different organic wastes to Oxisols and a Neosol on pH, base saturation, EC, cation exchange capacity (CEC at pH 7), and the availability of Al, macro (P, K, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and S) and micronutrients (B, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +). Soil samples (150 g) were treated with chicken, pig, horse, cattle, and quail manures, sewage sludge 1 and 2, eucalyptus sawdust, plant substrate, coconut fiber, pine bark, coffee husk, peat, limed compost, and biochar. Wastes were added considering a fixed amount of C (2 g kg- 1), which resulted in waste rates ranging from 2. 5 to 25. 6 Mg ha- 1. The soil-waste mixtures were incubated for 330 days in laboratory conditions. The <b>waste</b> <b>liming</b> or acidification values were soil-dependent. The use of some manures and compost increased the pH to levels above of those considered adequate for plant growth. The soil EC was slightly increased in the Neosol and in the medium textured Oxisol, but it was sharply changed (from 195 to 394 µS cm- 1) by the addition of organic wastes in the clayey Oxisol, although the EC values were below the range considered safe for plant growth. Changes in the soil availability of P, K+, Ca 2 + and Zn 2 + were highly related to the inputs of these nutrients by the wastes, and other factors in soil changed due to waste use. Organic waste use simultaneously affects different soil fertility attributes; thus, in addition to the target nutrient added to the soil, the soil acidity buffering capacity and the <b>waste</b> <b>liming</b> and agronomic value {{must be taken into account}} in the waste rate definition...|$|R

PKR Deputy President Syed Husin Ali {{alleged that the}} Commission was [...] "colluding with BN to allow cheating in the coming general elections," [...] and claimed that this was proof the government felt the Opposition would perform well on polling day. Dzulkifli Ahmad, a PAS and BERSIH leader, said that both organisations opposed the move, and that [...] "We {{want to make it}} clear that we are entering this election under protest". Dzulkifli added that BERSIH would file a complaint after polling day. Lim Guan Eng declared that the decision would only benefit the ruling coalition, and demanded an explanation for the claim of adverse effects on public security: [...] "It is ridiculous that the use of indelible ink can put the whole country into chaos and ruination."

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{aerobic incubation}} study was performed during 18 weeks under controlled conditions {{to assess the}} effects of applying different doses of pulp mill inorganic wastes on the physical–chemical properties of an acid Dystric Cambissol. Three different inorganic wastes were tested – wood ash, dregs and grits, and an agriculture limestone was used as reference. Results showed that increasing the dose applied of the different inorganic wastes tested always led to significant raises of soil pH at different incubation times demonstrating that its use as alternative-liming materials could be a valid and less expensive option {{to the use of}} commercial agricultural limestone. Moreover, no immediate concerns seem to be expected related to soil exchangeable sodium (Na) content, at least for the doses needed to increase soil pH until the targeted value 6. 5. Particularly for wood ash a pronounced increase on soil extractable potassium and phosphorous was observed, indicating that besides the <b>liming</b> effect this <b>waste</b> can contribute to improve soil fertility by supplying significant available amounts of these nutrients. Finally, metals {{do not seem to be}} a limiting factor for the application to land of these byproduct...|$|R
40|$|Winter barley {{were grown}} under field {{conditions}} during the 2004 growing season and residual influences of <b>liming</b> with carbocalk (<b>waste</b> of sugar factory) and phosphorus fertilization with MAP (monoammonium phosphate) were tested. By using the lowest lime rate (15 t ha − 1) barley yield was increased by 30 %. Overliming (90 t ha − 1) resulted by significant yield decreases in comparison with application 15 and 30 t of lime. Using of 45 and more lime per hectare protein contents was significantly increased. In general, liming considerably influenced on grain composition of barley. For example, by application of the lowest lime rate, grain P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mo and Na significantly increased {{in comparison with the}} control. Differences of grain composition among lime treatments were mainly non-significant. Ameliorative P fertilization significantly increased grain yields of barley up to 25 % in comparison with the control. In general, grain composition differences among applied treatments were mainly non-significant because significant differences only for P and Mn (increasing trend due to P application) as well as for Zn and Mo (decreasing trend) were found...|$|R
40|$|Acid {{soils are}} {{widespread}} in the Eastern Croatia. In general, liming of these soils is a usual recommnedation for their improvement. The first report with regard to liming in Croatia appeared more than 200 years ago. cited the report of an unknown author (Anonimous, 1789). Five experiments were conducted under field conditions in the last 25 years period with purpose of more explanation of this problem. Three experiments were conducted and tested during decade period of 80 -ies at last century and they included liming with hydrated lime up to 10 t/ha and calcite up to 32 t/ha. In general, maize, soybean and barley grain yields increased due to liming by 10 % or less than 10 %, while wheat showed no response to lime application. Also, the effects of liming were differently expressed depending on the soil characteristics and the year of testing. <b>Liming</b> with carbocalk (<b>waste</b> of sugar factory: about 37 % CaO) used in three experiments. Depending on the experiment, yield increases as affected by carbocalk application (15, 30 and 60 t/ha) were 23 %, 100 % and 43 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{evaluated}} four waste limestones mined in the Minas Gerais State, Brazil, and {{its potential}} as soil acidity amendments and its effects upon soil fertility attributes. Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were performed at the University Centre of Formiga (UNIFOR), with Oxisols collected under native conditions. A randomly experimental design was set with four replications, five <b>liming</b> materials (four <b>waste</b> limestones products + a mix pure product, to comparison) applied in two liming rates (50 % and 70 % of base saturation), and a control plot (no lime applied). Each liming material was characterized with respect to CaO(%), MgO(%), and micronutrients Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn contents by atomic absorption spectrophotometer and the mineralogy by X-ray diffractometry. Results indicated that all liming materials tested {{could be classified as}} supplemental source of calcium and magnesium and caused an increase in soil pH, soil Ca and Mg, and base saturation levels, whereas aluminum saturation decreased. Dolomite, calcite and quartz are major minerals. Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn were found in trace-amounts in all waste limestones, which was considered typical for such products. Considering the improvement of chemical characteristics and increase soil fertility, the use of waste limestone is an alternative that allows the use of commercial discarded material in small properties...|$|R
