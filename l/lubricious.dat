50|$|In {{the later}} 1920s Harold frequented the London salon of Lady Cunard, where {{at various times}} he {{encountered}} Ezra Pound, Joseph Duveen and the Irish novelist George Moore.

The nuns struggle with their vows of celibacy, some inclining to lesbianism whilst others invite male lovers secretly into their cells. Meanwhile, a corrupt church hopes to benefit from an aristocratic donation to the Convent, before launching an inquisition into the <b>lubricious</b> and corrupt activities of the inmates of the Convent. There then follow graphic scenes of torture as miscreant nuns are stripped naked and tortured with a variety of devices in order to elicit a confession of their misdemanours.

5000|$|In 1973, Ferzetti {{appeared}} in the TV movie, Divorce His, Divorce Hers, under Waris Hussein, and Hitler: The Last Ten Days, a British-Italian produced picture directed by Ennio De Concini. Ferzetti {{played the role of}} Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel opposite Alec Guinness (Adolf Hitler), Simon Ward, Adolfo Celi, and Diane Cilento. The following year of 1974, he again {{appeared in}} a World War II picture, this time the controversial arthouse classic about the Holocaust, The Night Porter, working under director Liliana Cavani. He starred alongside Dirk Bogarde and Charlotte Rampling and played Hans, a psychiatrist, one of his most notable roles. The film depicts the political continuity between wartime Nazism and post-war Europe, and the psychological continuity of characters locked into compulsive repetition of the past. Given the film's dark and disturbing themes, and a somewhat ambiguous moral clarification at the end, The Night Porter has tended to divide audiences and was accused of mere sensationalism.

5000|$|Because {{the images}} of Shakespeare are either {{doubtful}} in provenance or lacking expression, no one image seems to reconcile well with readers' imaginations. The relatively dusky features have caused repeated comment, often of a racist nature. George Steevens said that the picture gave Shakespeare [...] "the complexion of a Jew, or rather that of a chimney sweeper in the jaundice". According to Ben Macintyre, [...] "Some Victorians recoiled {{at the idea that}} the Chandos portrait represented Shakespeare. One critic, J. Hain Friswell, insisted 'one cannot readily imagine our essentially English Shakespeare to have been a dark, heavy man, with a foreign expression'." [...] Friswell agreed with Steevens that the portrait had [...] "a decidedly Jewish physiognomy" [...] adding that it displayed [...] "a somewhat <b>lubricious</b> mouth, red-edged eyes" [...] and [...] "wanton lips, with a coarse expression." [...] According to Ernest Jones, the portrait convinced Sigmund Freud that Shakespeare was French; [...] "He insisted that his countenance could not be that of an Anglo-Saxon but must be French, and he suggested that the name was a corruption of Jacques Pierre." [...] The Iraqi writer Safa Khulusi argued that its [...] "un-English" [...] look and [...] "Islamic beard" [...] was evidence for his theory that Shakespeare was an Arab. However, assuming the portrait to be genuinely of Shakespeare, there is no real reason to accept the truth of any such claims. Sixteenth and seventeenth-century Englishmen came {{in a wide variety of}} shapes, sizes and complexions, reflecting the mixed ancestry of Anglo-Saxon, Irish, British, Viking, Norman, Roman, French and many other ethnic sources.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} used in the works and the colours and forms changing according to the spectator’s perspective, are as it were, the traces which declare {{that the act of}} creation has been democratised. Theoretically, when looked at by different individuals at the same time, the work that each spectator sees by representing only one out of infinite possibilities will offer a new dimension and reality in each instance. In this sense, it is possible to say that Bulanda directly associates the spectator at the exhibition space with the eye in her work and the one creating the work is entirely ‘the gaze’ of the spectator in parallel with Schrödinger’s experiment. Besides having defined the act of gaze as a power relation, Bulanda uses this metaphor as a reflection of current political atmosphere. Now the eye points to the stranglehold of the ‘man in power’ while the variational and <b>lubricious</b> space on the toile indicates the distorted ‘reality’. It becomes possible to see the traces of süper modernity on the surfaces where real and fiction, rational and irrational blend together. Especially the indistinct architectural structure in which the works turn into spaces that capture ‘the spirit of time’ as well as carrying out the traces of thoughts which Auge conceptualised as ‘non-place’. The essential question for the spectator lies in the intersection of these narratives. Following the established logic, is it possible to centralise the concept of ‘power’ if man is both the master of the reality which he has created by his own gaze and the victim of the gaze (reality) imposed to himself? If not, is it meaningful to fight against ‘man in power’ or where is the field of conflict?Having revealed or recognised all of these relations, would a change be possible or would life continue as aware cynical subjects?All of these questions will find their answers in the reality created by the eyes gazing at Bulanda’s work or surrender to a metanarrative.|$|E

Poly (trimethylene carbonate) networks are relatively hydrophobic. To create a <b>lubricious</b> layer, methacrylated poly(ethylene glycol) and methoxy-poly(ethylene glycol) were grafted onto poly(trimethylene carbonate) networks by photo-crosslinking. After conditioning for 24 h in water, no delamination was observed, showing that the grafted hydrophilic layers were covalently attached to the poly(trimethylene carbonate) network. The lubricating properties were assessed by means of friction experiments, and the friction coefficients with relevant biomaterials were determined.
