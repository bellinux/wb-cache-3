5|$|Some octopuses, such as {{the mimic}} octopus, can combine their highly {{flexible}} bodies with their colour-changing ability to mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as <b>lionfish,</b> sea snakes, and eels.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live in a complex, relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as <b>lionfish</b> have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{instances}} of larger <b>lionfish</b> individuals engaging in cannibalism on smaller individuals, adult <b>lionfish</b> have few identified natural predators, likely from {{the effectiveness of}} their venomous spines. Moray eels (family Muraenidae), bluespotted cornetfish (Fistularia commersonii), and large groupers, like the tiger grouper (Mycteroperca tigris) and Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), have been observed preying on <b>lionfish.</b> It remains unknown, however, how commonly these predators prey on <b>lionfish.</b> Sharks are also believed to be capable of preying on <b>lionfish</b> with no ill effects from their spines. Park officials of the Roatan Marine Park in Honduras have attempted to train sharks to feed on <b>lionfish</b> as of 2011 in an attempt to control the invasive populations in the Caribbean. Predators of larvae and juvenile <b>lionfish</b> remain unknown, but may prove to be the primary limiting factor of <b>lionfish</b> populations in their native range.|$|E
50|$|Venom {{can also}} be found in some fish, such as the {{cartilaginous}} fishes - stingrays, sharks, and chimaeras - and the teleost fishes including onejaws, catfishes, stonefishes and waspfishes, scorpionfishes and <b>lionfishes,</b> gurnards, rabbitfishes, dragonets, surgeonfishes, scats, stargazers, weever, and swarmfish.|$|R
50|$|On 2 June {{she started}} her second war patrol, and on 10 July fired torpedoes at a {{surfaced}} Japanese submarine, after which <b>Lionfishs</b> crew heard explosions and observed smoke through their periscope. She subsequently fired on two more Japanese submarines and ended her second and last war patrol performing lifeguard duty (the rescue of downed fliers) {{off the coast of}} Japan. When hostilities ended on 15 August she headed for San Francisco and was decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard on 16 January 1946.|$|R
50|$|P. radiata {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 24 cm, though a more usual size is 20 cm. The dorsal fin has 12 or 13 long, venomous spines and 10 to 12 soft rays. The anal fin has three spines and five or six soft rays. The large {{pectoral}} fins flare {{out to the side}} and are clear and unbanded. The other fins are also colourless. The head and body colour is reddish-brown with about six vertical dark bands of different colour on the body separated by thin white lines. Two white horizontal lines occur on the caudal peduncle which distinguishes this fish from other similar <b>lionfishes.</b>|$|R
25|$|The red <b>lionfish</b> {{is found}} off the East Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States {{and in the}} Caribbean Sea, and was likely first {{introduced}} off the Florida coast by the early to mid-1990s. This introduction may have occurred in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew destroyed an aquarium in southern Florida, releasing six <b>lionfish</b> into Biscayne Bay. However, a <b>lionfish</b> was discovered {{off the coast of}} Dania Beach, south Florida, as early as 1985, before Hurricane Andrew. The <b>lionfish</b> resemble those of the Philippines, implicating the aquarium trade. The <b>lionfish</b> may have been purposely discarded by unsatisfied aquarium enthusiasts. This is in part because <b>lionfish</b> require an experienced aquarist, but are often sold to novices who find their care too difficult. In 2001, NOAA documented several sightings of <b>lionfish</b> off the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Bermuda, and Delaware. In August 2014, when the Gulf Stream was discharging into the mouth of the Delaware Bay, two <b>lionfish</b> were caught by a surf fisherman off the ocean side shore of Cape Henlopen State Park: one red one that weighed 1 pound 4.5 ounces and one common one that weighed 1 pound 2 ounces. Three days later a 1-pound 3 ounce red <b>lionfish</b> was caught off the shore of Broadkill Beach which is in the Delaware Bay approximately 15 miles north of Cape Henlopen State Park. <b>Lionfish</b> were first detected in the Bahamas in 2004. In June 2013 <b>lionfish</b> were discovered as far east as Barbados, and as far south as the Los Roques Archipelago and many Venezuelan continental beaches. <b>Lionfish</b> were first sighted in Brazilian waters in late 2014. Genetic testing on a single captured individual revealed that it was related to the populations found in the Caribbean, suggesting larval dispersal rather than an intentional release.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, zebra <b>lionfish</b> that {{detect the}} {{presence}} of small prey fishes flare up their fins as an invitation to other zebra <b>lionfish,</b> or even to another species of <b>lionfish</b> (Pterois antennata), to join them in better cornering the prey and taking turns at striking the prey so that every individual hunter ends up with similar capture rates.|$|E
25|$|Long-term culling {{has also}} been {{recorded}} to cause behavior changes in <b>lionfish</b> populations. For example, in the Bahamas, <b>lionfish</b> on heavily culled reefs have become more wary of divers and hide more within the reef structure during the day when culling occurs. Similar <b>lionfish</b> responses to divers have been observed when comparing culled sites and sites without culling in Honduras, including altered <b>lionfish</b> behaviour on reefs too deep for regular culling, but adjacent to heavily culled sites potentially implying movement of individuals between depths.|$|E
50|$|The Rare Fish Exhibit {{is a large}} exhibit {{separated}} into three rooms which exhibits rare fauna and flora of the red sea in medium sizd aquriums. The first two rooms feature animals such as <b>lionfishes,</b> Red Sea clownfish, star fish, rare corals, moray eels, lobsters, sea horses and more. In the exhibit there is a total of 250 species, featured in 35 medium aquariums. Some of the animals in the exhibit are endemic to the Red Sea, and are in the observatory park for means of breeding and conservation. The sea horse conservation program is a success, and since 2002 thousands sea horses has been released into the Red Sea. Despite the animals the aquariums are designed to mimic the animals' natural habitat and thus educate visitors about different marine biomes and habitats.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this field guide is to provide {{information}} on nonindigenous (i. e., non-native) fishes that have been observed in Florida’s marine waters. Introductions of non-native marine fishes into Florida’s waters could be intentional or unintentional, and are likely {{from a variety of}} sources, including aquarium releases, escape from aquaculture, loss due to extreme weather events (e. g., flooding from hurricanes), and possibly transfer with ballast water or hull-fouling. Presently the <b>lionfishes</b> (Pterois volitans and P. miles) are the only non-native marine fish species known to be established along the coast of Florida. All other marine fishes in this guide (except the euryhaline species, see below) have infrequent occurrences, occur singly or in small groups, and have not yet become self-sustaining populations. Aquarium releases are one of the major pathways whereby nonindigenous fishes gain access to new environments (Ruiz et al. 1997; Fuller et al. 1999). Most of the nonindigenous marine fishes found in Florida’s waters are thought to be aquarium fishes that either were illegally released into the ocean or escaped captivity (e. g., during severe storm/flooding events). Indeed, south Florida is a hotspot for nonindigenous marine aquarium fishes (Semmens et al. 2004). Increased public awareness of the problems caused by released or escaped aquarium fishes may aid in stemming the frequency of releases. For example, HabitattitudeTM (www. habitattitude. net) is a national public awareness and partnership campaign that encourages aquarists and water gardeners to prevent the release of unwanted aquarium plants, fish and other animals. It prompts hobbyists to adopt alternative actions when dealing with these aquatic plants and animals. (PDF file contains 133 pages.) ...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study}} of {{biogeography}} and ecology, genetic population structure, and molecular phylogeny of fishes on coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba and northern Red Sea. Ecological and genetic pattern are compared on different spatial scales and molecular markers add a temporal scale to study of evolutionary processes. Biogeographic analysis supported the differentiation of the Arabian sub-province from the Indian Ocean, but the affiliation of the Arabian Gulf is not clear. The analysis of the genetic population structure based on the mtDNA control region revealed homogenity between populations of Pterois miles in the Gulf of Aqaba and northern Red Sea and indicate high levels of gene flow. Investigations on interrupted gene flow in the evolutionary history of <b>lionfishes</b> (Scorpaenidae) revealed a differentiation between the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. Phylogenetic analysis of cyt b and 16 S rDNA sequences of the siblings P. miles and P. volitans suggest a divergence time of 2. 4 - 8. 3 million years. This coincide with tectonic events and sea level changes in Southeast Asia during the glacial maxima. Additionally, this genetic study gave indications for taxonomic revision of the genera Pterois and Dendrochirus. Ecological studies on the shore fishes off the Jordanian coast showed that fish species richness was positively correlated with hard substrate cover and benthic diversity. Abundance of corallivores was positively linked to live coral cover. The multivariate analysis of the fish community has revealed several associations of fishes in different habitats, such as deep and shallow reef slope. The northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba and its western shores are particularly subject to human disturbances. Fish abundance at an industrial site was 50 % lower than on an undisturbed reef and the trophic community structure was different...|$|R
25|$|Rigorous and {{repeated}} removal of <b>lionfish</b> from invaded waters could potentially control the exponential {{expansion of the}} <b>lionfish</b> in invaded waters. A 2010 study showed effective maintenance would require the monthly harvest of at least 27% of the adult population. Because <b>lionfish</b> are able to reproduce monthly, this effort must be maintained throughout the entire year.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{stonefish}} {{which can}} shoot venom, the <b>lionfish</b> can only release venom when something strikes its spines. Although not {{native to the}} US coast, <b>lionfish</b> have appeared around Florida and have spread up the coast to New York. They are attractive aquarium fish, sometimes used to stock ponds, {{and may have been}} washed into the sea during a hurricane. <b>Lionfish</b> can aggressively dart at scuba divers and attempt to puncture the facemask with their venomous spines.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>lionfish</b> thrive {{so well in}} the Atlantic and the Caribbean due to nutrient-rich {{waters and}} lack of predators, the species has spread tremendously. A single <b>lionfish,</b> located on a reef, reduced young {{juvenile}} reef fish populations by 79%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lionfish</b> are edible if {{prepared}} correctly (see below).|$|E
25|$|In 2014 at Jardines de la Reina National Marine Park in Cuba, a diver {{experimented with}} spearing and feeding <b>lionfish</b> to sharks {{in an effort}} to teach them to seek out the fish as prey. However, by 2016, Cuba was finding it more {{effective}} to fish for <b>lionfish</b> as food.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lionfish</b> {{could be}} {{decreasing}} Atlantic reef diversity {{by up to}} 80%. In July 2011, <b>lionfish</b> were reported {{for the first time}} in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary off the coast of Louisiana. Sanctuary officials said they believe the species will be a permanent fixture, but hope to monitor and possibly limit their presence.|$|E
25|$|Even to {{accomplish}} these numbers seems unlikely, but as populations of <b>lionfish</b> {{continue to grow}} throughout the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, actions are being taken to attempt to control the quickly growing numbers. In November 2010, {{for the first time}} the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary began licensing divers to kill <b>lionfish</b> inside the sanctuary in an attempt to eradicate the fish.|$|E
25|$|Parasites of <b>lionfish</b> {{have rarely}} been {{observed}} and {{are assumed to}} be infrequent. They include isopods and leeches.|$|E
25|$|Common {{interesting}} animals {{around the}} wreck are tuna, barracuda, batfish, moray eel, <b>lionfish,</b> stonefish, crocodilefish, scorpionfish, and sea turtle.|$|E
25|$|An active {{eradication}} {{program has}} resulted in the removal of invasive Casuarina trees and agave from Loggerhead Key, by cutting and herbicide treatment. Pterois, commonly known as <b>lionfish,</b> have also been found in the park's waters and the National Park Service was reviewing (in 2015) the <b>lionfish</b> management plan to determine what actions to take to manage the spread of this invasive species in Dry Tortugas National Park and Everglades National Park.|$|E
25|$|Red <b>lionfish</b> are an {{invasive}} species, yet {{relatively little}} is known about them. NOAA has research foci include investigating biotechnical solutions for control of the population, and understanding how the larvae are dispersed. Another important area of study is what controls the population in its native area. Researchers hope to discover what moderates <b>lionfish</b> populations in the Indo-Pacific and apply this information to control the invasive populations, without introducing additional invasive species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lionfish</b> {{have also}} {{established}} themselves {{in parts of}} the Mediterranean with Pterois miles being found in the waters around Cyprus and Malta.|$|E
25|$|Conservation {{groups and}} {{community}} {{organizations in the}} Eastern United States have organized hunting expeditions for Pterois such as the Environment Education Foundation's ‘lionfish derby’ held annually in Florida. Divemasters from Cozumel to the Honduran Bay Islands and at Reef Conservation International which operates in the Sapodilla Cayes Marine Reserve off Punta Gorda, Belize, now routinely spear them during dives. However, while diver culling removes <b>lionfish</b> from shallow reefs reducing their densities, <b>lionfish</b> have widely been reported on mesophotic coral ecosystems (reefs from 30–150 m) in the western Atlantic and even in deep-sea habitats (greater than 200 m depth). Recent {{studies have suggested that}} the effects of culling are likely to be depth-specific, and so have limited impacts on these deeper reef populations. Therefore other approaches such as trapping are advocated for removing <b>lionfish</b> from deeper reef habitats.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lionfish</b> is a {{predator}} {{native to the}} Indo-Pacific. It aggressively preys on small fish and invertebrates. They can be found around the seaward edge of reefs and coral, in lagoons, and on rocky surfaces commonly to 50 m deep. Though <b>lionfish</b> have on multiple occasions been recorded to 300 m depth. They show a preference for turbid inshore areas and in harbors, and have a generally hostile attitude and are territorial towards other reef fish. Many universities in the Indo-Pacific have documented reports of Pterois aggression towards divers and researchers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fish and}} {{invertebrates}} such as <b>Lionfish,</b> stonefish, crown of thorns starfish, and some sea urchins have spines which can produce puncture wounds with venom injection. These are often extremely painful {{and may be}} fatal in rare cases. Usually caused by impact with the stationary animal.|$|E
25|$|This fish is an {{opportunistic}} feeder. Its diet includes planktonic, demersal, and benthic organisms. Copepods {{constitute the}} bulk of their diet. It serves as an important food source for several species of <b>lionfish</b> (Pterois spp.), the honeycomb grouper (Epinephelus merra), the crocodilefish (Cymbacephalus beauforti), the snowflake moray (Echidna nebulosa), the estuarine stonefish (Synanceia horrida), and the yellow-lipped sea krait (Laticauda colubrina).|$|E
25|$|Extreme {{temperatures}} present {{geographical constraints}} {{in the distribution}} of aquatic species, indicating temperature tolerance plays a role in the lionfish’s survival, reproduction, and range of distribution. The abrupt differences in water temperatures north and south of Cape Hatteras directly correlate with the abundance and distribution of Pterois. Pterois expanded along the southeastern coast of the United States and occupied thermal-appropriate zones within 10 years, and the shoreward expansion of this thermally appropriate habitat is expected in coming decades as winter water temperatures warm in response to anthropogenic climate change. Although the timeline of observations points to the east coast of Florida as the initial source of the western Atlantic invasion, the relationship of the United States East Coast and Bahamian <b>lionfish</b> invasion is uncertain. <b>Lionfish</b> can tolerate a minimum salinity of 5 parts per thousand and even withstand pulses of freshwater, which means they can also be found in estuaries of freshwater rivers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{octopuses}} can use {{muscles in}} the skin to change both the colour and texture of their mantle to achieve a greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of seaweed, or the scraggly, bumpy texture of a rock, among other disguises. A few species, such as the mimic octopus, have another defence mechanism. They can combine their highly flexible bodies with their colour-changing ability to accurately mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as <b>lionfish,</b> sea snakes, and eels.|$|E
25|$|Pterois is a genus of venomous marine fish, {{commonly}} known as <b>lionfish,</b> native to the Indo-Pacific. Also called zebrafish, firefish, turkeyfish or butterfly-cod, it is characterized by conspicuous warning coloration with red, white, creamy, or black bands, showy pectoral fins, and venomous spiky fin rays. Pterois radiata, Pterois volitans, and Pterois miles are the most commonly studied species in the genus. Pterois species are popular aquarium fish. P. volitans and P. miles are a recent and significant invasive species in the west Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown booby, masked booby, terns, double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-Îlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red <b>lionfish),</b> the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, <b>lionfish</b> and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, Siamese crocodile lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata. The Komodo dragon exhibit was the largest of its kind at opening and {{is still one of}} the largest Komodo dragon exhibits in the country.|$|E
25|$|Most of Australia's {{fish species}} are marine, and 75% live in {{tropical}} marine environments. This is {{partly due to}} Australia's huge marine territory, covering 9 million km2. Groups of interest include the moray eels and squirrelfish, as well as the pipefish and seahorses, whose males incubate their partner's eggs in a specialised pouch. There are 80 species of grouper in Australian waters, including one of the world's biggest bony fish, the giant grouper, which can grow as large as 2.7m and weigh up to 400kg. The trevally, a group of 50 species of silver schooling fish, and the snappers are popular species for commercial fishing. The Great Barrier Reef supports a huge variety of small- and medium-sized reef fish, including the damselfish, butterflyfish, angelfish, gobies, cardinalfish, wrassees, triggerfish and surgeonfish. There are several venomous fish, among them several species of stonefish and pufferfish and the red <b>lionfish,</b> all of which have toxins that can kill humans. There are 11 venomous species of stingray, the largest of which is the smooth stingray. The barracudas are one of the reef's largest species. However, large reef fish should not be eaten for fear of ciguatera poisoning.|$|E
500|$|More than 50 {{species of}} exotic plant have been {{documented}} in the park, with almost 20 of those considered to be pest species which may displace native plants and possibly alter the ecological balance. Green iguanas, cane toads, black rats, <b>lionfish,</b> fire ants, oscars and brown basilisk lizards are common in the park. The <b>lionfish</b> (Pterois volitans and Pterois miles) is a tropical fish from the Indian-Pacific Ocean area. It {{is known for its}} voracious appetite and its ability to establish itself in new waters, rapidly replacing other species. Researchers theorized that the introduction of this species in the park occurred during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Sightings in Biscayne Bay at that time were believed to have been from home aquariums that were destroyed during the hurricane, though the researcher who first proposed the theory has since retracted the assertion. [...] More recent <b>lionfish</b> sightings are probably from more established populations in the Florida Keys to the south of the park. Also likely originating from human captivity, Burmese pythons have been observed near the park's boundary along the mainland. Exotic plant species which pose the highest risk to native plant communities include Brazilian-pepper, torpedo grass, tuberous sword fern, guava and portiatree.|$|E
500|$|The blowfish in {{the opening}} scene was {{intended}} by executive producer Russell T Davies to be [...] "like Finding Nemo, but evil" [...] and the producer of the episode, Richard Stokes, wanted the designs to be as flamboyant as [...] "the <b>lionfish</b> in The Spy Who Loved Me". The first designs of the costume were visibly different from the final design; the first designs were more fish-like than humanoid. After a humanoid design {{was approved by the}} production team, Millennium FX, who previously created the prosthetics for Doctor Who and the first series of Torchwood, immediately sculpted the costume to Paul Kasey's dimensions. Two versions of the mask were created; one was animatronic, which included mechanical fins, and one was used for the stunt where the blowfish was shot in the head.|$|E
