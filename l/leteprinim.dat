50|$|<b>Leteprinim</b> (Neotrofin, AIT-082) is a {{hypoxanthine}} derivative drug with neuroprotective and nootropic effects. It stimulates {{release of}} nerve growth factors and enhances survival of neurons in the brain, and is under {{development as a}} potential treatment for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleophilic}} addition at {{ethyl acrylate}} as an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound {{is a frequent}} strategy in the synthesis of pharmaceutical intermediates. Examples are the hypnotic glutethimide or the vasodilator vincamin (obsolete by now) or more recent therapeutics such as the COPD agent cilomilast or the nootropic <b>leteprinim.</b>|$|E
40|$|Although it is {{recognized}} that multi-drug therapies {{may be necessary}} to combat AD, there is a paucity of preclinical proof of concept studies. We present a combination treatment paradigm, which temporally affects different aspects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) -like pathology, specifically Aβ-toxicity and neurogenesis. At early stages of AD-like pathology, in TgCRND 8 mice, we found that combating Aβ pathology with scyllo-inositol ameliorated deficits in neurogenesis. Older TgCRND 8 mice with established amyloid load had decreased progenitor cell proliferation and survival compared to non-transgenic mice, regardless of scyllo-inositol treatment. The prolonged exposure to Aβ-pathology leads to deficits in the neurogenic niche, thus targeting Aβ alone is insufficient to rescue neurogenesis. To support the neurogenic niche, we combined scyllo-inositol treatment with <b>leteprinim</b> potassium (neotrofin), the latter of which stimulates neurotrophin expression. We show that the combination treatment of scyllo-inositol and neotrofin enhances neuronal survival and differentiation. We propose this proof of concept combination therapy of targeting Aβ-pathology and neurotrophin deficits as a potential treatment for AD...|$|E
