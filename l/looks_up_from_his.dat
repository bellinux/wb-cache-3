6000|$|... [An evening between {{light and}} dark is disclosed, some lamps being [...] lit. The huge body and tower of St. Stephen's rise into the sky [...] some way off, the western gleam still {{touching}} the upper stonework. [...] Groups of people are seated at the tables, drinking and reading [...] the newspapers. One very animated group, which includes an [...] Englishman, is talking loudly. A citizen near <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> [...] newspaper.] ...|$|E
6000|$|A boy, for example, who is full {{of health}} and {{increasing}} vigor, and in whom, of course, those organs on which the consciousness of strength and the impulses of courage depend are {{in the course of}} rapid and healthy development, in reading to his mother a story in which a thief that came into a back store-room of a house in the evening, with a bag, to steal meal, was detected by the owner and frightened away, <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> book and says, in a very valiant manner, ...|$|E
60|$|Real {{estate agents}} {{recommend}} it {{as a little}} piece of England--the island on which it stands {{is about the size of}} Great Britain--but no England is set in any such seas or so fully charged with the mystery of the larger ocean beyond. The high, still twilights along the beaches are out of the old East just under the curve of the world, and even in October the sun rises warm from the first. Earth, sky, and water wait outside every man's door to drag him out to play if he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> work; and, though some other cities in the Dominion do not quite understand this immoral mood of Nature, men who have made their money in them go off to Victoria, and with the zeal of converts preach and preserve its beauties.|$|E
60|$|Benjamin <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{plate with}} {{an aspect of}} stern surprise.|$|R

60|$|Rokoff <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{writing with}} an ugly scowl upon his face.|$|R
5000|$|An {{episode of}} Family Guy {{features}} a cutaway gag where Peter and Brian {{are sitting at}} the kitchen table; Peter is eating a bowl of breakfast cereal and suddenly tells Brian that theres a message in his Alpha-Bits which simply says [...] "Ooooo". A visibly annoyed Brian <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> newspaper and points out that they are actually Cheerios.|$|E
50|$|Later at an Indian party Sam sees Bugs {{spying on}} them. Sam orders an attack but the cavalry {{comes to the}} rescue and Sam tries to call for his Indians to stop as the cavalry charges. While Bugs hides {{underground}} to avoid being killed, Sam and his horse are unable to call off the attacks and {{end up in the}} middle between the two forces. Bugs <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> hole and sees nothing but feathers.|$|E
5000|$|The opening sequence, as in {{the fourth}} season, shows the front {{entrance}} of the house at 211 Pine St. This time, when the door opens, June appears carrying a tray that holds a full, chilled pitcher and four glasses, as the announcer intones, [...] "starring Barbara Billingsley". June turns to her right and beckons to Ward, whom we see pruning shrubbery with hedge clippers, then to her left, where Wally <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> lawn mower near some shrubbery, then toward the walkway, where Beaver looks up happily from mowing, all as the stars are announced. After an introductory scene, some credits for writing and directing are given. The closing sequence {{is similar to that}} of the third and fourth seasons, except that guest star credits link the actors to their roles.|$|E
60|$|After one {{of these}} {{intervals}} of silence, Eldon Parr <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> claret.|$|R

60|$|Freddie <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> broken meditations, to {{find that}} his host had arrived.|$|R
5000|$|Shatzkes {{possessed a}} {{wonderful}} sense of humour. A famous {{story is told}} by Yeshiva University Chancellor Rabbi Dr Norman Lamm who was in his RIETS class at the time. Shatzkes would usually look {{down the list of}} the names of his students and then at random would ask one student to read the day's page of Talmud. The students always assumed he didn't know the boys anyway. One day looking down the list he says [...] "ok, Shapiro, zug the gemorah" [...] (say the Gemara). Shapiro, who didn't have time to prepare properly, pipes up [...] "Shapiro is nisht due" [...] (Shapiro is not here). Shatzkes <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> gemara and with a twinkle in his eyes says to the trembling Shapiro [...] "ok due zog" [...] (ok you read)... the entire class fell to the floor in laughter.|$|E
50|$|The video {{alternates}} {{between the}} band playing underground and scenes {{of a story}} of two boys who find a fallen angel. It begins with the two boys playing by a stream, having a good time, but {{when one of the}} boys <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> toy boat, he sees an angel lying on the other side, unconscious and bleeding from her eyes. The boy points out the angel to his brother, and they run to her aid. Subsequently, they are seen carrying the now blindfolded angel on a makeshift stretcher. They travel to a nearby village in order to treat her. Residents of the village are confused and some look upon her with contempt, possibly seeing her not as an angel, but as an object of evil. This may be a reference to Satan, who fell from Heaven during the great battle. Because of Lucifer's treachery, a fallen angel is often viewed as evil.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video of}} this song was {{directed}} by Jim Shea, and features footage of Paisley singing in a forest, as well as home movies of himself with his grandfather, Warren L. Jarvis. He also holds up photos of himself with Jarvis and his aunt Rita Takach. The video was filmed in Northern California. The extended version of the video ends with Jarvis in a home movie saying [...] "Come on in and rock a while!" [...] and Paisley smiling when he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> guitar playing and sees this. It also features many different people holding photographs of loved ones who have presumably died. Two notable people featured in this video are Michael Reagan, who is shown holding a photograph of his father Ronald Reagan, and Teresa Earnhardt, who is shown {{sitting in front of}} a painted portrait of her husband, NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. Although she does vocals on the song, Dolly Parton is not shown singing in the video. However, she is shown holding a picture of her grandfather, Rev. Jake Owens, who'd died a few years earlier. She kisses her hand then touches the photograph in this scene. Figure Skater Scott Hamilton is shown holding a picture of his mother. John Carter Cash is featured holding a photo of his parents, Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Also in the video is Pixar director John Lasseter holding up a picture of co-director and fellow CalArts alumnus Joe Ranft who suddenly died in 2005 in a car accident. Various unknown people hold up photos of relatives who have passed on throughout as well. In 2007, after the Virginia Tech massacre, the last slide was dedicated to those lost with the VT emblem shining brightly. On tour in 2008, Paisley also added a picture of late actor Heath Ledger.|$|E
