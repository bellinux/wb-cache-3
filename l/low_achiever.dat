40|$|This thesis reports students’ reading {{strategies}} and reasons for using those strategies in comprehending reading materials at one Senior High School in Ternate, North Maluku, Indonesia. This {{study was conducted}} to find out the reading strategies most frequently used by high achiever students, middle achiever students and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students. It also investigated the similarities and differences of reading {{strategies and}} the students’ reasons for using those strategies in comprehending English text. According to Oxford (1990), the strategy consists of direct and indirect strategies. A direct strategy includes memory, cognitive, and compensation strategies while an indirect strategy deals with metacognitive, affective and social strategies. This study utilized a qualitative research design to get deep understanding about reading strategies most frequently used by high, middle, and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students, the similarities and differences of reading strategies, and the students’ reasons in using those strategies. The data were taken from two sources namely questionnaire and interview. The data from the questionnaires covered the students’ reading strategies and the similarities and differences of reading strategies while the interview data covered students’ reasons in employing reading strategies. The analysis of the data from questionnaires indicated that high achiever students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by metacognitive, memory, compensation, affective and social reading strategies. The middle achiever students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by metacognitive, affective, social, and memory strategies while the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students most frequently used cognitive strategies followed by social, metacognitive and affective strategies. The result of the study also indicated that there were 11 similarities of reading strategies which were employed by the different level of students (high, middle, and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students) in different context to create/construct a context, social interaction, and as a form of self-improvement. The data from the interview revealed that all the students used reading strategies to understand a text however the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students employed those strategies to do the exercises which were given by their English teacher. Based on the findings, this study recommends that the English teacher should encourage the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students to employ reading strategies most frequently used by high achiever students. For the further study, the researcher should consider on how to apply those reading strategies in improving the <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students’ achievement and the relationship between reading strategies and reading comprhension. This study also recommends that the government should conduct teacher training and provide reading materials such as: books, magazine and newspaper in English to motivate the students in doing reading activities and increase their reading skills...|$|E

This {{research is}} done by classifying the data using the learning strategies classification conducted by O’Malley and Chamot. The type of this research is case study. The data are obtained from the interview and document to the subjects. The result of this research shows that the subjects use various learning strategies classified by O’Malley and Chamot in learning materials in English. Those learning strategies used by the subjects are similar and the others are not. Although they use same strategies, some of those strategies are implemented differently. The differences of learning strategy used by the subjects are in metacognitive and cognitive strategies. The learning strategies that are only used by high achiever students are: advance organization (metacognitive strategies), grouping, auditory representation, and transfer (cognitive strategies). The other learning strategies are used by both high achiever and <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students, even by one student of each achiever.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} vocabulary learning strategies (VLSs) used by high and <b>low</b> <b>achievers.</b> Accordingly, a questionnaire and, an interview were designed by adapting Schmitt's (1997) VLSs questionnaire to carry out this study. Fifty four respondents (27 high <b>achievers</b> and 27 <b>low</b> <b>achievers)</b> who were attending 11 th Grade at Jorgo Nole Preparatory School (JNPS) in 2005 (E. C.) were involved in the study. In order to strengthen the data obtained through questionnaire, some interview questions were prepared, and ten randomly selected respondents (five from the high and five from the <b>low</b> <b>achievers)</b> were interviewed. Data obtained through the questionnaire were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version- 16. 0. Frequency, percentage, mean and t-test were employed to analyze the data obtained through questionnaire, and the data obtained through interview were analyzed qualitatively. Frequency and percentage were used to show the number of respondents rated the five point’s likert scale for each item. The mean scores were used to compare the difference between the high and the <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> in using the sub-categories of VLSs. The t-test (at P<O. 05) was used to check if there is statistically significant difference between the high and the <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> in using each of the VLSs provided to the respondents in the questionnaire, and to assess the relationship between VLSs and their English language achievement. Findings of the study indicate that there is a relationship between the students' perception and their language achievement, and VLSs preferred by the students and their English language achievement, i. e. the high achievers prefer more VLSs than the <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> to learn and study new vocabulary. In addition, there is significant difference between the high and the <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> regarding VLSs they use since many of the high achievers 'Usually' and 'Always' use almost all of the strategies, whereas many of the <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> 'Never' and 'Rarely' use many of the strategies to discover the meanings of new English words and to consolidate the words they have learned. Finally, it is recommended that English language teachers should facilitate the teaching learning conditions in which the high achievers can help the <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> practice different VLSs that help them to learn and consolidate new English words in order to speed up their English language acquisition.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{the relationship between}} the academic achievement and information-processing habits of basic skills students in the university. Academic achievement was measured by grade-point average (GPA) and American College Testing Program Assessment (ACT) scores.

There {{was no significant difference in}} the ILP profiles of high- and low-achieving basic skills students, whether they were grouped by ACT or GPA. Study Methods was the only scale that showed a significant correlation with academic achievement-namely, a negative correlation with ACT. A path analysis indicated that the effect of Study Methods on GPA is indirect, as mediated by ACT. Since ACT assesses prior achievement (i. e., high-school performance), it appears that learning style has an effect prior to college entrance. Basic skills students with low ACT scores tend to substitute conventional study methods for deep elaborative processing, but these students are low achievers in college, as indicated by their GPA.

It was designed for upper secondary schools {{but it can be}} used for other levels and subjects too. This tool is innovative in the introduction of self and peer evaluation for students of secondary schools in a gamification process of solving problems. With this app students solve mathematical problems and they have immediate feedback that is used for self-evaluation. After solving the problem and doing the self-evaluation the student can choose to watch a concise or detailed video to study the problem resolution. The concise video shows the steps need to solve the problem. The detailed video shows in more detail, including background information that may help <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students understand the resolution of that problem. In this way, the student can watch the video as many times as those needed to learn how to solve that problem. This is a step for the inclusion of <b>low</b> <b>achiever</b> students in the process of learning mathematics. This app also provides three levels of problems: beginners, intermediate and advanced to accommodate the low achievers and also motivate top performers students to use the app. The student can also at anytime evaluate his peers. In this way, the student can also study again problems of a certain topic when he is evaluating the resolution of a problem solved by another student. In this way, the teacher can also check the self and peer evaluation of his students and has feedback about students’ achievements. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the actual strategic behaviors {{of high and}} <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> in reading comprehension and their relation with respective performance. The participants were 45 individually examined third graders, 20 high and 25 <b>low</b> reading comprehension <b>achievers.</b> Cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational aspects of the participants' strategic behaviors during text comprehension was directly recorded by two observers {{by means of a}} structured observation form. The results revealed a relatively different profile of strategic behaviors between high and <b>low</b> <b>achievers.</b> Students' strategic behaviors during dealing with text comprehension were strongly related to respective performance for both groups...|$|R
40|$|A study {{investigated}} links between writing apprehension, preferred writing processes, and academic achieveme:It in 28 adult learners of English as a Second Language (ESL). One group was of varying language background in an intensive intermediate ESL {{class and the}} other consisted of francophone Canadians in an evening intermediate ESL writing class at a junior college. Students were tested and categorized as high and <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> in their writing classes. Based on scores on a writing apprehension questionnaire, the students were also classified as having high or low writing apprehension. Results indicate that high achievers had lower apprehension scores, as anticipated. It was also found that: (1) high and <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> were more concerned about form than content; (2) <b>low</b> <b>achievers</b> were more concerned about form than were high achievers; (3) high and low apprehensive writers were more concerne...|$|R
