40|$|To {{determine}} the factors in daily physical activity {{that influence the}} mineral density of the calcaneus, we recorded walking steps and the type and duration of exercise in 43 healthy 26 -to 51 -yr-old men. Areal (g/sq cm) calcaneal bone mineral density (CBMD) was measured by single energy x-ray densitometry. Subjects walked a mean (+/- SD) of 7902 (+/- 2534) steps per day or approximately 3. 9 (+/- 1. 2) miles daily. Eight subjects reported no exercise activities. The remaining 35 subjects spent 143 (2 - 772) (median and range) min/wk exercising. Twenty-eight men engaged in exercise activities that generate single leg peak vertical ground reaction forces (GRF(sub z)) of 2 or more body weights (high loaders, HL), and 15 reported exercise or daily activities that typically generate GRF(sub z) less than 1. 5 body weights (<b>low</b> <b>loaders,</b> LL). CBMD was 12 % higher in HL than LL (0. 668 +/- 0. 074 g/sq cm vs 0. 597 +/- 0. 062 g/sq cm, P less than 0. 004). In the HL group, CBMD correlated to reported minutes of high load exercise (r = 0. 41, P less than 0. 03). CBMD {{was not related to}} the number of daily walking steps (N = 43, r = 0. 03, NS).

40|$|An {{examination}} of weigh-in-motion (WIM) data collected recently at sites in five European countries {{has shown that}} vehicles with weights well {{in excess of the}} normal legal limits are found on a daily basis. These vehicles would be expected to have special permits issued by the responsible authorities. It {{can be seen from the}} WIM measurements that most of them are travelling at normal highway speeds (around 80 km/h). Photographic evidence indicates that, while many are accompanied by an escort vehicle in front and/or behind, normal traffic is flowing alongside in other lanes of the highway. As European freight volume grows, the frequency of these special vehicles can be expected to increase. Hence, the probability of them meeting a heavy truck travelling in the opposite direction on a bridge also increases. Gross vehicle weights in excess of 100 t have been observed at all sites, and are a daily occurrence in the Netherlands. Most of these extremely heavy vehicles are either mobile cranes or <b>low</b> <b>loaders</b> carrying construction equipment. Both types have multiple axles at very close spacing, and the gross weight and axle layout have implications for bridge loading. This paper presents findings based on a simulation model which incorporates the load effects for all observed truck types on short to medium span bridges. It is evident that special vehicles govern the lifetime maximum bridge loading, and the occurrence of extremely heavy trucks is sufficiently frequent that meeting events can be expected during the design lives of the bridges. The effects of different management strategies for special permit vehicles are modelled and the results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a disease}} that may be pre-determined from the {{condition}} of bone health during youth. In South Africa, the situation is quite unique in that the population of black people has a reduced fracture rate compared to white people. As lifestyle and dietary patterns change with urbanisation {{and there is a}} shift towards westernised diets and sedentary behaviour in youth, fractures in elderly South African blacks may become more prevalent. With these rapid lifestyle changes, it will become increasingly important to prioritise osteoporosis and its related conditions as a major public health concern in South Africa. Very few of the factors influencing osteoporosis have been well studied in children of different ethnic groups. Physical activity in childhood, especially in the prepubertal years, confers residual benefits to the adult skeleton. In this thesis, the associations between ethnicity, history of participation in physical activity and skeletal health were explored in a sample of pre-/early pubertal children from South Africa who participated in four different studies. Furthermore, a novel aspect of the thesis was the use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) to investigate the mechanistic role that physical activity plays on bone health in this unique population. First the use of an existing physical activity questionnaire for the assessment of bone loading had to be validated in a sample of black and white boys and girls (n= 38). A bone loading algorithm was used to calculate a peak bone strain score (PBSS) from the physical activity questionnaire. Therefore a bone specific physical activity questionnaire (B 3 Q) was used in subsequent studies. The PBSS was shown to be reliable and reproducible with significant (p< 0. 001) intraclass correlation coefficients. There were significant correlations between PBSS and moderate (r= 0. 38; p= 0. 02), vigorous (r= 0. 36; p= 0. 03) and combined moderate to vigorous intensity activity counts (r= 0. 38; p= 0. 02) as measured by accelerometry. The ability of the PBSS algorithm to classify children into high or low weight bearing groups was in moderate agreement with accelerometer derived combined moderate and vigorous activity counts (κ= 0. 42; p= 0. 008). PBSS was significantly correlated to body size adjusted bone mineral content at all sites scanned by DXA (r= 0. 43 - 0. 57; p< 0. 05). Positive correlations were observed between PBSS and area, density and strength at the radius and tibia (r= 0. 40 - 0. 64; p< 0. 05). At the radial metaphysis, significant correlations between moderate activity (r= 0. 46; p= 0. 005) and combined moderate and vigorous activity counts (r= 0. 42; p= 0. 01) were seen for bone strength. No associations were seen between accelerometer measured physical activity and bone outcomes at the tibial diaphysis. Multiple regression analysis showed that the PBSS was a better predictor of bone mass and structure than was accelerometry. The next study sought to determine whether children who were classified as being high bone loaders {{for the past two years}} would present with greater bone mass and strength regardless of their ethnicity. Sixty six children [black boys, 10. 4 (1. 4) yrs, n= 15; black girls, 10. 1 (1. 2) yrs, n= 27; white boys, 10. 1 (1. 1) yrs, n= 7; white girls, 9. 6 (1. 3) yrs, n= 17] reported on all their physical activities over the past two years in the interviewer administered bone specific physical activity questionnaire (B 3 Q). Children were classified as being either high or <b>low</b> bone <b>loaders</b> based on the cohort’s median peak bone strain score estimated from the B 3 Q. In the low bone loading group, black children had greater femoral neck bone mineral content (BMC) (2. 9 (0. 08) g) than white children (2. 4 (0. 11) g; p= 0. 05). There were no ethnic differences in the high bone loaders for femoral neck BMC. At the cortical sites, the black <b>low</b> bone <b>loaders</b> had a greater radius area (97. 3 (1. 3) vs 88. 8 (2. 6) mm 2; p= 0. 05) and a greater tibia total area (475. 5 (8. 7) vs. 397. 3 (14. 0) mm 2; p= 0. 001) and strength (1633. 7 (60. 1) vs. 1271. 8 (98. 6) mm 3; p= 0. 04) compared to the white <b>low</b> bone <b>loaders.</b> These measures were not different between the black low and high bone loaders or between the black and white high bone loaders. Ethnic differences in bone area and strength apparent between children classified as having a lower bone loading physical activity history appear to have been attenuated when children partaking in high bone loading physical activities were compared. Greater levels of mechanical loading seemed to have no apparent benefits in black children. Cross-sectional studies in black and white pre-pubertal children have observed significant ethnic differences in structural bone outcomes as measured by pQCT but there are a limited number of intervention studies that have been conducted in black children. The cortical bone of black and white children may respond differently to mechanical forces, yet no physical activity interventions and their effects on bone structure in black children have been done. The aim of the third study was to determine whether a weight-bearing physical activity intervention improves measures of bone mass, structure and strength in pre-pubertal black children. Children (9. 7 ± 1. 1 years) were randomised into an exercise (EX; n= 12) and control (CON; n= 11) group. The EX children performed a 20 -week weightbearing exercise program performed twice a week for 45 minutes per session, while CON children continued their regular activities. Changes in tibial trabecular volumetric bone density, area and strength were greater in the EX than the CON group (all p< 0. 01). At the cortical site of the tibia, the change in bone density was greater in the EX group than the CON group (all p< 0. 05). The greater change in tibial periosteal circumference in the EX groups also resulted in a greater change in cortical thickness of the tibia compared to the CON group (p< 0. 05). The final study assessed whether rates of bone accrual differed over one year between high and <b>low</b> bone <b>loaders</b> and also between black and white South African children. Forty seven children (18 boys, 29 girls) were followed up after one year. High bone loaders tended to have greater baseline BMC at all sites measured by DXA but the difference was only significant at the femoral neck (p= 0. 03). At the follow up visit, femoral neck BMC remained significantly higher in the high compared to the <b>low</b> bone <b>loaders</b> (p= 0. 003). Bone strength index (BSI) at the follow up visit was significantly greater in the high bone loaders compared to the <b>low</b> bone <b>loaders</b> (p= 0. 05). Although there was a trend for the high bone loaders to have greater indices of density and area at the 65...|$|R
40|$|The control {{inceptor}} used in {{a simulated}} vehicle {{is an important part}} in maintaining the fidelity of a simulation. The force feedback provided by the control inceptor gives the operator important cues to maintain adequate performance. The dynamics of a control inceptor are typically based on a second order spring mass damper system with damping, force gradient, breakout force, and natural frequency parameters. Changing these parameters can have a great effect on pilot or driver control of the vehicle. The neuromuscular system has a very important role in manipulating the control inceptor within a vehicle. Many studies by McRuer, Aponso, and Hess have dealt with modeling the neuromuscular system and quantifying the effects of a high fidelity control loader as compared to a <b>low</b> fidelity control <b>loader.</b> Humans are adaptive in nature and their control behavior changes based on different control loader dynamics. Humans will change their control behavior to maintain tracking bandwidth and minimize tracking error. This paper reports on a quasi-transfer of training experiment which was performed at the NASA Langley Research Center. The quasi transfer of training study used a high fidelity control <b>loader</b> and a <b>low</b> fidelity control <b>loader.</b> Subjects trained in both simulations and then were transferred to the high fidelity control loader simulation. The parameters for the high fidelity control loader were determined from the literature. The <b>low</b> fidelity control <b>loader</b> parameters were found through testing of a simple computer joystick. A disturbance compensatory task is employed. The compensatory task involves implementing a simple horizon out the window display. A disturbance consisting of a sum of sines is used. The task consists of the subject compensating for the disturbance on the roll angle of the aircraft. The vehicle dynamics are represented as 1 /s and 1 /s 2. The subject will try to maintain level flight throughout the experiment. The subjects consist of non-pilots to remove any effects of pilot experience. First, this paper discusses the implementation of the disturbance compensation task. Second, the high and low fidelity parameters used within the experiment are presented. Finally, an explanation of results from the experiments is presented...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that narrow vein mining needs innovative approaches to mine access and mining methods {{in order to improve}} the economics of this vital part of the mining industry.

The results are compared with those for conventional mining using trucks and loaders. The EMTS provides competitive haulage rates in substantially smaller excavations than is currently achievable. According to simulation results, the electric loader in conjunction with the EMTS had the same number of blasts as the conventional system and hence the same advance rate of 3. 33 m per 12 hour shift. Furthermore, the total drill-blast-load-haul cycle time was less than the conventional system by one hour. B. Besa and E. K. Chanda[URL]...|$|R
