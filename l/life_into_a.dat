25|$|Most historians {{view the}} gospels {{not as an}} {{objective}} account of Jesus, but {{as the product of}} men writing at a particular period, and grappling with particular theological as well as political issues. Specifically, they assume that after Jesus' death his sayings and stories about him circulated among his followers until, {{at some point in the}} mid-1st century someone (or group of people) wrote down his sayings in Greek (see Q source) and someone edited and organized stories about his <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> historical narrative, the Gospel of Mark. As these two documents circulated among Christians, other historical narratives were edited and organized. The four gospels ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were regionally authoritative by proto-orthodoxy by the 2nd century. Some historians have suggested that between Nero's persecution of Christians in 64 CE, and the Jewish revolt in 66 CE, Gentile Christians saw more sense in assigning Jews, rather than Romans, responsibility for Jesus' death.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright had been {{thinking}} about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on individual people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> game. Sims would be based on Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had been laid off.|$|E

500|$|According to Helen Vendler, [...] "To Autumn" [...] {{may be seen}} as {{an allegory}} of artistic creation.

500|$|Much of the {{criticism}} about the novel focuses on the plot; Jon Stock, writing in The Daily Telegraph, thought that although Boyd used details {{in the same way}} Fleming did that would appeal to Bond aficionados, the book was based on [...] "a curiously unstirring plot", which was also [...] "convoluted". The Nationals Nick Leech also noted the use of details, but considered that this led to [...] "a pedantic, meandering narrative" [...] which led to [...] "an underwhelming finale". Writing in the London Evening Standard, David Sexton agreed, calling the book a [...] "rather inattentive novel", that was a [...] "lame outing" [...] in the Bond canon.

On the other hand, Next Generation felt the bond was tiring and not truly innovative, and GamePro called the bond mechanic's controls Knuckles' Chaotixs biggest problem, finding them frustrating and choppy.

[...] This was not universally welcomed as, by September of that year, a retired chemical engineer claimed that the pleasure boat was [...] "leaving clouds of methane in its wake as it disturbed sediment on the river bed".

The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Friends was Aniston's sixth sitcom; {{each of her}} {{previous}} ventures had been canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for Friends, which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston, and reshoot several episodes if CBS' series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail. Essentially, the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered, while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms {{in spite of her}} preference towards Friends. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, [...] "When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn't know if I was going to be still playing Rachel." [...] Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, [...] "I'm auditioning for your part in Friends." [...] Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because [...] "in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable," [...] commending the actress for [...] "breathing <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> difficult character." ...|$|E
