We’re fun, like to dance and party, and we didn't really get to do a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> on the first album. Even going to festivals and seeing big bands live, like Coldplay or Bruce Springsteen, we knew the second time around we wanted something fun. It’s the kind of song where the whole band can get up and jam and have this Earth, Wind and Fire kind of moment".|$|E
500|$|Discussing May's {{sickness}} in {{the episode}} after being [...] "infected" [...] by the ghost Lucy {{in the season}} premiere, Wen explained that [...] "It starts to affect May’s perception of things. It’s almost like being on LSD, but worse. It’s not good. You never want May out of control. You don’t {{want her to be}} paranoid." [...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is I respect her power and I respect her. I understand that she’s going in the same direction I am, she’s seeking the same ends that I am, so I offer the opportunity for her to jump in and saddle up and we go find these things out." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{accurately}} {{depict the}} time period of the film, the filmmakers conducted extensive research that included studying artwork from the era. With eight weeks to create the wardrobe, costume designer Patricia Norris collaborated with Western Costume to compile costumes that would illustrate {{the passage of time}} while also being historically accurate. Using an earth tone color palette, Norris created nearly 1,000 costumes for the film. [...] "She [...] took earth samples from all three of the plantations to match the clothes," [...] McQueen said, [...] "and she had the conversation with Sean [...] to deal with the character temperature on each plantation, there was a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> minute detail."

In early November 1937, Anderson {{described}} Heikkinen as “the smallest but best lineman in the Michigan forward wall.” Anderson continued in his praise for Heikkinen: “Heik has shown the stuff in both of our tough games against Minnesota and Northwestern [...] [...] [...] Minnesota didn’t split our guards more than twice during the game. Heik was responsible for a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> My conception of a good guard is one that stops anything that comes his way on defense and leads the blocking on offense. Heik has done just that. When we have the ball he is our fifth man in the backfield. He pulls out most of our plays and bowls over the opposition. We have made most of the gains through the line over his position.” ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera {{revealed}} {{that some of}} the inspiration for the music video came from her work in Burlesque, stating, [...] "There is dancing, and I learned so much also as a dancer doing the 'Burlesque' film, moving my body in ways that were, I feel, never as precise before [...] I really fell in love and I adapted that in the dancing for 'Not Myself Tonight,' but it was really, really fun to take what I learned from the movie." [...] She further elaborated, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and it just was really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E

500|$|Mustaine stated {{he did not}} [...] "go {{into making}} this record with any pre-conceived notions". He {{said some of the}} lyrics on United Abominations were written about his {{frustration}} with his past record labels, stating [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> translated into the intensity on the record." [...] Mustaine wrote the songs for the album in an attempt to [...] "stir something {{in the minds of the}} listener". The lyrics of the album were mostly about choices the American government were making at the time, which Mustaine found to be foolish. Mustaine stated recording the new songs was [...] "super fun", despite having troubles with some of the complex music and vocal arrangements. All of the lyrics and music, with the exception of one song, were written by Mustaine. [...] "Never Walk Alone... A Call to Arms" [...] was co-written by Mustaine and guitarist Glen Drover. When bassist James LoMenzo was asked about the lyrics of the album, he said to [...] "talk to Dave about that". Although most of the band had no writing credits on the album, they stated that they were excited about recording the music.|$|E
500|$|On September 19, 2010, Mars {{was arrested}} in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock Casino for {{possession}} of cocaine. While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that {{what he did was}} [...] "foolish" [...] and that [...] "he has never used drugs before." [...] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course. Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said [...] "I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking", he added: [...] "I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--." [...] Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying [...] "I don't know where that came from", adding: [...] "I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is a big blur, and I try every day to forget and keep pushing." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{elected to}} play less {{well-known}} {{songs on the}} tour and avoided some of his bigger hits. He was eager to not repeat the formula that made the Serious Moonlight Tour a success, saying, [...] "It seemed so easy. It was cheers from the word go. You {{know how to get}} a reaction – play 'Changes,' 'Golden Years' and they'd be up on their feet. You get the reaction, take the money and run away. It seemed too easy. I didn't want to do that again." [...] In a different contemporary interview he said, [...] "I'm not doing 'Star' again. That was quite hard. I don't think I'm doing much Ziggy material on this tour! [...] Probably use a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried that, and that was a bit yawn-making. There was one I was humming to myself the other day: [...] 'Baby, baby, I'll never let you down' – oh lord, what's that one? Jesus, I can't remember it. ... 'Sons of the Silent Age!' [...] Ah! That's right! Thank god I could remember it! So that for me now is a new song. I've never done that one onstage." [...] "Sons of the Silent Age" [...] was performed every night of the tour.|$|E

[...] The remarks enraged Governor Kathleen Blanco of Louisiana, who stated that Hastert's comments were [...] "absolutely unthinkable for a leader in his position" [...] and demanded an immediate apology. Former President Bill Clinton, responding to the remarks, stated that had they been in the same place when the remarks were made, [...] "I'm afraid I would have assaulted him." [...] After the remarks caused a furor, Hastert issued a statement saying he was not [...] "advocating that the city be abandoned or relocated" [...] and later issued another statement saying that [...] "Our prayers and sympathies continue to be with the victims of Hurricane Katrina." [...] Hastert was also criticized for being absent from the Capitol during the approval of a $10.5 billion Katrina relief plan; Hastert was in Indiana attending a colleague's fundraiser and an antique car auction. [...] Hastert later said that he donated the proceeds from one of the antique cars he sold at the auction to hurricane-relief efforts.|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> emotion was real for me."

500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E

I {{used to hear}} those {{wonderful}} stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about Superman and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'". Donner commented, [...] "There are a few shots where Chris 's costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color {{back to where it}} should be." [...] Thau wanted to make the film shorter: [...] "I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem [...] when they're flying around.

Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "We didn't {{actually}} expect the New Directions to win nationals, but the episode just {{felt like it was}} going through the motions rather than seizing the opportunity to do something truly spectacular." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a [...] "good piece of television", and gave it a [...] "B+". He said it [...] "wasn't as good" [...] as the first-season finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", [...] "largely because it wasted {{a lot of time on}} performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> episode's set pieces without finding anything remotely as powerful as the performance of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of IGN gave [...] "New York" [...] a [...] "good" [...] grade of 7.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been, 'New York' was a decent close to an enjoyable season." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown said the episode was [...] "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a few killer numbers, strange resolutions, and head-scratching plot devices", while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was [...] "no exception" [...] to Glee having [...] "been undeniably frustrating in season two", though [...] "there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy".|$|E
500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV.

They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but really do have the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> happens nowadays." ...|$|E
