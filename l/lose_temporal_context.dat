40|$|Abstract: In the {{ubiquitous}} computing environment, context reasoning {{is an important}} issue of context-awareness. It is used to deduce desired or higher-level context and then to provide suitable services automatically. The previous context-reasoning approaches are mainly non-temporal. The reasoning is according to the real-time contexts without time information. However, <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> are very important information for context-awareness. Therefore, a <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> reasoning model (TempCRM) based on resource description framework (RDF) and Web ontology language (OWL) is proposed in this paper. TempCRM is used for inferring the dangerous level of a smart home. In a home environment, a potential dangerous situation is caused by a series of temporal events. A temporal event is represented as a RDF-based <b>temporal</b> <b>context.</b> A smart home ontology is defined for the terms and relationships used in the <b>temporal</b> <b>context.</b> Then, a set of reasoning rules can be defined for inferring and computing the dangerous level. In the simulation study, a script with dangerous situations is designed to evaluate the dangerous level generated by TempCRM. The result illustrates that TempCRM is useful to alarm the inhabitant and thus prevent the occurrence of an incident from the <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts...</b>|$|R

It {{is thought to have}} an obvious explanation, i. e. disoriented patients fail to store the information crucial for the maintenance of orientation. In this study, we explored whether disorientation was indeed associated with a failure to learn new information or rather with a confusion of information within memory. Twenty-one patients with severe amnesia were examined. Orientation was tested with a 20 item questionnaire. Two runs of a continuous recognition task were used to test the ability to acquire information (first run of the task) and the tendency to confuse the <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> of information acquisition (comparison of the second with the first run). We found that orientation was much better predicted by the measure of <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> confusion (r = 0. 90) than by the ability to simply acquire information (r = 0. 54). Superimposition of neuroradiological scans demonstrated that increased <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> confusion was associated with medial orbitofrontal or basal forebrain damage; patients with normal levels of <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> confusion did not have damage to these areas.

The results for the multiple-chain schedule indicate that <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> does impact {{the value of a}} conditioned reinforcer consistent with delay-reduction theory, such that a stimulus signaling a greater reduction in delay until reinforcement has greater value. Further, nonreinforced stimuli that are concurrently presented with the preferred terminal link also have greater value, consistent with value transfer. The effects of context on value for conditions with the multiple-successive-encounters procedure, however, appear to depend on whether the search schedule or alternate handling schedule was manipulated, as well as on whether the tested stimuli were the rich or lean schedules in their components.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Though the {{time-delay}} neural net architecture {{has been}} recently {{used in a}} number of speech recognition applications, it has the problem that it can not use longer <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> because this increases the number of connection weights in the network.

This architecture has the advantage that it can utilize information about longer <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> without increasing the number of connection weights in the network. This architecture is studied here for speaker-independent isolated-word recognition and its performance is compared with that of the time-delay neural net architecture. It is shown that the time-derivative neural net architecture, in spite of using less number of connection weights, outperforms the time-delay neural net architecture for speech recognition. 1...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of {{popularity}} has profound impact for social media, since it offers opportunities to reveal individual preference and public attention from evolutionary social systems. Previous research, although achieves promising results, neglects one distinctive characteristic of social data, i. e., sequentiality. For example, {{the popularity of}} online content is generated over time with sequential post streams of social media. To investigate the sequential prediction {{of popularity}}, we propose a novel prediction framework called Deep <b>Temporal</b> <b>Context</b> Networks (DTCN) by incorporating both <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> and <b>temporal</b> attention into account. Our DTCN contains three main components, from embedding, learning to predicting. With a joint embedding network, we obtain a unified deep representation of multi-modal user-post data in a common embedding space. Then, based on the embedded data sequence over time, <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> learning attempts to recurrently learn two adaptive <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> for sequential popularity. Finally, a novel temporal attention is designed to predict new popularity (the popularity of a new user-post pair) with temporal coherence across multiple time-scales. Experiments on our released image dataset with about 600 K Flickr photos demonstrate that DTCN outperforms state-of-the-art deep prediction algorithms, {{with an average of}} 21. 51 % relative performance improvement in the popularity prediction (Spearman Ranking Correlation).

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in single-neuron biophysics have enhanced {{our understanding of}} information processing on the cellular level, but how the detailed properties of individual neurons give rise to large-scale behavior remains unclear. Here, we present {{a model of the}} hippocampal network based on observed biophysical properties of hippocampal and entorhinal cortical neurons. We assembled our model to simulate spatial alternation, a task that requires memory of the previous path through the environment for correct selection of the current path to a reward site. The convergence of inputs from entorhinal cortex and hippocampal region CA 3 onto CA 1 pyramidal cells make them potentially important for integrating information about place and <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> on the network level.
