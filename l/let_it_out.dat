[...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] premiered on April 30, 2010 on Cyrus' official MySpace page; it was officially released for airplay on May 3, 2010 and released as a digital download on May 18, 2010. In May 2010, Cyrus recorded the Rockangeles remix of [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] with rapper Lil Jon at Rock Mafia Studios in Santa Monica, California. Lil Jon said the collaboration was [...] "crazy" [...] and thought audiences would enjoy the remix. Cyrus added, [...] "He just came in and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> It's pretty rockin." [...] They believed Lil Jon gave the remix more energy than the original version had.|$|E

500|$|The {{long hair}} {{tradition}} was widespread among English and French {{men in the}} 11th and 12th centuries, though it was considered, mostly because of endorsement of the Roman Catholic Church, acceptable for men also to have shorter hair. [...] The tradition was largely brought about by monarchs who rejected the shorter hairstyle, causing the people to follow. [...] Wulfstan, a religious leader, worried that those with longer hair would fight like women, and be unable to protect England from foreign invasion. This idea {{can be found in}} later military leaders as well, such as those of the American Confederacy. Knights and rulers would also sometimes cut or pull out their hair in order to show penitence and mourning, and a squire's hair was generally shorter than a knight's. Married women who let their hair flow out in public were frowned upon, as this was normally reserved for the unwed, although they were allowed to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in mourning, to show their distressed state. Through these centuries it was expected of Eastern Christians to wear long hair as well as long beards, which was especially expected from clergy and monks.|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} between 1866 and 1867, Cope went on trips to western parts of the country. He related to his father his {{scientific}} experiences; to his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life {{as part of her}} education. Cope found educating his students at Haverford [...] "a pleasure", but wrote to his father that he [...] "could not get any work done." [...] He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield, in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey. Due to the time-consuming nature of his Haverford position, Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to others, but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits. Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career, he finally sold the farm in 1869. Alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming, and Edward focused on his scientific career. He continued his continental travels, including trips to Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. He visited caves across the region. He stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana, but remained interested in the subject. Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the 1860s, paying periodic visits to the marl pits. The fossils he found in these pits became the focus of several papers, including a description in 1868 of Elasmosaurus platyurus and Laelaps. Marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions. Cope's proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more frequent trips possible. The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard. Two maids tended the estate, which entertained a number of guests. Cope's only concern was for more money to spend on his scientific work.|$|E
