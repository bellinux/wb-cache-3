5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
25|$|A force {{applied at}} {{a right angle}} to a lever multiplied by its {{distance}} from the lever's fulcrum (the length of the <b>lever</b> <b>arm)</b> is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two metres from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six metres from the fulcrum. The direction of the torque can be determined by using the right hand grip rule: if the fingers of the right hand are curled {{from the direction of}} the <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> to the direction of the force, then the thumb points in the direction of the torque.|$|E

The sensing assembly is immersed within a casing which is mounted to the structural member. The sensing assembly includes a support body and an accelerometer mounted to the support body for measuring movement of the structural member. The accelerometer is aligned with an anticipated line of motion such that measurements can be made along this line of motion. A pair of <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> are pivotally mounted to the support body for removably securing the support body within the casing. A spring is mounted between the support body and <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> for continuously biasing the <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> to a position perpendicular with the support body...|$|R
25|$|Ankle weights {{provide a}} large <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> {{for a small}} amount of weight and are very {{effective}} at correcting head-down trim problems, but the addition of mass to the feet increases the work of propulsion significantly. This may not be noticed on a relaxed dive, where {{there is no need to}} swim far or fast, but if there is an emergency and the diver needs to swim hard, ankle weights will be a significant handicap, particularly if the diver is marginally fit for the conditions.|$|E
25|$|Tank bottom weights {{provide a}} much shorter <b>lever</b> <b>arm,</b> so {{need to be}} a much larger {{proportion}} of the total ballast, but do not interfere with propulsive efficiency the way ankle weights do. There are not really any other convenient places below the weight belt to add trim weights, so the most effective option is to carry the main weights as low as necessary, by using a suitable harness or integrated weight pocket buoyancy compensator which actually allows the weights to be placed correctly, so {{there is no need for}} longitudinal trimming.|$|E

They operate similarly to pop bumpers, with a switch {{on each side of}} a solenoid-operated <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> in a typical arrangement. The switches are closed by ball contact with the rubber {{on the face of the}} kicker and this activates the solenoid.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a <b>lever</b> <b>arm</b> attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high lift coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high pitch control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E

[...] The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break.

40|$|Myosin-Is are {{molecular}} motors {{that link}} cellular membranes to the actin cytoskeleton, where they play roles in mechano-signal transduction and membrane trafficking. Some myosin-Is are proposed {{to act as}} force sensors, dynamically modulating their motile properties in response to changes in tension. In this study, we examined force sensing by the widely expressed myosin-I isoform, myo 1 b, which is alternatively spliced in its light chain binding domain (LCBD), yielding proteins with <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> of different lengths. We found the actin-detachment kinetics of the splice isoforms to be extraordinarily tension-sensitive, with the magnitude of tension sensitivity {{to be related to}} LCBD splicing. Thus, in addition to regulating step-size, motility rates, and myosin activation, the LCBD is a key regulator of force sensing.

50|$|The devices {{shown are}} on steam engines. Power is {{supplied}} {{to the governor}} from the engine's output shaft by a belt or chain connected to the lower belt wheel. The governor is connected to a throttle valve that regulates the flow of working fluid (steam) supplying the prime mover. As {{the speed of the}} prime mover increases, the central spindle of the governor rotates at a faster rate and the kinetic energy of the balls increases. This allows the two masses on <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> to move outwards and upwards against gravity. If the motion goes far enough, this motion causes the <b>lever</b> <b>arms</b> to pull down on a thrust bearing, which moves a beam linkage, which reduces the aperture of a throttle valve. The rate of working-fluid entering the cylinder is thus reduced and the speed of the prime mover is controlled, preventing over-speeding.|$|R
