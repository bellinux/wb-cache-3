At the same time, the main LFT properties are maintained: the modulus increased slightly, strength and viscosity, and thus processability, remained unaffected, while the impact resistance decreased. In addition, a significant improvement in surface quality was observed, largely eliminating the glass fibre printthrough, typically found in LFTs.

The residual fibre length and fibre orientation in the samples has also been characterised. These parameters were also found to be fibre concentration dependent.

The relationship with the polymer matrix and composite microstructure modifications (variations of crystalline morphology and local fibre content) was investigated. Adding carbon black alone decreases the impact performances. This highly conductive additive actually increases the cooling rate, and therefore the fibre &# 8216;frettage&# 8217; effect (higher internal stresses). It also acts as filler, which increases the material brittleness. The nucleating agents allow reducing the mould temperature, but their effect on the impact strength may be favourable or not depending on the processing temperatures. The addition of such additives induces perturbations of the polymer melt rheology in the mould cavity and of the cooling kinetics of the part, which both act on the fibre distribution during mould filling and {{on the degree of}} crystallinity of the composite parts...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper,a novel {{method for}} damage {{prediction}} and dynamic behaviour analysis of laminate composite structures is proposed and investigated. The dynamic behaviour of transversely isotropic layers is expressed through elasticity coupled with damage using a phenomenological macro-model for cracked composite structures made of polymer reinforced with <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> The damage is fully {{described by a}} single scalar variable whose evolution law is expressed through themaximum dissipation principle. Using the classical linear Kirchhoff–Love theory of plates and considering the damage-induced non-linearity, the obtained nonlinear dynamic equations are solved in time domain using a Newmark algorithm. To reduce the computational costs,a metamodel-reduction for damage localization and quantification is proposed where the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Craig–Bampton reduction methods are combined. Extracted stresses from finite element analysis are used as input for a feed-forward ANNs to estimate the damage severity. The Craig–Bampton reduction method is introduced as a Component Mode Synthesis (CMS) to investigate the case of as sembled structures locally damaged. Numerical simulations show that the damage modifies significantly the dynamic properties restricted to the eigen frequencies reduction. The designed feed-forward ANNs was verified and it provides promising results regarding severity and location of the damage. Moreover, the trained ANNs provide a quick response for damage level prediction in online procedure which permits to significantly reduce the computational costs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis shows {{a method}} to analyse places and bond of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced}} concrete. Due to its very low ductility, concrete fails rapidly under tensile load. Reinforcements can increase the stability of concrete with respect to tensile loads by absorbing these loads through the bonds at areas where the concrete fails and thus preparing the building element. The quantitative bond is a measure for the transfer of tensile loads and therefore also an indirect measure for {{the stability of the}} entire building element. In most cases concrete is reinforced with steel. Steel is very expensive and corrodes because of environment conditions, an alternative reinforcement is considered which is analysed in a special research field. Textile reinforced concrete, in which the reinforcement consists of <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> is a new composite material for which this bond is not yet known. Preliminary tests have shown that non-destructive bond analyses are not feasible with the required accuracy and level of detail. This thesis presents a method for location- and bond analyses of textile reinforcement. The analyses are based on scanning electron microscopy images of successive cross-sections of textile reinforced concrete. Using image analysis techniques, the positions of the fibres are extracted and the bonds between the reinforcements and the concrete matrix are determined geometrically. After correcting for the relative orientations of the cross-sections, the components of the reinforcements are assembled to a three-dimensional model of the reinforcement. The fibres are then approximated by various functions and the results discussed to recap the trajectories of the fibres in the specimen. In addition to the position and trajectory of the reinforcements, the areas of bond are also evaluated qualitatively, extrapolated along the fibres and displayed. The results obtained through this analysis provide a basis for subsequent models for the characterization of textile reinforced concrete which are needed to explain observations from experiments on the reaction of textile reinforced concrete under tensile and bending stress. Attention is paid specifically to the correct mapping of the fibres between the cross-sections. The analysis uses classical approaches from photogrammetric and alignment theory and is performed exemplarily. This method can be ransferred to other samples without modification...|$|R
40|$|A 2. 5 m <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced}} plastic composite wind turbine blade was fatigue tested {{by means of}} a mechanically operated test rig.

A yearly fatigue-loading spectrum for the blades has been developed from using short-term detailed aeroelastic and wind measurements, results from a detailed finite element model of the blade and averaged long-term wind data form the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This spectrum contained over 200 load levels covering R ratios from 0 to 0. 9. An equivalent damage spectrum has been formulated to minimise the number of load levels within the spectrum without compromising the amount of damage done to the blade structure. Results of fatigue testing indicate that predictions are close to the measured fatigue life of the blade. The stress distribution in fatigue critical areas of the blade during testing was found to be similar to the expected stress distribution under normal operational condition...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{previous}} optimisation of set-up parameters for injection moulding of polyamide 6 - 6 (PA 6 - 6) reinforced with 40 -wt% of 10 mm <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> {{the aim of this}} paper is to define suitable guidelines to further improve the mechanical performances of PA 6 - 6 /glass long fibre thermoplastic (LFT) injection mouldings. Different solutions have been considered: screw and non-return valve design modification so as to adapt them to LFT processing, increase of the initial fibre content (up to 50 wt%) and length (up to 25 mm) in the LFT pellets. Using a LFT dedicated plasticating unit has allowed decreasing the fibre breakage amount by about 80 % at the nozzle exit, however without improving the flexural properties. Increasing the initial fibre content has logically permitted to improve the flexural properties. Increasing the initial fibre length has not brought any improvement of the properties and has even amplified the structural heterogeneities and anisotropy of the parts. These trends have been explained on the basis of cavity pressure records highlighting significantly different rheological behaviours, and of resulting residual fibre lengths and through-the-thickness fibre orientation profiles modifications...|$|E
40|$|<b>Long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> {{compression}} mouldings {{are prone}} to significant variations in mechanical properties. Stiffness and strength tend to vary across an individual moulding and in addition there are also variations when different mouldings arc compared. Compression mouldings {{in the form of}} a top hat section were produced. This component was first modified to have ribs, then samples of both batches were reinforced with a thin thermoplastic composite plate with continuous fibres. In this way, four different batches were produced, which were tested under 3 -point-bending. Further, this work investigated the changes in mechanical properties across the manufactured top hat section mouldings. Tensile test results strongly indicate that the scatter of mechanical properties increases towards the edges of the compression moulding. When the mouldings were tested under 3 -point-bending, the experimental results were prone to a large scatter and it was not possible to predict the position of failure or the failure mode. However, this work successfully demonstrated that a targeted reinforcement of the moulding with continuous fibres can significantly reduce the performance variations, particular under loading with large strain. The findings of this work could lead to the development of new lightweight structural components, where there is a need for integrating functions into the moulding in order to reduce weight and costs for mass production...|$|E

The experimental data is compared with predictions made using a shear-lag model developed for continuous fibre cross-ply laminates relating modulus reduction to average crack spacing. A theoretical model, based on the Cox model, is derived to predict modulus reduction/cycling curves for skin layer specimens.

The LES results have demonstrated that the internally spout-fluidised bed with draft tube and disk-baffle can remarkably improve its hydrody-namic behaviour, which can effectively disperse fibre bundles and promote pre-impregnation with resin powder in manufacturing fibre reinforced thermoplastics. The hydrodynamics of the spout-fluidised bed has been investigated and reported in a previous paper (Hosseini et al., 2009). This study attempts to reveal important features of fibre dispersion and correlations between the fibre disper-sion and the characteristics of turbulence in the internally spout-fluidised bed using the LES modelling, focusing on the likely hydro-dynamic impact on fibre dispersion. The simulation has clearly indicated that there exists a strong interaction between the turbulent shear flow and transported fibres in the spout-fluidised bed. Fibre entrainment is strongly correlated with the local vorticity distribu-tion. The dispersion of fibres was modelled by a species transport equation in the LES simulation. The turbulent kinetic energy, Rey-nolds stress and strain rate were obtained by statistical analysis of the LES results. The LES results also clearly show that addition of the internals in the spout-fluidised bed can significantly change the turbulent flow features and local vorticity distribution, enhancing the capacity and efficiency of fibre flocs dispersion...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{injection}} moulding, <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced thermoplastics (LGFT) are {{an attractive}} way to produce large parts at low cost. However {{the strength of}} the part depends chiefly on the average fibre length, fibres which are subjected to considerable attrition during processing in conventional three stage screws. In this study, two models of fibre breakage are considered: The first mechanism is specific to plastication during which a fibre anchored at one end in the solid bed is submitted at the other end to the intense shear existing in the molten film, close to the barrel. The thickness of the molten film and the shear stress applied to the fibre vary with polymer viscosity, fibre strength and dimensions, and process parameters. As the melting of the solid bed progresses, more fibres are unlayered and submitted to bending. When the bending stress applied exceeds the fibre strength, the fibre breaks. This results in bimodal fibre length distributions. The sensibility of the model to main processing parameters such as screw rotation, initial fibre length, viscosity, barrel temper-ature and screw geometry is also investigated. The second mechanism addresses the fibre breakage occurring at a later stage in the process, when the screw channel is completely filled with melt. The basis for this {{is to look at the}} fibre as an array of bonded spheres. The flexibility of the fibre model is altered by changing the bending, stretching and twisting strength of the bond connecting adjacent spheres. The motion of the fibre in the flow field is determined by solving the translational and rotational motion equations for individual spheres under hydrodynamic forces and torques exerted on them. Again, the fibre fractures at the bond at which the applied stress exceeds the fibre strength...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the investigation and}} development of damage modelling techniques for woven <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polypropylene matrix composites. The objective of the work was to develop and validate predictive models for the intralaminar damage behaviour of these materials, {{with the aim of}} applying the results to an industrial demonstrator component. Two damage modelling methods were investigated. The first, based on ply-level failure criteria and implemented in an implicit finite element code, was developed and validated using a range of coupon tests for a balanced weave 60 % weight fraction commingled glass/polypropylene composite. The second method utilised a model previously implemented in the commercial explicit finite element code, PAMCRASH. This model was calibrated and validated using the same coupon tests as the first model. The models were subsequently used to simulate an industrial demonstrator component, during a two-phase design and development programme. The demonstrator, an automotive side intrusion beam, was designed and predictively modelled using the two damage modelling techniques investigated. Finally, the composite component was compared to a steel side intrusion beam, using a quasi-static vehicle test to a current legislative standard. This test showed comparable performance in terms of strength and stiffness for the two beams. It was concluded that the implicit finite element damage modelling technique can account for the damage and failure modes observed in a woven glass fibre reinforced polypropylene composite, but is limited when considering high levels of material nonlinearity and damage development, due to the stability of the implicit finite element method. It was also concluded that the explicit finite element technique was more suited to the simulation of damage development in thermoplastic matrix composite components, although the research showed that the model investigated was limited when considering shear damaging behaviour in a woven fibre reinforced composite.

Natural and black grades, at glass loadings of 35 %, 50 % and 60 % by weight have been examined together with a natural un-reinforcd Nylon 66 grade. The tensile strength of the matrix polymer reduced from 80 MPa at dry - "as moulded" to 30 MPa when fully moisture saturated. Dry - "as moulded" tensile strength values for the glass reinforced grades ranged between 198 MPa and 255 MPa for the natural grades and between 183 MPa and 251 MPa for the black. With moisture conditioning for 1000 hours (42 days) at 60 ºC these values were reduced from 92 MPa to 119 MPa for the natural grades and 87 MPa to 120 MPa for the black. The dry - "as moulded" flexural strength values ranged between 280 MPa to 365 MPa and 249 MPa to 369 MPa for the natural and black materials, respectively. As with tensile strength these values were also reduced with moisture uptake. For the same moisture conditions the values of strength measured in flexure were reduced more than in tension. For natural materials the values ranged between 80 MPa to 102 MPa and from 70 MPa to 92 MPa for the black.

40|$|Rapid Heating Cycle Molding (RHCM) is {{a widely}} used {{technology}} for manufacturing high gloss components without visible surface defects. Due to the several improvements such as the injection pressure reduction, the increasing on molded parts quality and the possibility to control the mold temperature, this technology is becoming an interesting solution for injection molding of thin wall components with engineering polymers. The elevated mold temperature, however, substantially increases the cycle time, thus lowering the productivity to a great extent. Development of capable techniques for rapidly heating and cooling a mold with a relatively large mass is technically challenging because of the constraints set by the injection molding process. In this work a porous mold insert with a regular deterministic geometry was developed and optimized through a numerical simulations to increase heat exchange between water and the cavity surface. An accurate mold numerical model was developed and experimentally validated. The results showed a substantial increase of the global coefﬁcient of thermal conduction compared to the existing technologies for the rapid variation of the mold cavity temperature. A further experimental study {{was focused on the}} RHCM inﬂuence on microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polypropylene. X-ray computed tomography (CT) was employed to allow a direct observation of the fibres orientation and image analysis was used to measure the residual ﬁbres length distribution. Tensile strength and fatigue analysis were performed in order to characterize the injection molded specimens, with a CIM and RHCM technologies, from static and dynamic point of view. The using of an high mold temperature resulted in a lower ﬁbre orientation while the residual ﬁbre length was enhanced. Concerning mechanical properties, the employment of a RHCM technology ensure an increasing of the tensile strength for thin wall components while both static and dynamic properties are decreased for thick parts. The mold temperature inﬂuence on injection molding of PET thin wall bottle preforms was also numerically investigated. The increasing in mold temperature resulted in a substantial decreasing of injection pressure without overcoming the limit of crystallization degree imposed by the subsequent blow molding process.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a summary of}} {{research}} on the use of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars and stirrups as internal reinforcement for concrete beams. Fibre reinforced polymer bars are geometrically similar to conventional steel reinforcement. They are made of a bundle of <b>long</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> bound together by a polymer matrix. The bars are strong when loaded in tension parallel to the fibres, and weak when loaded in any other direction. Fibre reinforced polymers are linear-elastic-to-brittle-rupture materials. Unlike steel reinforcement, bent FRP shapes must be made at the time of manufacture, before the polymer cures. Fibre reinforced polymer stirrups, and other bent shapes, are known to prematurely rupture at the bends. Initially, this was a concern for the shear design of FRP reinforced concrete beams; however, the phenomenon is generally accepted by those who work with the material and aspects of the phenomenon are considered in the provisions of modern FRP reinforced concrete design codes and standards. On occasion other researchers observed full utilization of the straight portion strength of FRP stirrups, and one study suggested that the longitudinal bar arrangement may impact stirrup utilization. Therefore, the experimental program described in this thesis was devised to investigate the influence of longitudinal bar arrangements on GFRP stirrup utilization for beams failing in diagonal shear-tension. However, the experimental beams all failed in a form of shear-compression & strut-crushing and not by diagonal shear tension, so no stirrups ruptured and the original objective could not be tested. The failure modes were concrete controlled and the experimental results indicated deep beam behaviour. The original analysis method was precluded by the unintended failure modes, so an element of novelty was incorporated into the research by applying an analysis method for strut-and-tie modelling of steel reinforced concrete that did not require the assumption of steel yielding to find a lower bound solution. That method was developed by Kim and Yun (2011 a). A generalized form of the method was modified for this research to account for FRP, which necessitated modifications to other aspects such as the failure conditions and element geometry. The modified method {{is referred to as the}} Indeterminate Strut-and-Tie (IST) method throughout this thesis. Current literature on the strut-and-tie modelling of FRP reinforced concrete focuses exclusively on deep beams without stirrups, which are modelled by determinate strut-and-tie trusses. Without the yielding assumption it is not possible to solve an indeterminate strut-and-tie truss without resorting to traditional structural analysis methods. The novelty of the IST method is not simply the application of Yun’s work to FRP reinforced concrete, but that it is also the only method capable of finding a lower bound solution to FRP reinforced deep beams with indeterminate strut-and-tie trusses. The IST method uses traditional structural analysis methods to solve for the forces in a strut-and-tie truss. The concrete struts are modelled using one-dimensional, non-linear material behaviour that is modified with softening coefficients as described in Yun’s research. The method applies load in increasing increments and at each increment the stiffness matrix updates by accounting for changes in concrete strut elasticity. The IST method is also capable of modelling other beam behaviours such as strains and deflections. The research found that the IST method was the best at predicting the strength of the experimental beams when compared to both the best available academic model and the most modern design standard...|$|R

Development of economically viable processes for recycling end-of-life <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composites would have major beneficial economic and environmental impacts for the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composites industry. This paper reports a study on regenerating the performance of thermally recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> The effectiveness of the ReCoVeR treatments on the single <b>fibre</b> strength of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> thermally treated to imitate the conditions of composite recycling technology is presented. The regenerated strength levels of these ReCoVeRed fibres must be further protected and maintained by the use of fibre sizing technology similar to standard <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> products. Consequently the effect on fibre strength of the combination of the ReCoVeR treatment with a standard silane coating was also studied. Significant increase of fibre strength was obtained through the regeneration treatments, achieving greater than triple the fibre strength in comparison with the thermally treated <b>glass</b> <b>fibre.</b> Furthermore the same treatments have also been applied to <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> recovered from model composites using laboratory thermal recycling. Fibre strengths have been achieved which makes reusing these fibres as a composite reinforcement a viable option. Results on the mechanical performance of composites containing ReCoVeRed <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> are presented and discussed in support of this assertion...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} and reuse of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> from manufacturing waste and end-of-life composites in an environmentally-friendly, cost-effective manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the thermosetting polymer composites industry. A number of processes for recycling fibres from such materials are available or under development. However, nearly all options deliver recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> that are not cost-performance competitive due to the huge drop in strength of recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> compared to its original state. A breakthrough in the regeneration of recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such composites. This paper reviews the available knowledge of the thermally-induced strength loss in <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> discusses some of the phenomena that are potentially related and presents the status of research into processes to regenerate the strength and value of such weak recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recycled mixed {{post-consumer}} and post-industrial {{plastic wastes}} consisting of HDPE, LDPE and PP were injection moulded with short <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> (10 – 30 % by weight) {{to produce a}} new generation composite materials. Intensive experimental studies were then performed to characterise the tensile, compression and flexural properties of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced mixed plastics composites. With the addition of 30  wt. % of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> the strength properties and elastic modulus increased {{by as much as}} 141 % and 357 %, respectively. The best improvement is seen in the flexural properties due to the better orientation of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in the longitudinal direction at the outer layers. The randomness and length of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> were accounted to modify the existing rule of mixture and fibre model analysis to reliably predict the elastic and strength properties of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced mixed plastics composites.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{relationship}} between the heat capacity and the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content in reinforced epoxy composites has been investigated. A theoretical equation linking the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content with the heat capacity data is presented. Theoretical and the experimen-tal results are discussed. It {{has been found that}} the change in heat capacity at the glass transition temperature of the epoxy composite decreases with an increase in the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content. The curing ex-tent of the epoxy composites also influences the heat capacity. Since the heat capacity of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced epoxy composites can be measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry, determination of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> content in the epoxy composite can be inferred from a study of the heat capacity data...|$|R

Development of economically viable processes for recycling end-of-life <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> composites would have major economic and environmental impacts. This paper introduces and reviews the initial results of the ReCoVeR projects on enabling cost-effective performance regeneration of glass-fibres from thermal recycling of end-of-life automotive and wind energy composites. ReCoVeR technology targets treating <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> thermally reclaimed from GRP waste in order to regenerate a performance level which is equivalent to new fibres.

40|$|The {{composites}} {{between the}} reinforced <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> wastes obtained from surfboard manufacturing industry and polypropylene were developed for value adding and environmental reasons. The thermomechanical and rheological behaviours of the composites were investigated. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents were varied from 5 to 30 wt%. The effects of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-PP) compatibilizer on the behaviours were also determined. The {{results revealed that}} the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> was able to reduce the heat of fusion of the composite. Additionally, the tensile and flexural properties were increased with increasing the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents following the rule of mixtures. The addition of MA-PP led to enhance tensile and flexural properties due to {{the improvement of the}} adhesion between matrix and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is correlated with morphological observations. From the rheological studies, the apparent flow activation energy revealed that the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> decreased the fluidity of the molten composite materials; however, it could be slightly improved by using MA-PP...|$|R
40|$|Unidirectional <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> layers {{have been}} hybridized with {{unidirectional}} self-reinforced polypropylene layers. Tensile tests and microCT {{have been performed}} to investigate and understand the properties of these hybrids. The tensile behavior {{is a combination of}} the stiff and strong <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> layers and the ductile self-reinforced layers. A hybrid effect of + 10 % was observed for the failure strain of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> layers. Tensile strength and absorbed energy showed mainly negative hybrid effects. This is attributed to the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> misalignment, which is induced by the shrinkage forces of the self-reinforced layers.
