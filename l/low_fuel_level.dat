Yamaha's self-cancelling indicator unit is used and a variable resistance gauging system is used to monitor engine oil contents with associated warning lights. A large fuel gauge is provided as is a <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level</b> warning light. A digital clock is also fitted. A safety feature of the FJ1200 is that the engine ignition is cut if first gear is selected with the sidestand down, this is now commonplace on modern motorcycles.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{extremely}} <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> {{the aircraft}} requested {{an emergency landing}} in Lahore, Pakistan. Pakistan initially denied the request. Pakistan also shut down their air traffic services, thus effectively blackening the whole of Pakistan airspace for the Indian Airlines flight and switched off all lights at Lahore Airport. With no help from ATC, Captain Sharan banked on his visual instincts and began descending on {{what he thought was}} a runway only to find out that it was a well-lit road and aborted landing the aircraft in time. On understanding that the only other option for the aircraft was to crash land, Lahore Airport switched on its lights and allowed the aircraft to land. Lahore airport officials refuelled the aircraft and allowed it to leave Lahore at 22:32 IST. Pakistani officials rejected the pilot's request to offload some women and children passengers due to tense relations with India.|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{commenced}} in {{the beginning}} of September 2006. It was performed {{as a part of the}} project OPTIVe (Optimized System Integration for Safe Interaction in Vehicles). OPTIVe’s purpose is to investigate, evaluate and demonstrate methods and technical solutions for safe, efficient and cost effective integration of HMI systems in cars. It is a cooperative project between Volvo Car Corporation and Luleå University of Technology among others, which were also the assigners for this thesis. OPTIVe has executed surveys in USA and Sweden about which information instruments the driver desires to have displayed in the automobile and on which display. The purpose with this master thesis was to compile the answers regarding the instrument cluster and analyze which information instruments should be placed in that display. The results would be different design concepts suitable for Sweden and USA and if possible a concept suited for both countries. The result of the survey, when both countries were taken under consideration, was that the users desired to have the warning symbols Low oil pressure, <b>Low</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level,</b> Parking brake engaged, High motor temperature, Charging system failure, and ABS failure displayed in the instrument cluster. The driver instruments desired were Speedometer, Fuel level and Motor temperature level indicator and no In-vehicle technology instruments. This lead to that four different concepts were designed which were suited for both countries. The first two concepts had a simple and clean design which was further developed into two new concepts with more decorations. When comparing the countries and the genders, instruments and warning symbols that will differ is the Tachometer, Low tire pressure and Engine in need of service. Testing the four concepts in the eye-track lead to discussions about changes and improvements that could be made and also, to a questionnaire handling the speedometer. The new questionnaire was conducted since it was discovered that the pointer of the speedometer in all four concepts was a new idea in this context and the question was if it attracted the drivers or not, if the standard speedometer was more popular, or if a combination of the two was more likely to please. The speedometer questionnaire showed that the idea itself was good but that a combination between the standard speedometer and the modern speedometer was more popular. The combination speedometer will therefore be used in all the concepts. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} today’s vehicles gives drivers help {{with everything from}} adaptive cruisecontrol to warning lights for <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>level.</b> But the increasing functionality also increases the risk offailures in the system. To prevent system failures, different safety analytic methods can be used, e. g.,fault trees and/or FMEA-tables. These methods are generally performed manually, and due to thegrowing system size the time spent on safety analysis is growing with increased risk of human errors. If the safety analysis can be automated, lots of time can be saved. This thesis investigates the possibility to generate fault trees from safety requirements as wellas which additional information, if any, that is needed for the generation. Safety requirements are requirements on the systems functionality {{that has to be}} fulfilled {{for the safety of the}} system to be guaranteed. This means that the safety of the truck, the driver, and the surroundings, depend on thefulfillment of those requirements. The requirements describing the system are structured in a graphusing contract theory. Contract theory defines the dependencies between requirements and connectsthem in a contract structure. To be able to automatically generate the fault tree for a system, information about the systems failure propagation is needed. For this a Bayesian network is used. The network is built from the contract structure and stores the propagation information in all the nodes of the network. This will result in a failure propagation network, which the fault tree generation will be generated from. The failure propagation network is used to see which combinations of faults in the system can violate thesafety goal, i. e., causing one or several hazards. The result of this will be the base of the fault tree. The automatic generation was tested on two different Scania systems, the fuel level displayand the dual circuit steering. Validation was done by comparing the automatically generated trees withmanually generated trees for the two systems showing that the proposed method works as intended. The case studies show that the automated fault tree generation works if the failure propagationinformation exists and can save a lot of time and also minimize the errors made by manuallygenerating the fault trees. The generated fault trees can also be used to validate written requirementsto by analyzing the fault trees created from them...|$|E

30|$|Although raking reduced tree damage, {{it did not}} appreciably reduce tree {{mortality}} in our study (mortality was < 5 % after raking). Low mortality among both raked and not-raked trees has been a consistent feature of studies involving large, high-value trees (Swezy and Agee 1991, Hood 2007, Fowler et al. 2010). Therefore, none of the studies have provided direct evidence that raking reduces mortality from prescribed burns capable of killing large trees (e.g., Kolb et al. 2007). However, a few studies indirectly suggest that raking may reduce large-tree mortality from intense prescribed burns. In particular, van Mantgem and Schwartz (2004) found that raking reduced prescribed burning mortality of small ponderosa pines (5 cm to 15 cm DBH) from 40 % to 4 % in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Also, Dalrymple and Safford (2013) found that large Jeffery pines in the Lake Tahoe Basin of California were {{significantly less likely to}} be killed by wildfires if they had naturally <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>levels</b> near their boles, and Nesmith et al. (2010) made the same observation on large sugar pines subjected to prescribed burns in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in California. Additional research remains necessary {{to determine whether or not}} raking and other fuel removal treatments can reduce mortality. This research seems particularly important given the fact that the burns that are most capable of killing trees tend to be the ones that most effectively reduce fuels (McCaw et al. 1997). However, reducing prescribed fire damage can be advantageous even when the damage does not result in mortality, because heat damage can reduce tree growth (Berryman 1986, Valor et al. 2015) and carbon sequestration (Wiechmann et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Steady-state and scale-resolving {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed for flow in and around a model scramjet combustor flameholder. Experimental data available for this configuration include velocity statistics obtained from particle image velocimetry. Several turbulence models {{were used for the}} steady-state Reynolds-averaged simulations which included both linear and non-linear eddy viscosity models. The scale-resolving simulations used a hybrid Reynolds-averaged/large eddy simulation strategy that is designed to be a large eddy simulation everywhere except in the inner portion (log layer and below) of the boundary layer. Hence, this formulation can be regarded as a wall-modeled large eddy simulation. This e ort was undertaken to not only assess the performance of the hybrid Reynolds-averaged / large eddy simulation modeling approach in a flowfield of interest to the scramjet research community, but to also begin to understand how this capability can best be used to augment standard Reynolds-averaged simulations. The numerical errors were quantified for the steady-state simulations, and at least qualitatively assessed for the scale-resolving simulations prior to making any claims of predictive accuracy relative to the measurements. The steady-state Reynolds-averaged results displayed a high degree of variability when comparing the flameholder fuel distributions obtained from each turbulence model. This prompted the consideration of applying the higher-fidelity scale-resolving simulations as a surrogate "truth" model to calibrate the Reynolds-averaged closures in a non-reacting setting prior to their use for the combusting simulations. In general, the Reynolds-averaged velocity profile predictions at the <b>lowest</b> <b>fueling</b> <b>level</b> matched the particle imaging measurements almost as well as was observed for the non-reacting condition. However, the velocity field predictions proved to be more sensitive to the flameholder fueling rate than was indicated in the measurements...|$|R

30|$|In summary, this {{comprehensive}} {{case study}} provides a historical examination of fire {{history in a}} chaparral dominated landscape and gives land managers a frame of reference that could support decision-making and assist {{in the development of}} current and future chaparral fuel management strategies. Additional studies in other areas and at other elevations are needed before these findings can be applied more generally across the southern California landscape. Understanding how this fire history relates to one developed from low elevation stands that border residential development is of particular interest. Southern California {{has one of the highest}} numbers of housing units located within the wildland-urban interface and, despite recent economic difficulties, housing growth in these areas is expected to continue in the future (Radeloff et al. 2005, Safford 2007). In light of our findings, we suggest that effort and costs may be better spent on wildland-urban interface management and updating zoning regulations to reflect the current scientific consensus. In the context of <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>levels</b> and strong Santa Ana wind events, irregular spatial arrangement of fuels has been shown to be ineffective in controlling fire spread in chaparral landscapes (Moritz 1997, Keeley 2001, Keeley and Zedler 2009). The historical and modern records both imply that large, landscape-scale fires are inevitable in chaparral landscapes.|$|R

50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses {{an inverted}} bell-shaped burner {{topped with a}} flame spreader (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> output <b>levels,</b> the <b>fuel</b> will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.|$|R

40|$|The author studied {{how much}} road damage {{contributes}} to road use costs in Ghana {{and how the}} marginal social costs should be recovered. This required understanding the road deterioration process better and analyzing the implications for vehicle operating costs and road user charges. The most important thing learned is that studies of road-user costs are feasible in reputedly data-poor countries. The author found that {{to bridge the gap}} between road-user costs and charges, the annual fee for heavy trucks should be raised tenfold. Fuel taxes alone are not adequate to distinguish fully the large difference in road damage costs incurred by heavy trucks and private cars. The taxing instrument most deficient in Ghana is the annual licensing fee. Not only should licensing fees for heavy trucks be ten times higher than they are now, but exemptions from the licensing fee should be canceled and registration rules strictly enforced. Even then, charges on heavy vehicles will not cover costs unless current legal limits of axle loading are obeyed. A more efficient means of reducing the damaging effects of heavy vehicles lies in structuring the annual fees to reflect how much more damaging two-axle heavy vehicles are than multiaxle vehicles. The issue of redistribution of costs and fees is of secondary importance in Ghana because of <b>low</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption, <b>low</b> <b>level</b> of <b>fuel</b> taxes, and the fact that expenditures on fuels are proportionately the same for the poor and the nonpoor.
