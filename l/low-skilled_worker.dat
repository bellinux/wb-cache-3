If using this measure alone, Alxa was ranked first in China, even higher than its neighbor Ordos. However, it should be noted that wealth in the region is not evenly distributed, and that the numbers are skewed by its low permanent population. Much of the productive economic activity takes place under the auspices of several large companies operating in the region, extracting natural resources. These include China Kingho Corporation, a [...] "clean coal" [...] technology operator, and the Inner Mongolia based Taiximei Group. Due to its remote location, much of the economic activity takes place with the support of migrant laborers from other parts of China. The high per capita GDP is not reflected in the salaries of the average <b>low-skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> which is on par with other mid-sized Chinese cities.|$|E

40|$|Developing a three-sector and four-factor general {{equilibrium}} model, {{this paper}} offers {{an explanation of}} wage inequality in a vertically fragmented production structure typical of off-shore outsourcing to developing countries like China or India. The model characterizes a typical developing economy where intermediate good is produced using capital and local <b>low-skilled</b> <b>worker,</b> traditional sector uses unskilled worker to produce agricultural products and skilled worker works in tandem with intermediates to produce final goods for export. The model furnishes that wage dispersion could be explained theoretically in this specific-factor general equilibrium structure where factor returns are endogenously determined within a production structure with middle products. In particular, scenario analysis shows that increase in relative price of final good aggravates wage inequality, whereas opposite happens when price of intermediates and import-competing sector inflates.

40|$|This study {{argues that}} a multidimensional health benefit offer (i. e., offers of medical, dental, sick leave, or vision benefits) and the hours or tenure {{restrictions}} placed on it {{are affected by the}} relative demand for workers in the local labor market. Using the Bay Area Longitudinal Surveys (BALS), a database of low-skilled jobs, we show that an excess labor demand for workers' skills increases the firm's offer of health benefits and reduces the restrictions on them, while an excess labor supply increases restrictions. These findings suggest that research assessing the correlation between wages, skills, and whether or not a firm offers health insurance might understate the plight of the <b>low-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> since health care access may also be restricted by a failure to receive an array of health benefits and by the restrictions placed on the offer. Furthermore, public policies might place the issues of uninsurance of low-wage workers {{within the context of a}} lack of marketable skills since low-skilled workers might be able to enhance their ability to secure jobs that offer an array of health benefits if they acquire skills in short supply in the local labor market.

40|$|Globalization may {{impose a}} double-burden on <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> On the one hand, the {{relative}} supply of low-skilled labor increases.

40|$|In {{this brief}} {{we argue that}} welfare {{participation}} is more sensitive to economic conditions than previously believed. Why? Prior research focused on short-term economic fluctuations and ignored differences between high- and <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> As welfare is long-term (i. e., permanent) {{it makes more sense}} to make comparisons with long-term economic trends. Also, since <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are more likely to end up on welfare, it is proper to focus on their economic opportunities. Thus, we focus on the long-term impact of economic conditions on welfare participation, and we concentrate our analysis on <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> Specifically, we analyze long-term changes in the supply of high-paying jobs for coal and steel workers as they affect certain heavy coal- and steel-producing regions of the United States during the 1970 s and 1980 s. Our findings indicate that welfare participation in these regions closely mirrors the long-term local availability of high-paying jobs for <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> This has serious policy implications for the long-term success of welfare reform. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{skills and}} the use of skills at work in 21 OECD countries. The skills {{included}} in the analysis are literacy, numeracy and problem-solving.

40|$|To {{summarise}} {{the arguments}} in this paper, a {{case will be}} made for and against {{an increase in the}} minimum wage. First the case for the defence of a minimum wage increase. An increase in a minimum wage will, if the increase is within bounds, only increase the percentage of the output that <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> receive, without altering their employment numbers. If the marginal utility of income decreases with income, a minimum wage will thus increase social welfare in the short term. In the short term it is even possible that the reduction in the wages of the high-skilled workers will increase the labour supply of the high-skilled workers, thereby increasing employment of <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> and output in the short run. As to the long run: because <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are in practice not able to borrow against future wages, a higher minimum wage may increase the education that <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are able to afford for 19 themselves and their children, thereby increasing the number of high-skilled workers. This will increase total output in the long run. If there is a long run negative effect of a higher minimum wage on the number of low-skilled jobs, this will increase the incentives of <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> to become high-skilled, increasing output even further in the long run. Empirically, this possibility does not conflict with the findings that individual <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> increase their labour supply and their employment prospects if benefits are lowered, or that labour demand for <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> in any particular firm or industry, decreases if the wages of the <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> increases. These are all the effect of the fact that high-skilled workers will move to those firms and industries where they can earn higher wages and will try and combine with those <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> who will accept the lowest wages. An economy-wide minimum wage will make this â€fleeingâ€ behaviour impossible. The empirical evidence for this view comes from case studies which suggest that an {{increase in the minimum wage}} does not lead to a substantial reduction in the number of employed workers in the short run. Now the case against an increase of the minimum wage. If a large increase in the minimum wage crosses a technological â€switching pointâ€, where an existing alternative team technology becomes optimal for the high-skilled workers, the number of <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> employed will decrease dramatically. As this technology is not used before the increase of the minimum wage, there is no way to empirically tell beforehand whether such a technological switching point will be crossed or not. Even in the short run therefore, an increase in the minimum wage may unexpectedly result in a large reduction in the employment levels of <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> In the longer run, the increased incentives for high-skilled workers to find technologies that reduce the number of low-skilled jobs in production, may reduce the long run demand for low-skilled jobs. This may explain why the US and European case studies find such a small effect of a change in the minimum wage: as it takes time to develop and implement new technologies, the effects of a minimum wage under team production will only be felt in the long run. Also, the increase in a minimum wage may reduce the incentives for <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> to become high-skilled, increasing the number of <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> and hence reducing output in the long run. A final possibility is that an increase in the minimum wage decreases the wage of high-skilled workers and reduces the labour supply of high-skilled workers, thereby reducing the demand for <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> even in the short run 11. Both cases make arguments about what happens to technology and the number of <b>low-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in the long run, as a result of a higher minimum wage. As it is virtually impossible in an empirical study to separate the long-run effects of a minimum wage on employment and transition probabilities, from all the other factors that influence employment levels and transition probabilities (business cycles, technology shocks, changes in the international competitive environment, government intervention in education markets, etc.), I have little hope that either of these cases can be proven convincingly. ...|$|R
