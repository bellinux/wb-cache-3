40|$|Spectral <b>line</b> <b>width</b> {{broadening}} in Rydberg gases, {{a phenomenon}} previously {{attributed to the}} many-body effect, was observed experimentally almost a decade ago. The observed <b>line</b> <b>width</b> was typically 80 - 100 {{times larger than the}} average interaction strength predicted from a binary interaction. The interpretation of such a phenomenon is usually based on the so-called diffusion model, where the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> broadening mostly originates from the diffusion of excitations. In this paper, we present a model calculation to show that diffusion is not the main mechanism to the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> broadening. We find that the rare pair fluctuation at small separation is the dominant factor contributing to this broadening. Our results give a width of about 20 - 30 times larger than the average interaction strength.

We designed a prospective study to test the hypothesis that in vitro NMR spectroscopy has a high sensitivity for detecting early breast cancer. One hundred and thirty-five women were referred for breast biopsy due to abnormal mammograms. One hundred of these were recruited through a population-based mammography screening project. Sixty-nine of 135 women were found to have breast cancer and their average <b>line</b> <b>width</b> of the methyl and methylene resonance in the plasma were compared to those women who had a benign or normal histopathology in the biopsy and to the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> for 100 healthy subjects from the same population. The mean <b>line</b> <b>width</b> at a half-height of the methyl and methylene resonances of the serum lipoprotein lipids in the NMR spectrum did not differ appreciably between the groups.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose that}} the scatter in <b>line</b> <b>width</b> versus {{luminosity}} of the BLR of AGN arises from a dependence on the line of sight to an axially symmetric BLR. Adopting a simple model for the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> {{as a function of}} luminosity and angle, and convolving this with the observed luminosity function, allows us to predict a <b>line</b> <b>width</b> distribution consistent with the available data. Furthermore, we use the relation between the equivalent <b>width</b> of a <b>line</b> and the luminosity in the continuum to predict an observed correlation between <b>line</b> <b>width</b> and equivalent width. The scatter on this correlation is again provided by angular dependence. We also show a viewing angle dependence can produce the X-ray spectral index distribution.

This behavior {{is similar to that of}} ferric myoglobin. Due to large anisotropy in the g-tensors, the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> variation can be accounted for on the basis of heme orientation disorder. This disorder is characterized by an angle, determined here by two independent methods. In these computations Gaussian disorder on a sphere is assumed. The disorder angle is found to be constant on the sphere and about 4 degrees for both alpha- and beta- chains. Treatment of crystals with heavy water (buffer) increases the disorder. Since ligand nitrogen hyperfine couplings are available from hemoglobin electron nuclear double resonance, single crystal {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} spectra can be simulated by superimposing hyperfine bands, where the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> of the component bands is a variable and the disorder model above is employed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{variation}} in the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> with height in the inner corona (region above 1. 1 Rsun), by using the spectral data from LASCO-C 1 aboard SOHO. We used data acquired at activity minimum (August - October 1996) and during the ascending phase of the solar cycle (March 1998). Series of images acquired at different wavelengths across the Fe X 637. 6 nm (red) and Fe XIV 530. 3 nm (green) coronal lines by LASCO-C 1 allowed us to build radiance and width maps of the off-limb solar corona. In 1996, the <b>line</b> <b>width</b> of Fe XIV was roughly constant or increased with height up to around 1. 3 Rsun and then it decreased. The Fe X <b>line</b> <b>width</b> increased with height up to the point where the spectra were too noisy to allow <b>line</b> <b>width</b> measurements (around 1. 3 Rsun).

40|$|We {{identify}} the physical mechanisms {{responsible for the}} optical homogeneous broadening in Eu 3 +:Y 2 O 3 nanoparticles to determine whether rare-earth crystals can be miniaturized to volumes less than λ 3 whilst preserving their appeal for quantum technology hardware. By studying how the homogeneous <b>line</b> <b>width</b> depends on temperature, applied magnetic field, and measurement time scale the dominant broadening interactions for various temperature ranges above 3 K were characterized. Below 3 K the homogeneous <b>line</b> <b>width</b> is dominated by an interaction not observed in bulk crystal studies. These measurements demonstrate that broadening due to size-dependent phonon interactions is not a significant contributor to the homogeneous <b>line</b> <b>width,</b> which contrasts previous studies in rare-earth ion nanocrystals. Importantly, the results provide strong evidence that for the 400 nm diameter nanoparticles under study the minimum <b>line</b> <b>width</b> achieved (45 ± 1 kHz at 1. 3 K) is not fundamentally limited.
