5|$|Ishikawa {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Giants on April 24. After <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, {{with the return of}} Belt to first base and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite being a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts in left field, Ishikawa became the Giants starting left fielder during the 2014 postseason.|$|E
5|$|Albion and Wolves have contested the Black Country derby, {{it is one}} of {{the longest}} {{standing}} derbies in world football, being played more than 150 times; their first major clash was an FA Cup tie in 1886. The rivalry came to prominence when the two clubs contested the league title in 1953–54, and during the 1990s it intensified to new heights among supporters, with both clubs <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> Division One for much of the decade and only local pride at stake. Moreover, in 2002 Albion came from being 11 points adrift to overhaul Wolves to gain promotion. The rivalry was further heightened after the sides met in the play-offs in 2007. A 2004 survey by Planetfootball.com confirmed that the majority of both Albion and Wolves supporters consider the other to be their main rival. Despite their geographical location, fellow Black County club Walsall are seen as lesser rivals, having played in a lower division than Albion for most of their history.|$|E
5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920. For the {{remainder}} of the inter-war years though, Villa were on a slow decline that would lead to them being relegated to the Second Division in 1936 {{for the first time in}} their history. They returned to the top-tier of English football by the outbreak of the Second World War. As with many clubs, the war brought much change to Villa Park and remainder of the 1940s were spent rebuilding the team. By 1957, Villa were a Cup winning side once again with the clubs seventh FA Cup win. Even though Villa won the inaugural League Cup in 1960, the club were to enter into a very unsuccessful period. The 1960s saw much change at Villa Park. By the end of the 1960s, Villa were <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> the Second Division and fan pressure led to the resignation of the Board and the introduction of Doug Ellis as Villa Chairman.|$|E

25|$|The {{flotation}} of {{the company}} has been dogged with controversy.

Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it was as if they'd never been".|$|E

25|$|Former West Ham {{player and}} Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley officially {{took over the}} vacant West Ham job on 13 December 2006, just 48 hours after Pardew had been sacked by new {{chairman}} Eggert Magnússon. Curbishley had been the odds-on favourite for the West Ham job straight after Pardew's departure, so it {{came as no surprise}} that Curbishley was unveiled at a press conference on 13 December. Curbishley served as manager of local rivals Charlton for 15 years leading up to May 2006. During that time, he took Charlton from a struggling side <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> old Second Division to a recognized Premiership side.|$|E
25|$|Incredibly, the Phillies claimed baseball's {{best record}} after a two-month stretch {{during which they}} {{were one of the}} worst teams. On May 21, they held {{the best record in the}} NL at 26-15. Over the next two months, Philadelphia fell seven games out of first place, <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> third through much of the period. The Phillies' 22-31 record during that stretch was worse than every team except Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Arizona, Washington and Seattle (all teams who {{finished}} the season in last place). Starting from July 22, perhaps motivated by the firing that day of batting coach Milt Thompson, the Phillies went an MLB-best 49-19 through the rest of the season.|$|E
25|$|However, manager Trevor Francis {{continued}} to play his preferred main strike partnership of Ade Akinbiyi and Dele Adebola, keeping Johnson and Palace legend Dougie Freedman on the left-wing and bench, respectively. When Francis was dismissed, and with the Eagles mid-table, he was replaced by Steve Kember, who decided to partner Freedman with Neil Shipperley, while Johnson was left {{to play the role}} of support striker. The new strike partnership initially worked well, with Palace winning their first three matches and topping the table. However, the good start to the season did not continue and, with Palace <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> 20th place in November, Kember was dropped.|$|E

25|$|The new {{campaign}} {{began with the}} Heat retaining the Cup Winners Cup. They defeated the previous season's BBL Cup winners, the Milton Keynes Lions, over two legs, winning both games 91–89 at the Spectrum and 68–60 at the Bletchley Centre. The first league game saw the Heat suffer defeat on the road against the Newcastle Eagles, losing a tight affair 81–86. A run of mixed results found the team <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> mid-table by November, while the team {{went out of the}} BBL Cup, beaten over two legs by the Plymouth Raiders in the Semi-finals. The Heat lost both games, going down 73-80 in the first leg at home and 69-74 on the road.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the 1995 season saw Church play only {{occasionally}} for the first team, and he never made the impression required to become a regular in the side, with a first-class batting average <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> the mid-teens and a top score of only 35 {{in a total of}} 14 innings in both forms of the game. 1996 was a better year on the face of it, with 280 first-class runs at 25.75, but more than half of those came from just one of his 11 innings, when he hit 152 (almost treble the next highest score of his career) against Oxford University in June. That game also saw Church take his first wicket, that of William Kendall, and go on to record what was to remain his best innings bowling return of 4-50.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Frank W. Kushel, a Sears manager, {{was given}} {{responsibility}} for the catalog company's unwieldy, unprofitable building materials department. Sales were down, and there was excess inventory <b>languishing</b> <b>in</b> warehouses. He is credited with suggesting to Richard Sears that the company assemble kits of all the parts needed and sell entire houses through mail order. In the same year, the Aladdin Company of Bay City, Michigan, offered the first kit homes through mail order. In 1908, Sears issued its first specialty catalog for houses, Book of Modern Homes and Building Plans, featuring 44 house styles ranging in price from US $360–$2,890. The first mail order for a Sears house was filled in 1908. As Sears mail-order catalogs were in millions of homes, large numbers of potential homeowners were able to open a catalog, see different house designs, visualize their new home and then purchase it directly from Sears.|$|E
