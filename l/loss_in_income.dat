In New South Wales, the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1998 restricts farmers from clearing native vegetation {{on their own}} freehold land, and offers no compensation. The Act may therefore impose opportunity costs, or <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income,</b> on landholders. These opportunity costs are estimated for a case study property in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, and these results are then generalised to assess the broad trade-offs between development and preservation. The <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> appear to vary between 5 and 10 per cent of annual income, depending on livestock prices. The flow of these losses over time appears to total some $ 26 m for all properties of this kind in the immediate region.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} empirical {{estimates of}} the impacts of natural disasters on different forms of capital (with a focus on human and intangible capital and natural capital), and on real gross domestic product per capita. The types of disaster considered are droughts, earthquakes, floods, and storms and their impacts are {{measured in terms of}} the number of people affected or people affected per capita. The authors find statistically significant reductions on the values of human and intangible capital and land capital as a consequence of the disasters, and these reductions are greater when the impacts last for longer periods. Based on the assumption that natural disasters indirectly affect the level of <b>income</b> via <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> capital, the authors estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function using the different forms of capital as inputs. The <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> are found to vary across different countries and the type of natural disaster studied. However, a common finding is that the <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> depend generally on two factors: the relative magnitude of impacts of a natural disaster and the values of different forms of capital. The estimates in this paper are national level figures and cannot be useful in predicting the cost of damages at the local level, where much larger amounts can be experienced per capita. Nevertheless, the estimates provide some indication of magnitudes for different disasters and for different groups of countries. More work and more data are needed to get a dynamic profile for the losses of capital and income. But given the study's results, the time profile is estimated to range typically between two and five years.

50|$|Soon {{after he}} became Bishop of Roskilde in 1157, Absalon began to expand the {{travertine}} cathedral. In 1160, the art of firing bricks was brought to Denmark by monks from the south, and the new material was employed. It was decided to build a new, Romanesque cathedral around the existing one, allowing services to continue during construction. However, work was slow, and when Absalon was forced to surrender his position as Bishop of Roskilde in 1191, only the two floors of the apse, the choir towers {{and part of the}} transept had been completed. Absalon's successor, Peder Sunesen, embracing the new French Gothic style, made significant changes to the plans, tearing down the choir towers and reducing the width of the transept. The choir was completed and inaugurated in 1225, allowing services to begin there, and the old travertine cathedral was torn down. Work on the nave continued for the next 55 years, limited by funds, lack of kilns to fire the bricks, and the winters. With the exception of the two towers on the west facade, the cathedral was completed by 1280, and work on the interior proceeded, slowed by a fire in 1282 which also destroyed several of the canons' houses in the area. Several chapels were also added to the cathedral, and in 1405, work on the towers was completed.When Margrethe I died in 1412, she was buried in her family's chapel at Sorø Klosterkirke. But the following year Bishop Peder Jensen Lodehat, who had been the queen's chancellor and religious advisor, brought her body to Roskilde Cathedral. The monks in Sorø were outraged, above all because the loss of the queen's earthly remains would mean a significant <b>loss</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> from requiems — at that time monks and clergy would typically have been paid to say requiem masses for a dead person, and for a queen such masses would likely have been said on a regular basis in perpetuity, each one incurring a fee — as well as a loss of prestige. Though often blamed on the bishop, {{it is quite possible that}} the move was orchestrated by the queen's adoptive son, Eric of Pomerania. This is reinforced by the inscription on the sarcophagus, which describes how it was given by the new king, Eric VII, in 1423.|$|E

Estimates are made of the job growth in Washington that can be attributed to the Reagan military buildup.

30|$|Summary {{measures}} of income inequality have been broadly stable in Ireland {{over a long}} period, from the early 1990 s through {{to the start of}} the current recession. There were, however, some significant shifts on a year-by-year basis in the years 2008 to 2011, during which average incomes fell sharply as Ireland experienced the full force of a major recession. The year by year pattern shows a fall <b>in</b> <b>income</b> inequality <b>in</b> 2009, reversed in the following years. Some of this is directly attributable to the timing of policy changes, with an increase in welfare payments in 2009, while taxes and levies were sharply increased. Later years saw more emphasis on expenditure cuts, and less on income-based taxes. Over the full period 2008 to 2011 the Gini coefficient has returned to the narrow range in which it has remained over since the 1990 s. There have, however, been major <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> share for both bottom and top deciles, with gains <b>in</b> <b>income</b> shares focused on the rest of the upper half of the distribution.|$|R

Corporate management opposition to SFAS 8 {{on the grounds that}} the inclusion of translation gains and <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> would adversely affect the prices of their stocks were instrumental in the replacement of SFAS 8 by 52. Drawing on the efficient market and information content theories, the case is made for both positive and negative effects from the requirements. Hypotheses are then developed and tested for the information in the disclosures. ^ In contrast to previous studies, expectation for translation gains and losses are introduced. The earlier of the receipt of the 10 -K or the annual report at the Securities and Exchange Commission is used as the event date, following recent studies that recognize that detailed information in financial statements are usually not made available at the earnings announcement date. ^ Results indicate a negative but insignificant reaction to the disclosures under SFAS 8. Useful information is found in the SFAS 52 disclosures although the direction of the effects are not consistent with each expectation model. The results from a test to determine if the economic exposure effects of exchange risks are immediately impounded before the accounting information is known did not show the returns of multinational corporations significantly different from the returns of a control sample of domestic firms during periods of sharp exchange rate changes. ^ The study contributes to the literature by finding first an empirical 2 ̆ 2 no 2 ̆ 2 answer to the adverse effects concerns generated by the required inclusion of translation gains and <b>losses</b> <b>in</b> <b>income</b> under SFAS 8 and second, support that useful information will be used by the market, regardless of where it is included in the financial statements.
