40|$|To {{reverse the}} {{downward}} {{trend in the}} balance of trade, American companies must concentrate on increasing research into new products, boosting productivity, and improving manufacturing processes. The Precision Engineering Center at North Carolina State University is a multidisciplinary research and graduate education program dedicated to providing the new technology necessary to respond to this challenge. One extremely demanding manufacturing area is the fabrication and assembly of optical systems. These systems {{are at the heart of}} such consumer products as cameras, <b>lenses,</b> <b>copy</b> machines, laser bar-code scanners, VCRs, and compact audio discs - products that the Japanese and other East Asian countries are building dominance. A second critical area is the fabrication of VLSI and ULSI circuits. The tolerances required to produce the next generation of components for such systems have created the need for new approaches - approaches that could either make or break America`s competitive position. This report contains individual reports on research projects grouped into three broad areas: measurement and actuation; real-time control; precision fabrication. Separate abstracts for these articles have been indexed into the energy database...|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1951, the Zorki 3 was {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} Leica III. It offered a number of improvements over the original Zorki, including a large combined viewfinder with the rangefinder builtin, a removable back, and a larger and faster Jupiter-8 (<b>lens)</b> (Zeiss Sonnar <b>copy)</b> <b>lens.</b> It also added a new mechanism for slow shutter speeds with a separate selector dial {{on the front of}} the camera. This mechanism was unreliable, so the improved Zorki 3M of 1954 (also produced in 1955) combined all of the shutter speeds on a single dial. The Zorki 3S, introduced in 1955, was a Zorki 3M with flash sync.|$|R
50|$|The way {{in which}} Copyscopes are to be {{constructed}} was first shown and explained in the May 1986 issue of Astronomy Magazine by Ken Bird. Surplus <b>copy</b> <b>lens</b> from 200 to 300 mm focal lengths along with PVC pipe components for the tube and lens holder were used to build the Copyscope described in the magazine.|$|R
40|$|One copy of {{the mouse}} alpha A-crystallin gene alpha A-CRYBP 1 site {{activated}} the thymidine kinase (tk) promoter in a mouse lens epithelial cell line but not in primary chicken <b>lens</b> cells; multiple <b>copies</b> further activated the tk promoter and extended expression to fibroblasts, B cells, and chicken lens cultures. The loss of lens specificity by multimerization may place selective constraints {{on the number of}} alpha A-CRYBP 1 sites in the alpha A-crystallin promoter...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{video is}} {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent. Unfortunately, editing video remains difficult for several reasons: it is a time-based medium, it has dual tracks of audio and video, and current tools force users {{to work at the}} smallest level of detail. Based on interviews with professional video editors and observations of the use of our own editor, we have developed new interaction techniques for digital video based on semantic zooming and <b>lenses.</b> When <b>copying</b> or cutting a piece of video, it is desirable to select both ends precisely. However, although many video editing tools allow zooming into a fine level of detail, they do not allow zooming at more than one location simultaneously. Our system provides multiple lenses on the same timeline, so the user can see more than one location in detail...|$|R

In {{addition}} to false identity papers, they were equipped with US$60,000 in currency ($ today), a [...] "backup" [...] cache of 99 diamonds, two [...]32 caliber Colt automatic pistols, a Leica camera with a special <b>lens</b> for document <b>copying,</b> two Krahl wristwatches, secret inks and developers, and microdots that contained radio schematics and transmission schedules as well as mail drop addresses.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lens on the}} Hexar is {{considered}} to be of high quality for this type of camera and isoften compared with other high-quality lenses such as those from Leica. It is oftenstated that the <b>lens</b> is a <b>copy</b> of the Leica Summicron 35mm f2 lens, although this doesnot appear to be the case. The source of this statement may be a pair of articles by DanteStella where he states that photos taken with the Hexar have a similar [...] "look" [...] to those takenwith a 35mm Summicron, but notes that the lens seems more similar to a Nikon 35mm f1.8lens design.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{a new technique}} to generate multiple light-sheets for fluorescence microscopy. This is possible by illuminating the cylindrical <b>lens</b> using multiple <b>copies</b> of Gaussian beams. A diffraction grating placed just before the cylindrical lens splits the incident Gaussian beam into multiple beams traveling at different angles. Subsequently, this gives rise to diffraction-limited light-sheets after the Gaussian beams pass through the combined cylindrical lens-objective sub-system. Direct measurement of field at and around the focus of objective lens shows multi-sheet pattern with an average thickness of 7. 5 mu m and inter-sheet separation of 380 mu m. Employing an independent orthogonal detection sub-system, we successfully imaged fluorescently-coated yeast cells (approximate to 4 mu m) encaged in agarose gel-matrix. Such a diffraction-limited sheet-pattern equipped with dedicated detection system may find immediate applications {{in the field of}} optical microscopy and fluorescence imaging.

Eric Baer is Director, Center for Layered Polymeric Systems (CLiPS), The Herbert Henry Dow Professor of Science and Engineering and Professor in the Dept. of Macromolecular Science and Engineering at Case Western Reserve University. Baer's {{research}} interests include: irreversible microdeformation mechanisms; pressure effects on morphology and mechanical properties; relationships between hierarchical structure and mechanical function; mechanical properties of soft connective tissue; polymer composites and blends; polymerization crystallization on crystalline surfaces; viscoelastic properties of polymer melts; damage and fracture analysis of polymers, and micro- and nanolayered composites. Eric Baer was the Editor of the Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 1988 - 2011. He is Editor of five books and has published over 600 research papers. Runtime: 62 : 23 minutesThe fundamental discoveries with polymer micro/nanolayered and fibrillar systems are being “translated” into new novel products. Three examples will {{be described in}} detail. First the development of graded index <b>lenses,</b> which are <b>copies</b> of mamalian <b>lenses</b> for application in telescopic systems, will be outlined.

Finally, new membrane filters will be described that are specifically designed for the removal of water droplets out of gasoline. The lecture series will be concluded by indicating additional applications currently under consideration...|$|R
