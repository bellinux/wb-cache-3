40|$|Abstract Background There {{are many}} {{different}} types of pediculicides available OTC in Australia. In this study we compare the efficacy and safety of three topical pediculicides: a pediculicide containing melaleuca oil (tea tree oil) and lavender oil (TTO/LO); a head lice "suffocation" product; and a product containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (P/PB). Method This study was a randomised, assessor-blind, comparative, parallel study of 123 subjects with live head lice. The head lice products were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions (the TTO/LO product and the "suffocation" product were applied three times at weekly intervals according to manufacturers instructions (on Day 0, Day 7 and Day 14) and the P/PB product was applied twice according to manufacturers instructions (on Day 0 and Day 7)). The presence or absence of live lice one day following the last treatment was determined. Results The percentage of subjects who were <b>louse-free</b> one day after the last treatment with the product containing tea tree oil and lavender oil (41 / 42; 97. 6 %) and the head lice "suffocation" product (40 / 41, 97. 6 %) was significantly higher compared to the percentage of subjects who were <b>louse-free</b> one day after the last treatment with the product containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide (10 / 40, 25. 0 %; adj. p Conclusion The high efficacy of the TTO/LO product and the head lice "suffocation" product offers an alternative to the pyrethrins-based product. Trial Registration The study was entered into the Australian/New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ACTRN 12610000179033. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ostrich feather lice (Struthiolipeurus struthionis) on {{productivity}} and leather quality {{was investigated in}} the light of louse-related skin damage on other livestock species that seems similar to defects, called pitting, seen on ostrich skins. The occurrence and spread of feather lice on ostriches were also studied. Natural infestation of <b>louse-free</b> ostriches within a group mixed with louse-infested ostriches was achieved within 6 months. Lousiness was determined by visual counts on the body and feathers of the ostriches on five locations. There was a relatively low correlation between the number of lice observed on the live ostriches and the actual number of lice extracted from harvested wing feathers. However, it was demonstrated that lice obtained from feathers increased at a rate of 3. 29 (s. e. = 1. 34) lice per 100 g of feathers for an increase of one louse observed on the live birds in the paddock (R 2 = 0. 23). Treatment with synthetic pyrethroid insecticides eradicated all lice. Louse infestation had no significant influence on growth or slaughter traits, while no causal relationship between louse infestation and pitting damage on the processed ostrich skins could be demonstrated.
