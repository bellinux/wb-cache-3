5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said {{she saw the}} figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in <b>Liston</b> churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

25|$|<b>Liston</b> {{made his}} second title defense on February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach, Florida against Cassius Clay (soon {{to change his}} name to Muhammad Ali). <b>Liston</b> was a heavy favorite. In a pre-fight poll, 43 of 46 sportswriters picked <b>Liston</b> to win by knockout. Odds makers gave <b>Liston</b> 1–7 to win.|$|E
25|$|The {{second round}} saw <b>Liston</b> {{continue}} to pursue Ali. At one point <b>Liston</b> had Ali against the ropes and landed a hard left hook. Ali confessed later he had been hurt by the punch, but <b>Liston</b> was unable to press his advantage home. Two of the three official scorers awarded the round to <b>Liston</b> and the other scored the round even.|$|E
25|$|<b>Liston</b> {{appears as}} a {{character}} in James Ellroy's novel The Cold Six Thousand. In the novel, <b>Liston</b> not only drinks but also pops pills and works as a sometime enforcer for a heroin ring in Las Vegas. <b>Liston</b> also appears in the sequel, Blood's a Rover.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1954, <b>Liston</b> was in {{his eighth}} fight when {{suffered}} defeat for the first time, losing to Marty Marshall, a journeyman with an awkward style. In the third round, Marshall nailed Liston—reportedly while he was laughing—and broke his jaw. A stoic <b>Liston</b> finished the fight but lost by an eight-round split decision. On April 21, 1955, <b>Liston</b> defeated Marshall in a rematch, dropping him four times {{en route to a}} sixth-round knockout. They had a rubber match on March 6, 1956, which <b>Liston</b> won by a lopsided ten-round unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|Liston's {{streak of}} nine {{straight}} knockout victories ended {{when he won}} a unanimous twelve-round decision against Eddie Machen on September 7, 1960. Machen's mobility enabled him to go the distance. However, Machen's taunting and his spoiling tactics of dodging and grappling—at one point almost heaving <b>Liston</b> over the ropes—so alienated the audience that <b>Liston</b> received unaccustomed support from the crowd. Before his bout with <b>Liston,</b> Muhammad Ali consulted Machen and was advised {{that the key to}} success was to make <b>Liston</b> lose his temper.|$|E
25|$|Since 1945, {{the award}} for the best and fairest player in each VFA/VFL season has been the J. J. <b>Liston</b> Trophy, named after {{long-term}} Association president John James <b>Liston,</b> who died in 1944.|$|E
25|$|<b>Liston</b> {{competed in}} the 1953 National Amateur Athletic Union Tournament and lost in the quarterfinals to 17-year-old Jimmy McCarter on April 15. <b>Liston</b> would later employ McCarter as a {{sparring}} partner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Liston</b> was {{the subject}} of a 2008 feature film based upon his life titled Phantom Punch. The film starred Ving Rhames as <b>Liston</b> and was {{produced}} by Rhames, Hassain Zaidi and Marek Posival.|$|E
25|$|In {{the session}} 1818–1819 Syme became {{assistant}} and demonstrator of the dissecting room of Robert <b>Liston,</b> {{who had started}} as an extramural teacher of anatomy in competition with Liston's old master, Dr John Barclay; in those years he held also resident appointments in the infirmary and the fever hospital, and {{spent some time in}} Paris practising dissection and operative surgery. In 1823 <b>Liston</b> handed over to him the whole charge of his anatomy classes, retaining his interest in the school as a pecuniary venture; the arrangement did not work smoothly, and a feud with <b>Liston</b> arose, which did not terminate until twenty years later, when <b>Liston</b> was settled in London.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{up to the}} fight, Sonny <b>Liston</b> was {{the major}} betting-line favorite, though Sports Illustrated {{predicted}} that Patterson would win in 15 rounds. Jim Braddock, Jersey Joe Walcott, Ezzard Charles, Rocky Marciano and Ingemar Johansson picked Patterson to win. The fight also carried a number of social implications. Liston's connections with the mob were well known and the NAACP was concerned about {{having to deal with}} Liston's visibility as World Champion and had encouraged Patterson not to fight <b>Liston,</b> fearing that a <b>Liston</b> victory would tarnish the civil rights movement. Patterson also claimed that John F. Kennedy did not want him to fight <b>Liston</b> either.|$|E
25|$|United States President John F. Kennedy {{also did}} not want Patterson to fight <b>Liston.</b> When Patterson met with the {{president}} in January 1962, Kennedy suggested that Patterson avoid <b>Liston,</b> citing Justice Department concerns over Liston's ties to organized crime.|$|E
25|$|Jack Dempsey {{spoke for}} many {{when he was}} quoted as saying that Sonny <b>Liston</b> {{should not be allowed to}} fight for the title. <b>Liston</b> angrily responded by {{questioning}} whether Dempsey's failure to serve in World War I qualified him to moralize. Frustrated, <b>Liston</b> changed his management in 1961 and applied pressure through the media by remarking that Patterson, who had faced mostly white challengers since becoming champion, was drawing the color line against his own race.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Liston</b> was {{released}} from prison on October 31, 1952, he had a brief amateur career that spanned less than a year. <b>Liston</b> captured the Chicago Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions on March 6, 1953, with a victory over 1952 Olympic Heavyweight Champion Ed Sanders. He then outpointed Julius Griffin, winner of the New York Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions, to capture the Intercity Golden Gloves Championship on March 26. <b>Liston</b> was dropped in the first round, but he came back to control the next two rounds and had Griffin hanging on at the end.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Liston</b> {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as unbeatable, he lost the title in 1964 to Cassius Clay (later known as Muhammad Ali), who entered as a 7–1 underdog. Controversy followed with claims that <b>Liston</b> had been drinking heavily {{the night before the}} fight. In his 1965 rematch with Clay, <b>Liston</b> suffered an unexpected first-round knockout that led to unresolved suspicions of a fix. He was still a world-ranked boxer when he died under mysterious circumstances in 1970. Underworld connections and his unrecorded date of birth added to the enigma.|$|E
25|$|Beckman Instruments also {{acquired}} the Liston-Becker Instrument Company in June 1955. Founded by Max D. <b>Liston,</b> Liston-Becker {{had a successful}} record {{in the development of}} infrared gas analyzers. <b>Liston</b> developed instruments to measure smog and car exhaust emissions, essential to attempts to improve Los Angeles air quality in the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|The Ring {{magazine}} ranks <b>Liston</b> as {{the seventh}} greatest heavyweight of all time, while the respected boxing writer Herb Goldman ranked him second. In his book, The Gods of War, Springs Toledo argued that <b>Liston,</b> when at his {{peak in the}} late 1950s and early 1960s, could be favored to beat just about every heavyweight champion {{in the modern era}} {{with the possible exception of}} Muhammad Ali.|$|E
25|$|In the 2001 film Ali, <b>Liston</b> {{was portrayed}} by former WBO Heavyweight Champion Michael Bentt.|$|E
25|$|The rematch {{was set for}} April 1963; however, <b>Liston</b> {{injured his}} knee {{swinging}} a golf club and the fight was delayed to July 22, 1963. In Las Vegas that night, Patterson attempted {{to become the first}} boxer to win the heavyweight title three times, but <b>Liston</b> once again knocked him out in the first round. Patterson lasted four seconds longer than in the first bout.|$|E

25|$|<b>Liston</b> trained {{hard for}} the rematch, which was {{scheduled}} to take place November 13, 1964, in Boston. Time magazine said <b>Liston</b> had worked himself into the best shape of his career. However, there were again rumors of alcohol abuse in training. The extent to which Liston's heavy drinking and possible drug use {{may have contributed to}} his surprisingly poor performances against Ali is not known.|$|E
25|$|<b>Liston</b> {{boxed in}} an International Golden Gloves {{competition}} at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis on June 23, and knocked out Hermann Schreibauer of West Germany at 2:16 {{of the first}} round. The previous month, Schreibauer had won a bronze medal in the European Championships. At this time, the {{head coach of the}} St. Louis Golden Gloves team, Tony Anderson, stated that <b>Liston</b> was the strongest fighter he had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Liston</b> {{played a}} fist fighter in the 1965 film Harlow, made a cameo {{appearance}} in the 1968 film Head, which starred The Monkees, and played the part of The Farmer in the 1970 film Moonfire, which starred Richard Egan and Charles Napier.

25|$|Coroner Mark Herman said {{traces of}} heroin {{byproducts}} {{were found in}} Liston's system, but not in amounts large enough to have caused his death. Also, scar tissue, possibly from needle marks, {{was found in the}} bend of Liston's left elbow. The toxicology report said his body was too decomposed for the tests to be conclusive. Officially, <b>Liston</b> died of lung congestion and heart failure. He had been suffering from hardening of the heart muscle and lung disease before his death. <b>Liston</b> had been hospitalized in early December, complaining of chest pains.|$|E
25|$|In The Greatest, the 1977 {{film about}} the life of boxer Muhammad Ali in which Ali played himself, <b>Liston</b> was portrayed by future Magnum, P.I. star Roger E. Mosley.|$|E
25|$|After {{the third}} Johansson fight, Patterson defended the title on December 4, 1961 against Tom McNeeley and {{retained}} the title with a fourth-round knockout. However {{he did not}} fight number-one contender Sonny <b>Liston.</b> This was {{due in part to}} Cus D'Amato, who did not want Patterson in the ring with a boxer with mob connections. As a result, D'Amato turned down any challenges involving the IBC. Eventually, due to a monetary dispute with Jimmy Jacobs, Patterson removed D'Amato from handling his business affairs and agreed to fight <b>Liston.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{lost his}} title to <b>Liston</b> on September 25, 1962 in Chicago, by a first-round {{knockout}} {{in front of}} 18,894 fans. The two fighters were a marked contrast. In the ring, Liston's size and power proved too much for Patterson's guile and agility. However, Patterson did not use his speed to his benefit. According to Sports Illustrated writer Gilbert Rogin, Patterson didn't punch enough and frequently tried to clinch with <b>Liston.</b> <b>Liston</b> battered Patterson with body shots and then shortened up and connected with two double hooks high on the head. The result {{at the time was}} the third-fastest knockout in boxing history. After being knocked out, Patterson left Comiskey Park in Chicago wearing dark glasses and a fake beard for the drive back to New York. After the fight, questions were raised on whether the fight was fixed to set up a more lucrative rematch. Overnight, Patterson seemed to lose his public support {{as a result of his}} swift knockout.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after he}} became seventh Catholic Bishop of Auckland in 1929, James Michael <b>Liston</b> renewed the {{invitation}} to the Christian Brothers, whose pupil {{he had been in}} Dunedin. This again aroused the opposition of the Marist Brothers. They were concerned that a new boys' Form I to VI school would take enrolments from Sacred Heart College and would diminish their revenue. Unmoved by the Marist Brothers' opposition, <b>Liston</b> requested his old Dunedin classmate, Brother Michael James Benignus Hanrahan (Brother Benignus), the Christian Brothers provincial, to provide brothers to staff the school. This was agreed to.|$|E

25|$|From {{the opening}} bell <b>Liston</b> {{attempted}} to close with Ali, looking {{to land a}} hard punch to the head to end the fight quickly and decisively. Though Ali often carried his gloves down at his waist, seemingly open to attack, he proved very difficult to hit. With Ali quickly ducking his head left, right or away, Liston's leading left jabs largely failed to land. As <b>Liston</b> pursued his target Ali retreated away, using his foot speed to slip away into open space in the ring, largely circling {{to the left and}} away from the threat of a <b>Liston</b> left hook. Though the opening round saw Ali largely on the defensive, it was soon established that Ali could reverse roles quickly and take to the offensive with a remarkably fast series of combinations delivered to Liston's head. A sudden violent combination delivered with 30 seconds left in the round electrified the crowd. The opening round was fought an extra 20 seconds, as both fighters and referee Barney Felix apparently did not hear the bell.|$|E
