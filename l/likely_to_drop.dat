5|$|The {{following}} season City {{failed to}} capitalise on the gains {{made in the}} first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. While City rarely seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. Mancini was dismissed two days later, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season, but BBC Sports Editor David Bond reported he had been sacked for his poor communication and relationships with players and executives. In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini. In Pellegrini's first season, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title {{on the last day of}} the season.|$|E

25|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company {{for a long period}} of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for upward mobility to begin with based on these same stereotypes.|$|E
25|$|After {{setting the}} pace {{throughout}} free practice, Menu {{went on to}} take pole position ahead of Muller and Huff while Chevrolet wrapped up the manufacturers title. Much of the attention was on the Honda of Monteiro, who at one point looked <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out in Q1 until a last minute quick lap got him through to the second session. He finished Q2 eleventh behind Stefano D'Aste who would take his third reversed grid pole position {{of the year in}} race two. Independents' Trophy leader Michelisz could only manage fourteenth, five places behind trophy rival Oriola. The Team Aon duo of James Nash and Tom Chilton qualified in 19th and 21st respectively but would both start the first race {{at the back of the}} grid due to them both requiring a new engine for the event.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the fall}} of 2008, AVO has flown 13 gas {{measurement}} flights, and of these, 5 have occurred since the eruption began on March 15, 2009. Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates (up to 2000 tonnes/day) were measured in October–November, 2008. Starting in late January 2009, and coincident with a strong increase in seismicity, gas emission rates rose to a level (> 5000 tonnes/d) suggesting significant unrest at the volcano, and emissions stayed at this level until the eruption began. Since that time, emissions of both CO2 and sulfur dioxide (SO2) have been very elevated, sometimes reaching levels in excess of 10,000 tonnes/d. These volcanic gas emission rates are among the largest ever measured in Alaska, though such high values are consistent with an openly degassing volcanic system that is actively extruding lava. Based on measurements and observations from Redoubt's previously observed eruptions, these gas emission rates are <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> substantially when the eruption wanes.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{which of}} the students who entered economics Ph. D. programs in fall 2002 were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> earn a Ph. D. within five years, and which were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>dropped</b> out. Students enrolled in Top- 15 ranked programs are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have <b>dropped</b> out, but no more <b>likely</b> than others <b>to</b> have graduated; relatively more of them remain in the pipeline after five years of study. Students with higher verbal and quantitative GRE scores more frequently survive the first five years but are no more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have graduated in five years. First-year financial aid appears to reduce attrition and increase completion for U. S. citizens. Those with undergraduate degrees from Top- 60 U. S. liberal arts colleges and from foreign universities have both lower attrition and higher completion probabilities. The availability of office space for Ph. D. students is related to higher retention among non-U. S. citizens, but lower completion probabilities among U. S. citizens. There are also important differences in the characteristics associated with retention and completion probabilities between men and women. Faculty size, student load...|$|R
25|$|Community college {{students}} are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be food insecure than those students at four-year colleges. African American and Latino {{college students}} are food insecure to greater extent than Asian and White college students. Three-fourths of college students who are food insecure receive some form of financial aid {{and the majority of}} these students are employed. It has been found that food insecurity at the community college level is far higher for students concentrated in mathematics, developmental writing, and reading. Food insecure students are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consider <b>dropping</b> out of college and are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> stay on track toward obtaining their academic goals than those who are food secure.|$|R
25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E
25|$|After {{an end to}} {{the season}} which many {{believed}} would only spur City on, however, the following season failed to capitalise on any of the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. The transfer window saw virtually no players join the club until {{the last day of the}} season, when a last-minute burst of activity saw four different players all join in the space of around 10 hours. The free-flowing football of the previous season was suddenly rare to behold, and while City rarely seemed <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the UEFA Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, in a result which seemed to confirm Mancini's reputation as far better at managing in domestic games than European, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. The loss resulted in Mancini's dismissal, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season but with many in the press suggesting a break-down of relations between Mancini and his players but also between the Italian and his board-level superiors, while a refusal to promote young players was also cited. In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, who boasted a far more impressive Champions League record but less of a reputation for trophy-winning.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of the family, rural females are sent to find urban employment over male counterparts, mainly to supplement familial income at home and to support the males, who are more likely to attend college. The male standard of education in China is higher, particularly when a family is under financial stress, females are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of school to generate income for the family. Because females have lesser impact on the family's long-term financial stability, their rights for opportunities development are consequently unequal. This inequality also reinforces emotional motivations for migration. Many women migrate to find personal fulfillment. Stereotypes in China that developed as a result of globalization portray rural women as [...] "‘backward’" [...] and urban women as [...] "‘modern’". Many people associate modernity with maturity, so rural women migrate to cities to be perceived as mature. Migrant women also appreciate the knowledge they obtain (including political- and self-awareness) while living in cities. Some women even report desiring to leave villages as a result of boredom with rural life. Ideas perpetuated due to globalization simultaneously increased women's intentions to become independent; many migrant workers desire lives separate from those of their families’.|$|E

40|$|Many {{school systems}} today {{are trying to}} attract top college {{graduates}} into teaching, but {{little is known about}} what dissuades this target group from entering the profession. This study randomly assigned applicants for a highly-selective alternative pathway into teaching in Argentina either to a survey about their motivations for applying to the program or to surveys that revealed information about their future pay or working conditions. The study finds that applicants who received information about pay or working conditions were much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report that they intended <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of the selection process, but were no more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>drop</b> out.

2500|$|The {{intensity}} of aphasia therapy {{is determined by}} the length of each session, total hours of therapy per week, and total weeks of therapy provided. There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. [...] For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks scored higher on language measures than the control group who received less intensive therapy. However, a Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia revealed a more nuanced finding. The review found that treatments that are higher intensity, higher dose or over a long duration of time led to significantly better functional communication but people were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).|$|E
2500|$|Research {{has found}} {{that there is a}} high risk of {{educational}} underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions of which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an urban war zone is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even war-like conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior. Because of poverty, [...] "Students from low-income families are 2.4 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out than middle-income kids, and over 10 times more likely than high-income peers to drop out" ...|$|E
50|$|Abscission {{can also}} occur in {{premature}} leaves {{as a means}} of plant defense. Premature leaf abscission has been shown to occur in response to infestation by gall aphids. By abscising leaves that have been made host to aphid galls, plants have been shown to massively diminish the pest population, as 98% of aphids in abscised galls died. The abscission is selective, and the chance of dropping leaves increases as the number of galls increase. A leaf with three or more galls was four times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> abscise than a leaf with one, and 20 times as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dropped</b> as a leaf without any galls.|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out is {{a dangerous}} one for the student. The purpose of this quantitative {{study was to examine}} the relationship between student mathematics achievement as measured by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) Grade 4 Mathematics Test (G 4 MT), Grade 8 Mathematics Test (G 8 MT), and Integrated Algebra Mathematics Test (IAMT) and dropping out of high school in a medium-size school district in the Lower Hudson Region of New York. Furthermore, the study examined to what extent the New York State mathematics tests served as predictors of students dropping out of high school. The 680 research participants were students who first entered Grade 9 in the 2006 - 2007 school year. There was no statistically significant relationship between students’ mathematics achievement and dropping out of high school. However, there was a statistically significant relationship between student taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT and dropping out of high school. Taking the NYSED G 8 MT and IAMT contributed significantly to the prediction of students dropping out of high school. Students taking the NYSED G 4 MT and G 8 MT were almost 3 times more <b>likely</b> not <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of high school. Moreover, students taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT were 10 times more <b>likely</b> not <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> out of high school.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluates the}} changes in social {{networks}} of older and younger breast cancer patients over a 6 -month period following their first diagnosis and how such modifications are associated with changes in the patients’ mood state.  Design and Methods: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were interviewed shortly after their diagnosis and again 6 months later. Female support network members enumerated by patients were interviewed once within 3 months of the patients’ initial interview.  Results: Findings based on information for 149 network members of 26 patients indicate that members in older (≥ 51 years) patients’ networks were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dropped</b> at follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 21, p =. 04) compared with those in younger patients’ networks. Network members who provided more support were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dropped</b> by younger patients (OR = 0. 42, p <. 01). Decrease in network size was associated with decrease in mood disturbances among younger patients (Profile of Mood State–Bipolar: β = 0. 35, p ≤. 01).  Implications: Reducing the number of network members after cancer diagnosis may not necessarily lead to psychological distress, providing support for self-regulation of social network resources among cancer patients. Older patients’ network members were more embedded in patients’ networks, making it more stable over time. Identifying important network members (e. g., frequent support providers for younger patients and family members for older patients) and facilitating positive social interactions between these network members and patients may be beneficial...|$|R
