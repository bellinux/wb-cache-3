40|$|Abstract. To {{overcome}} {{the shortcomings of}} assembly lightweight steel structure residential system in our country. A new type of lightweight energy-saving composite wall is proposed, which is composed by <b>light-gauge</b> shaped <b>steel</b> and thin panel. In order to investigate the load-bearing behaviour and failure mode of the composite wall, 4 wall specimens in full ratio were designed and manufactured. The experiment study is carried out under lateral and vertical loads. The {{results show that the}} self-drilling screw integrate the <b>light-gauge</b> shaped <b>steel</b> and thin panel to bear loads. The decrease of self-drilling screw spacing can effectively enhance the load-bearing capacity of the composite wall, and the best choice of the self-drilling screw pitch is 150 mm. The composite wall has good bearing and deformation capacity, and it is suitable for applying to light weight steel residential system in our country...|$|R

40|$|The {{external}} {{envelope of}} steel framed industrial buildings normally {{involves the use}} of purlins and rails spanning between the main hot-rolled frames to support the roofing/cladding. These purlins are typically <b>light-gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> members of complex shape for which the thin-walled nature of the material means that local instabilities will significantly influence their structural behaviour. Economic design should be based on failure of the system, recognising the opportunity for redistribution of moments. This paper presents the findings from a numerical investigation of the degree of moment redistribution in continuous cold-formed steel beams subjected to a downward (gravity) uniformly distributed load (UDL). Three types of nonlinear finite element analysis were validated against previously reported physical tests: (i) continuous two-span beams subjected to a UDL, (ii) single span beams subjected to a central point load producing a moment gradient and (ii) single span beams subjected to two point loads producing a central region under pure bending. The interior support moments from the continuous beam models were compared against reference moment capacities from the three-point bending models. Based on various different section sizes, covering a range of cross-sectional slenderness, full moment redistribution with no drop-off in moment at the interior support was found to be possible only for stocky sections but not for slender sections. In the case of slender sections, local and distortional buckling caused a reduction in interior support moment prior to failure of the system. Hence a design formula is proposed to estimate the post-peak reduction of interior support moment from its initial peak, and this reduced moment capacity is then used in conjunction with the full span moment to determine the load-carrying capacity of the system. Comparisons show the proposed approach to offer accurate prediction of observed system failure loads...|$|R
25|$|Constructed of <b>light-gauge</b> painted sheet <b>steel,</b> Joroleman {{designed}} his mailbox with an arched, tunnel-shape roof, which prevented excessive {{accumulation of}} rainwater or snow while resisting deformation. The tunnel top also simplified {{the process of}} mass production by {{eliminating the need for}} precise sheet metal bends. Stamped and formed metal straps riveted to the arched opening and the mailbox door served as a door latching mechanism, while a rotating red semaphore flag mounted on a shaft attached {{to the side of the}} mailbox served to signal the approaching mailman if there was outgoing mail inside. Fitted with a crimped or braze-on rear steel panel and a false floor to keep its contents dry in inclement or humid weather, the Joroleman mailbox required only two rivets, three axle bolts, and four screws and nuts for completion. Durable and inexpensive, the popularity of the Joroleman mailbox was further enhanced by a decision not to patent the design, but to make its specifications known to all potential manufacturers for competitive sale. Adopted across the United States, it has remained the top-selling mailbox since its introduction, and was also widely used in Canada prior to that country's decision to eliminate individual curbside delivery to rural residents.|$|R

40|$|The {{external}} {{envelope of}} steel framed industrial buildings normally {{involves the use}} of purlins and rails spanning between the main hot-rolled frames to support the roofing/cladding. These purlins are typically <b>light-gauge</b> cold-formed <b>steel</b> members of complex shape for which the thinness of the material means that local instabilities will significantly influence their structural behaviour. In this thesis, the finite element (FE) method (ABAQUS) has been used to develop numerical analyses to study the buckling behaviour and degree of moment redistribution in continuous and sleeved cold-formed steel 2 -span purlin systems. Five types of nonlinear FE analyses have been validated against reported physical tests: (i) continuous 2 -span beams subjected to uniformly distributed load (UDL), (ii) single span beams subjected to a moment gradient, (iii) single span beams subjected to pure bending (iv) sleeved 2 -span beams subjected to a UDL and (v) single span sleeved sections subjected to a moment gradient. The FE analyses were used to generate a large portfolio of new results for gravity and uplift loading for continuous and sleeved 2 -span arrangements covering a wide range of cross-sections by varying the flange and web dimensions and material thickness. The effects of local and distortional buckling and limited rotational capacities for single span FE models were investigated. The 2 -span FE results formed the basis for a simple modification to conventional plastic design that recognises the possibility of a reduction in moment with increasing rotation in the interior support region. The assumption of full moment redistribution for gravity loading was found to be only valid for stocky sections but not for slender sections. For uplift loading in addition to the potential reductions in moment at the interior support, limitations in the span moment due to lateral torsional buckling (LTB) for slender members were also accounted for. Based on the FE results, an α- reduction framework was established to predict the collapse load for continuous and sleeved 2 -span systems. It was assumed that the cross-section or LTB resistance was achieved in the span while a reduced cross-section resistance allowing for the post-peak fall in capacity was achieved at the interior support. The accuracy of the proposed design method was compared against elastic and full plastic design cases by considering their ultimate load carrying capacities. Whereas the elastic design method provides overly-conservative results and plastic design overestimates the capacity of slender sections, the proposed design method gave accurate predictions of the failure load with minimal scatter for all cases. The developed α-reduction framework provides a foundation for allowing the use of other purlin sections and interior support connections by inserting alternative cross-sectional moment capacity inputs obtained from several sources such as physical testing, hand calculations from design codes and FE analyses.

5000|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{multiple}} layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration. Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a non-linear decibel sound transmission loss measurement. So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a light-gauge (25-ga. or lighter) steel stud partition will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points. Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer. The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions {{is similar to that}} of <b>light-gauge</b> <b>steel</b> partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls. [...] However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.|$|E

Cold-formed steel channel sections along with fire-resistive plasterboards are used to construct <b>light-gauge</b> <b>steel</b> frame (LSF) floor systems to provide adequate fire resistance ratings (FRR). It is common practice to use lipped channel sections (LCS) as joists in LSF floor systems, and past research has only considered such systems.

The structural and thermal performances of LSF floor systems made of a welded HFC, LiteSteel Beams (LSB), with different plasterboard and insulation configurations, were investigated using four full-scale fire tests under standard fires. These fire tests showed that the new LSF floor system with LSB joists improved the FRR in comparison to that of conventional LCS joists.

This research {{is focused on the}} thermal per-formance of Magnesium Oxide (MgO) wall boards in comparison to the conventional gypsum plasterboards exposed to standard fire on one side. Thermal properties of MgO board and gypsum plasterboard were measured first and then used in the finite element heat transfer models of the two types of panels. The measured thermal property results show that MgO board will perform better than the gypsum plasterboards due to its higher specific heat values at elevated temperatures. However, MgO board loses 50 % of its ini-tial mass at about 500 °C compared to 16 % for gypsum plasterboard. The developed finite element models were validated using the fire test results of gypsum plasterboards and then used to study the thermal performance of MgO board panels. Finite element analysis re-sults show that when MgO board panels are exposed to standard fire on one side the rate of temperature rise on the ambient side is significantly reduced compared to gypsum plas-terboard. This has the potential to improve the overall thermal performance of MgO board lined LSF walls and their fire resistance levels (FRL). However, full scale fire tests are needed to confirm this.

The aim of {{this project}} was to create guidelines {{for the design of}} thin-walled steel structures by analyses which consider the effect of cross-sectional instability. Research was conducted to address the knowledge gap associated with the amplification of second-order effects due to local instabilities, the treatment of imperfections in advanced analysis and the effect of interactive buckling on light gauge steel members. The objectives of this research were achieved through a combination of numerical and experimental investigations using two different types of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The first series of experiments investigated the effects of interactive buckling through a number of compression tests on varying lengths of ultra-light gauge steel storage rack uprights. The second experimental investigation was used to study the effects of local instabilities on the second-order effects and behaviour of light gauge steel frames. Fourteen full scale storage rack tests were completed using different combinations of beam depths and nominal horizontal loads. Measured imperfection data and calibrated FE models were then used to determine a rational procedure for implementing geometric imperfections into advanced analysis. Special attention was given to the effect that local instabilities had on the second-order displacements of the frame.

40|$|Ductile Steel Plate Shear Walls (SPSWs) {{have been}} {{accepted}} widely as a very effective lateral load resisting system. However, their use in retrofit works is very limited because of the design inefficiency arising {{from the use of}} thicker than required commercially available infill plates. Consequently the ductility demand for the surrounding framing members is higher than required. SPSWs utilizing light-gauge cold-formed infill plates could be a viable alternative for rehabilitation of seismically deficient buildings. This thesis presents a numerical study using finite element models on the behavior of unstiffened <b>light-gauge</b> <b>steel</b> plate shear walls with welded infill plate connection. The detailed finite element models include both material and geometric non-linearity. This research describes in detail the validation of the key finite element models by comparing the results with that from the available experimental studies. Excellent correlation between the test results and the finite element analysis results has been achieved. For seismic performance evaluation of a multi-storey building with SPSWs, detailed finite element models or a strip model can be used to represent the SPSW components. However, development and analysis of such models often require undesirable effort and excess time for high-to-medium rise buildings. A simplified model is developed in this research to study the behavior of SPSW system. In the simplified model, discrete elements are used for the framing members and the behavior of the infill plate is represented by equivalent diagonal bracing members. The simplified model, Equivalent Braced Model, is developed through repeated static and dynamic validations with experiment and detailed finite element models. The proposed Equivalent Braced Model would facilitate a simplification to the structural modeling of large buildings with SPSWs in order to evaluate the seismic performance using regular structural analysis tools and can prove to be a potential aid in performance-based seismic design of SPSW buildings. Finally, the developed equivalent braced model and the detailed finite element model are used to analyze three multi-storey light-gauge SPSWs (four-storey, six-storey and ten-storey) designed according to the capacity design approach. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Light-gauge</b> <b>steel</b> framed (LSF) {{walls with}} {{plasterboard}} lining are increasingly used in modern building construction {{due to their}} numerous advantages. Their fire performance has been investigated using both numerical and experimental studies {{in the past for}} lipped channel section (LCS) and welded hollow flange section (HFC) studs. A new riveted HFC stud was also considered. However, no attempt was made to use a structurally and economically optimum stud section in the wall configurations. This paper investigates the fire performance of a new stiffened channel section (SCS) as LSF wall studs. The proposed section succeeds in delaying both local and distortional buckling modes. At ambient temperature, the member compression capacity of each stud section, normalized to its squash capacity, was used to compare the performance of the three sections. It was found that the performance of SCS is equivalent to the LSB and superior to the LCS. The fire performance of LSF wall studs made of LCS, LSB, and the proposed section has also been assessed for three common wall configurations using finite element (FE) analyses. The walls were exposed to the standard ISO 834 - 1 fire curve on one side. Stud time-temperature profiles were developed for the three wall configurations using finite element thermal analyses and validated using available full-scale fire test data. Fire Resistance Levels (FRL) of load bearing and non-load bearing walls were determined and validated using previous experimental and numerical results. For the same load ratio, the three stud sections perform similarly, giving close FRL values for each of the configurations considered. Due to the elimination of the necessity for welding or riveting, it is proposed that SCS is used to develop structurally and economically optimum LSF walls compared to those made using LCS and welded or riveted HFC sections. FRL versus Load Ratio curves were developed for the full range of load ratio using both steady and transient state FE analyses. Using them, the susceptibility of cavity insulated, non-load bearing LSF walls to failure due to structural inadequacy was also identified...|$|E

Two different sheet profiles and three fastener patterns were used. The results are compared with the predicted stiffness from a plane truss computer analog. Test variables include openings in the sheeting, recessing of purlins in from the sheet ends, seams in the length of the sheet and placing the purlins flat;An analytical method and an empirical equation to be used in conjunction with testing are presented. The analytical method predicts the stiffness of the control diaphragms within 1. 5 % of that predicted by the plane truss computer analog. The empirical equation was fitted to steel diaphragms on steel frames and can be used to adjust for different diaphragm lengths, purlin spacings, and sheet thicknesses;It was found that the location and size of an opening does influence diaphragm stiffness. Openings with sheeting on two sides only will reduce diaphragm stiffness approximately twice as much as openings with sheeting on three or four sides. Fastener stiffness and location have the largest impact on diaphragm stiffness. Increasing the number of fasteners at seams in the length of the diaphragm will off-set the effect of the discontinuous sheet length. Fasteners {{near the edge of the}} sheet have a much larger impact on stiffness than those near the center of the sheet. The plane truss computer analog predicted the test diaphragm stiffness reasonably well;Several methods of modeling the diaphragm frame interaction are reviewed.

Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research concerns the in-use performance of <b>light-gauge</b> <b>steel</b> modular construction used for residential purposes. The aim was to investigate ways to reduce the in-use energy consumption of new buildings, while ensuring thermal comfort. Data were collected from two case study buildings in the UK, one in Loughborough and the other in London, using a variety of methods including building measurement, building monitoring, inspections, and a detailed review of the construction documentation. The case study buildings were monitored using EnOcean enabled wireless sensor networks and standalone temperature sensors. Monitoring data included electricity consumption in individual rooms, often by end use, space heating use, internal temperature and relative humidity, and external temperature. Building measurements included blower door tests to measure fabric air leakage rates, infrared thermal imaging to identify fabric defects and weaknesses, and ventilation system flowrate measurements. Inspections and the review of documentation allowed problems with design, manufacture and construction to be identified. A particular concern for thermally lightweight construction is the risk of overheating, therefore overheating analyses were undertaken. The research identified weaknesses in the design, construction and operation of the case study buildings resulting in increased energy use and poor thermal comfort, particularly overheating. The modular construction studied requires specific design changes to improve the fabric and building services, in order to reduce energy use.
