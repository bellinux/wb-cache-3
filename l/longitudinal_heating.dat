When a p-polarized laser pulse, with intensity below the self-induced-transparency (SIT) threshold, obliquely irradiates a thin overdense plasma, the initially opaque plasma becomes transparent after a time interval that is linearly dependent on {{the thickness of the}} plasma.

In a certain range of the amplitude of the incoming wave, the corresponding nonlinear one-dimensional (1 D) set of equations is shown to admit two competing steady-state solutions that satisfy the same boundary conditions. One of those solutions describes just the well-known SIT regime of propagation, the other one corresponds to the full reflection of the incident wave.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two complimentary {{methods for}} the laser cooling of a magnetically guided ultra-cold atom beam. If combined, these methods {{could serve as}} a starting point for high-through put and possibly even continuous production of Bose-Einstein condensates. First, a mechanism is outlined to harvest ultra cold atoms from amagnetically guided atom beam into an optical dipole trap. A continuous loading scheme is described that dissipates thedirected kinetic energy of a captured atomvia decelerationby amagnetic potential barrier followed by optical pumping to the energetically lowest Zeeman sublevel. The application of this scheme to the transfer of ultra cold chromium atoms from amagnetically guided atom beam into a deep optical dipole trap is investigated via numerical simulations of the loading process. Based on the results of the theoretical studies the feasibility and the efficiency of our loading scheme, including the realisation of a suitable magnetic field configuration, are analysed. Second, experimentswere conducted on the transverse laser cooling of amagnetically guided beam of ultra cold chromium atoms. Radial compression by a tapering of the guide is em-ployed to adiabatically heat the beam. Inside the tapered section heat is extracted from the atom beam by a two-dimensional optical molasses perpendicular to it, resulting in a signi-ficant increase of atomic phase space density.

In particular, the effect of Schottky band overlap on <b>longitudinal</b> <b>heating</b> was studied. Fig. 1. Layout of the CR with Palmer pick-up (PP). In order to minimize the effect of undesired mixing caused by the low energy and the large initial momentum spread, the Palmer pick-up PP in the CR ring must be used to extract both a momentum cooling signal and a horizontal cooling signal, which cannot be disentangled electronically as they overlap in the frequency domain. This effect of band overlap can decrease the cooling performance, because Schottky noise always leads to heating.

It includes a high-field solenoid-magnet string for capture of low-energy pions from the target, {{as well as the}} infrastructure to house and support the target and capture magnets. Because of the high levels of activation of materials in the Target System, it includes substantial radiation shielding, and remote-handling capability. 5 Early visions [1] of a target system for aMuon Collider considered (pulsed) toroidal collection (with a Li lens, as at a p ̄ source), which is limited to one sign of charged particles, and has not been demonstrated for the 50 -Hz repetition rate specified for a Neutrino Factory. Pion collection with DC solenoid magnets was proposed in 1995 [2] and has since been the baseline concept. An additional advantage of solenoidal capture in a high-field magnet is that longitudinal-transverse emittance exchange occurs as the field strength decreases adiabatically along the capture channel [3], which provides initial transverse cooling of the secondary pions (at the expense of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>heating).</b> Issues of survival of a solid target in a 4 -MW proton beam with ≈ 2 -ns pulses led to consideration of a free-mercury-jet target [4], now the baseline.

40|$|A {{model to}} explain the {{generation}} of strong electron temperature enhancements in the E region at polar latitudes is proposed and compared with auroral zone coherent and incoherent backscatter radar observations. Experimental evidence from radar observations associates these enhancements with the convective electric field, Ec, {{and it is now}} accepted that the mechanism responsible involves Farley-Buneman waves (FB). Extending the linear theory of the FB instability, a quantitative theory {{to explain the}} enhancements in terms of wave heating is sought. The RMS magnetic aspect width, k /k RMS, is incorporated in the electron conductivity. Interro- gating the FB dispersion relation for a given external convective electric field, Ec, the magnetic aspect width that gives marginal instability is calculated numerically.
