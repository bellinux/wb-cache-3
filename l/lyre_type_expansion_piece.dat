50|$|The jouhikko is {{a member}} of a family of bowed <b>lyre</b> <b>type</b> {{instruments}} that stretches from Russia in the east, through Scandinavia, to Britain and Ireland. Most of these regions have only very sketchy evidence about their extinct bowed lyre traditions. The four-stringed Estonian talharpa and hiiu kannel have a wider hand hole and can play a wider range and shifting drones. The Welsh crwth is the most developed of this family to survive, with six strings, a fingerboard, and a complex playing style. Extinct or obscure variants include the Shetland gue and the English crowd. Other instruments are perhaps less closely related, including the bowed zithers such as the Finnish harppu, Icelandic fiðla, and the North American Inuit tautirut.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, unication-based grammar formalisms have become the {{predominant}} paradigm in natural language processing systems because of their monotonicity, declarative-ness, and reversibility. From the viewpoint of computer science, typed feature structures {{can be seen as}} data structures that allow representation of linguistic knowledge in a uniform fashion. <b>Type</b> <b>expansion</b> is an operation that makes the constraints on a typed feature structure ex-plicit and determines their satisability. We describe an eÆcient expansion algorithm that takes care of recursive type denitions and allows exploration of dierent expansion strategies through the use of control knowledge. This knowledge is specied in a separate layer, indepen-dently of grammatical information. Memoization of the <b>type</b> <b>expansion</b> function drastically reduces the number of unications. In the second part, nonmonotonic extensions to TDL and the implementation of well-typedness checks are presented. Both are closely related to the <b>type</b> <b>expansion</b> algorithm.
