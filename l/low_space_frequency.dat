40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the changes of human eyes optical and visual quality after LASIK through modulation transfer function(MTF) measurement and contrast sensitivity function(CSF) measurement. METHODS:It was a prospective cohort study. Forty-seven patients(92 eyes) {{were divided into}} low myopia(- 2. 28 ± 0. 48 D), moderate myopia(- 4. 54 ± 0. 97 D) and high myopia(- 6. 86 ± 1. 17 D) groups according to the spherical equivalent(SE) diopter before the surgery. The uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA), SE diopter, wavefront aberration, CSF measurement, PSF measurement were examined before and after operation. The follow up visits of the patients were scheduled at the 7 th day, 1 st and 3 rd month. CSF curves, which were obtained with Carl Zeiss WASCA Analyzer wavefront aberration instrument under the 3. 0 mm and 5. 0 mm pupil size conditions, were scanned and loaded into Engauge Digitizer 4. 1 digital software to obtain PSF data of certain space frequency. And CSF data were obtained with Optical 6500 of STEREO OPTICAL Company under day and night environment. The data were statistical analyzed with paired- t test. RESULTS: CSF data declined obviously compared with the preoperative data in early stage(7 days) after surgeries. Partial <b>low</b> <b>space</b> <b>frequency</b> CSF data(low space frequency CSF data in 3. 0 mm pupil size condition and moderate myopia patients' <b>low</b> <b>space</b> <b>frequency</b> CSF data in 5. 0 mm pupil size condition) recovered back to preoperative levels in 3 months after LASIK. The myopic degree was higher, the CSF values of moderate and high spatial frequency were harder to restore to preoperative levels. Most of the MTF values declined in 1 week after LASIK. MTF values approximately recovered back to preoperative levels in 1 month- 3 months after LASIK. Partial MTF values of 1 week after LASIK had no statistical differences compared to the preoperative data. CONCLUSION: MTF values approximately recover back to preoperative levels earlier than CSF values. All the MTF values recover back to preoperative levels in 3 months after LASIK, but partial space frequency CSF values not. MTF values reflect the improvement of visual quality in early stage after LASIK. MTF data obtained with Carl Zeiss WASCA Analyzer wavefront aberration analyzer comprehensively and objectively reflect the optical system changes in early stage after LASIK...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a new adaptive content-based localized watermarking algorithm for remote sensing images based on DWT, which adaptively embeds corresponding watermarks into the local regions of the remote sensing image instead of the entire one. In order to improve watermarking capability against attacks in the frequency area, we selected some stable feature points in the remote sensing image, then used them to identify the locations where we inserted the local watermarks, namely we embedded the watermarks into the local sub-images centered by those feature points. When the remote sensing image is cropped, we can also detect and orient watermarks by the feature points in the remaining one. Moreover the algorithm took the new watermarking-embedding strategy based on DWT domain to embed the local watermarks, namely watermarks should be embedded into the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> firstly, and the remains are embedded into the high <b>frequency</b> <b>spaces</b> according to their significance. And different embedding strength for watermarks should {{be applied to the}} <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> and the high ones respectively. In order to further improve robustness of watermarks, the embedded local watermark is designed to be orthogonal to the feature vector of the <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> (LL 3) in DWT area of the corresponding sub-image, which means that watermarking casting is remote sensing image content dependent. In addition, the algorithm exploited the Neymann-Pearson criterion to detect watermarks. Experimental results show that the watermarking algorithm is robust to all kinds of attacks, especially cropping. 1...|$|R

After transforming the data to produce an initial image, it is possible to remove low-level sidelobe responses remaining in the image and thereby produce a high dynamic-range image.

40|$|Materials {{with high}} {{dielectric}} constant are in great {{demand for the}} miniaturization of electronic devices. More specifically, high dielectric constant polymer-ceramic composites are useful for embedded capacitor applications. A composite consisting of giant dielectric CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CCTO) incorporated into the Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrix has been fabricated by melt mixing followed by hot pressing. The composites thus fabricated has been characterised for structural, morphological and dielectric properties.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} using mean-field theories {{to help solve}} a long standing problem {{in the study of}} ionically solid electrolytes. While it has been long known that the ionic conductivity in solid electrolytes is comprised of two terms, the mobility and number of mobile charge carriers, there has been no accurate method developed to determine these two quantities independently. In this paper, we apply a mean-field method based upon low frequency a. c. impedance measurements of the limiting <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> charge polarization capacitance that develops {{as a result of the}} mobile carrier population diffusing to blocking electrodes. The space charge capacitance that develops is shown to be a simple function of the number of charge carriers and is found to be independent of the d. c. conductivity, but strongly dependent upon temperature. Measurements on two simple but well studied ion conducting glasses, LiPO 3 and NaPO 3, suggest that the carrier population is thermally activated where only a small fraction of the cations are mobile in the glass. The activation energy for carrier creation in LiPO 3 is larger (49 kJ/mol) than that for NaPO 3 glass (44 kJ/mol) and is in agreement with models of activation energies in ion conducting glasses that associate the creation energy with the cation charge density...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors that affect the pointing of precision payloads and devices in space platforms is the vibration generated due to static and dynamic unbalanced forces of rotary equipments placed in the neighborhood of payload. Generally, such disturbances are of low amplitude, less than 1 kHz, and are termed as ‘micro-vibrations’. Due to low damping in the space structure, these vibrations have long decay time and they degrade the performance of payload. This paper addresses the design, modeling and analysis of a <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>space</b> frame platform for passive and active attenuation of micro-vibrations. This flexible platform has been designed to act as a mount for devices like reaction wheels, and consists of four folded continuous beams arranged in three dimensions. Frequency and response analysis have been carried out by varying the number of folds, and thickness of vertical beam. Results show that lower frequencies can be achieved by increasing the number of folds and by decreasing the thickness of the blade. In addition, active vibration control is studied by incorporating piezoelectric actuators and sensors in the dynamic model. It is shown using simulation that a control strategy using optimal control is effective for vibration suppression under a wide variety of loading conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Radio {{emission}} from density plasma can {{be detected}} at low radio frequencies. An image of such plasma clouds of the entire inner interplanetary space is always a wanted input for space weather forecast and ICME propagation studies. To take such an image within the ecliptic plane may not fully explore what is happening around the Sun {{not only because of}} the blockage of the Sun, also because most of the ICMEs are propagating in the low-latitude of the Sun, near the ecliptic plane. It is then proposed to launch a solar polar orbit radio telescope to acquire high density plasma cloud images from the entire inner interplanetary <b>space.</b> <b>Low</b> radio <b>frequency</b> images require a large antenna aperture in space. It is, therefore, proposed to use the existing passive synthetic aperture radiometer technology to reduce mass and complicity of the deployment system of the big antenna.
