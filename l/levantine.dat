5|$|Israeli cuisine has adopted, and {{continues}} to adapt, elements of various styles of Jewish cuisine, particularly the Mizrahi, Sephardic and Ashkenazi styles of cooking. It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in <b>Levantine,</b> Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, and foods such as falafel, hummus, msabbha, shakshouka, couscous, and za'atar are now widely popular in Israel.|$|E
5|$|Several {{passengers}} on the Titanic had <b>Levantine</b> origins. At the time, many carried identification from the Ottoman Empire that stated they were from Greater Syria, which included what is today Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Passengers from Lebanon, for instance, had hometown villages today located in Lebanon.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{numbers of}} <b>Levantines</b> are not clear. It is {{estimated}} that there are about 100-150 <b>Levantines</b> in Izmir. Another estimate put the number as hundreds. However, the number may be higher because of assimilation policies of Turkish nationalist-Kemalist governments, conversions to Islam because of the fear after the Greek and Armenian Genocides, or intermarriages. In the documentary about the <b>Levantines</b> of Izmir (Bazıları Onlara Levanten Diyor), <b>Levantines</b> call themselves 'Christian Turks' {{and they say they}} are not happy to be called <b>Levantines.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Levantines</b> in Turkey or Turkish <b>Levantines,</b> {{refers to}} the {{descendants}} of Europeans who settled in the coastal cities of the Ottoman Empire {{in order to be}} engaged in trade especially after the Tanzimat Era. Their estimated population is around 1,000. They mainly reside in Istanbul, İzmir and Mersin. Anatolian Muslims called <b>Levantines</b> Frenk (first used for French then for all non-Orthodox Europeans) and Sweet Water Freng (due to their high-standard life style) in addition to Levanten.|$|R
5|$|Tabbouleh is a <b>Levantine</b> vegan dish (sometimes {{considered}} a salad) traditionally made of tomatoes, finely chopped parsley, mint, bulgur and onion, and seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and salt. Some Israeli {{variations of the}} salad use pomegranate seeds instead of tomatoes.|$|E
5|$|Arak is a <b>Levantine</b> {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this turmoil, {{specific}} regions in mainland Greece witnessed a dramatic population decrease, especially Boeotia, Argolis and Messenia. Mycenaean refugees migrated to Cyprus and the <b>Levantine</b> coast. Nevertheless, other regions {{on the edge of the}} Mycenaean world prospered, such as the Ionian islands, the northwestern Peloponnese, parts of Attica and a number of Aegean islands. The acropolis of Athens, oddly, appears to have avoided destruction.|$|E
50|$|Ottoman Empire {{fought against}} the British, French and Italians during World War One. Victorious states of World War One {{compelled}} Ottoman government to sign the Treaty of Sèvres. The United Kingdom, Italy and France were among the occupants in Anatolia. After the independence of Turkey, there has been negative public opinion towards <b>Levantines</b> because of allegations that <b>Levantines</b> had cooperated with the Allies. After the Great Fire of Smyrna, most of <b>Levantines</b> left Izmir {{and only a few}} came back.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} problems in Turkish economy after <b>Levantines</b> and Greeks left the country. Turkey faced exportation problems. Most of exports {{remained at the}} hands of local Turkish villagers. However, Turkish government left all capitulations of <b>Levantines</b> in order to break the monopoly for Turkish entrepreneurs.|$|R

5|$|Second in {{importance}} {{after the supreme}} deity, were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans. Palmyra had unique deities, such as the god of justice and Efqa's guardian Yarhibol, the sun god Malakbel, and the moon god Aglibol. Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities, including the greater <b>Levantine</b> gods Astarte, Baal-hamon, Baalshamin and Atargatis; the Babylonian gods Nabu and Nergal, and the Arab Azizos, Arsu, Šams and Al-lāt.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with Byblos on the <b>Levantine</b> coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia. Nyuserre's reign saw {{the growth of the}} administration, and the effective birth of the nomarchs, provincial governors who, for the first time, were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaoh's court.|$|E
5|$|Although the Third Crusade, in the end, {{failed to}} retake Jerusalem, a three-year truce was {{eventually}} negotiated with Saladin. The truce, {{known as the}} Treaty of Jaffa, ensured that Christian pilgrims from the west would once again be allowed to visit Jerusalem. Saladin also recognised the Crusaders' control of the <b>Levantine</b> coast {{as far south as}} Jaffa. Both sides had become exhausted by the struggle, Richard needed to return to Europe in order to protect his patrimony from the aggression of Philip of France, and Palestine was in a ruinous state.|$|E
50|$|After the Committee of Union and Progress {{came into}} power after 1908 Revolution, <b>Levantines</b> {{began to be}} {{affected}} by policies of Turkish nationalists. <b>Levantines</b> were also not happy against increasing Greek presence in the city of Izmir. Greek occupation in Izmir weakened their power in the city economically. In addition, their economic interests suffered due to the World War One and {{in the first years of}} Turkey. The Great Depression affected <b>Levantines</b> very much. They quit their jobs and began to leave Turkey due to high maintenance costs. Their settlements became government property.|$|R

5|$|Palestinian cuisine {{consists}} of foods from or commonly eaten by Palestinians—which includes {{those living in}} Palestine, Israel, Jordan, refugee camps in nearby countries {{as well as by}} the Palestinian diaspora. The cuisine is a diffusion of the cultures of civilizations that settled in the region of Palestine, particularly during and after the Islamic era beginning with the Arab Ummayad conquest, then the eventual Persian-influenced Abbasids and ending with the strong influences of Turkish cuisine, resulting from the coming of the Ottoman Turks. It is similar to other <b>Levantine</b> cuisines, including Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian.|$|E
5|$|Situated at a {{strategic}} location between Egypt, Syria and Arabia, and {{the birthplace of}} Judaism and Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including Ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Achaemenids, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Sasanians, Byzantines, the Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis and Palestinians. Modern archaeologists and historians of the region refer to their field of study as <b>Levantine</b> archaeology.|$|E
5|$|The region spans a {{wide variety}} of {{cultures}} with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, <b>Levantine,</b> Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Provençal (French), Spanish, and Portuguese. However, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta), and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{tests on}} Syrians were {{included}} in many genetic studies, the genetic marker which identifies descendants of the ancient <b>Levantines</b> is found among members of all <b>Levantines</b> from different religious groups.

5|$|The revolt in Palestine was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} revolts that sprung up elsewhere in the Egyptian-ruled Levant, such as the 1838 Druze revolt and those {{that occurred in the}} Nusayriyya Mountains and Mount Lebanon. Unlike the other <b>Levantine</b> revolts, the participants were not an ethnoreligiously or socially homogeneous group, but rather an assortment of societal groups from different classes, subcultures, geographical areas and religions. This also significantly distinguished it from previous popular uprisings against Ottoman rule that had occurred in Jerusalem and its vicinity, namely the Naqib al-Ashraf Revolt in 1703–1705 and the revolt of 1825–1826, which failed to attract support from the people of Nablus, Hebron, Galilee and Gaza.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} king, Abdullah I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted immigrants from different <b>Levantine</b> areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of evidence dating to Unas' reign, we {{know very little about}} his activities. Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities, in particular Byblos, seem to have continued during Unas' time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the <b>Levantine</b> coast with Syro-Canaanite men, who were either the boat crews or slaves. Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the Shasu. Similar reliefs have been found in preceding pyramid complexes, such as that of Sahure, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events. Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions; however, for example the autobiography of Weni relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty.|$|E

25|$|There {{are around}} 35,000 Catholics, constituting 0.05% of the population. The {{faithful}} follow the Latin, Byzantine, Armenian and Chaldean Rite. Most Latin Rite Catholics are <b>Levantines</b> of mainly Italian or French background, {{although a few}} are ethnic Turks (who are usually converts via marriage to <b>Levantines</b> or other non-Turkish Catholics). Byzantine, Armenian, and Chaldean rite Catholics are generally members of the Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian minority groups respectively. Turkey's Catholics are concentrated in Istanbul.|$|R

5|$|Satellite {{tracking}} {{revealed that}} {{those found in}} Pelagos Sanctuary migrate southward to off Tunisia, Malta, Pantelleria, and Sicily, and also possibly winter off coastal southern Italy, Sardinia, within the Strait of Messina, Aeolian Islands, and off Catalonia, Cabrera Archipelago, Libya, Kerkennah Islands, Tuscan Archipelago, Ischia and adjacent gulfs (e.g. Naples and Pozzuoli), winter feeding ground of Lampedusa, and whales may recolonize out of the Ligurian Sea to other areas such as in Ionian and in Adriatic Sea. Biology of the species along southern and southeastern parts of the basin such as off Libya, Algeria, and northern Egypt, is unclear due to lacks of scientific approaches although whales have been confirmed off the furthermost of the basin such as along in shore waters of <b>Levantine</b> Sea including Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus. Documented records within Turkish waters have been in very small numbers; one sighting off Antalya in 1994 and 5 documented strandings as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{large and}} wealthy island of Cyprus {{had been under}} Venetian rule since 1489. Together with Crete, {{it was one of}} the major {{overseas}} possessions of the Republic, with a population estimated at 160,000 in the mid-16th century. Aside from its location, which allowed the control of the <b>Levantine</b> trade, the island possessed a profitable production of cotton and sugar. To safeguard their most distant colony, the Venetians paid an annual tribute of 8,000 ducats to the Mamluk Sultans of Egypt, and after their conquest by the Ottomans in 1517, the agreement was renewed with the Ottoman Porte. Nevertheless, the island's strategic location in the Eastern Mediterranean, between the Ottoman heartland of Anatolia and the newly acquired provinces of the Levant and Egypt, made it a tempting target for future Ottoman expansion. In addition, the protection offered by the local Venetian authorities to corsairs who harassed Ottoman shipping, including Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, rankled with the Ottoman leadership.|$|E
