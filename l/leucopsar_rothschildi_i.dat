50|$|The Bali myna (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi),</b> {{also known}} as Rothschild's mynah, Bali starling, or Bali mynah, locally known as jalak Bali, is a {{medium-sized}} (up to 25 cm long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and fewer than 100 adults are assumed to currently exist in the wild.|$|R
40|$|The Bali {{starling}} <b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi</b> is a passerine {{endemic to}} the dry monsoon forest of the island of Bali, Indonesia. Habitat conversion and excessive capture for the pet trade brought the species to the verge of extinction in the 1980 s. The species is critically endangered because of 1) an extremely small population size, 2) restriction to a small area, 3) illegal trapping, and 4) diminishing suitable habitat left within its natural range. An intricate web of factors prevents the Bali starling from emerging from this precarious situation...|$|R
5|$|Extant relations, {{such as the}} Bali myna (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi)</b> and the white-headed {{starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities in colouration and other features with the extinct Mascarene species. Since the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem morphologically closer to each other than to the hoopoe starling—which appears closer to Southeast Asian starlings—there may have been two separate migrations of starlings from Asia to the Mascarenes, with the hoopoe starling the latest arrival. Except for Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean with native starlings, probably due to their isolation, varied topography, and vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|A {{postage stamp}} was {{proposed}} {{to be issued}} by Indonesia on the rich flora and fauna of its provinces. It was proposed to issue 33 stamps in succession between 2008 and 2011. In 2008 the series issued represented the province of Bali with the stamp depicting floral species of Dysoxylum densiflorum, known as Majegau in Indonesian language. The stamp issue described the qualities of this species as [...] "one of woods commonly used for Balinese carving material thanks to its strength and beautiful colour and pattern". Majegau (Dysoxylum densiflorum) and Bali starling (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi)</b> of Bali {{are also part of}} this series.|$|R
40|$|Vegetation {{structure}} and composition of Bali Starling (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi</b> Stresemann, 1912) Habitat at Labuan Lalang monsoon forest, Bali Barat National Park. Research wasconducted in Labuan Lalang monsoon forest, Bali Barat National Park in May 2010 to identifytheir vegetation {{structure and}} composition of plant species communities in this area. Thisinformation was important as basic data for developing model for habitat reconstruction ofendemic Bali starling birds (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi</b> Stresemann 1912). Several ecologicalparameters information such as name species, frequency, density and abundance of individualspecies were collected for qualitative an quantitative analyses. The result showed that 93 species belonging 84 genera and 37 families were found in this area. Some plant species were recorded as endangered such as Strycnos lingustrina, Helicteresixora, Protium javanicum, Rauvolfia serpentina, Zanthoxylum rhetza, Ziziphus rotundifolia,Ceriops tagal, Flacourtia indica, and Santalum album. The important species that composedin this forest were dominated by Grewia ericocarpa, Schoutennia ovata (Tiliaceae) andfollowed by Vitex trifoliata and Abutilon indicum. The species diversity and evenness indexof Shannon-Wiener indicated that species diversity in this forest were not too high and thepopulations on unstable condition. Principal Coordinat Analyses (PCO) on the tree height andaltitude data of every tress showed that tree species associated to Bali starling were found onthe 10 – 25 m tree hiehgt community and occupied {{in the area of}} 40 – 60 m asl.

5|$|Extant East Asian {{starling}}s, {{such as the}} Bali myna (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi)</b> and the {{white-headed starling}} (Sturnia erythropygia), have similarities with these extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|R
40|$|A {{study on}} plants species as {{resource}} {{of food for}} Bali Starling (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi</b> Stresemann, 1912) {{was carried out in}} Ped Village, Nusa Penida, Klungkung Bali, Indonesia between March-April and between August-September, 2006. Explorations methods were conducted in making inventory of plants species and part of plants as food resource. Direct observations were conducted to observe feeding activity of the starling after release. Results of this study showed that 105 plants species have been identified in Ped village. About 30 species (in varied habitus of trees, shrubs, and herbs) acted as food resources for the starling. Part of plants species which had been used as food resources were fruits and seeds. Besides plants as food sources, insects were also available on the studi site (such as grasshopper, ants, caterpillars, butterflies). In addition there were also small reptiles as source of food for the the bird. Plants availability as source of food supports ex-situ conservations of Bali Starling in Ped village...|$|R
40|$|Bali myna (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi</b> Stresemann, 1912) was {{reported}} as an endemic bird from {{western part of}} Bali Island, and also as endangered species. The species lived in the lowland forest and used tree holes made by other animals as their nests. Besides L. rothschildi, there were two other species of birds found using the holes as their nest in the study site, namely Black-winged starling(Sturnus melanopterus (Daudin, 1800)) and Javan myna (Acridotheres fitscus (Wagler, 1827)). This paper deals with result {{of research on the}} competition of those three species of birds in obtaining tree hole for nesting, was carried out in West Bali National Park, Bali. Data demonstrated that there were no differences in the size of nest for the three species of birds, Javan myna lived in the habitat of coconut garden where Bali myna did not occupy it, and the habitat of Black-winged starling was overlapped with Bali myna, but Bali myna preferred living in denser vegetation. The reproduction of the three species of birds were dependent on the occurrence of other birds species belonging to Picidae and Capitonidae who were able to make holes on trees...|$|R
40|$|ABTRATCheT {{existence}} of the Bali Starling (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi</b> Stresemann 1912) in nature is increasing anxiety, because the population of this birds is increasingly endangered due to changes in its natural habitat along with northwest coast of Bali, and are rampant illegal poaching to satisfy the demand in world market as pet birds. The purpose {{of this research is}} to examine the potential for Bali Starling in natural habitat conditions are increasingly of concern which made IUCN set critically endangered status (being Critically Endangered) since 1966. While CITES for wildlife have been included in Appendix I of the Bali Starling, meaning forbidden to be traded. The research method which was in this article used is descriptive method with primary and secondary data. Primary data were obtained from observations in the field and the secondary data were obtained from studies of the literature and the annual report of the West Bali National Park. The results showed that the potential actual population numbers of Bali Starling have yet to be ascertained. Aji W (2013) indicated that from observation in the field of Menjangan Resort and West Bali National Park found only 10 individuals, while according to Birdlife International, the amount in the remaining 49 individuals nature only (Peter R, 2015). Key words: potential, Bali Starling, extinction, natural habita...|$|R
2500|$|If the pseudotooth {{birds are}} Galloanseres, phaeomelanins {{might be more}} likely to have {{occurred}} in their feathers, but it is notable that the most basal lineages of Anseriformes are typically grey-and-black or black-and-white. Among ocean-going birds in general, the upperside tends to be much darker than the underside (including the underwings) – though some petrels are dark grey all over, a combination of more or less dark grey upperside and white underside and (usually) head is a widespread colouration found in seabirds and may either be plesiomorphic for [...] "higher waterbirds" [...] or, perhaps more likely, be an adaptation to provide camouflage, in particular against being silhouetted against the sky if seen by prey in the sea. It is notable that at least the primary remiges, and often the other flight feathers too, are typically black in birds – even if the entire remaining plumage is completely white, as in some pelicans or in the Bali starling (<b>Leucopsar</b> <b>rothschildi).</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that melanins will polymerize, making all-black feathers very robust; as the largest forces encountered by bird feathers affect the flight feathers, the large amount of melanin gives them better resistance against being damaged in flight. In soaring birds as dependent on strong winds as the bony-toothed birds were, black wingtips and perhaps tails can be expected to have been present.|$|R
