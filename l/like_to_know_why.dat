2500|$|While writing Women in Love in Cornwall during 1916–17, Lawrence {{developed}} {{a strong and}} possibly romantic relationship with a Cornish farmer named William Henry Hocking. Although {{it is not clear}} if their relationship was sexual, Frieda said she believed it was. Lawrence's fascination with the theme of homosexuality, which is overtly manifested in Women in Love, could be related to his own sexual orientation. In a letter written during 1913, he writes, [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> nearly every man that approaches greatness tends to homosexuality, whether he admits it or not ..." [...] He is also quoted as saying, [...] "I believe the nearest I've come to perfect love was with a young coal-miner when I was about 16." [...] However, given his enduring and robust relationship with Frieda it is likely that he was primarily [...] "bi-curious" [...] in the terminology of today, and whether he actually ever had homosexual relations remains an open question.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006 {{and again}} in December 2007, Binoche {{travelled}} to Tehran {{at the invitation of}} Abbas Kiarostami. While there in 2007, she shot a cameo appearance in his film Shirin (2008) which he was shooting at the time. Binoche's visit proved controversial when two Iranian MPs raised the matter in parliament, advising more caution be exercised in granting visas to foreign celebrities which might lead to [...] "cultural destruction". In June 2009 Binoche began work on Certified Copy directed by Kiarostami. The film was an Official Selection in competition at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Binoche won the Best Actress Award at the festival for her performance. The film went on general release in France on 19 May 2010 to very positive reviews. Her win at the 2010 Cannes Film festival makes Binoche the first actress to win the European [...] "best actress triple crown": Best Actress at Venice for Three Colors: Blue, Best Actress at Berlin for The English Patient and Best Actress at Cannes for Certified Copy. The September 2010 UK release of the film was overshadowed when French actor Gérard Depardieu made disparaging comments about Binoche to the Austrian magazine Profil, [...] "Please can you explain to me what the mystery of Juliette Binoche is meant to be?" [...] he said. [...] "I would really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> she has been so esteemed for so many years. She has nothing – absolutely nothing". In response, while promoting Certified Copy, Binoche spoke to movie magazine Empire saying, [...] "I don't know him. I understand you don't have to like everyone and you can dislike someone's work. But I don't understand the violence ... I do not understand why he is behaving like this. It is his problem." [...] Certified Copy proved to be controversial in Kiarostami's homeland when Iranian authorities announced on 27 May 2010 that the film was to be banned in Iran, apparently due to Binoche's attire; Deputy Culture Minister Javad Shamaqdari is quoted as saying, [...] "If Juliette Binoche were better clad it could have been screened but due to her attire {{there will not be a}} general screening." ...|$|E

40|$|Current {{guidance}} about {{informed consent}} suggests patients ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the procedures {{involved in any}} treatments they agree to undergo, and {{have a right to}} be involved in decisions about their care. However, it is not clear how this guidance is and should be applied to decisions between variant surgical procedures such as abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. We sent structured questionnaires about information provision and decision-making to 157 women who were scheduled for hysterectomy in north-east Scotland. A purposive sub-sample of 20 women was interviewed in depth post-operatively. 104 women (66 %) responded to the questionnaires. 75 % reported being told at outpatient clinics what kind of hysterectomy they would have, but fewer than half had been told about the advantages and disadvantages of different kinds. Between 26 % and 65 % of women thought they had been given too little information about various issues pertaining to different types of hysterectomy. The interview accounts suggested that gynaecologists offered women little opportunity to influence the selection of a surgical procedure. Women did not express a desire for a greater say in this selection, but appreciated being told, or would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>why</b> particular procedures were recommended for them. There may be circumstances in which it is important for surgeons to tell patients about options they have ruled out in their particular cases. Decisions between alternative surgical procedures are often highly contingent on the dispositions and skills of individual surgeons. They raise practical and ethical issues that have been neglected in recent discussions about patient involvement in decision-making. As policy makers continue to emphasise the importance of choice and patients become increasingly aware of the existence of variant procedures, these issues need careful consideration.

40|$|Abstract. The {{title of}} this paper {{suggests}} two distinct aspects of the models that we propose and consider. The rst {{of these is the}} mod-elling of other agents by motivated agents. That is to say that the act of modelling is itself motivated and constrained by the agent doing that modelling. The second aspect is that all such models will also be of mo-tivated agents. It is not sucient merely <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what other agents are <b>like,</b> but also <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> they are <b>like</b> that. This why aspect is what provides the extra information that allows a greater understanding of the interactions between entities in the world, and consequently provides for more resilient agents capable of eectively dealing with new and unfore-seen circumstances in an uncertain world. Previous work has described a formal framework for agency and autonomy in which agents are viewed as objects with goals, and autonomous agents are agents with motivations. This paper considers the nature of cooperation within that framework. We identify distinct kinds of interaction, depending {{on the nature of the}} entities involved. In particular, we describe and specify the dierences that arise in these interactions which we characterise as engagements of non-autonomous agents, and cooperation between autonomous agents. ...|$|R
