40|$|The use of {{pipelines}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular ways of delivering gas phases as shown by numerous examples in hydrocarbon transportation systems in Arctic regions, oil and gas production facilities in onshore and offshore wells, and municipal gas distribution systems in urban areas. A gas <b>leak</b> from pipelines can cause serious problems not only because of the financial losses associated but also its social and environmental impacts. Therefore, establishing an early <b>leak</b> detection model is vital to safe and secure operations of such pipeline systems. A <b>leak</b> detection model for a single gas phase is presented in this study by using material balance and pressure traverse calculations. The comparison between two steady states, with and without <b>leak,</b> makes it possible to quantify the magnitude of disturbance in two <b>leak</b> detection indicators such as the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) and the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) in a broad range of <b>leak</b> locations (x <b>leak)</b> and <b>leak</b> opening sizes (d <b>leak).</b>  The results from the fit to large-scale experimental data of Scott and Yi (1998) show that the value of <b>leak</b> coefficient (C D), which is shown to be the single-most important but largely unknown parameter, ranges from 0. 55 to 4. 11, and should be a function of Reynolds number (N Re) which is related to <b>leak</b> characteristics such as <b>leak</b> location (x <b>leak),</b> <b>leak</b> opening size (d <b>leak),</b> <b>leak</b> rate (q <b>leak)</b> and system pressure. Further investigations show that between the two <b>leak</b> detection indicators, the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) is superior to the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) because of larger disturbance, if the pressure drop along the pipeline is relatively small compared to the outlet pressure; otherwise, the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) is superior to the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) {{is widely}} used to manage post-cholecystectomy bile <b>leaks.</b> However, the best endoscopic intervention remains controversial. We investigated {{the success of a}} 7 French double pigtail stent following sphincterotomy in the management of such bile <b>leaks.</b> METHODS: Between July 1998 and June 2008, 48 patients were referred for ERCP for presumed post-cholecystectomy bile <b>leaks.</b> <b>Leaks</b> were confirmed at ERCP and managed by a combination of sphincterotomy and stent insertion unless contraindicated. RESULTS: Bile duct cannulation was successful in 44 (91. 7 %) patients. A <b>leak</b> of the cystic duct was demonstrated in 19 (43. 2 %) patients, the duct of Luschka in 11 (25. 0 %), and the common hepatic duct in 5 (11. 4 %). Complete transection of the common bile duct occurred in 4 patients. The remaining patients had no cholangiographic evidence of a <b>leak.</b> Sphincterotomy was performed in 34 patients. A 7 French double pigtail plastic stent was placed in all 35 patients with cholangiographic evidence of a bile <b>leak.</b> No bile <b>leaks</b> were demonstrated at a follow-up of 8 - 16 weeks and all stents were removed successfully.
