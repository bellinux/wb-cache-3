40|$|Purpose – This article investigates how buying firms {{manage their}} lower tier {{sustainability}} management (LTSM) in their supply networks and what contextual factors influence {{the choice of}} approaches. As most of the environmental and social burden is caused in lower tiers we use the iceberg analogy. Design/methodology/approach – Findings from 12 case studies and 53 interviews, publicly available and internal firm data are presented. In an abductive research approach, Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) conceptually guides the analytical iteration processes between theory and data. Findings – This study provides eight LTSM approaches grouped into three categories: direct (holistic, product-, region-, and event-specific) indirect (multiplier-, alliance-, and compliance-based) and neglect (tier- 1 -based). Focal firms choose between these approaches depending {{on the strength of}} observed contextual factors (stakeholder salience, structural supply network complexity, product and industry salience, past supply network incidents, socio-economic and cultural distance and <b>lower</b> <b>tier</b> <b>supplier</b> dependency), leading to perceived sustainability risk (PSR). Research limitations/implications – By depicting TCE’s theoretical boundaries in predicting LTSM governance modes, the theory is elevated to the supply network level of analysis. Future research should investigate LTSM at the purchasing category level of analysis to compare and contrast PSR profiles for different purchase tasks and to validate and extend the framework. Practical implications – This study serves as a blueprint for the development of firms’ LTSM capabilities that suit their unique PSR profiles. It offers knowledge regarding what factors influence these profiles and presents a model that links the effectiveness of different LTSM approaches to resource intensity. Originality/value – This study extends the application of TCE and adds empirically to the literature on multi-tier and sustainable supply chain management...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{avionics}} {{systems have}} increased in complexity {{to the point where}} 1 st <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> to an aircraft OEM find it financially beneficial to outsource designs of subsystems to 2 nd tier and at times to 3 rd <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Combined with challenging schedule and budgetary pressures, the environment in which safety-critical systems are being developed introduces new hurdles for regulatory agencies and industry. This new environment of both complex systems and tiered development has raised concerns in the ability of the designers to ensure safety considerations are fully addressed throughout the tier levels. This has also raised questions about the sufficiency of current regulatory guidance to ensure: proper flow down of safety awareness, avionics application understanding at the <b>lower</b> <b>tiers,</b> OEM and 1 st tier oversight practices, and capabilities of <b>lower</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Therefore, NASA established a research project to address Regulatory Compliance in a Multi-tier Supplier Network. This research was divided into three major study efforts: 1. Describe Modern Multi-tier Avionics Development 2. Identify Current Issues in Achieving Safety and Regulatory Compliance 3. Short-term/Long-term Recommendations Toward Higher Assurance Confidence This report presents our findings of the risks, weaknesses, and our recommendations. It also includes a collection of industry-identified risks, an assessment of guideline weaknesses related to multi-tier development of complex avionics systems, and a postulation of potential modifications to guidelines to close the identified risks and weaknesses...|$|R
40|$|A {{preferred}} {{methodology for}} handling increasing customer demands {{and the resulting}} complexity is to design common modules or subsystems. The design of all the modules required by a complex system, such as a car, aeroplane or computer, is increasingly a task beyond the organisational resources of the OEMs and their close suppliers. Therefore, a larger burden is transferred down the supply chain.

40|$|While the {{literature}} suggests many causes for {{the dynamics of}} supply chains, the so-called ''bullwhip effect'', this paper focuses only {{on the effect of}} time delays in the flow of ordering information. We examine this effect in a supply chain in which its members, aiming at increasing their responsiveness to customer demand, have the option of coordinating their transactions using one of two canonic topologies of information structure; one serial with attendant local transfer of ordering information, and the other parallel with attendant global information transfer. Using computer simulation experiments on each topology of the supply chain, we analyse the effects of time delays in the transfer of information between chain members, on the material flow moving downstream in the chain. The effects are quantified in terms of the variability of material flows along the chain, the individual response of chain members to customer demand, and the overall performance of the chain in meeting customer demand. We characterise both models by the same production and shipping lead times, but with varying time delays in inter-organisational information transfer, while controlling for time delays in the transfer of information within the organisation of each member of the chain. Our results show that in the serial system, there is a time delay below which the behaviour of the system is damped, and above which it oscillates. This is termed the crossover delay. Its value decreases as one moves upstream from customer to suppliers. To ensure damped behaviour, the <b>lower</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> must receive information with less delay than the upper <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> If even one supplier suffers a time delay exceeding the crossover delay, the entire system oscillates. For a parallel system, with global ordering information, the crossover time delay is at a much higher value than for the serial system. Furthermore, the parallel structure shows a fundamentally more damped behaviour than the serial system. It is thus an easier management task to maintain a parallel system in damped mode, compared with a serial syste...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of declining defense budgets over the last decade, the Department of Defense (DoD) is faced with {{increasing}} support costs for aging military equipment. Funds to modernize our armed forces for {{the challenges of the}} 21 st century are being siphoned off to meet growing maintenance costs, which continue to increase as equipment ages. The downturn in procurement of new equipment has produced a consolidation of the defense industrial base, including the <b>lower</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS) is a major problem for the DoD, particularly in the area of avionics. Companies have shifted their focus to commercial markets due to the downsizing of the U. S. military, decreased supplier demand, and the emphasis on the DoD to use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts. As a result, fewer suppliers of legacy avionics components are available today, and available parts are going out of production at an accelerating pace. Traditional efforts of addressing technology refresh have been reactive in nature. Decisions on DMS/obsolescence concerns are based on schedule, procurement cost, and other short term gains. Long term effects and total ownership cost (TOC) are often left out of the decision making process. The defense industry has implemented programs and developed tools to combat these issues and manage DMS in a more systematic manner, following the DoD’s emphasis in acquisition reform. However, many approaches still rely heavily on obtaining information regarding obsolescence independently, reacting to it within the boundaries of a single organization with little cooperation across the supply chain. The Technology REfresh for Navy Transformation (TRENT) program seeks to mitigate these problems by developing a new enterprise-wide strategy for proactive technology management at the system level. The goals of the TRENT program are to improve the readiness, mission capability, and life-cycle affordability of Navy weapon systems. The components of the proactive TRENT solution include...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} {{what drives}} {{the adoption of}} different social sustainability supply chain practices. Research has shown certain factors drive the adoption of environmental sustainability practices but few focus on social supply chain practices; delineate which practices are adopted; or what drives their adoption. We examine the facilitative role of sustainability culture to explain the adoption basic social sustainability supply chain practices, consisting of monitoring and management systems and advanced social sustainability supply chain practices, which are new product and process development and strategic supply chain redefinition. We then explore {{the role played by}} a firm’s entrepreneurial orientation in shaping and reinforcing the relationship betwe en sustainability culture and the adoption of social sustainability supply chain practices. Design/methodology/approach - A survey of 156 supply chain managers in multiple industries in Ireland was conducted to test the relationship between the variables. Findings - Our findings show that sustainability culture is positively related to all the practices and entrepreneurial orientation impacts and moderates social sustainability culture only in advanced social sustainability supply chain practice adoption. Research limitations/implications – As with any survey this is a single point in time with a single respondent, is cross - sectional in nature and conducted in one country. Implications for managers include developing and fostering cultur al attributes in the organisation to implement social sustainability supply chain management practices that go beyond monitoring suppliers to behavioural changes in the supply chain with implications beyond the dyad of b uyer and <b>supplier</b> to <b>lower</b> <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> and the community surrounding the supply chain. Originality/value – This is the first time, to the authors’ knowledge, that cultur al and entrepreneurial variables have been tested for social sustainability supply chain practices giving us new insight into how and why social sustainability supply chain practices are adopted. It also applies a strategic choice theory lens to explore variability in the adoption of different sustainable supply chain practice and presents a view {{of the role of the}} supply chain managers as active creators and enactors of their environment...|$|R

This research focuses on collaboration and e-business for a solution which will enable engineering SMEs to respond to such challenges and undertake higher value projects. In particular, the aim of this engineering doctorate is to develop and implement a mechanism that puts together combinations of SMEs with the required capability, within an e-business environment. Accounting for 99. 3 % of all manufacturing companies and 50. 8 % of the total employment, SME prosperity and `well-being' has significant impact on the national economy. Analyses, such as these provided by KPMG and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, indicate that the demand for common components could substantially reduce the number of small manufacturers and subcontractors. Statistics published by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) confirm the decline of the sector, a reduction of over 22 % in overall sector turnover has been reported in the past two years. Although, improved communication links through collaboration and `e' enablement could permit SMEs to move towards a more enriched business model, there is evidence that ebusiness take-up and success in Europe among engineering businesses is low. For instance, focusing on on-line sales, the eEurope 2004 benchmarking report admits that only 14 % of SMEs make on-line sales and in only 7 % of SMEs do on-line sales constitute more than 5 % of their overall sales. The vast majority of companies still continue to rely on old trusted methods of doing business even though outsourcing to lower cost regions and countries is a major threat to many engineering SMEs in Europe. Access to specific competences drives organisations to collaborate with each other. Focusing on the organisational competence, a notion which expresses the key skills and capabilities of an organisation, an ICT based methodology has been developed and tested in this research. The `Competence Profiling Methodology' facilitates collaborative business processes. The methodology enables the discovery of appropriate collaborators for the development and manufacture of complex systems by matching complimentary competences and softer factors. These ideas were developed and tested within two SME projects in the West Midlands, Autocle@r and Autolean 3, {{as well as with the}} DTI funded Manufacturing Advisory Service - West Midlands, a one-stop shop to assist manufacturing SMEs. The results from these projects were used to develop a practical portal architecture, to help e-enable engineering SMEs. The resulting West Midlands Collaborative Commerce Marketplace, has over 2000 SME members, has had over 40, 000 tenders through the system and over 100 companies are using collaborative spaces to coordinate resources. A key conclusion of this research is that traditional e-business is poorly suited to engineering SMEs being very standard product orientated. Skills and capabilities are far more generic than end products and focusing on them can support more effective eenablement of engineering companies.

40|$|The world {{automotive}} industry has evolved through different manufacturing methodologies over many decades. It originated from craft production, but was transformed to mass production by Henry Ford {{in response to}} increased market demand. The methodology developed by Henry Ford {{made it possible to}} produce quality vehicles in large numbers and at affordable cost to the general public. However, it cannot deliver a great variety of products to the marketplace. Mass production was overtaken by a new automotive manufacturing methodology developed in Japan after World War II. The methodology, commonly referred to as lean production, yields consistently high quality products at even lower costs, whilst being able to deliver a variety of products to the consumer. The effectiveness of the lean production methodology hinges upon the strength and closeness of the relationships that exist between the assembler and its suppliers. Different models have been developed over time to describe the relationships between automotive assemblers and their suppliers. The lean supply model is generally accepted as an effective way of describing the relationships that exist between an automotive assembler and its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> in a lean manufacturing environment. The research study aims at gaining an improved understanding of the relationships that exist between a selected Eastern Cape automotive assembler and its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers.</b> The effect of its supplier support practices towards lean manufacturing implementation amongst its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> is evaluated. For the selected assembler it is found that the effect of its supplier support practices on lean manufacturing implementation amongst its first <b>tier</b> <b>suppliers</b> is limited by a non-uniform approach followed towards the supplier base.
