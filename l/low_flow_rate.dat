Stalling value decreases with a small deviation from the design point causing stall near the hub and tip regions whose size increases with decreasing flow rates.

25|$|Hoses may {{be fitted}} to low {{pressure}} ports of the regulator first stage to provide gas for inflating buoyancy compensators and/or dry suits. These hoses {{usually have a}} quick-connector end with an automatically sealing valve which blocks flow if the hose is disconnected from the buoyancy compensator or suit. There are two basic styles of connector, which are not compatible with each other. The high flow rate CEJN 221 fitting has a larger bore and allows gas flow at a fast enough rate {{for use as a}} connector to a demand valve. This is sometimes seen in a combination BC inflator/deflator mechanism with integrated secondary DV (octopus), such as in the AIR II unit from Scubapro. The <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> Seatec connector is more common and is the industry standard for BC inflator connectors, and is also popular on dry suits, as the limited flow rate reduces the risk of a blow-up if the valve sticks open. The high flow rate connector is used by some manufacturers on dry suits.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of flow instabilities {{as well as}} the cavitation phenomenon in a centrifugal pump operating at <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were studied by experimental and numerical means, respectively. Specially, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical model of cavitation was applied to simulate the internal flow through the pump and suitably long portions of the inlet and outlet ducts. As expected, cavitation proved to occur over a wide range of <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> producing a characteristic creeping shape of the head-drop curve and developing in the form of nonaxisymmetric cavities. As expected, the occurrence of these cavities, attached to the blade suction sides, was found to depend on the pump's flow coefficient and cavitation number. The experiments focused on the flow visualization of the internal flow patterns by means of high-speed digital movies and in the analysis of the inlet pressure pulsations near the impeller eye by means of fast response pressure transducers. The experimental results showed that the unsteady behavior of the internal flow in the centrifugal pump operating at <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> has the {{characteristics of}} a peculiar low-frequency oscillation. Meanwhile, under certain conditions, the low-frequency pressure fluctuations were closely correlated to the flow instabilities induced by the occurrence of cavitation phenomena at <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> Finally, the hydraulic performances of the centrifugal pump predicted by numerical simulations were in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data...|$|R

2500|$|Tesla's design {{attempted}} to sidestep the key drawbacks of the bladed axial turbines, {{and even the}} lowest estimates for efficiency still dramatically outperformed the efficiency of axial steam turbines of the day. However, in testing against more modern engines, the Tesla Turbine had expansion efficiencies far below contemporary steam turbines and far below contemporary reciprocating steam engines. [...] It does suffer from other problems such as shear losses and flow restrictions, but this is partially offset by the relatively massive reduction in weight and volume. Some of Tesla turbine's advantages lie in relatively <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> applications or when small applications are called for. The disks need to be as thin as possible at the edges {{in order not to}} introduce turbulence as the fluid leaves the disks. This translates to needing {{to increase the number of}} disks as the flow rate increases. Maximum efficiency comes in this system when the inter-disk spacing approximates the thickness of the boundary layer, and since boundary layer thickness is dependent on viscosity and pressure, the claim that a single design can be used efficiently for a variety of fuels and fluids is incorrect. A Tesla turbine differs from a conventional turbine only in the mechanism used for transferring energy to the shaft. Various analyses demonstrate the flow rate between the disks must be kept relatively low to maintain efficiency. Reportedly, the efficiency of the Tesla turbine drops with increased load. Under light load, the spiral taken by the fluid moving from the intake to the exhaust is a tight spiral, undergoing many rotations. Under load, the number of rotations drops and the spiral becomes progressively shorter. [...] This will increase the shear losses and also reduce the efficiency because the gas is in contact with the discs for less distance.|$|E

5000|$|The electrosprays {{operated}} at <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> generate {{much smaller}} initial droplets, which ensure improved ionization efficiency. In 1993 Gale and Richard D.

40|$|Abstract-The {{evaluation}} of energy expenditure {{is of great}} importance, not only during health promotion, but also during recovery from disease. The measurement of oxygen uptake is the most reliable method for measuring energy expenditure, but, for estimating resting metabolism, {{there is still a}} need for sophisticated equipment. We have developed and evaluated a simple calorimeter and compared it with the flow-through (Canopy) system. A respiratory simulator was used to evaluate oxygen uptake at different <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> A known concentration of mixed gases flows into the system via the respiratory simulator and the oxygen concentrations and <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were compared. The results indicate that large errors in the measurement of oxygen uptake occurred at <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> but these errors were about 5 % under estimated values in the simple calorimeter. The measurement error at <b>low</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> is about 10 % in the Canopy system. From these results, we concluded that the simple calorimeter can be used to measure oxygen uptake under resting conditions; however, the Canopy system would be unsuitable for measurement in a subject with small ventilation, such as an elderly patient.
