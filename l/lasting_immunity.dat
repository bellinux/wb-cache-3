5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced <b>lasting</b> <b>immunity</b> to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, and the person could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E

50|$|Both {{vaccines}} {{have been}} used for decades to induce immunity to polio, and {{to stop the spread of}} the infection. However, OPV has several advantages; because the vaccine is introduced in the gastrointestinal tract, the primary site of poliovirus infection and replication, it closely mimics a natural infection. OPV also provides long <b>lasting</b> <b>immunity,</b> and stimulates the production of polio neutralizing antibodies in the pharynx and gut. Hence, OPV not only prevents paralytic poliomyelitis, but also, when given in sufficient doses, can stop a threatening epidemic. Other benefits of OPV include ease of administration, low cost and suitability for mass vaccination campaigns.|$|E

50|$|She {{returned}} to the game in Survivor: All Stars, where she started out on the Saboga tribe. In the first episode Lewis successfully lobbied for Tina Wesson's elimination {{on the grounds that}} a former winner (in Wesson's case, the second season, Survivor: The Australian Outback) {{should not be allowed to}} win again. Throughout the game, Lewis along with fellow contestant, Rupert Boneham, managed to wind up on all 4 tribes. After Saboga was dissolved in a reward challenge, they were absorbed into Chapera, then shuffled to Mogo Mogo, and finally merged into Chaboga Mogo. Lewis survived to the final three, but after losing the <b>last</b> <b>Immunity</b> Challenge to Rob Mariano, was voted out by Mariano and became the final member of the jury.

40|$|Potent but safe {{adjuvants}} {{are required}} to circumvent the many limitations of the newborn immune system to induce rapidly effective and long <b>lasting</b> <b>immunity</b> to subunit vaccines. By the use of pattern recognition receptors, antigen-presenting cells (APC) can very efficiently be activated by "danger" motifs expressed by various pathogens. APC activated by "danger" motifs, such as immunostimulatory sequences of bacterial DNA, can not only transmit the activation signal from the innate immunity to the adaptive compartment, but also shape the antigen-specific immune responses. Molecules or compounds expressing "danger" motifs could, therefore, be considered for use as adjuvants for subunit vaccines. In this review, the authors discuss the promises and potential drawbacks that such novel adjuvants could hold for their use in experimental and clinical early life vaccinations...|$|E
40|$|Differences among {{males in}} {{immunocompetence}} can affect resistance to parasites and diseases, and sexual ornaments {{have been suggested}} to function as indicators of additive genetic variation in disease resistance, health and condition in the good gene models of sexual selection. In this paper the role of genetic variation in the immune system is discussed as an alternative route to explore whether or not immunological variation influences condition and sexual ornamentation. In vertebrates, {{the effect of the}} genes located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in shaping immunodominance, <b>lasting</b> <b>immunity,</b> and the risk of developing pathological immune responses are suggested as the link between genetic variation at the MHC and male ornaments. It is also suggested that general immune responsiveness may be optimized at an individual basis depending on the MHC associated risk of autoimmune disorders...|$|E
40|$|Difficulties with {{inducing}} sterile {{and long}} <b>lasting</b> protective <b>immunity</b> against malaria with subunit vaccines has {{renewed interest in}} vaccinations with attenuated Plasmodium parasites. Immunizations with sporozoites that are attenuated by radiation (RAS) can induce strong protective immunity both in humans and rodent models of malaria. Recently, in rodent parasites {{it has been shown}} that through the deletion of a single gene, sporozoites can also become attenuated in liver stage development and, importantly, immunization with these sporozoites results in immune responses identical to RAS. The promise of vaccination using these genetically attenuated sporozoites (GAS) depends on translating the results in rodent malaria models to human malaria. In this study, we perform the first essential step in this transition by disrupting, p 52, in P. falciparum an ortholog of the rodent parasite gene, p 36 p, which we had previously shown can confer long <b>lasting</b> protective <b>immunity</b> in mice. These P. falciparum P 52 deficient sporozoites demonstrate gliding motility, cell traversal and an invasion rate into primary human hepatocytes in vitro that is comparable to wild type sporozoites. However, inside the host hepatocyte development is arrested very soon after invasion. This study reveals, for the first time, that disrupting the equivalent gene in both P. falciparum and rodent malaria Plasmodium species generates parasites that become similarly arrested during liver stage development and these results pave the way for further development of GAS for human use...|$|R
50|$|Day 9: After a {{night of}} celebration, life at Naak {{continued}} as usual, oblivious to the events at the other camp. At Jarakay, Marlon started to plot his moves as a double agent by talking to Charisse and Niña about their vote on the upcoming Tribal Council. The men's alliance was also thinking about altering their strategy if and when John did not come back to camp. As Charisse was starting to talk about John, John {{came back to the}} island after a night in the hospital, telling his tribemates that his collapse the day before was caused by his low potassium levels. The rest of the Jarakay tribe welcomed him back with open arms. At Naak, the tribe was gathering their things to slightly higher ground as the tide began to recede towards camp. Back at Jarakay, the men's alliance decided to stick with their choice of voting out Patani. At Tribal Council, an activity was held at which one member was out of the Tribal Council area as the others would talk about that person. Afterwards, there was also talk about how they lost in the <b>last</b> <b>Immunity</b> Challenge and how everyone had changed during the second Immunity Challenge on Day 5. After the voting, Gigit was surprisingly voted out, 8-1. After Gigit left, Paolo told the remaining Jarakay members to stay on for another round of voting. In the resulting tally, Patani was eliminated, 3-2-2-1. Because of the wide distribution of the votes, Paolo reminded the tribe to step up as one.|$|R
