40|$|Abstract—There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that ionizing radiation increases cancer risks at high doses (e. g.,> 1 Gy), and persua-sive, if controversial, epidemiological evidence that cancer risks are increased at low doses (10 mGy). Discussed here are the issues related to extrapolating radiation risks from <b>low</b> radiation doses <b>to</b> <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses (< 1 mGy) — for which purpose {{we are forced to}} rely on radiobiological evidence and biophysical arguments. At high doses, cells are typically hit by many tracks of radiation, while at low doses most cells are typically hit by a single track of radiation; at <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses proportionately fewer cells are hit, again only by a single track of radiation. Thus, in comparing <b>low</b> doses <b>to</b> <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses, the damage <b>to</b> hit cells remains essentially the same (a single radiation track passing through a cell), but what changes is the number of cells that are subjected to this same damage, which decreases linearly as the dose decreases. This is the argument for a linear no-threshold (LNT) model. It is important to emphasize that this LNT argument only applies to the extrap-olation from <b>low</b> doses <b>to</b> <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses, not from high <b>to</b> <b>low</b> doses. Of course there are caveats to this argument, such as the potential effects of phenomena such as inter-cellular commu-nication and immunosurveillance, and the possibility of differ-ent radiobiological processes at <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses, compared <b>to</b> <b>low</b> doses. However, there is little conclusive experimental evidence about the significance of these phenomena at <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses, and comparative mechanistic studies at high doses vs. low doses will not be informative in this context. At present, we do not know whether such radiobiological phenomena would produce small or large perturbations, or even whether they would increase or decrease cancer risks at <b>very</b> <b>low</b> doses, compared with the prediction of a linear extrapolation from low doses...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{cholesterol}} metabolism {{in patients}} with poorly controlled noninsulin-dependent diabetes was characterized by inhibition of cholesterol net transport between cultured cells (fibroblasts) and plasma, inhibition of cholesterol esterification, and inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer <b>to</b> <b>low</b> and <b>very</b> <b>low</b> density lipoproteins, relative <b>to</b> a normal control group.

5000|$|The {{processes}} {{that lead to}} drug-induced lupus erythematosus are not entirely understood. The exact {{processes that}} occur are not known even after 50 years since its discovery, but many studies present theories on the mechanisms of DIL. A predisposing factor to developing DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at which}} the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL. Of the drugs that cause DIL, hydralazine has been found to cause a higher incidence. Hydralazine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. Approximately 5% of the patients who have taken hydralazine over long periods of time and in high doses have shown DIL-like symptoms.

It is indeed simultaneously realized that the TLC methods used thus far in almost all published studies on INMT and DMT biosynthesis are incapable to resolve DMT from those tetrahydro-β-carbolines. These findings are a blow for all previous claims of evidence of INMT activity and DMT biosynthesis in avian and mammalian brain, including in vivo, as they all relied upon use of the problematic TLC methods: their validity is doubted in replication studies that make use of improved TLC methods, and fail to evidence DMT-producing INMT activity in rat and human brain tissues. Published in 1978, the last study attempting to evidence in vivo INMT activity and DMT production in brain (rat) with TLC methods finds biotransformation of radiolabeled tryptamine into DMT to be real but [...] "insignificant". Capability of the method used in this latter study to resolve DMT from tetrahydro-β-carbolines is questioned later.To localize INMT, a qualitative leap is accomplished with use of modern techniques of molecular biology, and of immunohistochemistry.

A questionnaire containing demographic data and some factor influencing on teacher evaluation including effective teaching skills (9 questions), faculty personal characteristics (15 questions), educational principles and laws (1 question), personal characteristics and attitudes of students toward lessons (10 questions), daily time and place of lecture presentation (4 items), and teacher evaluation process at the University (6 questions) was given to each student before the starting of lecture at the classroom. The questionnaires were collected, and the data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods appropriate. Results. Results showed that from the viewpoints of students proficiency on the course (94 %), good-tempered (93 percent), confidence (92. 7 %), expressive power (91 percent), organizing the contents and having interest to teaching (90 %), personality (90 percent), and old or up-to date of teaching materials (83 %) have high and higher influences on student evaluation of teacher quality. Most Students (63. 3 %) expressed that their personal issues have <b>low</b> up <b>to</b> <b>very</b> <b>low</b> influence on teacher evaluation. Additionally, a significant relation between the gender (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that acdamemic capability (such as academic proficiency and providing new and updated scientific information on the course subject) {{is one of the most}} important factor influencing teacher evaluation outcomes. Also, it seems that not only teaching methods, but also teacher personality can increase student enthusiasm and motivation for learning that ultimately improve the quality of education...|$|R
50|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{resistance of}} a conducting element, usually a copper trace in Printed circuit Board(PCB) can use {{be used as}} sensing element instead of a shunt resistor. Since no additional resistor is required this approach promises a low-cost and space saving configuration with no additional power losses either. Naturally, the voltage drop of a copper trace is <b>very</b> <b>low</b> due <b>to</b> its <b>very</b> <b>low</b> resistance, making {{the presence of a}} high gain amplifier mandatory {{in order to get a}} useful signal.There are several physical effects which may alter the current measurement process: thermal drift of the copper trace, initial conditions of the trace resistance etc. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for applications that require a reasonable accuracy due to the large thermal drift. In order to overcome the problems associated with the temperature drift, a digital controller can be used for thermal drift compensation and calibration of the copper trace.A significant drawback of this kind of current sensor is the unavoidable electrical connection between the current to be measured and the sense circuit. By employing a so-called isolation amplifier, electrical isolation can be added. However, these amplifiers are expensive and can also deteriorate the bandwidth, accuracy and thermal drift of the original current sensing technique. For these reasons, current sensing techniques based on physical principles that provide intrinsic electrical isolation deliver a better performance at lower costs in applications where isolation is required.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the phase}} out of CFC’s and HCFC’s, {{standard}} solder pastes and fluxes evolved from RA and RMA fluxes, <b>to</b> No-Clean, <b>to</b> <b>low</b> residue No-Clean, <b>to</b> <b>very</b> <b>low</b> residue No-Clean. Many companies {{came out with}} their cleaning solutions, aqueous and semi-aqueous, with each product release being more innovative than the previous one. Unfortunately {{for most of the}} suppliers of cleaners, two other trends appeared; lead-free soldering and the progressive miniaturization of electronic devices. Past chemicals like CFC’s, HCFC’s, brominated solvents, detergents and glycols cannot do a good cleaning job anymore because most flux formulations have changed. Also, assembly processes have been modified due to smaller components and more compact board assemblies. Thus, {{it is important to remember}} that the world is composed of two main things: organics and inorganics. Organics are made of resins and activators, whereas inorganics are made of salts, metallic salts and fillers. Cleaning performance is affected by three main criteria. The first involves the Hansen Parameters which is a characterization of a contaminant to be dissolved and which can be simplified by the solvency power of a product also known as the Kauri Butanol Index (KB Index). The second is surface tension, expressed in mN/m. This parameter must be considered because when the cleaning product cannot make contact with the contaminants under or around components, the contaminants cannot be dissolved. This second parameter drives us to the third point, which is physical parameters like temperature, mechanical activities, and the duration of the process. The mastery to manage all of these parameters while facing high-tech miniaturization and environmental care, like ROHS, REACH, etc. brings innovation to cleaning in this electronic world...|$|R
