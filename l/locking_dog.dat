40|$|Life {{experiences}} and living conditions {{can influence the}} problem-solving strategies and the communicative abilities of dogs with humans. The goals {{of this study were}} to determine any behavioural differences between Labrador Retrievers living in a kennel and those living in a house as pets and to assess whether kennel dogs show preferences in social behaviours for their caretaker relative to a stranger when they are faced with an unsolvable task. Nine Labrador Retrievers living in a kennel from birth and ten Labrador Retrievers living in a family as pets were tested. The experimental procedure consisted of three “solvable” tasks in which the dogs could easily retrieve food from a container followed by an “unsolvable” task in which the container was hermetically <b>locked.</b> <b>Dogs</b> of both groups spent {{the same amount of time}} interacting with the experimental apparatus. Kennel dogs gazed towards people for less time and with higher latency than pet dogs; however, there were no significant preferences in gazing towards the stranger versus the caretaker in both groups. These findings demonstrated that kennel dogs are less prone to use human-directed gazing behaviour when they are faced with an unsolvable problem, taking the humans into account to solve a task less than do the pet dogs...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, the {{operations}} regarding the tubing hanger crown plugs {{and the internal}} tree cap are studied and analyzed based on experience data collected from the Statoilo perated fields of Norne, Gullfaks, Åsgard and Heidrun. The Internal Tree Cap (ITC) has been analyzed considering operations involving puling of the lower Tubing Hanger Crown Plug (THCP) through the ball valve. Due {{to the extent of}} the problems seen with operating the ball valve, the cap is recommended pulled before pulling the lower crown plug. A contingency procedure is described in form of a decision tree, and should be use if the cap for some reason is not pulled. For the lower THCP problems have been identified for both pulling and setting operations. Problems with the Upper Wireline Plug (UWLP) are mostly during setting operations. For the lower THCP premature setting of the plug {{is one of the main}} problems. The premature setting is seen in connection with use of a brass pin as the upper shear pin in the CPHRT. A steel-steel combination for the two shear pins in the hydraulic running tool is therefore recommended. The CPHRT should also always be checked for water intrusion in order to ensure that the pistons in the RT are free to move all theway down when trying to <b>lock</b> the <b>dogs</b> into the tubing hanger nipple profile. It is recommended that the number of pistons in the running tool and the setting pressure should follow the table given in the Halliburton manual. Different methods have been used for pulling the THCP. Equalizing across the plug isseen as a necessity for a successful pulling operation. The pulling method with the highest success rate is the”Pressure up above” method. This method is currently just in use for the RLWI system but it is recommended that it be adapted and used for pulling through the WOR. Braided wire should be used when pulling the plug. Displacing fluid through the ¼” TCI-line between the upper and lower plug is seen asone of the challenges when trying to set the UWLP. Calculations done for setting inthe WOR and MR show that the pressure needed in the riser is dependent on the displacement velocity. The higher the pressure in the riser the faster the fluid willdisplace through the TCI-line. In the MR only hydrostatic pressure is available so alonger displacement time should be accounted for. A design failure with the UWLP setting tool has been investigated. When the runningtool is set in compression, a premature energizing of the plug <b>locking</b> <b>dogs</b> can occurand the plug is not able to set. It is recommended that the running tool should be held in tension until the plug has landed and it should be evaluated if a re-design of the tool is needed. New technology regarding the crown plugs is presented. This new technology includes an equalizing crown plug, a motorized setting tool and a pulling/jetting toolall under development for FMC Technologies. Best practice guidelines are developing for the installation and retrieval of the crown plugs based on the analyses performed. Best practice guidelines and recommendations are also made for operating the ITC. The analysis and recommendations given in this thesis should be used as a basis for developing a finalized best practice for crown plug operations. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} use of {{a surgical}} technique commonly used in humans for treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in dogs. DESIGN Prospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs with CSM (n= 10). METHODS Dogs weighing > 30 kg that had CSM at 1 vertebral articulation were eligible for inclusion. Dogs had vertebral column distraction/fusion performed using a cortical ring allograft, cancellous autograft, and a spinal <b>locking</b> plate. <b>Dogs</b> were evaluated temporally by repeat neurological examinations and by client perception of postsurgical outcome, determined by telephone interview. RESULTS Nine dogs survived the immediate postoperative period. Seven of 8 dogs had moderate to complete improvement without recurrence (mean follow-up, 2. 48 years). The most common postsurgical complications were screw loosening (n= 4) and plate shifting (2), neither of which required surgical revision. One dog had pseudoarthrosis that may have negatively impacted outcome. CONCLUSION Treatment of single level CSM in dogs with ring allograft and a spinal locking plate system may lead to successful outcomes. The major problems encountered with included cost of the implants and adjusting the system designed for humans to fit the vertebral column of a dog. CLINICAL RELEVANCE For dogs with CSM at a single level, the {{use of a}} spinal locking plate in combination with a cortical ring allograft can be an effective surgical treatment. Costs of the implants as well as anatomic differences in dogs make this type of surgery less appealing...|$|R

40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{angles of}} insertion for laminar vertebral fixation of L 1 and L 2 {{by use of}} a <b>locking</b> plate in <b>dogs</b> and to confirm screw placement by use of computed tomography (CT). Sample-Vertebral specimens harvested from 8 canine cadavers. Procedures-The point of insertion and minimum and maximum insertion angles for laminar and facet screws for laminar vertebral stabilization were determined by use of CT. A precontoured locking plate was then placed by use of 1 locking screw in the lamina of each lumbar vertebra and 1 nonlocking screw in the facet joint. The position and angle of the screws were examined by use of CT, and penetration into the vertebral canal was recorded. Results-Mean ± SD insertion angles for L 1 and L 2 were 18 ± 4 ° and 21 ± 5 ° toward the vertebral canal and 11 ± 4. 4 ° and 10 ± 3 ° in a dorsal direction, respectively. Insertion angles for the facet joint were between 24 ± 4 ° ventrally and 12 ± 2 ° dorsally. Insertion of the screw did not penetrate the vertebral canal for 23 of 24 (96 %) screws. For 23 of 24 inserted screws, the previously determined angle was maintained and purchase of bone and cortices was satisfactory. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Placement of laminar and facet screws in canine vertebrae was possible and can be performed safely if angles of insertion determined pre-operatively via CT are maintained...|$|R
