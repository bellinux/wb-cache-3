25|$|The first development, called Al-Hussein or Project 1728, with a {{range of}} 400 miles, allowed the Iraqi army to attack deep inside the Iranian boundaries. The range was {{extended}} by reducing the original 945kg warhead to 500kg and increasing the propellant capacity. The warhead carried HE, although it had chemical, biological and nuclear capabilities. According to UN inspectors reports, the Iraqis were able to produce all the major components of the system by 1991. The Al-Hussein was 12.46 meters long and had a diameter of 0.88. The guidance was inertial, without terminal phase. The altitude where the motor burnt out was 31 miles, while the trajectory highest altitude or apogee, was 94 miles. The accuracy for the impact, or Circular error probable, was estimated in a radius of 1,000 meters, and the missile <b>launch</b> <b>weight</b> was 6,400kg.|$|E
500|$|The team {{designed}} {{a much larger}} missile with a greatly enlarged upper fuselage and three stages, more than doubling the <b>launch</b> <b>weight.</b> This version extended range, with interceptions taking place as far as [...] downrange and over [...] in altitude. An even larger booster took the missile to hypersonic speeds while still in the lower atmosphere, so the missile fuselage had to be covered over completely with a phenolic ablative heat shield to protect the airframe from melting. Another change was to combine the aerodynamic controls used for control in the lower atmosphere with the thrust vectoring engines, using a single set of movable jet vanes for both roles.|$|E

50|$|The Air Force {{had also}} started their Lunex Project in 1958, {{also with a}} goal of {{building}} a manned lunar outpost. Like NASA, Lunex favored the direct ascent mode, and therefore required much larger boosters. As part of the project, they designed an entirely new rocket series known as the Space Launcher System, or SLS (not {{to be confused with}} current SLS plans), which combined a number of solid-fuel boosters with either the Titan missile or a new custom booster stage to address a wide variety of <b>launch</b> <b>weights.</b> The smallest SLS vehicle consisted of a Titan and two strap-on solids, giving it performance similar to Titan C, allowing it to act as a launcher for Dyna-Soar. The largest used much larger solid-rockets and a much enlarged booster for their direct ascent mission. Combinations in-between these extremes would be used for other satellite launching duties.|$|R

40|$|Robert Heinlein {{was quoted}} as saying “Once you’re in low Earth orbit (LEO), you’re halfway to anywhere. ” This is due to the {{mechanics}} of space launch, where accelerating into LEO is a large portion of your journey. As a corollary, storing mass in LEO is a way to make trips beyond LEO easier. This paper discusses a project that, for on the order of $ 1 B, creates a flexible cache of rocket propellants (hydrogen and oxygen) and human consumption supplies (oxygen and water) in low Earth orbit. Part of the project involves increasing launch vehicle flight rates through open competition, which will lower the per-kilogram cost of launching payloads into LEO. Exploiting this cache will cut the <b>launch</b> <b>weights</b> of interplanetary spacecraft by up to 2 / 3. This material, stored on orbit for years, would serve any space mission. The plan is modeled after historical cases that jump-started the airline industry, and calls for the best of governmental and/or commercial efforts to get us half way to anywhere.
