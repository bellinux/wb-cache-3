[...] The oropharynx is one of three divisions of the interior of the pharynx based on their relation to adjacent structures (nasal pharynx (nasopharynx), oral pharynx (oropharynx) and laryngeal pharynx (<b>laryngopharynx</b> - also referred to as the hypopharynx), from top to bottom). The pharynx is a semicircular fibromuscular tube joining the nasal cavities above to the larynx (voice box) and oesophagus (gullet), below, where the larynx is situated in front of the oesophagus.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the <b>laryngopharynx</b> below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the tonsillar fossa in which lies the palatine tonsil, another lymphoid organ.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>laryngopharynx,</b> (Latin: pars laryngea pharyngis), {{also known}} as hypopharynx, is the caudal part of the pharynx; it {{is the part of}} the throat that connects to the esophagus. It lies {{inferior}} to the epiglottis and extends to the location where this common pathway diverges into the respiratory (larynx) and digestive (esophagus) pathways. At that point, the <b>laryngopharynx</b> is continuous with the esophagus posteriorly. The esophagus conducts food and fluids to the stomach; air enters the larynx anteriorly. During swallowing, food has the [...] "right of way", and air passage temporarily stops. Corresponding roughly to the area located between the 4th and 6th cervical vertebrae, the superior boundary of the <b>laryngopharynx</b> is {{at the level of the}} hyoid bone. The <b>laryngopharynx</b> includes three major sites: the pyriform sinus, postcricoid area, and the posterior pharyngeal wall. Like the oropharynx above it, the <b>laryngopharynx</b> serves as a passageway for food and air and is lined with a stratified squamous epithelium. It is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus.|$|E

50|$|The pharynx {{is a part}} of the {{conducting}} zone of {{the respiratory}} system and also a part of the digestive system. It is the part of the throat immediately behind the nasal cavity at the back of the mouth and above the esophagus and larynx. The pharynx is made up of three parts. The lower two parts—the oropharynx and the <b>laryngopharynx</b> are involved in the digestive system. The <b>laryngopharynx</b> connects to the esophagus and it serves as a passageway for both air and food. Air enters the larynx anteriorly but anything swallowed has priority and the passage of air is temporarily blocked. The pharynx is innervated by the pharyngeal plexus of the vagus nerve. Muscles in the pharynx push the food into the esophagus. The pharynx joins the esophagus at the oesophageal inlet which is located behind the cricoid cartilage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vascular}} {{supply to}} the <b>laryngopharynx</b> includes the superior thyroid artery, the lingual artery and the ascending pharyngeal artery. The primary neural supply is from both the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. The vagus nerve provides a branch termed [...] "Arnolds Nerve" [...] which also supplies the external auditory canal, thus laryngopharyngeal cancer can result in referred otalgia. This nerve is also responsible for the ear-cough reflex in which stimulation of the ear canal results in a person coughing.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{respiratory}} tract, {{can refer to}} {{the parts of the}} respiratory system lying above the sternal angle (outside of the thorax), above the vocal folds, or above the cricoid cartilage. The larynx is sometimes included in both the upper and lower airways. The larynx is also called the voice box and has the associated cartilage that produces sound. The tract consists of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, the pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx and <b>laryngopharynx)</b> and sometimes includes the larynx.|$|E
50|$|In humans the pharynx {{is part of}} the {{digestive}} system and also of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. (The conducting zone also includes the nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, and their function is to filter, warm, and moisten air and conduct it into the lungs.) The pharynx makes up the part of the throat situated immediately behind the nasal cavity, behind the mouth and above the esophagus and larynx. The human pharynx is conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the <b>laryngopharynx.</b> It is also important in vocalization.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{respiratory}} tract has goblet cells which secrete mucous, form a layer that covers their surface. This helps filter waste, which is eventually are either swallowed into the highly acidic stomach environment or expelled via spitting. The cells lining of the respiratory tract is covered in small hairs called cilia. These beat rhythmically out from the lungs, moving secreted mucous foreign particles toward the <b>laryngopharynx</b> upwards and outwards, in a process called the mucociliary escalator. In addition to keeping the lower respiratory tract sterile, and to prevent mucus accumulation in the lungs. Within alveoli sit macrophages {{of the immune system}} which engulf and digest any harmful agents that they may come across.|$|E
5000|$|The nasal {{passages}} contain two conchae {{on either}} side, which help {{to increase the}} surface area to which the air is exposed. Additionally, the sinuses within the skull are able to drain through the nasal passage. The nasal passage join to the larynx via the pharynx. The pharynx is about 15 cm long in an adult, and includes the nasopharynx, which protect {{the entrance to the}} auditory tubes, the oropharynx, which contains tonsillar tissue, and the <b>laryngopharynx.</b> In parallel to the main nasal passages, the horse has a complex system of paranasal sinuses - air filled spaces within the head which communicate with the respiratory tract, and serve to reduce the weight of the head. These consist of: ...|$|E

50|$|The reflex is {{impaired}} in {{the person}} whose abdominals and respiratory muscles are weak. This problem {{can be caused by}} disease condition that lead to muscle weakness or paralysis, by prolonged inactivity, or as outcome of surgery involving these muscles. Bed rest interferes with the expansion of the chest and limits the amount of air that can be taken into the lungs in preparation for coughing, making the cough weak and ineffective. This reflex may also be impaired by damage to the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve which relays the afferent branch of the reflex arc. This nerve is most commonly damaged by swallowing a foreign object, such as a chicken bone, resulting in it being lodged in the piriform recess (in the <b>laryngopharynx)</b> or by surgical removal of said object.|$|E
5000|$|An {{air choke}} or {{tracheal}} choke specifically {{refers to a}} [...] "true" [...] choke that compresses the upper airway (trachea, larynx or <b>laryngopharynx),</b> hence interfering with breathing, and leading to asphyxia. Although less effective at inducing unconsciousness than its vascular counterpart, the air choke causes excruciating pain and air hunger, and in combat sports a fighter will usually submit to such a submission hold. Air chokes {{have been associated with}} fractures of the larynx or hyoid bone, and are considered less safe than blood chokes to practice. The arm bar choke is an air choke done by placing the forearm across the front of the neck from behind. The free hand grabs the wrist and pulls back the forearm, hence driving the forearm (usually the radius bone) into the front of the neck.|$|E
50|$|Pepsin is {{most active}} in acidic environments between 37 °C and 42 °C. Accordingly, its primary site of {{synthesis}} and activity {{is in the}} stomach (pH 1.5 to 2). Pepsin will digest up to 20% of ingested amide bonds by cleaving preferentially at the N-terminal side of aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Pepsin exhibits preferential cleavage for hydrophobic, preferably aromatic, residues in P1 and P1' positions. Increased susceptibility to hydrolysis occurs {{if there is a}} sulfur-containing amino acid close to the peptide bond, which has an aromatic amino acid. Pepsin cleaves Phe1Val, Gln4His, Glu13Ala, Ala14Leu, Leu15Tyr, Tyr16Leu, Gly23Phe, Phe24 in the insulin B chain. Pepsin exhibits maximal activity at pH 2.0 and is inactive at pH 6.5 and above, however pepsin is not fully denatured or irreversibly inactivated until pH 8.0. Therefore, pepsin in solution of up to pH 8.0 can be reactivated upon re-acidification. The stability of pepsin at high pH has significant implications on disease attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pepsin remains in the larynx following a gastric reflux event. At the mean pH of the <b>laryngopharynx</b> (pH = 6.8) pepsin would be inactive but could be reactivated upon subsequent acid reflux events resulting in damage to local tissues.|$|E

40|$|Atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT) of the <b>laryngopharynx</b> is rare. Here {{we report}} five cases to {{demonstrate}} their clinicopathological features. The patients were four males and one female, aged 41 to 69 years (median 53. 6 years). All tumors (two in the hypopharynx and three in the larynx) presented as a slowly growing, painless mass. Symptoms included dysphagia (2 / 5), dysphonia (3 / 5), and {{the feeling of a}} foreign body in the throat (5 / 5). Tumors were well circumscribed or focally infiltrative, ranging from 2. 0 to 5. 0 cm (median, 3. 4 cm) in size, and microscopically showed the typical features of lipoma-like ALT. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were stained with S- 100, vimentin, murine double minute 2 (MDM- 2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4). Two patients had local tumor recurrences at 6 and 14 months after initial surgery during follow-up. ALT of <b>laryngopharynx</b> is an indolent tumor.

40|$|Purpose: The {{laryngeal}} tube airway (LTA) {{is a new}} extraglottic {{airway device}} with a large proximal cuff that inflates in the <b>laryngopharynx</b> and a distal conical cuff that inflates in the hypopharynx. We {{determine the influence of}} the cuff volume and anatomic location on pharyngeal mucosal pressures for the LTA. Methods: Fifteen fresh cadavers were studied. Microchip sensors were attached to the (anatomic location) anterior, lateral and posterior surface of the distal cuff (hypopharynx) and proximal cuff (<b>laryngopharynx)</b> of the size 4 LTA. Oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) and mucosal pressures were measured at 0 - 140 mL cuff volume in 20 -mL increments. In addition, mucosal pressures for the proximal cuff were measured in three awake, topicalized volunteers. Results: OLP and mucosal pressure at all locations increased with cuff volume (all: P 80 - 100 mL. Mucosal pressures were similar for cadavers and awake volunteers.

40|$|Aim: to {{determine}} the possibility of radionuclide methods {{in the identification of}} "sentinel" lymph node (SLN) in larynx and <b>laryngopharynx</b> cancer patients. Material and methods: 17 patients with larynx and <b>laryngopharynx</b> cancer were included in research. In all patients for SLN visualization nanocolloid radiopharmaceutical was injection around tumor into mucous coat with the subsequent SPECT and radioguided study. Results: Sensitivity and specificity of SPECT and radioguided study for SLN identification were 100 %. We found 22 SLN in 17 patients (from 1 to 2 per patient, on average 1. 3). Most often SLN were located in the III level of a neck (lymph nodes around of carotid arteries) – 12 SLN (54. 5 %) and IIA level (under lower jaw lymph nodes) – 6 (27. 2 %). One SLN (4. 5 %) was localized in IV level and 3 nodes (13. 6 %) in VI level. In 2 patients (11. 8 %) metastasis in SLN were found. In these patients within 2 years cancer progressing was revealed. Fifteen patients (88. 2 %) had no metastatic in SLN and had no progressing of a cancer. Conclusions: Sensitivity and specificity of SPECT and radioguided study for SLN identification are 100 %.

40|$|The {{effects of}} intra- and intersubject variabilities in airway {{geometry}} on airflow {{in the human}} lungs are investigated by large eddy simulation. The airway models of two human subjects consisting of extra- and intrathoracic airways are reconstructed from CT images. For intrasubject study, airflows at two inspiratory flow rates are simulated on the airway geometries of the same subject with four different levels of truncation. These airway models are the original complete geometry and three geometries obtained by truncating the original one at the subglottis, the supraglottis, and the <b>laryngopharynx,</b> respectively. A comparison of the airflows in the complete geometry model shows that {{the characteristics of the}} turbulent laryngeal jet in the trachea are similar regardless of Reynolds number in terms of mean velocities, turbulence statistics, coherent structures, and pressure distribution. The truncated airway models, however, do not produce the similar flow structures observed in the complete geometry. An improved inlet boundary condition is then proposed for the airway model truncated at the <b>laryngopharynx</b> to improve the accuracy of solution. The new boundary condition significantly improves the mean flow. The spectral analysis shows that turbulent characteristics are captured downstream away from the glottis. For intersubject study, although the overall flow characteristics are similar, two morphological factors are found to significantly affect the flows between subjects. These are the constriction ratio of the glottis with respect to the trachea and the curvature and shape of the airways...|$|E
30|$|In summary, we have herein {{presented}} {{a patient with}} Kniest dysplasia in whom trials of tracheal intubation induced laryngeal edema both {{at the age of}} 6  years and again at 13  years. Patients with Kniest dysplasia can develop airway narrowing that is not detectable by preoperative interviews or physical examination. Therefore, preoperative assessment of the <b>laryngopharynx</b> and trachea by endoscopy and computed tomography is required to exclude anomalies such as tracheomalacia and airway narrowing. Additionally, because of connective tissue vulnerability, tracheal intubation may also exacerbate airway edema even if the laryngeal condition is normal preoperatively. Therefore, alternative airway management methods {{such as the use of}} a laryngeal mask should be considered.|$|E
