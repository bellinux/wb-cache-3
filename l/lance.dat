5|$|Although a large {{horse is}} not {{required}} to carry an armoured knight, it is held by some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase the power of a <b>lance</b> strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the <b>lance.</b>|$|E
