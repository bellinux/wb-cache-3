Filter and vapor-phase semivolatile organic {{samples were collected}} from normal and high-emitter gasoline and diesel vehicles operated on chassis dynamometers on the Unified Driving Cycle, and the compositions of the samples were measured in detail. The two fractions of each sample were combined in their original mass collection ratios, and the toxicity of the seven samples was compared by measuring inflammation and tissue damage in rat lungs and mutagenicity in bacteria. There was good agreement among the toxicity response variables in ranking the samples and demonstrating a five-fold range of toxicity. The relationship between chemical composition and toxicity was analyzed {{by a combination of}} principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression (PLS, also known as projection to <b>latent</b> <b>surfaces).</b> The PCA /PLS analysis revealed the chemical constituents co-varying most strongly with toxicity and produced models predicting the relative toxicity of the samples with good accuracy.

40|$|Modeling species {{abundance}} patterns using {{local environmental}} features is an important, current problem in ecology. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) in South Africa {{is a global}} hot spot of diversity and endemism, and provides a rich class of species abundance data for such modeling. Here, we propose a multi-stage Bayesian hierarchical model for explaining species abundance over this region. Our model is specified at areal level, where the CFR is divided into roughly $ 37 {,} 000 $ one minute grid cells; species abundance is observed at some locations within some cells. The abundance values are ordinally categorized. Environmental and soil-type factors, likely to influence the abundance pattern, {{are included in the}} model. We formulate the empirical abundance pattern as a degraded version of the potential pattern, with the degradation effect accomplished in two stages. First, we adjust for land use transformation and then we adjust for measurement error, hence misclassification error, to yield the observed abundance classifications. An important point in this analysis is that only $ 28 %$ of the grid cells have been sampled and that, for sampled grid cells, the number of sampled locations ranges from one to more than one hundred. Still, we are able to develop potential and transformed abundance surfaces over the entire region. In the hierarchical framework, categorical abundance classifications are induced by continuous <b>latent</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The degradation model above is built on the latent scale. On this scale, an areal level spatial regression model was used for modeling the dependence of species abundance on the environmental factors.

40|$|Presented on February 3, 2010 from 4 - 5 pm in room G 011 of the Molecular Science and Engineering Building on the Georgia Tech Campus. Introduction of the {{property}} integration framework has allowed for representation of processes and products from a properties perspective. This methodology enables identification of the desired product properties by targeting the optimum process performance without committing to any components during the solution step. The identified property targets are then used as inputs for solving a molecular design problem, which returns the corresponding components. Recently, novel property clustering techniques and proven group contribution methods have been combined to facilitate simultaneous consideration of {{the property}} performance requirements as well as process and molecular constraints. The clusters are obtained by mapping property relationships into a low dimensional domain allowing for visualization of the problem. For visualization purposes only three properties {{can be used to}} characterize the system, however algebraic and optimization based approaches have extended the application range to include more properties. Using this approach the process requirements along with the molecular building blocks can be represented on a ternary cluster diagram. The property clustering technique uses property operators, which are tailored to exhibit linear mixing rules. The mixing rules will invariably be functionally different for molecular groups and process streams; however since they represent the same property, they can still be visualized on the same diagram. Once visualized it is possible to solve the process design problem by identifying the product properties corresponding to the desired process performance. On the ternary diagram the target product properties will be represented as either a single point or a region depending on whether the target properties are discrete values or given as ranges. The structure and identity of candidate molecules are then identified by combining or “mixing” molecular fragments until the resulting properties match the targets. A significant result of the developed methodology is that for problems that can be adequately described by just three properties, the process and molecular design problems are solved visually and simultaneously on a ternary diagram, irrespective of how many molecular fragments are included in the search space. Mixture design is a Design of Experiments (DOE) tool used to determine the optimum combination of chemical constituents that deliver a desired response (or property) using a minimum number of experimental runs. While the approach is sufficient for most experimental designs, it suffers from combinatorial explosion when dealing with the multi-component mixtures found in e. g. pharmaceutical excipient design. The property clustering technique can be used to overcome this limitation by significantly reducing the complexity of the mixture design problem. While most current techniques make use of group contribution methods (GCM) to design molecules, there are many properties which can not be estimated by GCM. Furthermore, not all possible atomic arrangements and structures can be represented in GCM. Hence, there is a need of an efficient methodology for the design of structured molecules. One such approach to structured product design is to combine property clustering with decomposition techniques. This approach first utilizes multivariate characterization techniques to describe a set of representative samples, and then uses decomposition techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares on to <b>latent</b> <b>surfaces</b> (PLS), to find the underlying latent variable models that describe the molecule’s properties. The orthogonal nature of these models allows for groupbased interpretations and property predictions which can be utilized to design new molecules not found in the original set of molecules. This contribution will highlight the methodologies of this novel unifying design framework through illustrative examples of property driven process and product design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} is to assess {{potential}} future Antarctic surface mass balance changes, the underlying mechanisms, {{and the impact of}} these changes on global sea level. To this end, this paper presents simulations of the Antarctic climate {{for the end of the}} twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

The model is an updated and improved {{version of the}} coupled model studied by Latif and Barnett. Evidence is sought for determining {{the details of the}} mechanism responsible for the enhanced variance of some variables at 20 – 30 -yr timescales. The possible mechanisms include a midlatitude gyre ocean–atmosphere feedback loop, stochastic forcing, remote forcing, or sampling error.

The decadal signal off Japan is initiated by changes in strength and position of the Aleutian low. The atmospheric perturbations excite SST anomalies in the central and eastern North Pacific (with opposing signs and canonical structure). The atmospheric perturbations also change the Ekman pumping over the North Pacific, which excites equivalent barotropic Rossby waves that carry thermocline depth perturbations toward the west. This gyre adjustment results in a shift in the border between subtropical and subpolar gyres after about five years.

Exploiting, among others, {{a variant of the}} equal weight criterion of phase equilibrium, we obtain transition temperature, <b>latent</b> heat and <b>surface</b> tension, and compare with M_H approx 35 GeV. In the broken phase masses and Higgs condensates are compared to perturbation theory. For the symmetric phase, bound state masses and the static force are determined.
