500|$|Baker's first American film in over 10 years {{came in the}} Andy Warhol–produced black comedy Bad (1977), {{in which}} she plays the lead role of a Queens beauty salon owner who {{provides}} hitmen with jobs, starring alongside Susan Tyrrell and Perry King. [...] "You can hardly call making an Andy Warhol movie a 'comeback'," [...] said Baker. [...] "It's more <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon! The subject is totally unique." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{seventeen}} compositions issued on discs {{one and two}} of the original album, Harrison recorded at least twenty other songs – either in demo form for Spector's benefit, just before recording got officially under way in late May, or as outtakes from the sessions. In a 1992 interview, Harrison commented on the volume of material: [...] "I didn't have many tunes on Beatles records, so doing an album like All Things Must Pass was <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bathroom and letting it out." [...] As well as [...] "Wah-Wah", [...] "Art of Dying" [...] and others that would soon be developed in a band setting, Harrison's solo performance for Spector included the following songs, all of which remain unreleased: ...|$|E
500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dentist at two in the morning and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E

5000|$|For leisure activities, he <b>liked</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hollywood Bowl, {{especially}} the annual John Philip Sousa concert.

'My dearest Father,--Hearing that [...] "Israel in Egypt" [...] {{was to be}} {{performed}} at Exeter Hall on Friday night, I went and asked my tutor whether he had any objection to my running up that night to hear it, and coming back the next morning, quite early at six.

[...] "It was not," [...] he said, [...] "certainly <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> play, {{or any of those}} sort of places," [...] but he did not like the idea of going at all. Do you think that there was any harm in the wish? ...|$|E
60|$|But about {{motoring}} {{there is}} something magical, <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon; and I say the thing should be kept exceptional and felt as something breathless and bizarre. My ideal hero would own his horse, but would have the moral courage to hire his motor. Fairy tales are the only sound guidebooks to life; I like the Fairy Prince to ride on a white pony out of his father's stables, which are of ivory and gold. But if {{in the course of}} his adventures he finds it necessary to travel on a flaming dragon, I think he ought to give the dragon back to the witch at the end of the story. It is a mistake to have dragons about the place.|$|E

60|$|It was {{wonderful}} to Sir James Chettam how well he continued to <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Grange after he had once encountered the difficulty of seeing Dorothea {{for the first time}} in the light of a woman who was engaged to another man. Of course the forked lightning seemed to pass through him when he first approached her, and he remained conscious throughout the interview of hiding uneasiness; but, good as he was, it must be owned that his uneasiness was less than it would have been if he had thought his rival a brilliant and desirable match. He had no sense of being eclipsed by Mr. Casaubon; he was only shocked that Dorothea was under a melancholy illusion, and his mortification lost some of its bitterness by being mingled with compassion.|$|E
6000|$|It was not {{surprising}} that he should {{take an interest in}} the Devonian, for the lad worshipped and served him in love and wonder. Busy as he was, he would find time to warn Alick of an approaching officer, or even to tell him that the coast was clear, and he might slip off and smoke a pipe in safety. ‘Tom,’ he once said to him, for that was the name which Alick ordered him to use, ‘if you don’t <b>like</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> galley, I’ll go for you. You ain’t used to this kind of thing, you ain’t. But I’m a sailor; and I can understand the feelings of any fellow, I can.’ Again, he was hard up, and casting about for some tobacco, for he was not so liberally used in this respect as others perhaps less worthy, when Alick offered him the half of one of his fifteen sticks. I think, for my part, he might have increased the offer to a whole one, or perhaps a pair of them, and not lived to regret his liberality. But the Devonian refused. ‘No,’ he said, ‘you’re a stowaway like me; I won’t take it from you, I’ll take it from some one who’s not down on his luck.’ ...|$|E

Four years later, Latapi married Clemencia Espinoza, which he met at a leprosy campaign. Clemencia remained Latapi’s partner and collaborator throughout the years until Fernando’s death in 1989. Although his wife and he loved children, they never had one on their own. Apart from his native language Spanish, he spoke French and English, and understood both Italian and Portuguese. The latter was especially useful when he worked in leprosy studies with physicians João Ramos e Silva from Brazil and Augusto Salazar Leite from Portugal. He enjoyed reading plays and listening to opera and classical music.
