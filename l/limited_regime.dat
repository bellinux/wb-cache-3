The high diffusivities and concentrations of precursor in the fluid as compared to the vacuum systems used in chemical vapour deposition allow deposition to occur in a surface reaction rate <b>limited</b> <b>regime,</b> providing stable and uniform interfacial growth. This is crucial in developing more powerful electronic components, and metal particles deposited in this way are also powerful catalysts for chemical synthesis and electrochemical reactions. Additionally, due to the high rates of precursor transport in solution, it is possible to coat high surface area particles which under chemical vapour deposition would exhibit depletion near the outlet of the system and also be likely to result in unstable interfacial growth features such as dendrites. The result is very thin and uniform films deposited at rates much faster than atomic layer deposition, the best other tool for particle coating at this size scale.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the image}} sensor, or {{effective}} light collection area per pixel sensor, is the largest determinant of signal levels that determine signal-to-noise ratio and hence apparent noise levels, assuming the aperture area is proportional to sensor area, or that the f-number or focal-plane illuminance is held constant. That is, for a constant f-number, the sensitivity of an imager scales roughly with the sensor area, so larger sensors typically create lower noise images than smaller sensors. In the case of images bright enough {{to be in the}} shot noise <b>limited</b> <b>regime,</b> when the image is scaled to the same size on screen, or printed at the same size, the pixel count makes little difference to perceptible noise levels - the noise depends primarily on sensor area, not how this area is divided into pixels.

The method is explicit, fourth-order in time and spectral order in space. It is unconditional stable and conserves the total density in the discretized level. It is called a compact time-splitting method since, at each time step, the number of sub-steps in S_ 4 c is much less {{than those of the}} standard fourth-order splitting method and the fourth-order partitioned Runge-Kutta splitting method. Comparison among S_ 4 c and many other existing time-splitting methods for the Dirac equation are carried out in terms of accuracy and efficiency as well as long time behavior. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage in terms of efficiency and accuracy of the proposed S_ 4 c.

In this <b>limit</b> <b>regime,</b> the solution is highly oscillatory in time, i. e. there are propagating waves with wavelength O(ε^ 2) and O(1) in time and space, respectively. We begin with the conservative Crank-Nicolson finite difference (CNFD) method and establish rigorously its error estimate which depends explicitly on the mesh size h and time step τ {{as well as the}} small parameter 0 <ε< 1. Based on the error bound, in order to obtain `correct' numerical solutions in the nonrelativistic <b>limit</b> <b>regime,</b> i. e. 0 <ε≪ 1, the CNFD method requests the ε-scalability: τ=O(ε^ 3) and h=O(√(ε)). Then we propose and analyze two numerical methods for the discretization of the nonlinear Dirac equation by using the Fourier spectral discretization for spatial derivatives combined with the exponential wave integrator and time-splitting technique for temporal derivatives, respectively. Rigorous error bounds for the two numerical methods show that their ε-scalability is improved to τ=O(ε^ 2) and h=O(1) when 0 <ε≪ 1 compared with the CNFD method.

The solution consists of a real-time robust SDMA precoding, user selection and rate adaptation as well as an offline feedback index assignment algorithm. The index assignment problem is cast into a Traveling Sales Man problem (TSP). Based on the specific structure of the feedback constellation and the precoder, we derive a low complex but asymptotically optimal solution. Simulation results show that the proposed framework has significant goodput gain compared to the traditional naive designs under noisy limited feedback channel. Furthermore, we show that despite the noisy feedback channel, the average SDMA system goodput grows with the number of feedback bits in the interference <b>limited</b> <b>regime</b> while in noise <b>limited</b> <b>regime</b> increases linearly with the number of transmit antenna and the forward channel SNR.
