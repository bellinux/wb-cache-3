Immediate signs of bronchoconstriction, respiratory tract and deep lung irritation were observed during exposure, followed by the development of pneumonia and oedema a few hours after exposure (Purser & Woolley 1983; Purser & Grimshaw 1984; Purser & Buckley 1983). In one case, the exposure to the yellow smoke proved to be fatal (Purser & Woolley 1983; Purser & Grimshaw 1984; Purser & Buckley 1983).

To investigate the contribution of these mechanisms the effect of terfenadine and ipratropium bromide on the bronchial response to this stimulus was assessed. A total of 30 asth-matics (mean 28. 7 years) were submitted on three different days to distilled water challenge with or without prior treatment with oral ter-fenadine or inhaled aerosolized ipratropium bromide. The decrease in forced expiratory volume in I s induced by the same dose of distilled water was significantly (P < 0. 001) reduced from 35. 6 ± 15. 8 % to 19. 5 ± 16 % with terfenadine and to 23. 9 ± 19. 7 % with ipratropium bromide.

30|$|This {{analysis}} provides unequivocal {{evidence of}} the redistribution of plasma fluid and proteins from the peripheral circulation into the lung. This pattern of changes is not peculiar to phosgene poisoning since similar findings were noted following exposure to other <b>lung</b> <b>irritants</b> [33]. Bradycardia and decreased cardiac output along with systemic vasoconstriction may have caused the redistribution of plasma volume into the lung. This process may have aggravated the acute edema and anoxic anoxia in the accompanying hemodynamic state of increasing hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. All of these factors, including those caused by intense vagus stimulation [82, 86, 87], seriously impede gas exchange and further lead to imbalances in the fluid dynamics of the lung. Collectively, cardiovascular disturbances (cardiogenic edema caused by imbalanced Starling forces), rather than an appreciable disruption of the air-blood barrier function, {{were believed to be}} the predominant etiopathology of the phosgene-induced lung edema (at this Cxt). Evidence from studies on larger animals and human evidence (military and occupational) report a similar interrelationship of hemoconcentration and pulmonary edema [54, 75, 76].|$|R
40|$|Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong-smelling gas. It is {{commonly}} used in liquid form as a 37 % aqueous solution known as formalin (37 grams of formaldehyde gas dissolved in 100 ml of solution). To prevent polymerization of formaldehyde solution, about 10 - 15 % of methyl alcohol is added. Formalin is primarily used as a fixative for biological tissue specimens. A fixative labeled as 10 % buffered formalin is actually only a 3. 7 % solution of formaldehyde. This is because 10 % buffered formalin is made by diluting a stock bottle of 37 % formalin. Formalin can release formaldehyde gas, especially when poured or spilled over a large surface area, creating a potential inhalation exposure. Paraformaldehyde, is formaldehyde in solid form as a fine, white powder. When heated paraformaldehyde depolymerizes back to formaldehyde. If paraformaldehyde is added to water and heated, the resulting gas immediately dissolves making a formalin solution. Paraformaldehyde {{is commonly}} used as a disinfectant for biological safety cabinets.

Depression has often been associated with COPD. In an observational study of 35, 722 patients with COPD, the incidence rate of new-onset diagnoses of depression was significantly higher in the COPD group, compared to the COPD-free group. 5 Sleeping difficulties and physical inactivity are also common among those with COPD. 6, 7 The aim of this report is to enumerate the prevalence and risk of secondary chronic diseases, and poor quality of life, among North Carolina adults with COPD...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Nitrogen dioxide {{is known}} as a deep <b>lung</b> <b>irritant.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether the {{relatively}} low ambient air NO 2 concentrations in the northern city of Helsinki had an impact on the respiratory health of children. The association between personal exposure to ambient air NO 2 and respiratory health was investigated in a 13 -week follow-up study among 163 preschool children aged 3 ± 6 yrs. Personal weekly average exposure to NO 2 was measured by passive diffusion samplers attached to the outer garments. Symptoms were recorded daily in a diary by the parents. Among 53 children, peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured at home in the mornings and evenings. The association between NO 2 exposure and respiratory symptoms was examined with Poisson regression. The median personal NO 2 exposure was 21. 1 mg. m- 3 (range 4 ± 99 mg. m- 3). An increased risk of cough was associated with increasing NO 2 exposure (risk ratio= 1. 52; 95 % confidence interval 1. 00 ± 2. 31). There was no such association between personal weekly NO 2 exposure and nasal symptoms, but a nonsignificant negative association was found between the exposure and the weekly average deviation in PEF. In conclusion, even low ambient air NO 2 concentrations can increase the risk of respiratory symptoms among preschool children...|$|E

Forty-eight hours after exposure to 250 p. p. m. SO 2 base-line values of total lung resistance and dynamic lung compliance were unchanged {{but there was an}} increase in the bronchoconstrictor response to histamine (20 micrograms/kg I. V.). This enhanced response was vagally dependent. The response of <b>lung</b> <b>irritant</b> receptors to histamine (20 micrograms/kg I. V.) was also increased in these animals. Forty-eight hours after exposure to 400 p. p. m. SO 2 resting total lung resistance had increased and resting dynamic lung compliance had fallen. Vagotomy produced a small but insignificant fall in resting total lung resistance. Changes in total lung resistance produced by acetylcholine (40 micrograms/kg I. V.) histamine (20 micrograms/kg I.

40|$|Rationale : Tungsten oxide (WO 3) is an {{occupational}} exposure hazard. The primary route of WO 3 exposure is inhalation and WO 3 {{is known as}} a pulmonary irritant. This work investigated exposure of WO 3 to immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas- 2 B) to investigate cytotoxicity and carcinogenic potential. Experimental procedures : Insoluble WO 3 particles were sonicated to reduce aggregation and create suspensions of WO 3 particles small enough for Beas- 2 B cells to engulf (< 10 microns in diameter). Beas- 2 B cells were chronically exposed to varying doses (0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, 5. 0, 10 and 15 μg/cm 2) of WO 3 for 6 weeks. Proliferation rate was measured; soft agar cell migration testing and scratch test assays were performed. Results : After 2 weeks, Beas- 2 B cells with the highest doses of WO 3 started to proliferate just as quickly as the cells that had low doses of WO 3. After 6 weeks of WO 3 exposure, in the control transformation there was an average of 8 colonies per soft agar well. In the lower doses (0. 25 - 1. 0 μg/cm 2) there was an average of 25 colonies per well. In the higher doses (5. 0 - 15. 0 μg/cm 2) colonies ranged from 30 to 75 per well. Scratch testing revealed that WO 3 treated cells migrated significantly more quickly than control transformed cells. Conclusions : Chronic treatment of Beas- 2 B cells with WO 3 induced transformation in the cells. Inhaled WO 3 may not only be a <b>lung</b> <b>irritant,</b> but also a potential pulmonary carcinogen at high doses. ...|$|E

This correlation is largely based upon studies of lung cancer in ca-reer miners exposed to alpha radiation and other carcinogens and <b>lung</b> <b>irritants.</b> However, the general regulatory model is the “linear, no threshold ” model, which means that any radiation increases the risk of subsequent lung cancer and that it is the lifetime dose, rather than the rate, that correlates with the risk.

40|$|Definitive {{information}} on the chronic effects of exposure to ozone (03) in humans is not available. There is a strong concern that ozone could produce chronic lung damage in humans {{on the basis that}} exposures are ubiquitous at levels that produce transient symptoms, function deficits, and lung inflammation in humans and chronic lung damage in laboratory animals. Both prospective and national population surveys suggest an association between chronic 03 exposure and reduced lung function, and a pilot investigation of autopsied lungs of accident victims in Los Angeles reported an unexpectedly high incidence of disease in the centriacinar region, the lung region known to receive the highest dose of inhaled 03. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of further studies of structural changes in human lung tissue in relation to chronic 03 exposure. The major advantages of such studies are that a) measurable effects may be related to realistic chronic exposures, b) the effects may be described quantitatively and compared directly to those obtained in chronic animal inhalation exposures, and c) evidence for chronic effects may be obtained much more rapidly than in prospective studies. The major limitations are the difficulties in obtaining sufficient reliable {{information on}} residential history, physical activity out-of-doors, and smoking and other confounding exposures to <b>lung</b> <b>irritants</b> from next of kin, and limited availability of adequate air quality data for determining ambient concentrations at places of residence and/or outdoor exercise.

Luong ### Abstract A rapid {{one-step}} kinetics-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) procedure {{has been}} developed for highly-sensitive detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in less than 30 min. With minimal process steps, the procedure is highly simplified and cost-effective. The analysis only involves sequentially {{the formation of a}} sandwich immune complex on capture anti-CRP antibody (Ab) -bound Dynabeads, followed by two magnet-assisted washings and an enzymatic reaction. The developed immunoassay (IA) detected CRP in the dynamic range of 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1 with a limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0. 4 ng mL- 1 and 0. 7 ng mL- 1. Its analytical precision for analysis of CRP spiked in diluted human serum, whole blood, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples of patients was validated by conventional ELISA, unravelling its immense potential for in vitro diagnostics (IVD). ### Introduction As the gold standard for the detection of CRP in clinical diagnostics, ELISA exhibits high-throughput, excellent reproducibility, high precision and remarkable sensitivity. Last five decades have accumulated over 300, 000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA. In particular, the last decade has also witnessed considerable advances in diversified CRP assay formats (1 - 22), lateral flow (20), immunoturbidimetry (1, 11), surface plasmon resonance (14), piezoresistive cantilever-based IA (10), chemiluminescent IA (3), impedimetry (23), electrochemistry 17, reflectometric interference spectroscopy 19, microfluidics (7) and homogenous bead-based IA (24). In general, most of these assay formats are based on a complex procedure comprising of many process steps with a lengthy analysis time (25 - 28). Therefore, there is uttermost importance for the development of rapid and cost-effective IA procedures with high precision and minimal process steps to guide healthcare professionals to decide on the desired intervention at an early stage. CRP, a pentameric protein with a molecular weight of 118 kDa, is a member of a class of acute-phase reactants indicating activation of innate and adaptive immunity (13, 29, 30). It {{plays an important role in}} host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related microbial molecules. As an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions (31, 32), CRP is usually elevated in patients with neonatal sepsis (33 - 35), meningitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease and occult bacteremia. The significantly elevated serum CRP levels are associated with malignant diseases, bacterial infections and correlate with increased 30 -day mortality rates in hospitalized patients (36). The monomeric CRP binds to the surface of damaged cells and platelets, thereby activating the complement cascade that plays an important role in inflammation. The American Heart Association/Center for Disease Control has considered CRP as the best inflammatory marker for clinical diagnosis (37). The precise and rapid determination of human C-reactive protein (CRP) is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis (33 - 35, 38, 39), cardiovascular diseases (40 - 44), infectious/inflammatory conditions (31) and diabetes (45 - 47). The ability for repeated CRP measurements with high precision in an acute setting provides clinicians with the valuable information to assess disease diagnosis and circumvent any unnecessary administration of antibiotics. The normal CRP levels in human serum are usually below 10 µg mL- 1 30 but up to 350 - 400 µg mL- 1 in several disease states. The CRP levels in the ranges of 10 - 40 µg mL- 1, 40 - 200 µg mL- 1, and > 200 µg mL- 1 are the indicators of mild or chronic inflammation and viral infections; acute inflammation and bacterial infections; and severe bacterial infections and burns, respectively (30). The CRP levels beyond the cut-off point of 5 µg mL- 1 are indicative of neonatal sepsis, which is diagnosed based on the determination of two CRP concentration ranges normal (0. 2 - 480 µg mL- 1) and high sensitivity (0. 08 - 80 µg mL- 1) 30. The high sensitivity CRP assay is performed first, but the normal CRP assay is also performed if the CRP levels are > 80 µg mL- 1. The existing analytical techniques for the determination of CRP have limitations in terms of prolonged IA duration and lower analytical sensitivity, as reviewed recently by Algarra et al. (22). The clinical laboratory-based CRP assays, based on latex agglutination or nephelometry, and phosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine based immunoassays can detect CRP only in the detection range of µg mL- 1. On the other hand, the recently developed immunoassay formats, based on electrochemical techniques, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, chemiluminescence, total internal reflection and micromosiac immunoassays, have higher sensitivities in the range of ng mL- 1 to µg mL- 1. Similarly, the surface plasmon resonance based real-time and label-free immunoassay formats have sensitivity between ng mL- 1 to g mL- 1. Therefore, there is a critical need for a highly simplified, cost-effective, precise and highly sensitive IA format for the rapid detection of CRP. We have developed a rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure (48) (Figure 1) to detect CRP in human whole blood and serum in less than 30 min. It has critically reduced the IA duration by more than 12 -fold and the analysis cost by 2. 5 -fold in comparison to the conventional procedure. This novel ELISA format required also significantly reduced number of process steps and only two washing steps in comparison to the conventional counterpart (Table S 1). Moreover, the high analytical precision of the developed procedure implies its tremendous potential for rapid analyte detection in clinical and bioanalytical settings. ### Materials 1.

Block the MTP wells by incubating with 300 μL of 5 % (w/v) BSA for 30 min a 37 °C and wash with 300 μL of wash buffer five times. Washing can also be performed with an automatic plate washer. The preblocking is essential to prevent non-specific binding of IA reagents to the MTP wells (49). CRITICAL STEP Use filtered BSA or filter the BSA solution prior to use to remove any microbial or other contaminants. ?TROUBLESHOOTING **One-step kinetics-based CRP sandwich ELISA TIMING 30 min** - 2. Dispense in the BSA-blocked MTP wells sequentially 2 µL of the diluted stock solution of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® (diluted 1 : 10 in binding buffer), 38 µL of the binding buffer and 40 µL of biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab (0. 17 µg mL- 1) pre-conjugated to SA-HRP (diluted 1 : 3000). Finally, dispense 40 µL of CRP (varying concentrations; 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1) in the respective MTP wells in triplicate. Place the MTP on the magnetic holder and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min so that the magnets capture the Dynabead®-bound sandwich immune complex. Take out the excess reagents by sucking back the solution using a 300 µL multi-channel pipette. ?TROUBLESHOOTING - 3. Wash the magnetically-captured sandwich immune complex-bound Dynabeads® twice by dispensing and sucking back 300 µL of the washing buffer using a 300 µL multi-channel pipette. Thereafter, suspend the washed magnetically-captured sandwich immune complex-bound Dynabeads® in 50 µL of the binding buffer. - 4. Add 100 µL of the TMB-H 2 O 2 mixture to each MTP well and incubate at RT for 4 min to allow the enzymatic reaction to develop color. ?TROUBLESHOOTING - 5. Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 50 µL of 2 N H 2 SO 4 to each MTP well. - 6. Measure the absorbance at a primary wavelength of 450 nm and 540 nm as the reference wavelength in the Tecan Infinite M 200 Pro microplate reader. CRITICAL STEP Determine the absorbance within 10 min of stopping the enzymatic reaction. ### Troubleshooting ![TABLE 1]([URL] "TABLE 1 ") ### Anticipated Results The developed CRP sandwich ELISA critically reduced the IA assay duration by 12 -fold, from 6 h (commercial CRP sandwich ELISA) to just 30 min, based on the use of Ab-bound Dynabeads®/MTPs. The developed ELISA is cost-effective and highly-simplified as attested by the minimal process steps and 2. 5 -fold reduced IA components in comparison to the conventional ELISA procedure (Tables S 1, S 2). It detects 0. 3 - 81. 0 ng mL- 1 of CRP with linearity in the range of 1 - 81 ng mL- 1 (Figure 2 A). LOD, analytical sensitivity and correlation coefficient (R 2) are determined to be 0. 4 ng mL- 1, 0. 7 ng mL- 1, and 0. 998, respectively (Table S 2). The intraday and interday variability determined from five assay repeats (in triplicate) in a single day and five consecutive days, respectively, are in the ranges of 0. 7 - 10. 8 and 1. 6 - 11. 2, respectively. The developed ELISA can detect the entire pathophysiological range of hsCRP from 3 - 80 µg mL- 1 in human whole blood and serum after appropriate dilution, as demonstrated by the detection of CRP spiked in diluted whole blood and plasma (Figure 2 A). It has high specificity for CRP, as demonstrated by the use of various experimental process controls (Figure 2 B) that shows no detectable interference with the immunological reagents. The optimum duration for the formation of the sandwich immune complex by the one-step kinetics-based procedure is 15 min, while the optimum number of magnet-assisted washings thereafter is only two (Figure S 1). The developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs have the same analytical precision for the detection of CRP in diluted whole blood and serum as the results are in agreement with each other (Table 2). The percentage recovery for the CRP-spiked diluted human whole blood is in the range of 93. 3 - 107. 0 and 94. 0 - 103. 3 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Similarly, the percentage recovery for CRP-spiked diluted human serum ranges from 103. 3 - 108. 0, compared to 93. 3 - 113. 0 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. The results obtained for the detection of CRP in the EDTA plasma samples of patients by the developed ELISA are also in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional ELISA (Table 3). The anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® can be stored for more than 4 months at 4 ºC without compromising the CRP detection response (Figure 2 C). The production variability for the preparation of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads®, using the same lots of Dynabeads® and anti-CRP capture Ab, is less than 3 percent (Figure 2 D). Moreover, the developed ELISA using SA-HRP/biotinylated anti-CRP Ab conjugate is similar to the variant of the developed ELISA procedure that employs the two-step binding of biotinylated anti-CRP Ab and SA-HRP (Figure S 2 A). The one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA solution (comprising anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® and biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab preconjugated to SA-HRP, stored at 4 ºC in BSA-preblocked MTPs) exhibited no noticeable decrease in its functional activity for up to 4 weeks (Figure S 2 B). Therefore, taking into account the attributes of the developed generic sandwich ELISA procedure, it can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. Moreover, it has immense potential for the development of novel and fully automated rapid IVD kits in combination with lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics, nanotechnology and smart system integration. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Schematic of the protocol** ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") One-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure for the rapid detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) (48).

40|$|The {{opportunity}} {{of an emerging}} smart city in post-disaster Christchurch has been explored {{as a way to}} improve the quality of life of people suffering Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which is a progressive disease that affects respiratory function. It affects 1 in 15 New Zealanders and is the 4 th largest cause of death, with significant costs to the health system. While, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD, long-term exposure to other <b>lung</b> <b>irritants,</b> such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust can also cause and exacerbate it. Currently, we do know little what happens to the patients with COPD after they leave a doctor’s care. By learning more about patients’ movements in space and time, we can better understand the impacts of both the environment and personal mobility on the disease. This research is studying patients with COPD by using GPS-enabled smartphones, combined with the data about their spatiotemporal movements and information about their actual usage of medication in near real-time. We measure environmental data in the city, including air pollution, humidity and temperature and how this may subsequently be associated with COPD symptoms. In addition to the existing air quality monitoring network, to improve the spatial scale of our analysis, we deployed a series of low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) air quality sensors as well. The study demonstrates how health devices, smartphones and IoT sensors are becoming a part of a new health data ecosystem and how their usage could provide information about high-risk health hotspots, which, in the longer term, could lead to improvement in the quality of life for patients with COPD...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe airway {{epithelium}} is {{the first}} line of defence in the response to inhaled particles and irritants. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease characterised by an irreversible loss of lung function, with cigarette smoking as a major risk factor. Here, we address intraepithelial T-cells in COPD, as these cells are a distinct T-cell subtype thought to have important regulatory functions. We hypothesised that intraepithelial T-cells {{play a role in the}} response to <b>lung</b> <b>irritants</b> and that the T-cell populations would be altered and associated with signs of inflammation in COPD. MethodsBronchoscopy with endobronchial mucosal biopsy sampling was performed in 22 patients (mean age; 57) with stable COPD (median FEV 1 % predicted: 51). Age- and smoking- matched smokers (S) with normal lung function (n= 14) and age-matched non-smokers (NS) (n= 15) served as controls. Airway inflammation was recorded visually using bronchitis index (BI). Biopsy specimens were processed into glycol methacrylate resin and inflammatory cells were stained immunohistochemically. ResultsThe number of intraepithelial CD 4 + T-cells were significantly higher in COPD patients compared to smokers as well as trend towards significance in non-smokers (p= 0. 005 and p= 0. 036, respectively), whereas intraepithelial CD 8 + T-cells number were increased in patients with COPD compared to non-smokers (p= 0. 017). Both patients with COPD and smokers had a higher BI than non-smokers (p< 0. 001 for both). ConclusionsThe present data suggest a role for intraepithelial CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells in stable COPD and indicate that T-cells are of importance in the long-term inflammatory response in COPD or, alternatively, play a regulatory role...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} rats acutely exposed to ozone (0. 5 - 2. 0 ppm) or {{nitrogen}} dioxide (2 - 20 ppm) for 2 hr and sacrificed immediately thereafter shows little similarity {{in the individual}} biochemical effects of these pollutants. No evidence of nitrogen dioxide-induced lipid peroxidation was observed. Of interest is the finding that inhalation of nitrogen dioxide increases {{the extent to which}} concanavalin A agglutinates alveolar macrophages while ozone has exactly the opposite effect. Studies in the literature have suggested that the gaseous pollutants ozone and nitrogen dioxide have many similarities in their effects. In addition to being <b>lung</b> <b>irritants</b> producing death in pulmonary edema at high concentrations, the similarities include {{the fact that they are}} both relatively insoluble and therefore penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract. They have an almost identical effect of potentiating bacterial infections at low concentrations, in both cases apparently due to an interference in lung bacteriocidal capabilities (1 - 4). Both are oxidants and are reported to produce lipid peroxidation in vitro and in the lungs of animals inhaling relatively low concentrations of either (5 - 9). Long-term exposure to either results in pathological changes suggestive of chronic respiratory disease (10, 11). Furthermore, there is cross tolerance in that sublethal exposure to either ozone or nitrogen dioxide protects against subsequent exposure to lethal levels of both (12, 13). Although it is clear that differences also exist between ozone and nitrogen dioxide, it was believed at the inception of this part of the U. S. -U. S. S.

40|$|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), {{a growing}} health concern, {{is the fourth}} {{leading cause of death}} in the United States. While people habituated to smoking {{constitute}} the highest COPD susceptible population, people exposed to air pollution or other <b>lung</b> <b>irritants</b> also form a major group of potential COPD patients. COPD is a progressive disease that is characterized by the combination of chronic bronchitis, small airway obstruction, and emphysema that causes an overall decrease in the lung elasticity affecting the lung tissue. The current gold standard method to diagnose COPD is by pulmonary function tests (PFT) which measures the extent of COPD based on the lung volumes and is further classified into five severity stages. PFT measurements are insensitive to early stages of COPD and also its lack of reproducibility makes it hard to rely on, in assessing the disease progression. Alternatively, Pulmonary CT scans are considered as a major diagnostic tool in analyzing the COPD and CT measures are also closely related to the pathological extent of the disease. Quantification of COPD using features derived from CT images has been proven effective. The most common features are density based and texture based. We propose a new set of features called lung biomechanical features which capture the regional lung tissue deformation patterns during the respiratory cycle. We have tested these features on 75 COPD subjects and 15 normal subjects. We have done classification of COPD/Non COPD on the dataset using the three feature sets and also performed the classification all these subjects to their corresponding severity stage. It is shown that the lung biomechanical features were also able to classify COPD subjects with a good AUC. It is also shown that, by combining the best features from each feature set, there is an improvement in the classifier performance. Multiple regression analysis is performed to find the correlation between the CT derived features and PFT measurements...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Engineering Sciences (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Paraffin {{is used as}} a main {{household}} {{energy source}} for cooking, lighting and heating by low-income communities in South Africa. It is highly inflammable and spillages from paraffin can be considered as one of the major causes of fires that lead to the destruction of dwellings in the informal settlement. The situation is made worse due to the close proximity of the dwellings to each other which cause the fires to spread very quickly from one dwelling to the next leaving suffering and most often death in its wake (Schwebel et al., 2009 : 700). It has been shown by Muller et al. (2003 : 2018) that most of the informal rural communities use paraffin in non-ventilated and windowless environments and this causes major respiratory problems. The government has made a huge effort towards replacing paraffin as main cooking fuel in rural and informal settlements with ethanol gel. Ethanol gel is a healthier, safer alternative to paraffin because ethanol gel does not burn unless it is contained within a cooking device that concentrates the flame. It also fails to emit <b>lung</b> <b>irritants</b> or other dangerous chemical vapours when burned indoors (Bizzo et al., 2004 : 67). Commercial ethanol gels are manufactured with imported gelling agents that make their costs unaffordable to the rural poor communities. It is the objective of this study to determine whether gelling agents extracted from the local endemic species of cactacea viz. Opuntia fiscus-indica and Cereus Jamacaru can be used to synthesise ethanol gel comparable or better than the commercial gels. The two species chosen have been declared pests (Nel et al., 2004 : 61) and are continuously uprooted from arable land and burned by local farmers (Van Wilgen et al., 2001 : 162) This study showed that Opuntia ficas-indica stems gave a better cellulose yield (15. 0 ± 6. 7 wt. %) than Cereus Jamacaru (11. 5 ± 7. 8 wt %). Chemical composition analyses and FT-IR analyses showed that the hemicelluloses and lignin were completely removed from the extracted cellulose and the extraction was more effective for Opuntia ficasindica than for Cereus Jamacaru. Ethanol gel produced by using the extracted cellulose, as was investigated during this study, was compared to commercial gels with respect to viscosity, burn time, calorific values and residue and a good comparison was obtained.

40|$|Coughing protects and {{clears the}} airways and <b>lungs</b> of inhaled <b>irritants,</b> particulates, pathogens, and {{accumulated}} secretions. An initial urge to cough, {{and an almost}} binary output suggests gating mechanisms that encode and modulate this defensive reflex. Whether this “gate” has a physical location for the physiological barrier it poses to cough is unknown. Here we describe a critical component to cough gating, the central terminations of the cough receptors. A novel microinjection strategy defined coordinates for microinjection of glutamate receptor antagonists that nearly abolished cough evoked from the trachea and larynx in anesthetized guinea pigs while having no effect on basal respiratory rate and little or no effect on reflexes attributed to activating other afferent nerve subtypes. Comparable microinjections in adjacent brainstem locations (0. 5 – 2 mm distal) were without effect on coughing. Subsequent transganglionic and dual tracing studies confirmed that the central terminations of the cough receptors and their primary relay neurons are found bilaterally within nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), lateral to the commissural subnucleus and perhaps in the medial subnuclei. These synapses possess the physiological characteristics of a cough gate. Their localization should facilitate more mechanistic studies of the encoding and gating of cough. —Canning, B.

40|$|Bronchopulmonary C-fiber endings {{and rapidly}} {{adapting}} pulmonary receptors (RARs) are {{primarily responsible for}} eliciting the defense reflexes in protecting the <b>lungs</b> against inhaled <b>irritants.</b> In anesthetized animals, inhalation of cigarette smoke, {{one of the common}} inhaled <b>irritants,</b> into the <b>lungs</b> elicits pulmonary chemoreflexes that are mediated through the stimulation of pulmonary C fibers. When the C-fiber conduction is selectively blocked in the vagus nerves, the same smoke inhalation triggered only augmented breaths, a reflex effect of activating RARs, in the same animals. Indeed, electrophysiologic study shows that inhaled smoke exerts a direct stimulatory effect on both types of afferents. Increasing evidence indicates that the excitability of these afferents and therefore their reflex actions are enhanced by airway mucosal inflammation; one such example is the airway hyperresponsiveness induced by acute exposure to ozone. Although the mechanism underlying the inflammation-induced hypersensitivity of C-fiber endings is not fully understood, the possible involvement of local release of certain inflammatory mediators, such as histamine and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), should be considered. It is believed that changes in the membrane properties mediated by the activation of certain specific receptor proteins located on the membrane of these nerve terminals are involved, as the sensitizing effects of PGE 2 can be also demonstrated in cultured pulmonary C neurons.

40|$|Chlorination is {{the most}} popular method for {{disinfecting}} swimming pool water; however, although pathogens are being killed, many toxic compounds, called disinfection by-products (DBPs), are formed. Numerous epidemiological publications have associated the chlorination of pools with dysfunctions of the respiratory system and with some other diseases. However, the findings concerning these associations are not always consistent and have not been confirmed by toxicological studies. Therefore, the health effects from swimming in chlorinated pools and the corresponding stress reactions in organisms are unclear. In this study, we show that although the growth and behaviors of experimental rats were not affected, their health, training effects and metabolic profiles were significantly affected by a 12 -week swimming training program in chlorinated water identical to that of public pools. Interestingly, the eyes and skin are the organs that are more directly affected than the <b>lungs</b> by the <b>irritants</b> in chlorinated water; instead of chlorination, training intensity, training frequency and choking on water may be the primary factors for lung damage induced by swimming. Among the five major organs (the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys), the liver {{is the most}} likely target of DBPs. Through metabolomics analysis, the corresponding metabolic stress pathways and a defensive system focusing on taurine were presented, based on which the corresponding countermeasures can be developed for swimming athletes and for others who {{spend a lot of time}} in chlorinated swimming pools...|$|R
40|$|Respiratory {{epithelium}} is {{a highly}} integrated structure that efficiently protects <b>lungs</b> from extrinsic <b>irritants</b> thanks to rapid repair of the wound. The repair is a complex process that requires coordinated expression of networks of genes. Plausible regulators of this process are microRNAs. We investigated whether global miRNA silencing influences the epithelial repair, and whether changes in miRNA expression profile during repair are similar between two bronchial epithelial cell cultures: differentiated and undifferentiated cells. Two bronchial cell types were used: 16 HBE 14 o- and NHBE. Transfection was performed with siRNAs against Drosha and Dicer. For miRNA profiling, non-transfected cells were cultured until confluent and harvested for RNA isolation at baseline (cells before wounding) and at different time post-wounding (8, 16, 24, and 48 h). MicroRNA expression profiling was performed using TaqMan Array Human MicroRNA Card A. Target prediction was done in miRNA body map, and pathway analysis using DAVID. Cells with downregulated Drosha and Dicer demonstrated a significantly delayed wound repair in comparison to control in both cell lines. MiRNA expression profiling revealed that ten miRNAs exhibited significant changes over time after cell injury. These genes showed a similar expression pattern in both cell lines. The predicted targets of these miRNAs were then clustered by pathway analysis into six biological groups related to wound repair. Silencing of global miRNA expression confirmed that miRNAs are crucial for airway epithelial repair. Moreover, epithelial cells of two different origins demonstrated some similarities in miRNA expression pattern during wound repair, independent of differentiation stat...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The WTC {{collapse}} exposed over 300, 000 {{people to}} {{high concentrations of}} WTC-PM; particulates up to ∼ 50 mm were recovered from rescue workers' lungs. Elevated MDC and GM-CSF independently predicted subsequent lung injury in WTC-PM-exposed workers. Our hypotheses are that components of WTC dust strongly induce GM-CSF and MDC in AM; and that these two risk factors are in separate inflammatory pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Normal adherent AM from 15 subjects without WTC-exposure were incubated in media alone, LPS 40 ng/mL, or suspensions of WTC-PM(10 - 53) or WTC-PM(2. 5) at concentrations of 10, 50 or 100 µg/mL for 24 hours; supernatants assayed for 39 chemokines/cytokines. In addition, sera from WTC-exposed subjects who developed lung injury were assayed for the same cytokines. In the in vitro studies, cytokines formed two clusters with GM-CSF and MDC {{as a result of}} PM(10 - 53) and PM(2. 5). GM-CSF clustered with IL- 6 and IL- 12 (p 70) at baseline, after exposure to WTC-PM(10 - 53) and in sera of WTC dust-exposed subjects (n =  70) with WTC lung injury. Similarly, MDC clustered with GRO and MCP- 1. WTC-PM(10 - 53) consistently induced more cytokine release than WTC-PM(2. 5) at 100 µg/mL. Individual baseline expression correlated with WTC-PM-induced GM-CSF and MDC. CONCLUSIONS: WTC-PM(10 - 53) induced a stronger inflammatory response by human AM than WTC-PM(2. 5). This large particle exposure {{may have contributed to the}} high incidence of lung injury in those exposed to particles at the WTC site. GM-CSF and MDC consistently cluster separately, suggesting a role for differential cytokine release in WTC-PM injury.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{resistive}} loads applied {{at the mouth}} were compared {{to the effects of}} bronchospasm on ventilation, respiratory muscle force (occlusion pressure), and respiratory sensations in 6 normal and 11 asthmatic subjects breathing 100 % O 2. External resistive loads ranging from 0. 65 to 13. 33 cm H 2 O/liter per s were applied during both inspiration and expiration. Bronchospasm was induced by inhalation of aerosolized methacholine. Bronchospasm increased ventilation, inspiratory airflow, respiratory rate, and lowered PACO 2. External resistive loading, on the other hand, reduced respiratory rate and inspiratory flow, but left ventilation and PACO 2 unaltered. FRC increased to a greater extent with bronchospasm than external flow resistive loads. With both bronchospasm and external loading, occlusion pressure increased in proportion to the rise in resistance to airflow. However, the change in occlusion pressure produced by a given change in resistance and the absolute level of occlusion pressure at comparable levels of airway resistance were greater during bronchospasm than during external loading. These differences in occlusion pressure responses to the two forms of obstruction were not explained by differences in chemical drive or respiratory muscle mechanical advantage. Although the subjects' perception of the effort involved in breathing was heightened during both forms of obstruction to airflow, at any given level of resistance the sense of effort was greater with bronchospasm than external loading. Inputs from mechanoreceptors in the <b>lungs</b> (e. g., <b>irritant</b> receptors) and/or greater stimulation of chest wall mechanoreceptors as a result of increases in lung elastance may explain the differing responses elicited by the two forms of resistive loading...|$|R
