5|$|Sigurd Eysteinsson and Thorstein the Red {{moved on}} {{northern}} Scotland, conquering large areas variously {{described in the}} sagas as constituting all of Caithness and Sutherland and possibly including territory in Ross and even Moray during the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9th century. The Orkneyinga Saga relates how the former defeated the Pict Máel Brigte Tusk but died from an unusual post-battle injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{literacy}} in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century was particularly remarkable with {{special emphasis on}} the eradication of illiteracy. While it is feared that Birbhum {{may not be able}} to fulfill the national objective of sending all children in the age group 6–14 years to school by 2010, efforts are on in that direction.|$|E
5|$|With growing {{prosperity}} {{since the}} <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, Ireland became {{a destination for}} immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have made up {{the largest number of}} immigrants (over 150,000) from Central Europe. There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened {{year for the first time}} in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|The legendary traditions {{may also}} be in {{connection}} with the establishment of a trans-Carpathian frontier mark by the Hungarian monarchy, with its capital at Câmpulung, probably in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th century. A tomb stone belonging to {{one of the leaders of}} this formation, Count Lawrence of Câmpulung (comes Laurentius de Longo Campo), dating from the year 1300, may provide a solid chronological reference point. On the other hand, comes Laurentius may have been a one-time leader of the Saxon community in Câmpulung.|$|E
5|$|The {{little that}} is known of Mac Scelling {{suggests}} {{that he was an}} early archetype of what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E

5|$|Bjaðmunjo was a {{daughter}} of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1119). In the late eleventh century, {{following the death of}} his father, Muirchertach seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved to extend his authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland. In so doing, he gained control of the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin, and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles. There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eleventh century. What is known for sure is that, {{before the end of the}} century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region, where he held power until his death in 1103.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined {{with limited}} success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed {{in many areas}} of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana {{near the end of}} the last ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} value to the early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working and camping location is known as the Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Lead mining on Grassington Moor became {{important}} in the 18th century, {{and as a result}} of the mines' success, a number of the mine owners promoted the provision of the Grassington to Pately Bridge turnpike road, which was begun in 1760 and provided an all-weather route across the moors for wagons. From the early 19th century Hebden was a dormitory village for some miners, contributing to the population rising to more than 500 in the 1830s. In the early 1850s profitable mines were established in the parish to the north of the village on veins associated with Grassington Moor, which helped sustain the population. Although activity continued sporadically into the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, the accessible ore was largely exhausted by 1865, and the population declined to a low of 199 in 1901.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1190s, the Chronicle of Mann reveals that Cristinus, Bishop of the Isles, an Argyllman who was {{probably}} a meic Somairle candidate, was deposed and replaced by Michael (died 1203), a Manxman who {{appears to have been}} backed by Rǫgnvaldr. Cristinus' tenure appears to have spanned at least two decades, during a sustained period of meic Somairle power in the Isles. His downfall, however, came about at about time of the Crovan dynasty's resurgence under Rǫgnvaldr. The latter succeeded his father only years before, in 1187, and appears to have capitalised upon the infighting amongst the meic Somairle, and possibly even the downfall of Ragnall himself. Although the first known Bishop of Argyll, Haraldr, is accorded a tenure during {{the first quarter of the}} thirteenth century, it is likely that there were earlier bishops unknown to surviving sources. In fact, the diocese first appears on record in Liber Censuum, a Papal document dating to the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twelfth century; and it is possible that Cristinus, or an unknown successor, or perhaps even Haraldr himself, was the first dicocesan bishop. Whatever the case, Cristinus' tenure in the Isles may have witnessed an ecclesiastical reorientation, or shift of sorts, towards Argyll.|$|E
5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{concerning the}} political situation in the Isles in the <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eleventh century. What is known for sure is that, {{before the end of}} the century, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway (died 1103) led a marauding fleet from Scandinavia into the Isles, seized control of the kingdom, and held onto power in the Irish Sea region until his death in 1103. According to the Chronicle of Mann, when Guðrøðr died in 1095, Lǫgmaðr succeeded him as his eldest son, and went on to reign for seven years. The numerical calculations and chronology of this source are suspect, and it is uncertain if Lǫgmaðr's reign began before Magnús' arrival, during Magnús' overlordship, or even after Magnús' death. One possibility is that Lǫgmaðr commenced his reign in the Isles immediately after his father assumed the kingship of Dublin in 1091. If so, this transfer of power would seem to evidence the eminent status of Dublin's kinship amongst the Norse-Gaelic elite.|$|E
