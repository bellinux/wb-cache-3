5|$|After {{some months}} of <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> discussion, Harvard's ruling body, the Harvard Corporation, {{announced}} on May 8, 1933, {{that it had}} elected Conant as the next President of Harvard. Alfred North Whitehead, Harvard's eminent professor of philosophy disagreed with the decision, declaring: Clark was very much responsible for Conant's election.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{chose not}} to seek a fifth term in 1998, and retired to Owensboro. He worked for a time as a {{consultant}} to Washington <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> law firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky. At the time of his retirement, Ford was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. In January 2009, Mitch McConnell surpassed Ford's mark of 24 years in the Senate.|$|E

5|$|After his defeat, McEwen {{remained}} {{active in}} politics, but press accounts said {{he spent most}} of his time in the Washington, D.C., area residing in northern Virginia. Since 1997, he has been a partner with eleven other former Members of Congress in the Washington firm Advantage Associates, a <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> consulting firm. He founded FreedomQuest International, an international investment banking firm based in Washington, D.C. McEwen took to the lecture circuit, delivering speeches for $10,000 apiece. During the 2004 presidential election, McEwen traveled widely to speak for George W. Bush, focusing on Ohio. In 2006, he joined the law firm of Greenebaum, Doll, and McDonald as a consultant in its Cincinnati and Washington offices.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{appointment}} of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> back room maneuvers {{were not considered}} to qualify him for his office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies were delighted {{at the prospect of}} connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, the Senate voted to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|In late 1964 the RAN {{sought the}} Government's {{approval}} to upgrade Melbourne and purchase {{a force of}} 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended {{to be used to}} provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical task for the FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered would be more effective in this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{proposed}} to open negotiations with Spain {{on the basis}} of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation on Cuba began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million. McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his <b>lobbying,</b> <b>and</b> that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the Senate voted in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.|$|E

5|$|Nearly razed to {{the ground}} in 1960 along with other {{buildings}} on Lafayette Square, successful <b>lobbying</b> <b>and</b> support from the newly elected Kennedy administration in 1961 led to the original proposals to gut the building being dropped. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was instrumental in persuading architect John Carl Warnecke, a friend of her husband, to create a design that would incorporate the new buildings with the old, based on the architectural theory of contextualism. The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and a courtyard built between them and the National Courts building. The building has remained part of the National Courts Building complex ever since, and is now protected by the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

40|$|This {{training}} of four days focussed on two areas of capacity {{development of the}} home-based care (HBC) alliance in Malawi and Zambia: 1. Communities of Change (CoC) concept and practice linked to the Multi Stakeholder Process (MSP), <b>and</b> 2. <b>Lobby</b> & Advocacy (L&A). Since June 2010 Cordaid started together with the Centre of Development Innovation (CDI) a learning and development process on the Communities of Change concept and practice linked to the Multi Stakeholder Process with around 75 persons of her staff. In order to share and deepen {{the development of the}} COC & MSP concepts and practice further with the partners in the field, Cordaid organised this training. An effective working Alliance/CoC is a condition for effective <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> advocacy. Therefore the CoC - MSP part of the training was directly linked to the part on <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> advocacy. The <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> advocacy trajectory had been started already three years ago with an initial training (also in Malawi) specifically on <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> advocacy for home based care representatives of eight countries in Africa, amongst other Malawi and Zambia. The current training on <b>lobby</b> <b>and</b> advocacy is therefore also part of the follow up of that process...|$|R
