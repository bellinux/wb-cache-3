25|$|From its inception, the {{lighthouse}} was closely connected to Cape Cleveland Light. Both lighthouses were recommend, approved, tendered and finally, in December 1879, constructed together.The <b>light</b> <b>went</b> through two upgrades in the 1920s replacing both the oil lamp {{and the fourth}} order lens with an incandescent gas mantle and a new lens. In 1983 the light was converted to solar power, and finally in 1987 it was demanned.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 30 {{seconds after}} Flight 420's request to return, control {{problems}} started to occur. The aircraft became harder {{to control and}} a warning indicator showed that an engine problem was developing. 40 seconds later, the wing overheat warning system was illuminated. Before the crew had conducted the checklist for handling such an emergency, the warning <b>light</b> <b>went</b> off. 5 minutes later the left engine appeared to be on fire. The crew later shut down the engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, the Dutch {{botanist}} Frits Warmolt Went {{showed that}} a chemical messenger diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards <b>light.</b> <b>Went</b> cut {{the tips of the}} coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centred on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.|$|E

500|$|Canada won game seven by {{the score}} of 4–3. In {{the first period}} Phil Esposito scored two goals around a pair by Yakushev and Petrov, ending the first period tied 2–2. The second period was scoreless. In the third, Gilbert put Canada ahead, but Yakushev scored again to tie the score at three. At 17:54, Henderson fooled Soviet defender Tsygankov with a pass through Tsygankov's feet, then skated around Tsygankov {{to pick up the}} puck and break in on Tretiak. As Henderson shot and scored, Tsygankov tripped Henderson and Henderson did not see his shot go in. The goal <b>light</b> <b>went</b> on and off quickly and Team Canada rushed onto the ice to congratulate Henderson before there was any doubt raised about the goal. The Soviet coach Bobrov {{publicly}} blamed the loss on Tsygankov. After the game, Henderson commented about the goal as the [...] "one that gave him his most personal satisfaction ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Guided {{by similar}} motivations as his former partner, Foucault in 1850 was more {{interested}} in settling the particle-versus-wave debate than in determining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light. Foucault measured the differential speed of light through air versus water by inserting a tube filled with water between the rotating mirror and the distant mirror. His experimental results, announced shortly before Fizeau announced his results on the same topic, were viewed as [...] "driving the last nail in the coffin" [...] of Newton's corpuscle theory of light when it showed that light travels more slowly through water than through air. Newton had explained refraction as a pull of the medium upon the light, implying an increased speed of light in the medium. The corpuscular theory of <b>light</b> <b>went</b> into abeyance, completely overshadowed by wave theory. This state of affairs lasted until 1905, when Einstein presented heuristic arguments that under various circumstances, such as when considering the photoelectric effect, light exhibits behaviors indicative of a particle nature.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the last}} straw {{may have been the}} {{controversial}} elections of 1988.

The counting system [...] "fell" [...] because coincidentally the <b>light</b> <b>went</b> out and suddenly, when it returned, the winning candidate was Salinas, even though Cárdenas had the upper hand.|$|E
2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the <b>light</b> <b>went</b> off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|E
