It identifies a reference area on a kilometric grid provided by the EEA (European Environmental Agency) in which falls the site developing a series of maps of the territory (primarily land use according to a standardized methodology of survey and habitat monitoring, the Biohab) even three-dimensional, going to attribute all the general information on the area covered by Schedule ISPRA for Geosite that already allow a framework of the whole environment in which the works are placed and providing a fundamental geotouristic tool. Specifically were then detected the individual works by creating a thematic and detailed itinerary created with professional page layout software that are reported on a special website and can be downloaded directly on site by Qr-Code. In this itinerary, especially linked to the survey and enjoyment, however, did not want to overlook another concept applied to cultural heritage, in which these tools are increasingly applied, the restoration. Although the restoration of environmental Installations, Site Specific and works of Land Art, does not always proceed with classical methods, it is often desirable and necessary to maintain their <b>legibility</b> <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and preserve their inseparable relationship between works of art and natural landscape...|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to make sense of shifts in the social {{movement}} sector and its relationship to conventional politics over the past forty years, some have proposed that Western nations are increasingly becoming “movement societies. ” Accordingly, there are four key characteristics of the movement society: (1) <b>over</b> <b>time</b> expansion of protest; (2) <b>over</b> <b>time</b> diffusion of protest; (3) <b>over</b> <b>time</b> institutionalization of protest; and (4) <b>over</b> <b>time</b> institutionalization of state responses to protest. Using newly available data on over 19, 000 protest events occurring in the U. S. between 1960 and 1986, we evaluate these four claims.

40|$|Abstract. We study Nash equilibria in {{the context}} of flows <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> Many results on static routing games have been {{obtained}} over the last ten years. In flows <b>over</b> <b>time</b> (also called dynamic flows), flow travels through a network <b>over</b> <b>time</b> and, as a consequence, flow values on edges are time-dependent. This more realistic setting has not been tackled from the viewpoint of algorithmic game theory yet; but there is a rich literature on game theoretic aspects of flows <b>over</b> <b>time</b> in the traffic community. We present a novel characterization of Nash equilibria for flows <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> It turns out that Nash flows <b>over</b> <b>time</b> {{can be seen as a}} concatena-tion of special static flows. The underlying flow <b>over</b> <b>time</b> model is the so-called deterministic queuing model that is very popular in road traffic simulation and related fields. Based upon this, we prove the first known results on the price of anarchy for flows <b>over</b> <b>time.</b> ...|$|R
