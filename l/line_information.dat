50|$|The Loop Maintenance Operations System (LMOS) is a {{telephone}} company trouble ticketing system to coordinate repairs of local loops (telephone lines). When {{a problem is}} reported to the Centralized Repair Service Answering Bureau (CRSAB) by a subscriber dialing the designated number (often (1)+611), it is filed and relayed through the Cross Front End, which is a link from the CRSAB to the LMOS network. The trouble report is then sent to the Front End via the Datakit network, where a Basic Output Report is requested (usually by a lineman).

50|$|The Borivali Railway Station is a {{terminus}} for all slow, semi-fast {{and fast}} trains on the Mumbai Suburban Railway system of Maharashtra state, India. It {{also serves as}} the final city-limit stop for all mail and express trains on Western Railway before leaving Mumbai. As of 2006, there were plans to extend the Harbour Line to Borivali, and expansion plans are in full steam at the railway station. Borivali caters to almost 2.87 lakhs passengers everyday and is the busiest station on the western suburban line of Mumbai. Contrary to popular perception that stations such as Mumbai Central or Churchgate would be the busiest on the Western <b>line,</b> <b>information</b> obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act reveals that Borivali station is the most crowded with around 2.87 lakh passengers travelling from there daily. The number of passengers descending on Borivali is much higher compared to other stations as {{a large number of}} commuters from adjoining stations come here to catch a train as it is impossible to board a local train from stations such as Dahisar, Kandivali or Malad. Renovation work currently under way at the station is only adding to the woes of passengers.|$|E
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{importance and}} utilization of 'party line' information by air carrier flight crews was investigated through pilot surveys and a flight simulation study. The Importance, Availability, and Accuracy of party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> elements were explored through surveys of pilots of several operational types. The survey identified numerous traffic and weather party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> elements which were considered important. These elements were scripted into a full-mission flight simulation which examined {{the utilization of}} party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> by studying subject responses to specific information element stimuli. The awareness of the different Party Line elements varied, and awareness was also affected by pilot workload. In addition, pilots were aware of some traffic information elements, but were reluctant to act on Party <b>Line</b> <b>Information</b> alone. Finally, the importance of party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> appears to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution should be exercised when implementing datalink communications in tower and close-in terminal control sectors...|$|E
40|$|Air/ground digital {{datalink}} communications are {{an integral}} component of the FAA's Air Traffic Control (ATC) modernization strategy. With the introduction of datalink into the ATC system, there is concern over the potential loss of situational awareness by flight crews due to {{the reduction in the}} "party line" information available to the pilot. "Party line" information is gleaned by flight crews overhearing communications between ATC and other aircraft. In the datalink environment, party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> may not be available due to the use of discrete addressing. Information concerning the importance, availability, and accuracy of party line elements was explored through an opinion survey of active air carrier flight crews. The survey identified numerous important party line elements. These elements were scripted into a full-mission flight simulation. The flight simulation experiment examined the utilization of party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> by studying subject responses to the specific information elements. Some party line elements perceived as important were effectively utilized by flight crews in the simulated operational environment. However, other party line elements stimulated little or no increase in situational awareness. The ability to assimilate and use party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> appeared to be dependent on workload, time availability, and the tactical/strategic nature of the situations. In addition, the results of both the survey and the simulation indicated that the importance of party <b>line</b> <b>information</b> appeared to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution must be exercised when implementing datalink communications in these high workload, tactical sectors. This document is based on the thesis of Alan H. Midkiff submitted in partial fulfillment of the degree of Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to explore {{the use of a}} {{combination}} of line and point correspondences to improve the computation of homography transformations. The rink registration aspect of the UBC Hockey Tracking System currently uses only keypoint matches between frames leaving the <b>line</b> <b>information</b> on the rink unutilized. The hypothesis is that use of <b>line</b> <b>information</b> will help make the homography calculation more robust, especially in a closeup situation where not many keypoints are visible. The current system uses the normalized DLT (Direct Linear Transform) algorithm to calculate homographies from point correspondences that are acquired using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracker. A RANSAC algorithm is used to prune outlier correspondences from the calculation. Both the DLT and RANSAC algorithms are extended to use line correspondences as well as points. Experimental results are presented for a simple chessboard image. Rink registration for the hockey system is not yet improved due to a weakness in the DLT algorithm regarding normalization. ...|$|E
