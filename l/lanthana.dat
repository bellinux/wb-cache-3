40|$|The {{focus of}} this work has been the {{connection}} between structure and particle size for precious metals supported on rare-earth oxides. First, the adsorption properties of small Pd particles were studied {{as a function of}} their size via 15 NO, CO and H 2 adsorption. CO and H 2 adsorption on Pd were found to be independent of particle size. In contrast, NO adsorption was found to be strongly structure sensitive; the main desorption product following NO adsorption on small particles was N 2, at temperatures higher than 600 K, while large particles and Pd single crystals did not dissociate NO. ^ The role of ceria structure on the catalytic properties of supported metals was probed using adsorption and computer simulations, and the size of ceria crystallites was shown to dramatically influence the oxygen donation capability of ceria, with small crystallites being the most active. TPD studies of CO on precious metals supported on ceria showed CO 2 desorption only when the ceria support consisted of small crystallites. Steady-state CO oxidation rates were also significantly different when the ceria support consisted of small crystallites. Simulated annealing calculations confirmed that ceria reducibility is a strong function of crystallite size, with very small ceria clusters exhibiting large fluctuations in the energy required for oxygen removal as a function of cluster size, resembling the 2 ̆ 2 magic numbers 2 ̆ 2 observed on metals. ^ Finally, experimental evidence was found for the surface of polycrystalline <b>lanthana</b> films to be reducible in CO, especially in the presence of noble metals. Reduced <b>lanthana</b> can adsorb and decompose NO in a temperature range similar to that observed for Pt and Rh. Substantial amounts of the NO on reduced <b>lanthana</b> react to form N 2 and N 2 O. However, as for ceria, high-temperature annealing results in deactivation of <b>lanthana.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{desorption}} and steady-state CO oxidation {{measurements were}} performed on model catalysts {{to gain a better}} understanding of the redox properties of oxygen-storage components in three-way, automotive-emissions-control catalysts. The interactions of these components with group VIII metals, and the effect of those interactions on catalytic properties, was also examined. ^ Thermal desorption of O 2 was used to probe directly the oxidation and reduction of ceria, the primary oxygen-storage component used in emissions-control catalysts. For the first time, it was shown that there is a weakly bound form of lattice oxygen on small ceria crystallites, not found on inactive forms of ceria, and that this species of oxygen results in the enhanced CO oxidation activity of ceria-supported metals. Furthermore, interactions with zirconia, which is known to promote ceria in commercial catalysts, were found to greatly increase the fraction of weakly bound oxygen on ceria, as well as the CO oxidation activity. Metal-support interactions, unique to single-crystalline ceria and Rh, were found to promote unusually high CO dissociation activity. Insights gained from these measurements were used to design a novel, ceria-based anode for a solid-oxide fuel cell which could oxidize methane directly, with performance comparable to that obtained using hydrogen. ^ In addition to ceria, the catalytic properties of other reducible oxides, praseodymia and <b>lanthana,</b> were examined to determine the potential of these oxides as oxygen-storage components. While it was determined that praseodymia likely cannot be utilized in its pure form due to slow reoxidation, the results provided further insights into why ceria-based mixed oxides are such effective oxygen-storage components. While <b>lanthana</b> is normally considered to be non-reducible, <b>lanthana</b> could be reduced in CO and could promote the steady-state reduction of NO by CO. However, like ceria, the ability of <b>lanthana</b> to promote redox chemistry is dependent on its structure. ^ Finally, the interaction of oxygen with Rh, Pt, and Pd was studied as a function of particle size. Desorption from Pt and Pd was found to be strongly structure sensitive, whereas desorption from Rh was roughly independent of particle size. ...|$|E

However, CO 2 is recognised as an abundant, cheap, recyclable and non-toxic carbon source and thus its utilisation for the production of value-added chemicals is extremely beneficial for the chemical industry.

Styrene carbonate {{can be used as a}} solvent for lithium battery because of its high polarity property. Several reaction routes have been attempted for styrene carbonate production, which was phosgene, oxidative carboxylation, direct synthesis using homogeneous catalyst and direct synthesis using a heterogeneous catalyst. The latter being the most attractive route due to the inexpensive raw material, ease of catalyst recovery and the avoidance of corrosive reagents, such as phosgene and dimethyl formamide. The research study is aimed at catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2) to value added chemicals as to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in order to prevent global warming. The utilisation of carbon dioxide will not only offer one of the means to prevent global warming but also offer a mean of value-added chemicals such as fuel additives, substitute for various chemical reagents, organic solvent and green reagents.

A vapor phase apparatus was designed, fabricated, and calibrated through 1800 C. Vapor phase reactions were analyzed, calculations made, and powders of alumina, rutile, zinc orthotitanate (in a mixed phase), calcium tungstate, and <b>lanthana</b> were produced by homogeneous nucleation. Electron microscopy shows uniform particle morphology and size, and supports anticipated advantages of vapor-phase homogeneous nucleation; namely, purity, freedom from defects, and uniform particle sizing without grinding...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of methane, ethane and ethylene {{has been investigated}} either in an empty reactor or {{in the presence of}} a series of calcium-based catalysts including unpromoted calcium oxide (C), calcium oxide promoted with lanthane (LC) and with both <b>lanthana</b> and strontium oxide (SLC). It was found that these solids inhibit the gas-phase oxidation of ethylene, probably by trapping chain-carrier radicals. At T> 1000 K, the inhibiting effectiveness varies in the order C<LC<SLC which parallels the C 2 + yield sequence in the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). This strongly suggests that the inhibiting effect, thus observed in separate experiments, is operating in OCM conditions, preventing ethylene from further degradation. This sequence is also found to be similar to that of the strong basicity bf solids as deduced from the temperature of CO 2 desorption, indicating that this inhibiting effect might be related to the basicity of the catalyst. Finally the beneficial role of each components in the optimized catalyst (SLC) is discussed: <b>lanthana</b> might be an inhibitor of methyl radical or methane oxidation into CO, calcium oxide a promoter of ethane dehydrogenation into ethylene and strontium oxide might play the role of an inhibitor of the gas-phase oxidation of ethylene.

40|$|Based on the {{information}} provided in patents assigned to Gulf, Shell, Exxon, and Statoil, a series of catalysts has been prepared consisting of 12 [...] 20 wt. % cobalt, a second metal promoter (Ru or Re), and an oxide promoter such as <b>lanthana,</b> zirconia, or alkali oxide, the support being alumina, silica, or titania. All catalysts have been extensively characterized by different methods. The catalysts have been evaluated {{in terms of their}} activity, selectivity both in a fixed bed reactor and in a slurry bubble column reactor, and the results correlated with their physico-chemical properties...|$|E
