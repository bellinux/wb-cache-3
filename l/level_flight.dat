5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:13pm, the aircraft's {{tail section}} sustained a sudden upward movement, significant enough to require trimming {{to bring the}} plane back to <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport. FBI agents, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and Reno police surrounded the jet, as it {{had not yet been}} determined with certainty that Cooper was no longer aboard; but an armed search quickly confirmed that he was gone.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E

5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the airspeed or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|One E {{aircraft}} (AF Serial No. 56-0632) {{was modified}} as a testbed for various B-52 systems. Redesignated NB-52E, the aircraft was fitted with canards and a Load Alleviation and Mode Stabilization system (LAMS) which reduced airframe fatigue from wind gusts during low <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> In one test, the aircraft flew 10knots (11.5mph, 18.5km/h) {{faster than the}} never exceed speed without damage because the canards eliminated 30% of vertical and 50% of horizontal vibrations caused by wind gusts.|$|E
5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, but {{they were unable to}} resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{made its}} first flight in July 1923. During initiate flight tests, an automobile towed the Cyleplane {{into the air and}} released it. Afterward Gerhardt was able to maintain stable, <b>level</b> <b>flights</b> for short periods of time.|$|R

5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence of water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks for the presence of water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-20 was a Soviet {{prototype}} for a heavily armored ground-attack aircraft {{to replace the}} Ilyushin Il-10. It featured a number of innovative concepts including a cockpit mounted {{on top of the}} engine, directly behind the propeller, and wing-mounted autocannon that could be adjusted on the ground to fire level or depressed 23° to allow the aircraft to strafe ground targets while remaining in <b>level</b> <b>flight.</b> However it was slower than the Il-10, and its M-47 engine was problematic in flight tests in 1948–49. It was not placed into production. The test pilots called the aircraft the Gorbach (Hunchback).|$|E
5|$|Nagatos {{presence}} at Yokosuka was {{revealed to the}} Allies by photographs taken during the 10July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> needed to launch torpedoes against her would suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E
50|$|The 707 cruised at <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 310 {{for about}} two hours, after which it was cleared for descent to <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 110. <b>Flight</b> <b>level</b> 110 was reached at {{approximately}} 09:23, and clearance was granted to begin descent towards a target of <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 70. Just before 09:30, clearance to descend to 6000 ft was granted, and moments later the plane was cleared to make a visual approach to runway 10. A few minutes later, witnesses saw the entire right horizontal stabiliser and elevator assembly detach from the aircraft. The aircraft subsequently lost pitch control and entered a nose-dive from about 800 ft to ground level, destroying the aircraft on impact.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium, its {{zones of}} {{activities}} {{extend up to}} <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 245 (24500 ft), including {{the control of the}} airports of Brussels, Charleroi, Liege, Antwerp and Ostend.In the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, they apply between <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> 145 or 165 up to <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 245.|$|R
50|$|The {{particular}} {{route to}} be flown determines the ground distance to cover, while winds on that route determine the air distance to be flown. Each inter-waypoint portion of an airway {{may have different}} rules as to which <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> may be used. Total aircraft weight at any point determines the highest <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> which can be used. Cruising at a higher <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> generally requires less fuel than at a lower <b>flight</b> <b>level,</b> but extra climb fuel {{may be needed to}} get up to the higher <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> (it is this extra climb fuel and the different fuel consumption rate that cause discontinuities).|$|R
5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by {{deficiencies in the}} Yugoslav aeronautical industry which had resulted {{in a mixture of}} foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es in mock dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable in <b>level</b> <b>flight,</b> enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E
5|$|K5054 {{was fitted}} with a new propeller, and Summers flew the {{aircraft}} on 10 March 1936; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight, a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire {{was a very good}} aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330mph (528km/h), little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348mph (557km/h) in <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> in mid-May, when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath and handed the aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). Here, Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF. He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing. Edwardes-Jones' report was positive; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator. A week later, on 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, before any formal report had been issued by the A&AEE. Interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis.|$|E
5|$|The P-40s {{were better}} armored and faster in <b>level</b> <b>flight</b> than the Japanese fighters {{they were up}} against, mostly Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes, and could outdive them. On the other hand, the Japanese fighters had greater range, could outclimb the P-40, and were far more maneuverable. For an American P-40 pilot, risking a dogfight with a Japanese fighter was {{practically}} suicidal. Wurtsmith attempted to develop tactics that would exploit {{the strengths of the}} P-40 and minimize its weaknesses. The two-plane element was fixed as the chief unit of combat, and individual dogfighting was strictly prohibited. The P-40s would attempt to dive into a Japanese formation, attack, and then continue diving at a speed the Japanese fighters could not match. Above all, Wurtsmith attempted {{to make sure that he}} had enough P-40s in commission to outnumber the Japanese. The efforts of the ground crews and service troops made this possible. By May 1942, he had lost seven P-40s and three pilots while claiming the destruction of 38 Japanese aircraft. The heaviest Japanese attack had been by nine fighters and 24 bombers, which Wurtsmith had met with 50 P-40s; the P-40 pilots claimed 11 Japanese aircraft shot down. May was the first month that passed without a raid since January but the Japanese returned on four consecutive days in June, with three of these raids consisting of 18 to 20 fighters and 27 bombers. That month nine P-40s and 13 Japanese aircraft were lost. Wurtsmith was promoted to colonel on 6 July 1942. Between March 1942 and January 1943, his fighters claimed to have downed 78 enemy aircraft.|$|E
