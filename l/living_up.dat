5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are equivalent to that of humans, with male orcas <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to 75 years and female orcas <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to 80 years.|$|E

50|$|Church ministers {{were confronted}} with a stark choice: accept the new {{situation}} or lose their <b>livings.</b> <b>Up</b> {{to a third of}} the ministry refused. Many ministers chose voluntarily to abandon their own parishes rather than wait to be forced out by the government. Most of the vacancies occurred in the south-west of Scotland, an area particularly strong in its Covenanting sympathies. Some of the ministers also took to preaching in the open fields in conventicles, often attracting thousands of worshippers.|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{the first}} Broken Sword game, which {{garnered}} critical acclaim, The Smoking Mirror received mixed to positive reviews, mostly for not <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to its predecessor.

5|$|At the {{juvenile}} stage, a teleost {{looks more like}} its adult form. At this stage, its axial skeleton, internal organs, scales, pigmentation and fins are fully developed. The transition from larvae to juvenile can be short and fairly simple, lasting minutes or hours as in some damselfish, while in other species, like salmon, squirrelfish, gobies and flatfishes, the transition is more complex and takes several weeks to complete. At the adult stage, a teleost is able to produce viable gametes for reproduction. Like many fish, teleosts continue to grow throughout their lives. Longevity depends on the species with some gamefish like European perch and largemouth bass <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to 25 years. Rockfish {{appear to be the}} longest living teleosts with some species living over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|First {{announced}} at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, the episode was written by Artie Johann and Shawn Ries, and directed by Brian Iles. The episode received mixed reviews, praising its structure and humor, but criticizing it for not <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, which the episode was named after. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 7.14 million people in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Ralph Garman, Bob Gunton, Sanaa Lathan, Julius Sharpe, and Jennifer Tilly, along with several recurring guest voice actors from the series.|$|E
5|$|In {{the street}} outside the theatre a street {{carnival}} took place. <b>Living</b> <b>up</b> to the moniker for the theater's marquee, “the Magic Sign of a Wonderful Time,” spotlights scanned the night sky, banks of Klieg lights illuminated the streets outside the theater, and flares were shot from the roofs of nearby buildings. Additionally, dance bands were placed at the closed intersections to provide entertainment and, using giant screens to project the words, a sing-along was orchestrated on Fifth Avenue {{in front of the}} theatre. An estimated crowd of between 50,000 and 100,000 people participated in the events.|$|E

5|$|Termites {{are among}} the most {{successful}} groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to the NASA Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
5|$|The rolls {{were all}} of roughly the same length, about 5.5m (15ft), and would most likely have been {{presented}} side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall. The {{focal point of the}} whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the Galley Subtle is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the pinnace Mary James in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed {{at the beginning of the}} third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths. In his pursuit of <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony.|$|E

5|$|Watts' {{performances}} in the championships saw him recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 AFL draft at seventeen years of age, a year younger than most of his fellow draftees. The hype surrounding Watts {{in his first season}} was profound until he made his debut in the Queen's Birthday clash against Collingwood in the 2009 season. The management of his debut has led to long-term criticism of the club because he was played despite being unready for senior football. Instead, Watts was used as a promotional tool {{to create a sense of}} hope for long-suffering fans. Criticism has followed Watts closely throughout his career due to the expectations that were placed on him being the number one draft pick and many believing he was not <b>living</b> <b>up</b> to his potential.|$|E
