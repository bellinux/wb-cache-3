50|$|Several efforts can {{be carried}} out to {{increase}} the materials' ability to withstand a more aggressive dry-out. They involve incorporating <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point <b>fibers,</b> such as polypropylene, or oxidizing metallic powders (e.g. aluminium powder) to provide permeable paths to deliver the vapor to the atmosphere, thereby relieving the internal pressure. Another option is to mechanically reinforce the microstructure so the material can dissipate enough energy with the beginning of crack growth, avoiding explosion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{advances}} in technology have driven people for seeking {{ways to improve the}} quality of their living environment. While excessive noise is more likely to affect people physically and psychologically such as tiredness, dulling of the senses, lack of concentration, and reduction in work efficiency, etc, therefore, noise suppression has become an important research issue. In this research, 7 D polyester staple fiber and 4 D <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point <b>fiber</b> have been used to fabricate the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fabric through the process of opening, blending, carding lining, lapping, and needle-punching. Meanwhile, the contents of low-melting point polyester fiber ar...|$|R
30|$|Barrier {{materials}} {{constructed of}} natural fibers (e.g., cotton) often produce a fire blocking char upon exposure to heat and/or flames. Cellulosic fabrics require chemical treatment (e.g., boric acid) {{in order to}} yield excellent fire resistance. FR treatment {{can be applied to}} the final fabric as a coating, or FR chemicals can be introduced during fiber formation to alter the polymer structure (e.g., FR rayon fiber with polysilicic acid backbone). The FR rayon is generally used in upholstered furniture applications when combined with modacrylics, aramids, and wool fibers. For mattress applications, FR rayon fibers are usually blended with polyester fibers to form highloft battings. When exposed to heat, the FR rayon decomposes endothermically and forms a silicate-containing protective char ([Horrocks 1996]). The <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> polyester <b>fiber</b> <b>melts</b> holds the protective char in place ([Dennis ML 2999]).|$|R

Therefore, this study uses polylactide <b>fiber</b> (PLA) and <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point polylactide <b>fiber</b> (LPLA) to make sound absorbent PLA/LPLA plates, after which the tensile strength, softness, and sound absorption of the plates are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} is to make a composite of sufficient strength from glass <b>fibers</b> using <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> polyester or bicomponent (polyester/polyethylene sheath/core) fibers as binder fibers for nonwoven preforms. A wet-laid hydroentangled sheet consisting of a blend of glass and <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> binder <b>fibers</b> is used to make compression molded composite. An appropriate white water recipe for dispersing glass and binder fibers was obtained after personal conversation with Owens Corning Company and after image analysis of the trial sheets. The amount of defects in the fabric was analyzed and optimum time of dispersion was established. 6 layers of wet lay sheets were stacked and hydroentangled to get a high weight per unit length single hydroentangled sheet that is then heat pressed. When heat pressed, the binder fibers in the blend melt, adhere to the glass fibers and form a composite. These composites were tested for stiffness, toughness and flexural strength. An instron machine was used for tensile and 4 -point bending tests. Stress strain curves were obtained and the secant modulus at breaking strain was determined. The area under the curve was measured determine the toughness of the material. The tensile strength and toughnes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, Tencel staple <b>fibers</b> and PET <b>low</b> <b>melting</b> point <b>fibers</b> (LMPET) were blended {{to prepare}} {{composite}} nonwovens, with change of blending ratio of Tencel/LMPET, hot-baking time and temperature. By measurement of mechanical properties, the optimal parameters {{were found to}} become dressing covering material after analysis of experimental data, with adjustment of strength, breathability and flexibility of nonwovens. During membrane preparation, 3 % chitosan solution was exposed to UV ray for 1, 3, 5 minutes, and then manufactured into membrane by Freeze Dryer, in order to explore broken bond whether happened on chitosan structure and to further manage chitosan membrane degradation rate. With analysis of UV irradiation time influencing on membrane releasing, membrane at the same size was immersed in PBS for degradation test. According to mechanical and degradation results, it is showed that, 100 % Tencel nonwovens had better breathability and strength than that mixed with 30 % LMPET, and membrane had the most stable degradation rate after 5 min irradiation of chitosan solution. Finally, using most stable chitosan and Tencel nonwovens, Tencel / Chitosan composite dressing fabric was compounded by coating...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{viscosity}} of polymer <b>melts,</b> the <b>fiber</b> diameters are usually slightly larger than those obtained from solution electrospinning. The fiber uniformity upon achieving stable flow rates and thermal equilibrium, tends to be very good. The whipping instability which is the predominant stage in which the fiber is stretched for spinning from solutions can be absent from the process due to the <b>low</b> <b>melt</b> conductivity and high viscosity of the melt. The most significant factors which affect the fiber size {{tend to be the}} feed rate, the molecular weight of the polymer and the diameter of the spinneret. Fiber sizes ranging from ~250 nm to several hundreds of micrometers have been created thus far with the lower sizes being achieved using low molecular weight polymers.|$|R
