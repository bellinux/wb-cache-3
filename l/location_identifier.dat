The proposed scheme aims at decoupling object identification from location and is designed to operate with status-quo Internet routing. We showcase the proposed naming scheme implemented on the ns- 3 network simulator and demonstrate that nodes are able to receive messages in both infrastructure-based and infrastructure-less networks despite frequent disconnections and changing <b>location</b> <b>identifiers</b> (i. e., IP address), while visiting different networks.
