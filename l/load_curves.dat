2500|$|A high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25°C cell temperature, {{may produce}} 0.60V {{open-circuit}} (VOC). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25°C air temperature, {{will probably be}} close to 45°C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55V per cell. The voltage drops modestly, {{with this type of}} cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (ISC). Maximum power (with 45°C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43V in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current. This output can be up to 70% of the VOC x ISC product. The short-circuit current (ISC) from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (VOC) may drop only 10% with an 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2VOC at 1/2ISC. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the VOC x ISC product to 50% or even as little as 25%. Vendors who rate their solar cell [...] "power" [...] only as VOC x ISC, without giving <b>load</b> <b>curves,</b> can be seriously distorting their actual performance.|$|E

Currently, the prediction of these injuries is limited to peak linear and angular acceleration <b>loading</b> <b>curves</b> derived from laboratory reconstructions. However it remains unclear as to what aspect of these <b>loading</b> <b>curves</b> contributes to brain tissue damage. This research will use the University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model (UCDBTM) to analyze three distinct <b>loading</b> <b>curve</b> shapes meant to represent different helmet loading scenarios. The <b>loading</b> <b>curves</b> were applied independently in each axis of linear and angular acceleration, and their effect on currently used predictors of TBI and mTBI. <b>Loading</b> <b>curve</b> shape A had a late time to peak, B an early time to peak and C had a consistent plateau.

The quality of <b>load</b> <b>curve</b> data, however, is hard to guarantee since the data is subject to communication losses, meter malfunctions, and many other impacts.

Furthermore, we introduce algorithms to build the virtual portrait <b>load</b> <b>curve</b> data, and demonstrate its application on <b>load</b> <b>curve</b> data cleansing.

Since this approach includes variations in the demand of specific end use appliances only as changes in the annual totals, it neglects future changes in the hourly demand structure (e. g. through efficiency measures {{or the use of}} new appliances).

40|$|This paper proposes {{and compares}} feature {{construction}} and calibration methods for clustering daily electricity <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> Such <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> describe electricity demand {{over a period}} of time. A rich body of the literature has studied clustering of <b>load</b> <b>curves,</b> usually using temporal features. This limits the potential to discover new knowledge, which may not be best represented as models consisting of all time points on <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> This paper presents three new methods to construct features: 1) conditional filters on time-resolution-based features; 2) calibration and normalization; and 3) using profile errors. These new features extend the potential of clustering <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> Moreover, smart metering is now generating high-resolution time series, and so the dimensionality reduction offered by these features is welcome. The clustering results using the proposed new features are compared with clusterings obtained from temporal features, as well as clusterings with Fourier features, using household electricity consumption time series as test data. The experimental results suggest that the proposed feature construction methods offer new means for gaining insight in energy-consumption patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} and update <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> for Fortum Distribution AB. Theload curve method is a tool used to forecast the strain of an electric grid. The method is based oncustomer annual energy consumption, outdoors temperature as well as customer category. Theload curve method was established by Svenska Elverksföreningen {{at the start of}} the nineties andfocus was put on standardizing annual energyconsumption, in order to make the method usableacross the nation. Present consumption patterns have changed since the original <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> wereproduced, which leads to a need to update the <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> The work began with an update of present <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> according to recommendation taken fromanother earlier thesis. Thereafter a forecast model was produced in Excel to calculate the strainfor one customer, using the new <b>load</b> <b>curves.</b> The updated <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> were computed into theFortum network calculation software to be used in the calculations of the outgoing feeders indistribution stations in four geographically different areas in Sweden. The calculations were madethe third Wednesday in January of both 2013 and 2014. The day is arbitrarily chosen. Calculatedvalues were compared to measured hourly values of feeders in distribution stations of the sameday. An acceptable border for calculated values is determined by Fortum to plus/minus 10 % inrelation to observed values. Network calculations with the updated <b>load</b> <b>curves</b> showed ofaverage an error marginal of more than 30 % in all four distribution channels. We discovered nogeographical influence of the error marginal. Due to the new average error marginal being far above Fortums permit limitation we believe thisnew categorization should not be used. Additional adjustments with related evaluations of loadcurves should be made before the categorization can be applied...|$|E

This research uses the University College Dublin Brain Trauma Model to analyse the <b>loading</b> <b>curve</b> shapes from a series of centric and non-centric impacts to a Hybrid III headform fitted with different hockey helmets. The results found that peak resultant linear acceleration did not always correlate with brain deformation measures. The results also indicated that, due to the complex nature of the interaction between <b>loading</b> <b>curve</b> characteristic and tissue parameters, there was no commonality in curve shape which produced large magnitudes of brain deformation.
