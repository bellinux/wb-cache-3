After the Council of Constance lured Jan Hus in with a <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity,</b> then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415, the Hussites fought the Hussite Wars (1420-1434) for their religious and political cause. After the Hussite Wars ended, the Catholic-supported Utraquist side came out victorious from conflict with the Taborites and became the most common representation of the Hussite faith in Bohemia.

40|$|As oil {{became a}} {{globally}} traded product traders learnt {{to maximize their}} profits by moving energy commodities around the globe. Globalisation and technological development, besides having a durable positive effect on international maritime trade often triggers enormous risks. As much as financial institutions and big trading companies are trying to reconcile national differences between sourcing and consumption countries by minimising political risks, these transactions are never entirely risk free. Traders, ship-owners and bankers often ignore the implications that could stem from their engagements in profitable but not always straightforward obligations. Oil trading is very complex business. Usually, trading volumes are very high and require substantial financial resources and a strong logistic system that could manage potential risks. A chain of participants involved in execution of one sale contract includes numerous parties such as ship-owners, brokers, insurers, inspection specialists, port agents, financial institutions and experienced support staff. As a result, {{there are a number}} of risks that do not appear on the surface of transactions and arise as a consequence of negligence of contractual details or general misinterpretation. Often, these errors are caused due to mismatches between multiple contracts, Charterparties, letters of credits or, simply, a result of dishonest behaviour of partners. Traders do not work in ideal world where contract executions follow their exact mechanism, there are no last minute changes and documents always arrive on time to the discharge ports. That’s why the Letters of Indemnity are a great instrument that can remove a lot of barriers on the way of the traders. They facilitate timely delivery of cargoes to their receivers, reduce operational costs and as result, increase profit margins of traders. Hence, a <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indemnity</b> creates liabilities that fall beyond the framework of the sale contract and beyond the standard insurance coverage for ship-owners. Often, Letters of Indemnity generate liabilities under parties who might not have had an original unilateral contract. The biggest issues arise when the <b>Letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>Indemnity</b> is being called upon, and traders have to secure the claim of the carrier. Yet, they are used by traders on every day basis as market dynamics imposes its own rules on the entire industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to analyse the peculiar features of the English and the Norwegian P&I Clubs from a comparative perspective. In particular, this study approaches how the following three topics are dealt with by P&I Clubs in the named jurisdictions: i) the ¨Pay to be paid rule¨; ii) the possibility of third party claimants to file recovery actions directly againts P&I Clubs; and iii) the P&I Clubs´ position regarding cover when <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> are accepted by the assured in exchange of delivering cargo without presentation of a bill of lading.

40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into five parts; the first part {{introduces}} the subject of misdescription in bills of lading, followed by the second part where briefly {{the role of the}} bill of lading in the contract of carriage, its functions by law as well as the necessity of an International uniform system are presented. The third part of the system analysis concerns the legal framework on misdescription and in particular the gradual development of carriage of goods by sea over time, the International Conventions on bills of lading and certain implemented national provisions; here, the English, Greek and Norwegian legal systems are discussed as all three have implemented the Hague-Visby Rules and, being included in the top 10 largest merchant shipping fleets, they have a serious impact on the international maritime business. Part IV explores a question of considerable importance to maritime law and practice; the exchange of letters of indemnity against clean bills of lading, as a relatively common practice in the maritime business. Even though the <b>letter</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> is foreseen in the international instruments, in case of intention to mislead the endorsee, the national provisions apply and, as will be concluded, the indemnity will be of no effect. Finally, part V will include the major findings of the paper in a summarized form so as to ascertain the current issues and present possible regulatory solutions for a healthy well-being and development of the international maritime business...|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{bill of lading}} by land or sea, or {{air waybill}} are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an [...] "order" [...] or [...] "bearer" [...] bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, {{there is no need to}} present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in [...] "The Rafaela S" [...] 2003 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and [...] "The Happy Ranger" [...] 2002 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} major {{shipping}} companies which operate fleets comprised largely of vessels which are time chartered and subsequently sub-chartered on voyage terms. Legal risks will arise {{for the time}} charterer due the differing natures and terms of time and voyage charters. The essential question examined in this thesis is that of whether, and to what extent, legal risk can be minimized by the negotiation of equivalent contractual terms under time and voyage charter parties. The key areas addressed in this thesis are delivery under time charters compared to readiness under voyage charters, off hire under time charters versus suspension of laytime under voyage charters, obligations relating to cleanliness of cargo spaces, rights and responsibilities relative to safe berths and ports, the time charterer's position under bills of lading, and issues relating to redelivery of the vessel and consequent voyage charter liability if the vessel is unable to undertake the final voyage. The methodology applied is {{an examination of the}} case law, with a primary focus on the extensive body of English jurisprudence. This analysis of the case law is accompanied by a consideration of provisions of major charter party forms. The analysis leads to the conclusion that risk, to varying degrees, can be minimized through the application and clarification of contractual language. With respect to readiness of the vessel it is considered that risk will be reduced through agreeing contractual language which requires early notification of the vessel's delay. As regards off hire and laytime wording that clarifies non physical deficiencies is proposed. With regard to vessel cargo spaces intermediate cleanliness is identified as the greatest risk. Safe port and berth warranties are determined to represent an area of easily manageable risk, while <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> relating to bills of lading continue to represent very significant risk with suggested but no certain solution. Finally, with respect to redelivery a final voyage clause for time charters has been proposed which serves to almost eliminate risk in this area. Therefore, it is broadly concluded that risk can be managed but not eliminated through drafting of appropriate contractual terms...|$|R
40|$|LL. D. The {{bill of lading}} in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the bill of lading in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the bill of lading that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to bills of lading rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing bills of lading, such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions of the bill of lading are considered in detail, particularly the bill of lading as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the bill of lading, though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional bill of lading only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a bill <b>of</b> lading. <b>Letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a bill <b>of</b> lading. Such <b>indemnities</b> will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to delivery. The consideration of the nature and functions of the traditional bill of lading, enables the study to progress to an examination of an electronic bill of lading. The use of an electronic bill of lading means that many problems facing the traditional bill of lading can be avoided. The continuing evolution of the bill of lading will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development of an electronic bill of lading. The difficulty facing the dematerialisation of the bill of lading is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic bill of lading is the equivalent of an original and unique paper bill of lading. It is possible to create an electronic bill of lading that performs all the functions of a traditional bill of lading, and there are examples of the use of such electronic bills of lading in practice. Delivery of the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer of a paper bill of lading. It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic bills of lading in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|The most {{well known}} and {{developed}} sea transport document is the bill of lading, a legal institution of its own with many advantages, {{but it is also}} known to be a main contributor to high costs of trade due to delayed arrival of original documents, inaccurate or insufficient information and fraudulent issuance of incorrect or forged bills of lading. The trade community’s response to the problems associated with the bill of lading has been to develop the concept of the electronic bill of lading. This work began as early as 1970 but still has not gained commercial momentum. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether electronic bills of lading are legally valid and if such documents can be submitted and accepted as evidence {{in a court of law}} and if there are such legal obstacles, to investigate international and/or national initiatives aimed at resolving the situation. A secondary purpose is to investigate how electronic bills of lading are used today and how their functionality is perceived by the trade parties. The traditional bill of lading is a document of title granting right to control of the goods to its holder. It is by Swedish law not clear if an electronic bill of lading qualifies as such a document of title meaning that a buyer of goods that is being transported under an electronic bill of lading may not have the right to control of the goods. Delayed arrival of original bills of lading cause carriers to deliver goods against <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> instead <b>of</b> surrender of bills of lading, hereby exposing themselves to risk and loss of P&I cover. Paper bills of lading are considered secure but are still subject to fraud and forgery. Electronic alternatives are considered equally or more secure, much thanks to the use of electronic signatures. World trade is increasing, in part due to the introduction of ICT systems that minimizes manual intervention and allows for free flow of information between concerned parties. Current offerings of electronic bills of lading are integrated in such information systems. Existing, such as the American, and proposed, such as the Rotterdam Rules, legislation that promotes the use of electronic bill of lading applies the principle of equivalence, whereby it is the functionality, not the media, which defines the legal qualities of a transport document. The document of title functionality is achieved by applying the principle of singularity, according to which, only one party may control the transport record, which is the functional equivalence of being the holder of a traditional bill of lading. Such laws do not yet exist in Sweden, leaving it unclear whether holders of electronic transport records have the same right to control of the goods as do holders of traditional paper bills of lading. Key conclusions of the thesis are that legislation based on the functional equivalence principle would eradicate the legal obstacles to the use of electronic bills of lading and that such legislative action combined with the current trend of implementing ICT systems in the shipping industry would serve to overcome the “traditional inertia” that has characterized the industry for so long, and ease the transition in to modern document management systems that will serve to eradicate the problems caused by the paper bill of lading...|$|R

5000|$|The Divine Principle goes on {{to explain}} three types <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> {{conditions}}. Equal conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> pay back the full value of what was lost. The biblical verse [...] "life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth" [...] (Exod.21:23-24) is quoted as an example <b>of</b> an equal <b>indemnity</b> condition. Lesser conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> provide a benefit greater than the price that is paid. Faith, baptism, and the eucharist are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> lesser <b>indemnity</b> conditions. Greater conditions <b>of</b> <b>indemnity</b> come about when a person fails in a lesser condition. In that case a greater price must be paid {{to make up for}} the earlier failure. Abraham's attempted sacrifice of his son Isaac (Gen. 22:1-18) and the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the wilderness under Moses (Num.14:34) are mentioned as examples <b>of</b> greater <b>indemnity</b> conditions. The Divine Principle then explains that an indemnity condition must reverse the course by which the mistake or loss came about. Indemnity, at its core, is required of humans because God is pure, and purity cannot relate directly with impurity. Indemnification is the vehicle that allows a [...] "just and righteous" [...] God to work through mankind. Jesus' statement that God had forsaken him (Matt.27:46) and Christianity's history of martyrdom are mentioned as examples of this. The Divine Principle then states that human beings, not God or the angels, are the ones responsible for making indemnity conditions.|$|R
