25|$|Windows Forms Designer: The Windows Forms {{designer}} is used {{to build}} GUI applications using Windows Forms. Layout can be controlled by housing the controls inside other containers or locking them {{to the side of}} the form. Controls that display data (like textbox, <b>list</b> <b>box</b> and grid view) can be bound to data sources like databases or queries. Data-bound controls can be created by dragging items from the Data Sources window onto a design surface. The UI is linked with code using an event-driven programming model. The designer generates either C# or VB.NET code for the application.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} IDE, it {{includes}} a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion using IntelliSense for variables, functions, methods, loops and LINQ queries. IntelliSense is supported for the included languages, {{as well as for}} XML and for Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript when developing web sites and web applications. Autocomplete suggestions appear in a modeless <b>list</b> <b>box</b> over the code editor window, in proximity of the editing cursor. In Visual Studio 2008 onwards, it can be made temporarily semi-transparent to see the code obstructed by it. The code editor is used for all supported languages.|$|E
2500|$|The 3D {{capabilities}} in WPF are limited compared to what's available in Direct3D. However, WPF provides tighter integration with other features like user interface (UI), documents, and media. This {{makes it possible}} to have 3D UI, 3D documents, and 3D media. A set of built-in controls is provided as part of WPF, containing items such as button, menu, and <b>list</b> <b>box</b> controls. WPF provides the ability to perform control composition, where a control can contain any other control or layout. WPF also has a built-in set of data services to enable application developers to bind data to the controls. Images are supported using the Windows Imaging Component. For media, WPF supports any audio and video formats which Windows Media Player can play. In addition, WPF supports time-based animations, in contrast to the frame-based approach. This delinks the speed of the animation from how slow or fast the system is performing. [...] is anti-aliased and rendered using ClearType.|$|E

50|$|Proof {{theory is}} a major branch of {{mathematical}} logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain <b>lists,</b> <b>boxed</b> <b>lists,</b> or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.|$|R

For example, the Invoke control pattern {{is used for}} controls that can be invoked (such as buttons) and the Scroll control pattern is used for controls that are scrollable viewports (such as <b>list</b> <b>boxes,</b> <b>list</b> views, or combo boxes). Because each control pattern represents a separate functionality, they can be combined to describe the full set of functionality supported by a particular control.|$|R

It includes basic form widgets such as text boxes, buttons, checkboxes and <b>list</b> <b>boxes.</b> DCL is object-oriented; it allows re-use through inheritance and composition.|$|R
