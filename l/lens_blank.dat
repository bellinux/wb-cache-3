The Court held that this sale exhausted the patents on the finished lenses because the <b>lens</b> <b>blanks</b> substantially “embodied essential features of the patented device and were without utility until [...] [...] [...] ground and polished as the finished lens of the patent.” The Court noted that the grinding process was standard (conventional) and not central to the patents, indicating further that the <b>lens</b> <b>blanks</b> constituted a material part of the patented invention and all but completely practiced the patent, since only conventional further processing steps were needed to complete the invention.|$|R

The Supreme Court {{assumed that the}} patent was not [...] "fully practiced"—i.e., infringed—"until the finishing licensee has ground and polished the blank". The finishing license was therefore a manufacturing license, and according to Univis, was within the protected dispensation of the General Talking Pictures case. But the Supreme Court held {{that even though the}} <b>lens</b> <b>blanks</b> were unpatented their sale by the patentee triggered exhaustion of the patent. The Court considered that the blanks [...] "embodied essential features of the patented device", they were not used for anything else, and that was sufficient to trigger the exhaustion doctrine. Since Univis's patent rights were exhausted by the sale of the <b>lens</b> <b>blanks,</b> the post-sale price and other restrictions that Univis imposed on the finishers were held illegal and in violation of the antitrust laws.|$|R

40|$|Spectacle-mounted {{telescopic}} {{systems are}} prescribed {{for individuals with}} visual impairments. Bioptic telescopes are typically mounted {{toward the top of}} the spectacle lens (or above the frame) with the telescope eyepiece positioned above the wearer’s pupil. This allows the wearer to use up and down head tilt movements to quickly alternate between the unmagnified wide view (through the carrier lens) and the magnified narrow field-of-view (available through the eyepiece). Rejection of this visual aid has been attributed mainly to its appearance and to the limited field-of-view through the smaller Galilean designs. We designed a wide-field Keplerian telescope that is built completely within the spectacle lens. The design uses embedded mirrors inside the carrier lens for optical pathway folding and conventional lenses or curved mirrors for magnification power. The short height of the ocular, its position, and a small tilt of the ocular mirror enable the wearer to simultaneously view the magnified field above the unmagnified view of the uninterrupted horizontal field. These features improve the cosmetics and utility of the device.

Typically, bioptic telescopes are mounted {{toward the top of}} spectacle lenses or above the frame with the telescope eyepiece positioned above the eye's pupil. This allows the wearer to alternate between the magnified narrow field of view available through the eyepiece and the unmagnified wide view through the carrier lens using head motion.

40|$|AIM—Some {{surgeons}} consider {{hand held}} surgical keratometers unreliable. This {{may be due}} to incorrect use through not realising that the distance that the keratometer is held from the cornea influences the shape of the image. When a keratometer is held closer to the astigmatic cornea, the elliptical image will appear more circular, particularly for larger degrees of astigmatism. However, the keratoscopic astigmatic ruler (KAR) has design features that correct the hitherto unrecognised problems {{with the use of a}} hand held keratometer. This study assesses the reliability and accuracy of measurement of astigmatism using the KAR.  METHODS—The KAR and the Bausch & Lomb keratometer (B&L) were compared using six back surface toric cut contact lens blanks representing 1  to 6  dioptres of astigmatism. Two observers (one experienced in the use of the keratometers, the other a novice) took eight randomly repeated "masked" measurements of each <b>lens</b> <b>blank</b> with the KAR and four measurements with the B&L in a similar fashion.  RESULTS—There was no difference between the measurements with either instrument by each of the observers (p= 0. 95, ANOVA). The standard error of measurement for the KAR was 0. 59  D, for the B&L, 0. 31  D.  The intraclass correlation coefficient of reliability for the KAR was 0. 90  and for the B&L it was 0. 97.  The coefficient of repeatability for the KAR was plus or minus 0. 83  D, and for the B&L plus or minus 0. 77  D.  The interobserver reliability for the KAR was 0. 898, and for the B&L, 0. 975.  CONCLUSION—These results suggest that the KAR has good reliability and reproducibility and compares favourably with the B&L keratometer. Inexperience with use does not affect reliability.    Keywords: keratometry; calibratio...|$|E

Lithographers have been facing unprecedented challenges during last five years to keep the technology on the technology treadmill by developing various kinds of resolution enhancement techniques (RETs). In low K 1 regime, co-optimization of design, layout, mask, OPC, lithography and etching is the primary strategy to deliver a production-worthy patterning solution. Optical shrink is not a trivial task anymore. Intel always pursues parallel patterning techniques based on the dual exposure wavelength patterning strategy.

The effects ofpolarization at super high NA illumination on mask technology, such as <b>lens</b> reduction ratio, <b>blank</b> absorber thickness and image imbalance correction, and restriction on design layout are addressed in this paper. Contact patterning is extremely challenging at low K 1. Contact shape factor (circularity) which impacts the design rule will be discussed in this paper. Explosion of data file size and mask write time, stringent mask CD control and mask defect disposition are direct consequences of low-K 1 /high-MEEF (Mask Error Enhancement Factor) lithography.

It took more than ten years to develop a stable chemically amplified resist (CAR) for DUV. Consequently, as the industry moves towards manufacturing end-of-the-roadmap CMOS devices, lithography is still based on 193 nm light source to print critical dimensions of 45 nm, 32 nm and likely 22 nm. Sub-wavelength lithography creates a number of printability issues. The printed patterns are highly sensitive to topographic changes due to metal planarization, overlay errors, focus and dose variations, random particle defects to name a few. Design for Manufacturability methodologies came into being to help analyze and mitigate manufacturing impacts on the design. Although techniques such as Resolution Enhancement Techniques (RET) which involve optical proximity correction (OPC), phase shift masking (PSM), off-axis illumination (OAI) have been used to greatly improve the printability and better the manufacturing process window, they cannot perfectly compensate for these lithographic deficiencies. DFM methods were primarily devised to predict and correct systematic patterning problems that arise during manufacturing. Apart from systematic errors, random manufacturing variations may occur during photolithography. This is where a statistical approach to modeling of error behavior and its impact on different design parameters may prove to be effective. By incorporating statistical analysis to parameter variation, an effective, non-conservative design can be obtained. IC manufacturing yield is the foremost measure that determines the profitability of a given semiconductor manufacturing process. Thus early prediction of yield detractors is an important step in the design process. Such predictions are based on models, which in turn are rooted in manufacturing process. Success of yield prediction is based on quality of models. The models must capture physical phenomena and yet be efficient for computation. In this work, we present a lithography-based yield model that is computationally practical for use in the design process. The work also provides a methodology to perform statistical lithography rules check to identify hot spots in the design that can contribute to yield loss. Yield recovery methods aimed at minimally modifying the design ultimately produce more printable masks. Apart from IC manufacturing yield, ICs today are vulnerable to various reliability failures including electromigration (EM), negative bias temperature instability (NBTI), hot carrier injection (HCI) and electro-static discharge (ESD). Though such reliability issues have been examined since the beginning of CMOS, manufacturability impacts have created a renewed interest in analyzing them. In this dissertation, we introduce the concept of Design for reliable manufacturability (DFRM) to consider the effect of linewidth changes, gate oxide thickness variations and other manufacturing artifacts.
