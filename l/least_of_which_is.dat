5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> that many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, not the <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and {{has been used to}} show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.|$|E

25|$|The Ms. Ludwig XV 13, also titled Fior di Battaglia, is {{currently}} in the holdings of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, CA. Its prologue, format, illustrations, and text are all {{very similar to the}} Ms. M.383, though it's largely free of silver enamel. The text takes the form of descriptive paragraphs set in poor Italian verse, which are nevertheless fairly clear and informative. Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, not the <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> the vastly different order of the information. This is the longest and most comprehensive of the four manuscripts of Fior di Battaglia. This manuscript is typically referred to as the 'Getty version'.|$|E

If the Telford Steam Railway were to expand and cross the river Severn via the Albert Edward Bridge and operate to the original site of Buildwas Junction station, it would operate over a very short part of the former Severn Valley Line. The planned closure of Ironbridge Power Station In 2015 further adds to the debate because this covers the site of Buildwas Junction station. However, there are several obstacles to overcome, not <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> that all of the land north of Bridgnorth tunnel is in private ownership. The Holybush Road was widened and raised after closure, impeding access to the southern portal of Bridgnorth tunnel.

McKibben added [...] "There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10.

2500|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the veracity of}} estimates published by some sources. For example, Gerda Wielander (2013) has claimed that {{estimates of the number}} of Christians in China that have been spread by Western media may have been highly inflated. For instance, according to Asia Harvest, a US non-profit organization and [...] "inter-denominational Christian ministry", there were 105 millions Christians in China in 2011. The compiler of these figures, Paul Hattaway, indicates that his figures are his own estimate, based on more than 2,000 published sources such as Internet reports, journals, and books, as well as interviews with house church leaders. The study points out that “owing to the difficulties of conducting such a [...] in China today – not the <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> the sheer size of the country – there is [...] a margin of error of 20 percent.” Citing one of the aforementioned surveys, Gerda Wielander says that the actual number of Christians is around 30 million. Similarly, missionary researcher Tony Lambert has highlighted that an estimate of [...] "one hundred million Chinese Christians" [...] was already being spread by American Christian media in 1983, and has been further exaggerated, through a chain of misquotations, in the 2000s. Christopher Marsh (2011) too has been critical of these overestimations. On the 6th January 2015, David Ferguson published on the People's Daily the satirical news Merry Christmas, 100 million Chinese! criticising such type of journalism.|$|E
2500|$|Philpot has {{expressed}} controversial views on LGBT issues, including as {{an outspoken critic}} of the legalization of same-sex marriage. Following the 2013 decisions in Hollingsworth v. Perry (which had the effect of legalizing same-sex marriage in California by upholding the overturning of Proposition 8) and United States v. Windsor (which invalidated parts of the Defense of Marriage Act and forced the U.S. federal government to recognize same-sex marriages that were legal under state law), Philpot wrote an opinion editorial explaining that Kentucky state law was unaffected by the decisions. Philpot's conclusion was that [...] "Kentucky's constitution defines marriage as one man and one woman. Simple and traditional. Kentucky's definition of marriage stands – for now." [...] This was criticized heavily on two grounds. Then-retired Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky Jennifer Coffman, who was Kentucky's first female federal judge, wrote a highly critical opinion editorial responding to Philpot. She noted that [...] "Philpot took several risks, not the <b>least</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> that he could be wrong" [...] as the [...] "DOMA ruling's effect in Kentucky rests with the courts which consider the matter" [...] (i.e. Federal Courts), though subsequent events have rendered this moot. Further, [...] "the possibility that a case involving these issues could arise in Philpot's court underscores the primary error of his column: he has undermined his own judicial integrity. If squarely presented with the issue of the DOMA ruling's effect in Kentucky, he might have to disqualify himself from the case because he has stated his opinion on that topic." [...] Coffman also criticized Philpot for dismissing principles of judicial interpretation as [...] "boring and technical" [...] and for ridiculing judicial review with his observation that then-Chief Judge Vaughn Walker's declaration in the first instance that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional was: [...] "One trial judge trumped every voter in California" [...] – and for gratuitously mentioning Walker's sexuality.

Unfortunately, like some men as good, he was unaware that Reisenburg was not an independent state; and so, on the occasion of Austria attacking Naples, Mr. Sievers took the opportunity of attacking Austria. His article, eloquent, luminous, profound, revealed the dark colours of the Austrian policy, as an artist's lamp brings out the murky tints of a Spagnoletto. Every one admired Sievers' bitter sarcasms, enlightened views, and indignant eloquence. Madame Carolina crowned him with laurel in the midst of her coterie, and it is said that the Grand Duke sent him a snuff-box. In a short time the article reached Vienna, and in a still shorter time Mr. Beckendorff reached the Residence, and insisted on the author being immediately given up to the Austrian Government. Madame Carolina was in despair, the Grand Duke in doubt, and Beckendorff threatened to resign if the order were not signed.
