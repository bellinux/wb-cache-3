5|$|The {{predicted}} {{effects of}} the FairTax {{are a source of}} disagreement among economists and other analysts. According to Money magazine, while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax, many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality. Some economists argue that a consumption tax (the FairTax is one such tax) would {{have a positive effect on}} economic growth, incentives for international business to locate in the U.S., and increased U.S. international competitiveness (border tax adjustment in global trade). The FairTax would be tax-free on mortgage interest (up to a basic interest rate) and donations, but some <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions. There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment (to prevent Congress from re-introducing an income tax).|$|E

25|$|Many local <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> been {{impacted}} by the city's term limits. Several former city officialsAnthony Hall, Rodney Ellis, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Sylvia Garcia, Martha Wong, Chris Bell, Annise Parker, Shelley Sekula-Gibbs, Adrian Garcia, Ed Gonzalez, and Mike Sullivan, chose to run for other elected positions once their terms expired or shortly before they were due to expire.|$|E
25|$|Reformist <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> {{argued that}} the higher age of consent could result in abuses and {{wrongful}} arrests in statutory rape cases. Additionally, critics {{point out that there}} is often a disconnect between law and practice in India. For example, according to a 2012 United Nations report, 47% of Indian women marry younger than 18 (the legal marriage age is 21 for men and 18 for women).|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the regular}} {{admission}} price has {{increased over the}} years. In addition, Nevada <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> modified the state's entertainment and sales tax code to include such nonprofit organizations like Burning Man that sell more than 15,000 tickets. As a result, an individual ticket (including taxes) cost $424 in 2016. Even tickets sold under Burning Man's low income program are subject to these taxes. Including transportation, food, camp fees, clothing and costumes, and gifts, CNBC estimated in 2016 that {{the total cost of}} attending could range from $1,300 up to $20,000. In 2017, Money magazine estimated an average total cost of $2,348 to attend.|$|E
25|$|California's {{state budget}} woes are {{expected}} to put more pressure on cities such as Burbank. State <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> proposed eliminating the individual redevelopment agencies, {{a move that would}} force cities such as Burbank to eliminate much needed infrastructure projects. Local redevelopment agencies also may be forced to reimburse the state. For example, Burbank Redevelopment Agency might have pay the state nearly $20 million. But the city is fighting the return of at least $15 million in redevelopment funds, including money that was slated for the Lundigan Community Center and improvements to Johnny Carson Park. Whether Burbank will ultimately prevail is unclear, as the state's budget hole is getting worse due to the slow economy and lower than expected state revenues.|$|E
25|$|The burgeoning {{population}} of Salt Lake City {{and the surrounding}} metropolitan area, combined with its geographical situation, has led to air quality becoming a top concern for the populace. The Wasatch Front is subject to strong temperature inversions during the winter, which trap pollutants and lower air quality. The Utah Division of Air Quality closely monitors air quality and issues alerts for voluntary and mandatory actions when pollution exceeds federal safety standards. Protests have been held at the Utah State Capitol and Democratic <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> introduced legislation in the Utah State Legislature to make public transportation free during January and July, when air quality is usually at its worst. The {{population of}} the Salt Lake City metropolitan area is projected to double by 2040, putting further pressure on the region's air quality.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show a strong tension between two {{important}} values, namely freedom and security. A <b>lawmaker</b> <b>has</b> to choose a limitation of freedom to achieve security, which is very difficult. Legislator has to face with the dilemma in time of an institutional transformation. That time usually brings a radical growth of criminality. In such circumstances citizens demand from the legislator an effective fight with this serious threat. A <b>lawmaker</b> <b>has</b> to enable citizens both security and freedom by various legal institutions for example initial investigation. The initial investigation is based on a secret interfering in privacy for instance: a wire tapping by such services as police or secret service. This controversial solution has led so far to the reduction of crimes, especially organized. It can be justified by Max Weber’s ethics of responsibility. A <b>lawmaker,</b> however, <b>has</b> to protect the whole political community by some controversial institutions from the moral point of view. 3119220810 Filozofia Publiczna i Edukacja Demokratyczn...|$|R

After the M6.4 1933 Long Beach earthquake the Field Act was passed the following month, {{and after the}} 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act and Senate Bill 1953 (hospital safety requirements) were established. Following the San Fernando event, earthquake engineers and seismologists from established scientific organizations, {{as well as the}} newly formed Los Angeles County Earthquake Commission, stated their recommendations that were based on the lessons learned. The list of items needing improvements included building codes, dams and bridges being made more earthquake resistant, hospitals that are designed to remain operational, and the restriction of development near known fault zones. New legislation included the Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zone Act and the development of the Strong Motion Instrumentation Program.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, the Federal Election Commission {{ruled that}} Jackson, Jr. could hire {{his wife on}} his {{campaign}} payroll. The ruling stated that relatives can be employed {{as long as they}} were compensated [...] "no more than the fair market value" [...] for their services. [...] At the time, Sandi Jackson was employed by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) as the deputy director of training. Many other <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> made similar arrangements without contacting the FEC for a ruling. When House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was charged with ethical infractions, matters such as these came to light. Jackson remained on the payroll of her husband's main campaign fund, Jesse Jackson Jr. for Congress, in 2006 as she considered a run for public office. [...] She also continued to be employed by Howard Dean of the DNC. Between 2001 and early 2009, Jesse Jackson Jr.’s congressional campaign paid Sandra at least $247,500, including at least $95,000 after Sandra became Alderman.|$|E

[...] Democrat Barbara Flynn Currie, chair of the impeachment committee, was the recipient of the follow-up affidavit.

2500|$|Some {{historians have}} {{questioned}} the appropriateness of Hanson's selection for the honor of representing Maryland in Statuary Hall.

2500|$|On 21 July 2008, the French {{parliament}} passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy {{had made}} {{one of the key}} pledges of his presidential campaign.

They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president's right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament, to set its own agenda.

2500|$|Taiwan and China {{are largely}} {{strategically}} aligned on the Spratly islands issue, since they both claim {{exactly the same}} area, so Taiwan's control of Itu Aba (Taiping) island is viewed {{as an extension of}} China's claim. Taiwan and China both claim the entire island chain, while all the other claimaints only claim portions of them. China has proposed co-operation with Taiwan against all the other countries claiming the islands. Taiwanese <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> demanded that Taiwan fortify Itu Aba (Taiping) island with weapons to defend against the Vietnamese, and both China and Taiwanese NGOs have pressured Taiwan to expand Taiwan's military capabilities on the island, which played a role in Taiwan expanding the island's runway in 2012. China has urged Taiwan to co-operate and offered Taiwan a share in oil and gas resources while shutting out all the other rival claimaints. Taiwanese <b>lawmakers</b> <b>have</b> complained about repeated Vietnamese aggression and trespassing on Taiwan's Itu Aba (Taiping), and Taiwan has started viewing Vietnam as an enemy over the Spratly Islands, not China. Taiwan's state run oil company CPC Corp's board director Chiu Yi has called Vietnam as the [...] "greatest threat" [...] to Taiwan. Taiwan's airstrip on Taiping has irritated Vietnam. China views Taiwan's expansion of its military and airstrip on Taiping as benefiting China's position against the other rival claimaints from southeast Asian countries. China's claims to the Spratlys benefit from legal weight because of Taiwan's presence on Itu Aba, while America on the other hand has regularly ignored Taiwan's claims in the South China Sea and does not include Taiwan in any talks on dispute resolution for the area.|$|E
