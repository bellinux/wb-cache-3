The OLED device structure is a type of red–green–blue (RGB) -stacked emitting layer that has a good color index and greater adjustability, which improves the performance of the device. This novel design has the same equipment and material requirement compared to the ordinary design, and it is very beneficial in terms of high volume and low-cost production. It uses a hyper driving method because the entire OLED <b>lighting</b> <b>panel</b> is divided into many sub-emitting units; if one of the sub-emitting units is burned out, it has no effect on the adjacent sub-emitting unit, so the reliability is markedly better than the ordinary design...|$|E

The 50 Hz signal is on for the entire record extending from 0 to 1 second, while the 100 Hz signal is from 100 ms to 350 ms and 200 Hz signal is from 200 ms to 550 ms.

30|$|The ALT process {{relies on}} the {{assumption}} that the degradation mechanism is essentially the same at the high current densities used to measure the acceleration factor as it is at the extrapolated lower current densities. However, this process is not suitable to accurately predict lifetimes of devices when different degradation mechanisms are introduced during the accelerated testing of a large-area OLED <b>lighting</b> <b>panel.</b> This is because, at high current density, even the most efficient large-area OLED panels generate heat over a large area that cannot be easily dissipated. This heat is typically generated by Joule heating in the bus lines, electrodes and non-emissive exciton recombination. This can lead to increased temperatures and/or temperature gradients across the OLED panel, which may result in faster and non-uniform aging [28]. Therefore, the ALT method is not accurate in determining the lifetime of large-area OLED panels.|$|E

30|$|Compared to {{inorganic}} {{light-emitting diodes}} (LEDs), which have developed {{for several decades}} and are still being researched [1 – 3], organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) now have also attracted intensive attention due to their bright future on practical application [4, 5]. In recent years, white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) have become a research highlight; because of their potential applications in solid-state <b>lighting,</b> <b>panel</b> display technology etc., various WOLEDs constructions have been demonstrated [6 – 9]. Among the structures, multiple quantum well (MQW) device {{is one of the}} significant white emission devices because charge carriers and excitons could be confined in a narrow emissive zone to prevent the emitter from interacting with the adjacent emitter, which is highly similar to the working mechanism of the inorganic MQW constitution of LED. MQW is generally divided into type-I and type-II configurations in OLEDs. Type-I MQW structure is defined as the narrow bandgap molecule located within the wide bandgap molecule; thus, injected carriers are confined between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the narrow bandgap molecule. While the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of both two materials in type-II MQW structure are staggered, carriers are confined in different molecules.|$|E

40|$|OLED {{technology}} may be excellently suitable for lighting applications by combining high efficiency, cost effective manufacturing {{and the use}} of low cost materials. Certain issues remain to be solved so far, including OLED brightness, color, lifetime, large area uniformity and encapsulation. Another aspect, that might be capable in addressing some of the mentioned issues, is OLED lighting electrical driving. We report on the design of a driving platform for OLED lighting test panels or substrates. It is intended for being a test environment for lighting substrates as well as demonstration/presentation environment. It is based on a 128 -channel passive-matrix driver/controller ASIC OC 2. Its key component is an MSP 430 -compatible 16 -bit micro-controller core including embedded Flash memory (program), EEPROM (parameter), and RAM (data memory). A significant feature of the device is an electronic approach for improving the lifetime/uniformity behavior of connected OLED. The embedded micro-controller {{is the key to the}} high versatility of OC 2, since by firmware modification it can be adapted to various applications and conditions. Here its application for an OLED lighting driving platform is presented. Major features of this platform are PC-control mode (via USB interface), stand-alone mode (no external control necessary, just power supply), on-board OLED panel parameter storage, flat geometry of OLED <b>lighting</b> <b>panel</b> carrier (board), AC and DC driving regimes, adjustable reverse voltage, dedicated user SW (PC/Windows-based), sub-tile patterning and single sub-tile control, combination of multiple channels for increasing driving current.

Specifically the UDC team in 2010 delivered two prototype OLED ceiling illumination systems, each consisting of four individual OLED lighting panels on glass integrated into Armstrong's novel TechZone open architecture ceiling systems, at an overall system efficacy of 51 lm/W, a CRI = 85 and a projected lifetime to 70 % of initial luminance to exceed 10, 000 hours. This accomplishment represents a 50 % increase in luminaire efficacy and a factor of two in lifetime over that outlined in the solicitation. In addition, the team has also delivered one 15 cm x 15 cm <b>lighting</b> <b>panel</b> fabricated on a flexible metal foil substrate, demonstrating the possibility using OLEDs in a range of form factors.

40|$|This paper reports {{data on the}} {{structure}} and performances of an automated growth chamber prototype for plantlet vegetable production (Box Nursery), developed {{in relation to the}} research activity carried on in the Italian basis “Baia Terra Nova”, in Antarctica. The prototype was built to produce young plants for supporting the Plant-based Unit for Life Support (PULSA) installed at Terra Nova Bay, in the frame of an ongoing research activity of the PNRA (Italian Program Research in Antarctica). The Box Nursery is composed by: a growth chamber (89 x 69 cm, height 203 cm); a second body (satellite cube, 76 x 70 cm, height 91 cm) containing the control unit system and the irrigation tanks. Three germination module units were installed in the growth chamber, each composed by a steel tray equipped with a subirrigation system and a <b>lighting</b> <b>panel.</b> Cooling, heating and de-humidification systems were included in the growth chamber for maintaining optimal growth condition for plantlets. However, a system of ventilation was installed for preventing CO 2 and ethylene accumulation as well as oxygen depletion in the growth chamber. A specific software (Box Nursery management Software) was developed to allow the control of all systems and to record internal climatic condition. The prototype of Box Nursery was tested for 1 year with different vegetable plants (such as lettuce, tomato, radish, rocket etc.). The results showed that the prototype maintains the pre-set parameter independently from external climate, with average power consumption about 0. 6 kW. No differences on uniformity coefficient, average time and percentage of germination were recorded in comparison with seeds germinated in a growth chamber with same growing conditions...|$|E
30|$|InGaN/GaN {{multiple}} {{quantum well}} (MQW) structures grown on silicon substrates instead on conventional sapphire have attracted growing attentions for their potential applications in low-cost solid-state <b>lighting,</b> <b>panel</b> display, and silicon photonics [1 – 5]. The critical obstacle in fabricating high-quality GaN film on Si is the thermal expansion mismatch (56 %) between GaN and Si, which introduced large tensile stress and cracks to the grown GaN films [6 – 9]. Furthermore, a Si doped n-type GaN layer beneath MQW layers {{is necessary for}} light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or laser diodes (LDs). In these cases, additional tensile stress from Si doping will be brought in. In recent years, efforts {{have been made to}} overcome these difficulties via using intermediate layers with suitable compressive stress to counterbalance tensile stress [10 – 16], delta doping for strain relaxation [17, 18], or the lattice-matched buffer layer deposition [19, 20]. According to previous works [17], periodic Si δ-doping architecture of the n-type GaN layer could achieve smoother GaN layer with higher crystalline quality and lower crack density than on Si uniformly doped GaN. This was attributed to the reduction of tensile stress. Several works have been done for examining the surface morphology, dislocation density, and electrical properties of crystalline GaN/Si δ-doping GaN layers on either sapphire [21, 22] or silicon substrates [23]. Unfortunately, few of them directly investigated the luminescence properties of InGaN/GaN MQW structures on top of a Si δ-doping GaN layer and clarified the relationship between luminescence efficiency enhancement and strain release caused by the film structure improvements, which are critical to the device fabrication. It is also worth mentioning that, direct measuring strain or observing lattice distortions without breaking down the LED samples is difficult. Indirect methods are always applied to evaluate the internal strain. For instance, mechanical pressure was applied to modulate the internal strain, which led to the changes of piezoelectric field inside MQWs as well as the optoelectronic performances of LED devices [24 – 27]. In any of these cases, luminescence spectra measurements were found indispensable for exanimating the strain-related device performance.|$|E
