5|$|On 17 June, the six parties {{came to an}} {{agreement}} on forming a coalition government. The Katainen government will have 19 ministers with the portfolios divided with the NCP and the SDP both having six ministers, while the <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance,</b> the Greens and the SPP would each have two ministers and the Christian Democrats would have one. The NCP, SDP, SPP and the Christian Democrats announced their candidates for minister positions on 18 June, while the Left Alliance—with some of its notable members opposing joining the government—confirmed its participation in the government and its candidates for ministeral portfolios on its party council on 19 June. The Green League announced its ministers on 20 June. On 22 June, the parliament elected Katainen as prime minister {{by a vote of}} 118–72; two <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> MPs voted against Katainen, for which they were formally reprimanded by the <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> parliamentary group. President Tarja Halonen then formally inaugurated the government at the government palace in Helsinki the same afternoon.|$|E
5|$|In the elections, Solidarity {{received}} only 4.9% of the votes, 0.1% {{less than the}} 5% {{required in order to}} enter parliament (Solidarity still had 9 senators, 2 fewer than in the previous Senate). The victorious party was the Democratic <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej or SLD), a post-communist left-wing party.|$|E
5|$|The Centre Party, the National Coalition Party, the Social Democratic Party and the Green League held party {{conferences}} in May or June 2010 where they elected the party leadership {{for the election}} and approved their election manifestoes. The <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> held its conference in 2009, when they elected Paavo Arhinmäki chairman after the previous chairman resigned in 2009 due the party's poor result in the European Parliament election.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance's</b> loss of seats, its {{chairman}} Paavo Arhinmäki was still reasonably {{satisfied with the}} party's performance in the election, due to his claims that the media had concentrated on the four major parties during the campaign. However, Arhinmäki got the most personal votes in his electoral district of Helsinki. The <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance's</b> support was highest in Lapland with 16.7% of the votes and lowest in Southern Savonia with 2.2%.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{election}} there were 17 registered parties (a party has to collect signatures from at least 5,000 eligible voters in order to be accepted on the official party register, which is maintained by the Ministry of Justice). Eight of the parties were represented in the current parliament: the Centre Party, National Coalition Party (NCP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance,</b> Green League, Swedish People's Party (SPP), Christian Democrats and True Finns. The MP representing Åland sits with the Swedish People's Party in the parliament.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, the True Finns {{announced}} that they would withdraw from the government formation negotiations due to the bailout issue. Soini said he would remain true to the True Finns' campaign promises and not compromise the party's core principles. After Soini's announcement, Jyrki Katainen invited the SDP, Green League, SPP and Christian Democrats to negotiate on forming a coalition led by the NCP. On 18 May, Katainen {{announced that}} he would invite the <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> to negotiate as well, beginning on 20 May. The Left Alliance's participation had been demanded by the Social Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance,</b> to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Left</b> <b>Alliance</b> is {{the fourth}} largest party, while the Finns Party have {{increased}} their support steadily to become the fifth largest party. Support for the Swedish People's Party has been steadily declining over the years, most likely because of the diminishing proportion of Swedish speakers in Helsinki. The Centre Party of Finland, despite {{being one of the}} major parties in national politics, has little support in Helsinki, {{as is the case in}} most big cities.|$|E
