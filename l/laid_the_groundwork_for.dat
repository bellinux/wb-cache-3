5|$|Alternative rock is {{a diverse}} {{grouping}} of rock bands that in America developed {{largely from the}} hardcore scene in the 1980s in stark opposition to the mainstream music scene. Alternative rock subgenres that developed during the decade include indie rock, Gothic rock, noise rock, grunge, and college rock. Most alternative bands were unified by their collective debt to punk, which <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> underground and alternative music in the 1970s. Though the genre {{is considered to be}} rock, some styles were influenced by American folk, reggae and jazz. Like punk and hardcore, alternative rock had little mainstream success in America in the 1980s, but via the grassroots establishment of an indie scene through touring, college radio, fanzines, and word-of-mouth, alternative bands <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the breakthrough of the genre in the American public consciousness in the next decade.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to create}} an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later attempt {{to create an}} all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 {{eventually}} <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2008 election, Romney <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> {{a likely}} 2012 presidential {{campaign}} by using his Free and Strong America {{political action committee}} (PAC) {{to raise money for}} other Republican candidates and pay his existing political staff's salaries and consulting fees. A network of former staff and supporters around the nation were eager for him to run again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{contributions}} of Bodian, Morgan, and Howe thus <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> scientific <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> subsequent {{development of the}} Salk and Sabin polio vaccines. In Bodian's own summary their accomplishments were: ...|$|R

50|$|The Kassite {{language}} {{has not been}} classified. However, several Kassite leaders bore Indo-European names, and the Kassites worshipped several Indo-Aryan gods, suggesting that the Kassites were under significant Indo-European influence. The reign of <b>the</b> Kassites <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> essential <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of subsequent Babylonian culture.|$|R
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant {{that much of the}} preparation was not completed. Adolf Hitler ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent {{the operation}} contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E
5|$|The Uranium Committee was a {{committee}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) that succeeded the Advisory Committee on Uranium and later evolved into the S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), when that organization absorbed the NDRC in June 1941, and the S-1 Executive Committee in June 1942. It <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the Manhattan Project by initiating and coordinating the early research efforts in the United States, and liaising with the Tube Alloys Project in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} weeks of the {{earthquake}} swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists' assessment <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of manned-submersible dives in August and September.|$|E
50|$|The National Liberals' {{period of}} great {{dominance}} was between 1871 and 1879, {{when they were}} Bismarck's chief allies in the Reichstag, and were avid supporters of the Kulturkampf measures. The stabilization of the new state was in a large degree only feasible because of National Liberal party support and guidance of Bismarck´s domestic policies, {{especially in regards to}} national economics and the legal foundations of the second German empire. Weights and measurements were standardized, a common German market and a national bank, the Reichsbank, created and the numerous regional currencies replaced with the Reichsmark. The liberal economic policies, although temporarily unpopular in the recession of <b>the</b> 1870s, <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundworks</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> economic boom the German nation experienced {{at the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|R
50|$|This movie {{could be}} seen as a proto-slasher film meaning a movie that may have <b>laid</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slasher film subgenre.|$|R
50|$|The German-Israeli {{military}} cooperation was shrouded in secrecy {{for a long}} period, as such an entente was not seen favorably within Israel. However, this tight relationship, translated through arms deal and intelligence sharing, developed into solid trust and ultimately <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> necessary <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> establishment of diplomatic ties.|$|R
5|$|Air Vice Marshal Henry Neilson Wrigley, CBE, DFC, AFC (21April 1892– 14September 1987) was {{a senior}} {{commander}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). A pioneering flyer and aviation scholar, he piloted the first trans-Australia flight from Melbourne to Darwin in 1919, and afterwards <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the RAAF's air power doctrine. During World WarI, Wrigley joined the Australian Flying Corps and saw combat with No.3 Squadron on the Western Front, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross; he later commanded the unit and published a history of its wartime exploits. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for his 1919 cross-country flight.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} Newtonian limit, {{particularly}} in relation to cosmological solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of perturbations and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was {{the basis of his}} attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a cosmological constant or, in modern parlance, dark energy, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.|$|E
50|$|As chairman, Lynch, he <b>laid</b> much of <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Kennedy's 1960 presidential {{campaign}} in Massachusetts and traveled with him {{throughout most of}} the primary states.|$|R
5000|$|The EU-funded [...] "Mobinet" [...] {{project has}} <b>laid</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> TaaS, e.g. pan-European {{identity}} management of travellers, and payments, {{and links to}} trip planners.|$|R
50|$|During Rodenhizer's {{first term}} as mayor, he was {{instrumental}} in getting the Durham Freeway extended along its modern route. In his second term, he <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> financial <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> what would become Durham Bulls Athletic Park, persuading {{the owner of the}} minor league team to keep the Bulls in Durham.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, the Taft Court <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the {{incorporation}} {{of many of the}} guarantees of the Bill of Rights to be applied against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, the court by a 6–2 vote with Taft in the majority, upheld Gitlow's conviction on criminal anarchy charges for advocating the overthrow of the government; his defense was freedom of speech. Justice Edward T. Sanford wrote the court's opinion, and both majority and minority (Holmes, joined by Brandeis) assumed that the First Amendment's Free Speech and Free Press clauses were protected against infringement by the states.|$|E
5|$|Petén {{was first}} {{penetrated}} by Hernán Cortés with a sizeable expedition that crossed the territory {{from north to}} south in 1525. In {{the first half of the}} 16th century, Spain established neighbouring colonies in Yucatán to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Petén from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Petén took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of Mérida in Yucatán.|$|E
5|$|The {{centre of}} {{attention}} is {{in large part}} on the characters, described often with a personal slant and using memorable expressions ("It is we who are Hamlet") and incorporating psychological insights that were to become highly influential in later criticism. Though at first less influential, Hazlitt's comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> later critics' more elaborate interpretations. Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E
50|$|Alderman also <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> {{financial}} <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> University's future. During {{the first}} years of his presidency he established its first endowment fund and led the fundraising of almost $700,000 to meet a $500,000 challenge grant from Andrew Carnegie. By the end of his presidency the endowment would increase to $10 million.|$|R
50|$|As king, Aldarion gave aid to Gil-galad, {{established}} new havens and bases (of which Vinyalondë {{was most}} notable) on {{the coasts of}} Middle-earth, and <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> in Númenor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> creation of a great naval power.|$|R
50|$|Dr.Hong {{initiated}} a translational research program at MD Anderson Cancer Center using molecularly-targeted approaches {{for the treatment}} of lung cancer. He led the BATTLE (Biomarker-integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy for Lung Cancer Elimination) trial, which was the first successful prospective randomized trial based on the analysis of molecular findings from real-time biopsies to assign individualized targeted treatment. This trial <b>laid</b> out <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> worldwide development of personalized targeted treatments through the use of tumor profiling.|$|R
5|$|The {{tour was}} {{generally}} poorly received {{at the time}} for being overblown and pretentious. Despite the criticism, Bowie in 1991 remarked that this tour <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> later successful theatrical tours by other artists, and the set's design and the show's integration of music and theatrics has inspired later acts {{by a variety of}} artists. Starting in the late 2000s, the tour began to collect accolades for its successes, and in 2010 the tour was named one of the top concert tour designs of all time.|$|E
5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome {{can be divided into}} three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; tenant farming or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes's {{pursuit of}} the {{exclusive}} mining rights in Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the surrounding areas was motivated by his wish to annex them into the British Empire {{as part of his}} personal ambition for a Cape to Cairo Railway—winning the concession would enable him to gain a royal charter from the British government for a chartered company, empowered to annex and thereafter govern the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed on Britain's behalf. He <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> concession negotiations during early 1888 by arranging a treaty of friendship between the British and Matabele peoples and then sent Rudd's team from South Africa to obtain the rights. Rudd succeeded following a race to the Matabele capital Bulawayo against Edward Arthur Maund, a bidding-rival employed by a London-based syndicate, and after long negotiations with the king and his council of izinDuna (tribal leaders).|$|E
50|$|For three decades, the {{department}} over which this newly elected commissioner presided remained {{a very small}} agency of state government with limited duties and personnel. In 1925, {{the department}} employed a total of 15 people. In a general reorganization of the state's labor administration functions in 1931, <b>the</b> General Assembly <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> broad <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Department of Labor's subsequent, gradual development into an agency administering laws and programs affecting a majority of North Carolina citizens.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, he was {{appointed}} to a committee to advise the New York Mayor, Edward I. Koch, on the police department. The panel went on to make recommendations that included comprehensive changes in the training of police officers. Bard <b>laid</b> down <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> training police as specialists in family crisis intervention. This included training for police officers on innovative crime prevention and mental health techniques so they were better able to provide immediate crisis intervention when emergencies arose and other professionals (e.g., social workers, psychologists) were not available.|$|R
50|$|Leonardo Bruni (or Leonardo Aretino) (c. 1370 - March 9, 1444) was an Italian humanist, {{historian}} and statesman, often {{recognized as the}} most important humanist historian of the early Renaissance. He has been called the first modern historian. He was the earliest person to write using the three-period view of history: Antiquity, Middle Ages, and Modern. The dates Bruni used to define the periods are not exactly what modern historians use today, but he <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> conceptual <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> a tripartite division of history.|$|R
5|$|The papacy further refined the {{practice}} in the Mass in the Late Middle Ages, holding that the clergy alone was allowed to partake of the wine in the Eucharist. This further distanced the secular laity from the clergy. The laity continued {{the practice}}s of pilgrimages, veneration of relics, and belief {{in the power of}} the Devil. Mystics such as Meister Eckhart (d. 1327) and Thomas à Kempis (d. 1471) wrote works that taught the laity to focus on their inner spiritual life, which <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> the Protestant Reformation. Besides mysticism, belief in witches and witchcraft became widespread, and by the late 15th century the Church had begun to lend credence to populist fears of witchcraft with its condemnation of witches in 1484 and the publication in 1486 of the Malleus Maleficarum, the most popular handbook for witch-hunters.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{alternative}} rock remained mainly {{an underground}} phenomenon. While on occasion a song {{would become a}} commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In {{the case of the}} United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes {{in various parts of the}} country. Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> their success. By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and The Sugarcubes toured the United States arena circuit.|$|E
5|$|Before the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) by Sima Qian (14586 BCE), {{there existed}} terse chronicles of {{events such as}} the Spring and Autumn Annals and the chronicle found at Shuihudi {{covering}} events in the State of Qin and Qin dynasty from 306 to 217 BCE. There was also the Classic of History—part of the Confucian canon—which recorded the deeds of past rulers and political events (sometimes mythological instead of historical). However, Sima's work is considered the first of China's Standard Histories, <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> Chinese historiography by creating the first universal history of China. He divided his work of one hundred and thirty chapters into basic annals, chronological tables in grid format (with year-by-year accounts since 841 BCE, the start of the Gonghe Regency), treatises on general subjects (such as the economy and the calendar), histories of hereditary houses and states, biographies on individuals arranged in roughly chronological order, and his own autobiography as the last chapter. Being a court archivist allowed Sima to utilize eighty textual sources in addition to memorials, edicts, and stone inscriptions. These sources enhanced the enormous scope of his work, which mentions roughly four thousand people by name. He also traveled extensively to interview witnesses for more recent accounts.|$|E
60|$|Fisc. This hopeful {{business}} will be quickly spoiled, if I not take exceeding care of it.--Stay,--Towerson to be killed, and privately, {{that must be}} <b>laid</b> down as <b>the</b> <b>groundwork,</b> <b>for</b> stronger reasons than a young man's passion; but who shall do it?

50|$|In 1712, Peter the Great {{attached}} Bestuzhev to Prince Kurakin at the Utrecht Congress, that {{he might}} learn diplomacy; and {{for the same reason}} permitted him in 1713 to enter the service of the elector of Hanover. The elector, who became King George I of Great Britain, took him to London in 1714, and sent him to Saint Petersburg as his accredited minister with a notification of his accession. Bestuzhev then returned to England, where he remained four years. This period <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> necessary <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> his brilliant diplomatic career.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, he was {{project manager}} for the Universal Exposition and in 1983 {{was put in charge}} of the {{management}} of large Parisian civil state-sponsored projects. In 1986, the directors of SNCF (French State Railways) hired him to form a new architectural division. With Étienne Tricaud, he <b>laid</b> <b>the</b> theoretical <b>groundwork</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> creation of new, large stations in a contemporary style, which he saw from the points of view of both urban planning and architecture: opening up the city, intermodal transport, traffic management, accessibility and commercial development.|$|R
