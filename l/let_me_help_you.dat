She said: [...] "Mose, you're in luck; you've got a woman who'll do you good. She's loyal and she's strong, and there's nothing further for me to do--unless you <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> See here, why not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> get a start; what do you say?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Little John {{turned to}} Robin Hood. [...] "Why, how now, good master," [...] said he. [...] "Alas! Thou art in an ill plight. Marry, thy jerkin is all befouled with {{the dust of}} the road. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>thee</b> to arise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How!" [...] {{cried the}} Tanner, [...] "art thou indeed the great Robin Hood, {{and is this}} the famous Little John? Marry, had I known who thou art, I {{would never have been}} so bold as to lift my hand against <b>thee.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>thee</b> to thy feet, good Master Little John, and <b>let</b> <b>me</b> brush the dust from off thy coat." ...|$|R
6000|$|And come, now {{thou art}} going about this work, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>thee</b> in this matter. I. Ask thy heart, What evil dost thou see in sin? II. How sick art thou of sin? III. What means dust thou use to mortify thy sins? IV. How much hast thou been grieved to see others break God's law, {{and to find}} temptations in thyself to do it? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Good morning, sir!" [...] {{cried the}} Canadian. [...] "I {{am glad to}} see <b>you!</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>'elp</b> <b>you</b> hout, sir. Well, it is a {{pleasure}} to speak a little English with some one! The English close hup with the river in the autumn, but it open early this year. I 'ope you are a sign of many Americans. They are the life of our country. Without the Americans we could not live. No, sir. Not a day. Come in, come in. You will find you' room ready for you, sir." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> {{come and}} <b>help</b> <b>you,</b> I said. I can reach higher up than you can.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't understand. The {{only thing}} I {{see is that}} you're not logical. It's obvious now that you must, if possible, find the ore; and yet <b>you</b> object to <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>help.</b> If <b>you</b> give up the search and return to Toronto, {{it may be a}} very long time before you can make another trip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah, an ice-boat!" [...] cried Dick. [...] "Just the thing. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help,</b> <b>you,</b> Frank. Perhaps {{the captain}} will {{let us have}} an old camping-out tent for a sail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know," [...] {{replied the}} girl sadly. [...] "That's {{all the more}} reason you should <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> Pray don't refuse. It will--mean so much to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{wish you}} to hasten on this marriage! It {{will be better}} for you both. You love each other, and you must <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew we'd be friends," [...] {{cried the}} little one dancing about. [...] "And you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>help</b> <b>you</b> buy your things, won't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never can}} tell what Tom means,' said Mary, {{as she went}} up-stairs with Ethel. 'It was a very {{comfortable}} rest. I wish you had had the same, dear Ethel, you look so tired and worn out. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> stay and <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> It {{has been such a}} sad long day; and oh! how terrible this is! And you know him better than any of us, except Aubrey.' ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{an instant}} the grey eyes faltered. 'But that, surely,' she {{began in a}} low voice, still {{steadily}} sewing, 'that was our compact last night--that <b>you</b> should <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help,</b> that <b>you</b> should trust me just as you trusted the mother years ago who came in the little cart with the shaggy dusty pony to the homesick boy watching at the window. Perhaps,' she added, her fingers trembling, 'in this odd shuffle of souls and faces, I AM that mother, and most frightfully anxious you should not give in. Why, even because of the tiredness, even because the cause seems vain, you must still fight on--wouldn't she have said it? Surely there are prizes, a daughter, a career, no end! And even they gone--still the self undimmed, undaunted, that took its drubbing like a man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he {{said with}} intense emotion. (He {{was one of those}} big, fat men who feel deeply.) [...] "But <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> At least let me help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope, sir," [...] said Clarence, {{with a quick}} glow in his earnest face, [...] "that you'll <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you.</b> You thought I did once, you remember,--with the Indians." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said, [...] "you don't {{suppose you}} can keep those old fellows to yourselves--they're international. But hadn't we better be getting on? <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> through the gap." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{perceived}} that no moral scruple presented itself to him; {{when it came}} to the point, he was simply and naturally a lover, like any other man; and I persisted: [...] "It would only be a seven days' wonder. I never heard of a clergyman's running away to be married; but they must have sometimes done it. Come, I don't believe you'd have to plead hard with Miss Bentley, and Mrs. March and I will aid and abet you to the limit of our small ability. I'm sure that if I wrap up warm against the night air, she will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go and <b>help</b> <b>you</b> hold the rope-ladder taut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it {{is a part}} of {{the terrible}} story, a part of poor Lucy's death and all that led to it. Because in the {{struggle}} which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know. But I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery. <b>You</b> will <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help,</b> will <b>you</b> not? I know all up to a certain point, and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September, how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he will be here tomorrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us. Working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I want to <b>help</b> <b>you,</b> Jack. Please <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>help!</b> I didn't come by myself--Mr. Vannicock kept me company. He {{will make}} himself useful too, if he's not gone on. Mr. Vannicock!' ...|$|R
