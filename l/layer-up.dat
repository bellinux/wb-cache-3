40|$|In the paper, {{the authors}} discuss the {{numerical}} and experimental modal {{analysis of the}} cantilever thin-walled beams made of a carbon-epoxy laminate. Two types of beams were considered: circumferentially asymmetric stiffness (i. e., CAS) and circumferentially uniform stiffness (i. e., CUS) beams. The <b>layer-up</b> configurations of the laminate were chosen to get a vibration mode coupling effect in both analysed cases. The aim of the paper was to perform the numerical and experimental modal analysis of the composite structures, when a flapwise bending with torsion coupling effect or flapwise-chordwise bending coupling effect took place. Firstly, numerical studies by the finite element method was performed. The numerical simulations were {{carried out by the}} Lanczos method in the Abaqus software package. The natural frequencies and the corresponding free vibration modes were determined. Next, the experimental modal analyses of the CAS and CUS beams were performed. The test stand was consisted of a special grip, two beams with an adhered holder, the LMS Scadas III system with a modal hammer and an acceleration sensor. Finally, the results of both methods were compared...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally the {{precision}} placement and adhesion of optical fiber to an optical planar substrate {{has been made}} through use of solder, glass frit, glues or epoxies. These generally have disadvantages that include mechanical weakness in harsh environments (e. g. high temperature, high pressure and exposure to common solvents) and poor optical characteristics (e. g. high optical loss, high scattering and modal/refractive index mismatch with optical fiber). In this work we shall present an approach that overcomes these disadvantages, through embedding and consolidating a fiber directly upon a planar substrate layer using Flame Hydrolysis Deposition (FHD). The result is a planarized composite that is mechanically robust in harsh environments and is of planar optical quality. The deposited silica layers can be tailored in thickness, refractive index and anisotropic stress, with the ability for multiple layers to be deposited sequentially to achieve planar guiding. The technique is compatible with a lithography toolset allowing full planar integration techniques; physical micromachining capability allowing fiber evanescent field access and Bragg grating writing. The components that can be developed using this technique include precision <b>layer-up</b> fiber (e. g. high density fiber packing, precision fiber lengths and delay lines), hybrid fiber-planar devices (e. g. MOEMS, evanescent field sensors and environmentally stabilised narrow line lasers) and optical pump schemes (e. g. fiber pumping, pump strippers and mode strippers). We shall report {{the latest developments in}} fabrication, capability and component...|$|E
