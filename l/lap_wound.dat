40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{experimental}} results {{to prove that}} motor current signature analysis (MCSA) can diagnose shorted turns in low voltage stator windings of 3 -phase induction motors using LabVIEW. The diagnostic strategy is presented and variables that influence the diagnosis are discussed. Current spectra from motors with short-circuited turns (with and without short circuit current limiting resistors) are presented and fully analyzed. Results from motors tested to failure are reported. The results in this paper were from industrial motors of different pole numbers with concentric and <b>lap</b> <b>wound</b> winding designs. Since stator failures account for {{a high percentage of}} failures the results are particularly relevant to industry...|$|E
50|$|Despite {{dominating}} {{the first half}} of the race and carving his way through the field after the last yellow, Bräck was having difficulty keeping up with Dixon and he struggled to maintain pace as the <b>laps</b> <b>wound</b> down.|$|R
2500|$|As the <b>laps</b> <b>wound</b> down, Waltrip and Earnhardt, Jr. {{were running}} in {{first and second}} place, with Earnhardt Sr. behind them, {{blocking}} Marlin's attempts to pass. With less than two laps remaining, Fox commentator Darrell Waltrip noted that [...] "Sterling had beat the front end off of that ol' Dodge (Marlin's car) {{just trying to get}} around Dale Earnhardt, Sr.".|$|R
5000|$|Gidley {{was closing}} in fast on Franchitti as the <b>laps</b> <b>wound</b> down. By <b>Lap</b> 97 the only car {{between them was}} the lapped car of Michael Andretti, but as Gidley looked to {{overtake}} Andretti going into Turn 1 he locked up the brakes, losing valuable time. He finally got around Andretti on the next lap, but now Franchitti had lapped Wilson and put four seconds between them. On the last lap of the race, Franchitti was forced to slow down even more; halfway through the lap Gidley {{was able to get}} around Wilson and close the gap to first place. It was too little, too late, however, as Franchitti came out of the Turn 9-10 chicane onto the front straightaway and take the checkered flag by just three tenths of a second. Franchitti then ran out of fuel entering Turn 1.|$|R
60|$|The next pictures, {{taken at}} a great distance, showed a towering wounded soldier sitting {{by the side of}} a path, his arm in a sling, the stump of one leg extended, a crude crutch on his <b>lap.</b> Then two <b>wounded</b> soldiers, both the same, {{standing}} side by side.|$|R
50|$|Defending {{champion}} and race pole-sitter Emerson Fittipaldi dominated {{the first half}} of the race, looking to become the first back-to-back winner in 20 years. In the second half of the race, however, he fell victim to blistering tires, fell a <b>lap</b> down, and <b>wound</b> up finishing third. Bobby Rahal, the 1986 winner, was in position to win his second Indy 500, but he too suffered handling problems, which dropped him to second at the finish.|$|R
50|$|Facing a six-point {{deficit to}} Olsbergs MSE {{teammate}} Tanner Foust {{in the championship}} standings, Brian Deegan would {{need a lot of}} luck at SEMA to steal the GRC title. The track, constructed in a parking lot outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center, featured significantly more dirt than most others, and opened up the cars to put on the best show of the season. Foust and Deegan would each win their heat race on the first day, but while Foust backed it up with another win on Tuesday, Deegan would fall to the last chance qualifier after suffering a puncture in his second heat race. Despite his crew racing against the clock, Deegan would make it to the grid in time for the last chance qualifier and advance to the main event. Ken Block had been the man to beat all week, pacing the field through qualifying and his heat races and looking to win his first race of the season in the finale. He might have done so if not for an exhaust fire two laps into the main event that limited his driving, enabled Foust to pass him, and eventually put him out of the race with two laps to go, forcing a restart. It couldn't have been more fortunate for Deegan, who had been a non-factor in the first attempt and seized his second chance. He jumped {{from the back of the}} grid to the front by braking late in the first corner and began to work on chasing down Foust. But the race win and championship slipped out of reach as the <b>laps</b> <b>wound</b> down; Foust would take his second race win and championship in a row over Deegan and Rhys Millen, who earned his first career GRC podium and tied Hubinette for third in points.|$|R
5000|$|The Corona México 200 {{was held}} on April 20 at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, Mexico. Colin Braun won the pole. Kyle Busch won the race after passing Scott Pruett with nine laps remaining. Busch warned over his radio that Pruett would get dumped if he kept {{blocking}} him, {{a reference to the}} 2007 race. The win was Busch's first on a road course and his third straight Nationwide Series win. Scott Pruett led 36 of the 80 <b>laps</b> and <b>wound</b> up finishing third. Road course veteran Boris Said struggled {{for most of the day}} and was spun out by Marcos Ambrose with 28 laps remaining. The damage took Said out of the race, and he angrily pointed at Ambrose. Boris commented that [...] "He either made a mistake or he's incredibly stupid, and I don't think he'd make a big mistake like that. I wouldn't expect it from him. [...] "I'm not going to get mad, I'm just going to get even." [...] Ambrose finished the day in second place, his best finish in the Nationwide Series. This was the last race held at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez for the NASCAR Nationwide Series.|$|R
5000|$|... 1985: Mario Andretti {{started on}} the pole position, and led the first 58 laps. Andretti's {{strategy}} {{was to try to}} complete the race on one pit stop. After building up an over 10-second lead, Andretti pitted on lap 44. In order to conserve fuel, however, he subsequently dialed back his turbocharger boost. Danny Sullivan had pitted on lap 37. With Andretti slowing his pace, Sullivan went on a charge, dicing through traffic and caught up to Andretti. On the back stretch on lap 59, Sullivan took the lead, and began pulling out to a 15-second advantage. It was expected that the race would be decided between Sullivan and Andretti, with Sullivan needing one final pit stop, and Andretti gambling on going the distance. The Penske Team was planning a timed pit stop for Sullivan, hoping to fuel the car, and get back out on the track in close proximity to Andretti. On lap 79, Sullivan shockingly ran out of fuel coming out of the hairpin, and he coasted into the pits barely under power. Sullivan lost many seconds, allowing Andretti to re-take the lead. Andretti led {{the rest of the way}} and won at Long Beach for the second year in a row, and third time overall. Sullivan ran out of fuel again on the last <b>lap,</b> and <b>wound</b> up third.|$|R
5000|$|Annibale Carracci is {{probably}} most {{well known for}} his work on the Farnese Gallery Ceiling, which was commissioned a few years after this work. He incorporated elements from Venus, Adonis, & Cupid into the ceiling including another image of Venus among other mythological tales. His use of dynamics, arrangement of the composition, the style of the bodies, eye contact and gestures are once again used to convey a deep emotional connection between the figures. Carracci also studied the works of Correggio in Parma, Veronese and Tintoretto in Venice and then Rome. [...] Veronese’s Venus and Adonis (1580) depicted the scene right before Adonis dies. Adonis is lying on Venus’ <b>lap</b> after being <b>wounded</b> by the boar. Cupid Holds the dogs and Venus is glancing at him instead of looking at Adonis. Both Veronese’s and Titian’s Venus and Adonis paintings greatly influenced Annibale’s Venus, Adonis and Cupid and aided the great artist in becoming one of the great masters of Baroque Painting.|$|R
5000|$|Whitt {{had a hand}} in {{determining}} the 2016 Xfinity Series champion. Late in the Ford EcoBoost 300, a caution came out. Whitt was running eighteenth in TriStar Motorsports' No. 14 entry and on the lead lap, but the team was out of tires. Whitt's crew decided to keep him out, meaning that he would restart first, alongside Chase contender Daniel Suárez. The other three Chase contenders were near Whitt; Elliott Sadler was behind Suarez while Erik Jones and Justin Allgaier were behind Whitt. On the restart, Whitt was slow on the gas, and while Suarez and Sadler sped by, Jones and Allgaier were trapped behind Whitt, who eventually fell {{all the way back to}} eighteenth in the ten <b>laps</b> remaining. Suarez <b>wound</b> up winning the championship. Jones harshly criticized Whitt after the race, calling the move [...] "disrespectful", while Allgaier was more subdued. Whitt later apologized for the incident, saying, [...] "It's not like you mean to do it." [...] He also partially blamed Jones ramming him on the restart as to why he did not get up to speed.|$|R
5000|$|The fifth {{race of the}} 1950 {{season was}} run on May 30 at Canfield Speedway in Canfield, Ohio. The event was staged {{on the same day}} as the Indianapolis 500 — hence the {{ironically}} title [...] "Poor Man's 500". Jimmy Florian won the pole. Bill Rexford of Conewango Valley, New York stalked Curtis Turner for over half the race, then took command to win the [...] "Poor Man's 500", a 100-miler at Canfield Speedway.Rexford took the lead in the 121st lap and went on to beat runner-up Glenn Dunnaway by two laps. Lloyd Moore finished third and took the lead in the Grand National point standings by 36.5 points over Tim Flock, who finished ninth. Lee Petty crossed the finish line in fourth place and Bill Blair took fifth. The promoters did pay some lap money, with $5 going to the leader of each lap from the 101 through the 200. Rexford's earnings came to $1,400 with the lap money.Turner led the first 120 laps before his engine went sour. He departed after 133 <b>laps</b> and <b>wound</b> up 19th. A crowd of 11,000 showed up on Memorial Day and watched Al Gross, former stunt car driver for the Jimmy Lynch Thrill Show, flip his Olds in the ninth lap. Gross suffered a broken back and was taken to the hospital for an extended stay.Frank Canale posted the second fastest qualifying time but overheating problems forced him to the sidelines after 74 laps. Joe Merola was on hand with a new radically designed 1948 Tucker Torpedo, {{one of the most controversial}} and advanced automobiles ever to hit the market. The car conked out before Merola was able to complete a lap.|$|R
50|$|Race report: Starting {{from his}} second pole of the season, James Hinchcliffe led the field through Turn 1 {{on the opening}} lap as Charlie Kimball {{overhauled}} Jean-Karl Vernay for second place. The three drivers then held their respective positions {{for the duration of}} the race, as the other drivers battled behind. Sebastian Saavedra and Martin Plowman rounded out the top five placings. Dan Clarke and Junior Strous both ran into early trouble, with Clarke suffering a mechanical problem and Strous running into the barriers on Lap 9. Clarke returned to the race six <b>laps</b> down, and <b>wound</b> up thirteenth at the end of the race. Stefan Wilson suffered an electrical problem, Rodrigo Barbosa was parked after causing two of the race's four full course cautions with spins and Adrián Campos Jr. crashed heavily at Turn 1 on Lap 34, causing the third caution. Almost immediately after the race returned to green after the Campos crash, the yellow flags flew again after Gustavo Yacamán and Niall Quinn were both involved in incidents at the track's Fountain section; Yacamán having been punted from behind by Quinn's team-mate Tõnis Kasemets, while Quinn spun by himself. On the penultimate lap, Sam Schmidt Motorsports' Philip Major ran into his team-mate James Winslow, forcing the British driver into the barrier and was eventually scored in twelfth position.|$|R
