50|$|A {{frequent}} criticism made in {{the late}} 20thcentury is that the drawing depicts a man of a greater age than Leonardo himself achieved, as he {{died at the age}} of 67 and allegedly made the drawing between the age of 58 and 60. It has been suggested that the sitter represents <b>Leonardo's</b> father Piero <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> or his uncle Francesco, based on the fact they both had a long life and lived until the age of 80.|$|R
5|$|Another early {{application}} of the Reuleaux triangle, by <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> circa 1514 (or possibly {{by one of his}} followers at his direction), was a world map in which the spherical surface of the earth was divided into eight octants, each flattened into the shape of a Reuleaux triangle.|$|E

It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music.

40|$|<b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> Vinci’s Milanese {{observations}} of optics and astronomy complicated {{his understanding of}} light. Though these complications forced him to reject “tidy ” interpretations of light and optics, they ultimately allowed him to excel in the portrayal of reflection, shadow, and luminescence (Kemp, 2006). <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> Vinci’s The Last Supper demonstrates this careful study of light and the relation of light to perspective. In the work, <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> delved into the complications of optics and reflections, and its renown guided the artistic study of light by subsequent masters. From da Vinci’s personal manuscripts, accounts from his contemporaries, and present-day art historians, the iterative relationship between <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> Vinci’s study of light and study of optics becomes apparent, {{as well as how}} his study of the two fields manifested in his paintings. Upon commencement of courtly service in Milan, <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> immersed himself in a range of scholarly pursuits. Da Vinci’s artistic an...|$|R

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{has also}} been used in other styles of architecture. For instance, <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. A modern high-rise building, the Kölntriangle in Cologne, Germany, was built with a Reuleaux triangle cross-section. Together with the circular shape of its core, this gives varied depths to the rooms of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci.</b> Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E

5000|$|Swedenborg's Flying Machine {{was first}} sketched by the Swedish {{scientist}} Emanuel Swedenborg in 1714, {{when he was}} 26 years old. [...] It was later published in his periodical, Daedalus Hyperboreus, in 1716. While <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> Vinci’s designs predate those of Swedenborg, da Vinci’s manuscripts remained unknown due {{to a variety of}} circumstances until the late 19th century. So, in terms of influence, Swedenborg predated <b>da</b> <b>Vinci.</b>|$|R
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for floor tiles or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was {{the inability of the}} Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from the spirit of the Renaissance.|$|E

5|$|In 1500 polymath <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci</b> {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of <b>Leonardo</b> <b>da</b> <b>Vinci,</b> human anatomy. Underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E

5000|$|Seven {{years after}} {{this book was}} published, {{some of the ideas}} {{presented}} in this and other similar books, have become central to the best-selling novel The <b>Da</b> <b>Vinci</b> Code by Dan Brown.

Brown's reliance on The Templar Revelation is also confirmed {{by the fact that he}} imports certain factual errors from this book (see Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris for an example).|$|R
