25|$|A {{recent survey}} {{conducted}} at the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute found that 63% of individuals interested in college football preferred a playoff system to the BCS, while only 26% favored the status quo. President Barack Obama had been vocal about {{his opposition to the}} BCS. During an appearance on Monday Night Football during the 2008 presidential campaign season, ESPN's Chris Berman asked Obama to name one thing about sports he would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Obama responded that he did not like using computer rankings to determine bowl games, and he supported having a college football playoffs for the top eight teams. When Steve Kroft asked then-President-elect Obama about the subject during an interview on 60 Minutes, Obama reiterated his support of eight-team playoffs; although he has said it is not a legislative priority.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{found that}} the most {{difficult}} aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film's animation. Todd Edwards explained that [...] "it becomes an equation: 'I have 10 things that I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> in this shot. I {{have the time and}} the budget to do three. Pick those three and then let's move on.' And that was hard to do." ...|$|E

[...] Seifert said: “When I joined Miss Earth I became aware of the things I can do as a Filipino and as a citizen of the world. I would like to share this awareness with more people, whether on a personal level or through the media. I want {{to make a difference in}} every little way I can.” She nailed the competition with her answer.|$|E
5000|$|While in October 2009, Kaulitz {{was number}} 11 on German {{magazine}} GQs Best Dressed list. They cite his flamboyant style {{as one of}} the reasons he was chosen, as well as his <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> and try new things. Designer Michael Michalsky supported his decision by saying: [...] "Bill Kaulitz is unique and uncompromising, Pop-Art brought <b>to</b> life. He <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> - that is fashion." [...] For the Dsquared2 Fall/Winter 2010 fashion show, Kaulitz opened and closed the show with the song Screamin'.|$|R

2500|$|Hello Folks, Donna Deegan here. For {{those of}} you who haven't been {{watching}} this past week, where've you been? Seriously, if you haven't had the time to tune in, I have changed my name to, well, my name. So many of you have e-mailed to say [...] "Hey Donna, it's about time!" [...] Well, fortunately the station thought so too. Tim and I have been married for more than five years, and I have been Deegan everywhere but on the air since then. So why now? Well, there is no great strategy here. For some time now the station has been putting together a new look for our news opens, graphics etc. That's a big deal and very expensive so it's not done very often. While making those plans they very graciously asked if I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> my on-air name. I talked it over with my kids and with Tim and everyone said [...] "go for it" [...] so I did. That simple. The decision {{had nothing to do with}} my recent recurrence. It will be fun to see if I can actually call myself the correct name every day. Between chemo and my normal space cadet nature, I think the betting pool is in full swing.|$|E

But that she held George's hand in her own, perhaps she would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> places with....
