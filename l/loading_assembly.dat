40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{the performance of}} a modified large scale shear box apparatus, which is mainly used to execute full scale laboratory study of segmental retaining walls. A typical apparatus has already been adopted by the current ASTM and NCMA test protocols and by literature studying of those test protocols, it is found that protocols recommend a fixed vertical actuator with roller or airbag configuration as a proposed vertical <b>loading</b> <b>assembly.</b> Previous research study demonstrated that vertical loading arrangement greatly influences the interface shear capacity of block systems and fixed vertical actuator with flexible airbag shows better loading arrangement for the blocks which have dilatant behavior. However, airbag arrangement is strenuous and time-consuming <b>loading</b> <b>assembly</b> compared to fixed vertical actuator which increases normal load with shear displacement due to bending of vertical actuator locked with the top block during shear loading. For the drawbacks of fixed vertical loading arrangement, the apparatus used in this study was fully redesigned and modified in terms of normal loading arrangement specially. A moveable vertical <b>loading</b> <b>assembly</b> is used in the modified apparatus which allows the piston movement with the top blocks during shear testing. The results outlined in this paper report that normal load remains constant over the period of shear testing {{for a wide range of}} surcharge loading. It could easily be concluded that the modified apparatus might be a better alternative to the existing apparatus used in the test protocols. ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Changes in {{industries}} and work practices have coincided with work-related musculoskeletal dis-orders (MSDs). This {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of MSDs and to assess postural loading in assembly workers of an Iranian telecommunication manufacturing company. Methods. Data were collected from 193 randomly selected workers in 4 units of the company. The Nordic musculoskeletal disorders question-naire and the UBC ergonomic checklist were used as data collection tools. Loading on the upper body assess-ment (LUBA) was used to assess postural loading. Results. Lower back symptoms were the most prevalent problems among the workers (67. 9 %). LUBA showed that most assembly workers (94. 3 %) had experienced considerable and high postural loading (postural load index, PLI> 5). Regression analyses revealed that light-ing, rotation, contact stress, repetition, gender and age were factors associated with symptoms. Conclusion. Work-related MSDs occurred at a high rate among workers. Postural loading requires consideration. Any ergonomic intervention should focus on eliminating ergonomic factors associated with symptoms. musculoskeletal disorders postural <b>loading</b> <b>assembly</b> workers LUBA 1...|$|E

40|$|With recent {{focus on}} {{sustainable}} construction practices and the ever-increasing transportation cost and scarcity of natural resources, use of unconventional aggregate materials, such as primary crusher run and concrete demolition waste, have become viable {{for the construction}} of pavement working platforms over very weak and often wet subgrade soils. To this end, a research study was undertaken at the Illinois Center for Transportation to evaluate the adequacy and field performances of such large-sized aggregate materials and validate new material specifications. A state-of-the-art image analysis technique was utilized to characterize the size and morphological properties, e. g. shape, texture and angularity of two large-sized aggregates, referred to herein as primary crusher run and crushed concrete. For the field evaluation, full-scale test sections were constructed with these large-sized aggregate materials over a very weak engineered subgrade and subjected to accelerated pavement testing. Construction quality control was achieved through in-place density and modulus measurements on conventional aggregate capping surface layers using nuclear gauge, lightweight deflectometer and soil stiffness gauge type devices. Periodic rut measurements were carried out on the pavement surface throughout the accelerated loading process using an Accelerated Transportation <b>Loading</b> <b>Assembly</b> (ATLAS). Contributions of the underlying pavement layers to the total rut accumulation was evaluated through innovative applications of ground penetrating radar (GPR), a light weight penetrometer device, known as the French Panda, as well as a geo-endoscopy probe.

40|$|The ongoing {{development}} towards increasing functional {{density and}} performance drives {{the improvement of}} IC packaging and interconnection technologies. However, new integration technologies, such as through silicon vias (TSVs) for 3 D stacking for heterogeneous systems as well as rigid micro-bumps together with the utilization of delicate new (porous ultra low-k) materials weaken the mechanical stability. As a result, the risks of cracking or delaminations increase e. g. in back-end-of-line (BEOL) structures or in the surrounding of TSVs. Chip package interaction (CPI) under thermal <b>loading,</b> <b>assembly</b> loading as well as residual stresses from different processing steps provide the dominating thermo-mechanical stress situations. In this field, qualified Finite Element Modeling (FEM) techniques play a well accepted key role to manage damage, cracking and delamination risks in the package design phase and also during failure tolerance optimization. Well defined/measured materials properties, loadings, boundary conditions and residual stresses from manufacturing are preconditions {{to ensure the quality}} of simulation results. Unfortunately, stress/strain singularities at certain locations within the designs under investigation call for advanced approaches taking into account the stress singularities, i. e., fracture mechanics approaches, instead. The contribution explains classic fracture mechanics approaches for bulk fracture and material interface delamination investigations as well as their recently realized extensions and current limitations. In contrast, advanced approaches allowing the simulation of crack initiation and propagation like cohesive zone modeling (CZM) and extended FEM (X-FEM) will be explained and discussed with respect to their advantages/disadvantages. Their benefits for the thermo-mechanical reliability optimization will be explained with the aid of 3 D IC-integration, TSV and a smart lighting assembly, in detail...|$|E
40|$|Interface bonding between hot-mix asphalt (HMA) {{overlays}} and Portland {{cement concrete}} (PCC) pavements {{is one of}} the most significant factors affecting overlay service life. This study was performed to quantify the effects of HMA type, tack coat type, tack coat application rate, and PCC surface texture on the interface bonding and overlay performance through laboratory testing, accelerated pavement testing (APT), and numerical modeling. This report presents the outcomes of the APT, as well as the numerical modeling of pavement interfaces. The results of the laboratory testing are covered in a companion report. The APT built on and validated previously completed laboratory tests where an HMA overlay was placed on top of an existing PCC pavement having various surface textures including smooth, transverse tined, longitudinal tined, and milled. In addition, zebra sections were included to evaluate the effect of non-uniform tack coat application. Asphalt emulsion SS- 1 hP and cutback asphalt RC- 70 were applied at three residual application rates, 0. 02, 0. 04, and 0. 09 gal/yd 2 (0. 09, 0. 18, and 0. 41 L/m 2); asphalt binder PG 64 - 22 was applied at 0. 04 gal/yd 2 (0. 41 L/m 2). Two HMA designs, standard binder mix and moisture sensitive binder mix, were used along with the three tack coats. Twenty-five pavement test sections were constructed and loaded with the Accelerated Transportation <b>Loading</b> <b>ASsembly</b> (ATLAS) at the centerline. The tensile strains at the bottom of HMA, to quantify potential interface slippage, were measured for selective sections, and primary HMA rutting was analyzed for all sections. The APT results validated laboratory determined optimum tack coat application rate, which provided the lowest interface strain and surface rutting in the field. Both PG 64 - 22 and SS- 1 hP showed better rutting resistance than RC- 70. Milled PCC surface provided lower rutting than transverse-tined and smooth surfaces. The field testing also showed that PCC cleaning methods play an important role in the HMA-PCC bonding. Higher rutting depth was measured in sections with uneven tack coat distribution compared to that with uniform tack coat distribution. Field testing results don???t show enough evidence to prove that using a moisture-sensitive mix will result in higher HMA surface rutting.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A multifunctional structural polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell was designed, developed and manufactured. The structural fuel cell was designed to represent the rear rib section of an aircraft wing. Custom membrane electrode assemblies (MEA s) were manufactured in house. Each MEA had an active area of 25 cm 2. The platinum loading on each electrode (anode and cathode) was 0. 5 mg/cm 2. Sandwiched between the electrodes was a Nafion 212 electrolyte membrane. Additional components of the structural fuel included metallic bipolar plates and end plates. Initially all the components were manufactured from aluminium {{in order for the}} structural fuel cell to closely represent an aircraft wing rib. However due to corrosion problems the bipolar plate had to be manufactured from marine grade 361 L stainless steel with a protective coating system. A number of different protective coating systems were tried with wood nickel strike, followed by a 5 µm intermediate coat of silver and a 2 µm gold top coat being the most successful. Full fuel cell experimental setup was developed which included balance of plant, data acquisition and control unit, and a mechanical <b>loading</b> <b>assembly.</b> Loads were applied to the structural fuel cells tip to achieve a static deflection of ± 7 mm and dynamic deflections of ± 3 mm, ± 5 mm, and ± 7 mm. Static and dynamic torsion induced 1 ° to 5 ° of twist to the structural fuel cell tip. Polarisation curves were produced for each load case. Finite element analysis was used to determine the structural fuel cell displacement, and stress / strain over the range of mechanical loads. The structural fuel cells peak power performance dropped 3. 9 % from 5. 5 watts to 5. 3 watts during static bending and 2 % from 6. 2 watts to 6. 1 watts during static torsion. During dynamic bending (2000 cycles) the structural fuel cell peak power performance dropped 11 % from 6. 7 watts to 6 watts (3 mm deflection at 190 N), 23 % from 6. 3 watts to 4. 8 watts (5 mm deflection at 270 N), and 41 % from 7. 2 watts to 5 watts (7 mm deflection at 350 N). During dynamic torsion (2000 cycles) the structural fuel cell peak power performance dropped 16 % from 6 watts to 5. 1 watt (3 ° of torsional loading), and 30 % from 6. 4 watts to 4. 3 watts (5 ° of torsional loading). The simulated (finite element modelling) displacement of - 6. 6 mm (At maximum bending load of 364. 95 N) was within 9 % of the actual measured displacement of - 7. 2 mm at 364. 95 N. Furthermore the majority of the simulated strain values were within 10 % of the actual measured strain for the structural fuel cell...|$|E
