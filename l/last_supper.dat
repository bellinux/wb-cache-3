5|$|According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas Iscariot was {{a disciple}} of Jesus. Before the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper,</b> Judas {{went to the}} chief priests and agreed to hand over Jesus in {{exchange}} for 30 silver coins. Jesus was then arrested in Gethsemane, where Judas revealed Jesus' identity to the soldiers by giving him a kiss.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, another {{investigation}} was {{undertaken by the}} States forensic labs of the Netherlands using up-to-date techniques, including gas chromatography, to formally confirm the origin of six van Meegeren forgeries that had been alleged to be genuine Vermeers, including the Emmaus and the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> The conclusions of the 1946 commission were again reaffirmed and upheld by the Dutch judicial system.|$|E
5|$|John lacks {{scenes from}} the synoptics such as Jesus' baptism, the calling of the Twelve, exorcisms, parables, the Transfiguration, and the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> Conversely, it {{includes}} scenes {{not found in the}} synoptics, including Jesus turning water into wine at the wedding at Cana, the resurrection of Lazarus, Jesus washing the feet of his disciples, and multiple visits to Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b>|$|E
5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja {{used the}} camera to emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, his first work, used long shots to show the main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel {{closed in}} 1988 and, in 1991, Hardee opened the Up The Creek comedy club in Creek Road, Greenwich. In an upstairs {{bar at the}} club was a mural {{commissioned}} by Hardee as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci's The <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> It showed Hardee as Christ with Jo Brand, Julian Clary and other famous British comedians as the Disciples including Ben Elton as Judas Iscariot.|$|E

60|$|March did {{not notice}} the {{vanishing}} Socialist. He was watching, with a teasing sense of familiarity, a tall, shabbily dressed, elderly man, who had just come in. He had the aquiline profile uncommon among Germans, and yet March recognized him at once as German. His long, soft beard and mustache had once been fair, and they kept some tone of their yellow in the gray to which they had turned. His eyes were full, and his lips and chin shaped the beard to the noble outline which shows in the beards the Italian masters liked to paint for their <b>Last</b> <b>Suppers.</b> His carriage was erect and soldierly, and March presently {{saw that he had}} lost his left hand. He took his place at a table where the overworked waiter found time to cut up his meat and put everything in easy reach of his right hand.|$|R

5|$|Thirty {{pieces of}} silver was {{the price for}} which Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus, {{according}} to an account in the Gospel of Matthew 26:15 in the New Testament. Before the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper,</b> Judas {{is said to have}} gone to the chief priests and agreed to hand over Jesus in exchange for 30 silver coins, and to have returned the money afterwards, filled with remorse.|$|E
5|$|Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty and Evans {{passed over}} the Simplon Pass and on to Milan, where they viewed Leonardo's The <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> and visited the Brera Gallery. After a sixteen-day {{cabriolet}} ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached Florence, where they stayed for two days visiting the city's galleries. On 10August, the two men finally reached Rome.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper,</b> and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did--ah--take <b>supper</b> <b>last</b> night, it is true," [...] he said. [...] "But if I am {{a little}} pale to-day, {{that is not the}} cause. Things have {{occurred}} to annoy me intensely." ...|$|R
60|$|Smike had scraped a meal {{together}} from the remnant of <b>last</b> night's <b>supper,</b> and was anxiously awaiting his return. The occurrences {{of the morning}} had not improved Nicholas's appetite, and, by him, the dinner remained untasted. He {{was sitting in a}} thoughtful attitude, with the plate which the poor fellow had assiduously filled with the choicest morsels, untouched, by his side, when Newman Noggs looked into the room.|$|R
60|$|In due course, {{however, the}} <b>last</b> waltz before <b>supper</b> came round, and he, as agreed upon, danced {{it with his}} hostess. As the strains of the music died away, {{the doors of the}} supper-room and tent were thrown open.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1938, van Meegeren moved to Nice, using the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} The Supper at Emmaus to buy a 12-bedroom estate at Les Arènes de Cimiez. On the walls of the estate hung several genuine Old Masters. Two of his better forgeries were made here, Interior with Cardplayers and Interior with Drinkers, both displaying the signature of Pieter de Hooch. During his time in Nice, he painted his <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> I in the style of Vermeer.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} pieces is a large dish weighing , in the centre of which is a relief depiction of the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper.</b> Around the edge at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} {{religious instruction}} for various ages, leads a choir and football team and celebrates the Holy Thursday <b>Last</b> <b>Supper,</b> believers' marriages and funerals. Baptism is practiced by immersion with the pastor's approval, and {{is reserved for}} people aged over 15years. Fasting on two Sundays a month and between eight and ten conventions per year for each church are also scheduled. The church participates in social and humanitarian activities and organizes recreational days, including activities such as theater, library, trips, a clothing exchange and a paint shop.|$|E

5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was, and is, renowned {{primarily}} as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> the most reproduced religious painting of all time. Leonardo's drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon, being reproduced on items {{as varied as the}} euro coin, textbooks, and T-shirts. Perhaps fifteen of his paintings have survived. Nevertheless, these few works, together with his notebooks, which contain drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on the nature of painting, compose a contribution to later generations of artists rivalled only by that of his contemporary, Michelangelo.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{worked in}} Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was {{commissioned}} {{to paint the}} Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The <b>Last</b> <b>Supper</b> for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie. In the spring of 1485, Leonardo travelled to Hungary on behalf of Ludovico to meet Matthias Corvinus, for whom he {{is believed to have}} painted a Holy Family. Between 1493 and 1495, Leonardo listed a woman called Caterina among his dependents in his taxation documents. When she died in 1495, the list of funeral expenditures suggests that she was his mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not till we have breakfast," [...] said Bastin. [...] "I {{will get}} out a pig. As a matter of fact, I had no <b>supper</b> <b>last</b> night, as I was taking a class of native boys and making some {{arrangements}} of my own." ...|$|R
