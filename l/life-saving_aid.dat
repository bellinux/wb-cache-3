5000|$|Founder Enrique Morones has {{received}} several death threats {{from those who}} disagree with Border Angels and its stance on undocumented migrants. Critics argue that Border Angels provides assistance to migrants who break U.S. immigration laws. Border Angels, however, provides only <b>life-saving,</b> humanitarian <b>aid</b> and notifies the U.S. Border Patrol before each desert water drop. It maintains a cordial working relationship with Border Patrol officers, [...] {{as evidenced by the}} annual Children's Day celebrations and weekly events held in coordination with the Border Patrol at Border Field State Park, which is maintained by Border Patrol.|$|R
50|$|In February 2007, Joint Communications {{implemented}} an Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMD) program {{utilizing the}} protocol-based Medical Priority Dispatch System {{created by the}} National Academies of Emergency Dispatch. This program allows dispatchers to quickly and accurately determine the nature of an emergency medical call and prioritize it {{to allow for the}} most appropriate response. Joint Communications's dispatchers are trained to provide real-time instruction of CPR and other <b>life-saving</b> first <b>aid</b> while simultaneously dispatching Emergency Medical Service (EMS) professionals to the emergency. This reduces the time between the onset of symptoms and when basic aid is provided to the patient, thus increasing the patient's chances of survival in life-threatening emergencies.|$|R
50|$|Basic principles, such as knowing {{to use an}} {{adhesive}} bandage or applying direct {{pressure on}} a bleed, are often acquired passively through life experiences. However, to provide effective, <b>life-saving</b> first <b>aid</b> interventions requires instruction and practical training. This is especially true where it relates to potentially fatal illnesses and injuries, {{such as those that}} require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR); these procedures may be invasive, and carry a risk of further injury to the patient and the provider. As with any training, it is more useful if it occurs before an actual emergency, and in many countries, emergency ambulance dispatchers may give basic first aid instructions over the phone while the ambulance is on the way.|$|R
5000|$|To {{prevent the}} delay of <b>life-saving</b> <b>aid</b> from bystanders, many {{states of the}} USA have [...] "Good Samaritan laws" [...] which protect {{civilian}} responders who choose to assist in an emergency.

40|$|Abstract: Cardio-pulmonary {{resuscitation}} (CPR) is a <b>life-saving</b> first <b>aid</b> {{which is}} part of the treatment given in case of sudden cardiac death. According to the American Heart Association (AHA) 2005 Guidelines for CPR, there are three key components related to the chest compressions which should be considered: (i) optimal compression depth between 3. 8 and 5. 4 centimeters; (ii) optimal compression rate between 85 and 115 compressions per minute; (iii) complete chest recoil by releasing all pressure from the chest after each chest compression (CC). A device for automatic control of the quality of chest compressions during CPR was developed. It embedded hardware and software solutions for simultaneous measurement of the depth, rate and the chest recoil thus providing a feedback about the efficiency of the cardiac massage at each CC compression. The system is applicable as a training device for basic education in CPR or as a consulting system for rescuers on the scene of the cardiac incident. The accuracy of the CC Device was adjusted by theoretical and experimental calibration, and tested by planned experiments, as well as experiments with a medical team...|$|R
40|$|Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation {{is indeed}} an {{important}} <b>life-saving</b> first <b>aid</b> skills practiced throughout the world. It {{is perhaps the}} only known effective method of keeping a victim of cardiac arrest alive long enough for definitive treatment to be delivered. When trained in CPR, children and adolescents can {{recognize the need for}} care and administer CPR and it has been established to be successful in saving victims life when effectively performed. This study adopted quasi-experimental design aimed at assessing the CPR knowledge among four purposively selected secondary schools in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State of Nigeria before and after training in CPR. Four hundred (400) students were drawn from the schools and copies of the self-administered questionnaire were given to the participants before and after the training in CPR to respond to. At the end of the exercise,. 322 questionnaires were found to have been properly filled, giving a response rate of 80. 5 %. The findings revealed that the level of pre-training knowledge was 8. 9 % compared to post training knowledge of 88. 6 %. The knowledge difference between pre and post training in CPR was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). It was concluded that Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation training was possible among Nigerian students and should be incorporated in Nigerian school curriculum in line with best practices as recommended by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. In {{the event}} of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) early {{intervention}} provided by a layperson can be <b>life-saving.</b> Teaching first <b>aid</b> in primary school may increase the lifelong ability and motivation of young people to take action in an emergency. Objective. The aim {{of this article is}} to report a training experience on BLSD (Basic Life Support and Defibrillation) designed for a group of pupils in an Italian primary school, with assessment of its effectiveness at a distance. Methods. The assessment was carried out using a multiple choice questionnaire on a sample of 130 pupils aged 11 - 12, 62 trained in BLSD and 68 as a control group. The trained group also performed an emergency simulation to assess their learning of practical skills. Results. Using the t test, significant differences emerged in the questionnaire scores between the case-control group. The results of the skill test were positive, even for the most difficult manoeuvres such as opening airways, assessing breathing, or using an AED (Automated External Defibrillator). Conclusion. Although there are still some open questions regarding the ability to retain these skills in the medium/long term, the study shows that life-saving manoeuvres can be effectively taught to primary school pupils...|$|R
5000|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Cpl. Bennett distinguished himself while serving as a platoon medical aidman with the 2d Platoon, Company B, during a reconnaissance-in-force mission. On 9 February the platoon was moving to assist the 1st Platoon of Company D which had run into a North Vietnamese ambush when it became heavily engaged by the intense small arms, automatic weapons, mortar and rocket fire from a well fortified and numerically superior enemy unit. In the initial barrage of fire, 3 of the point members of the platoon fell wounded. Cpl. Bennett, with complete disregard for his safety, ran through the heavy fire to his fallen comrades, administered <b>life-saving</b> first <b>aid</b> under fire and then made repeated trips carrying the wounded men to positions of relative safety from which they would be medically evacuated from the battle position. Cpl. Bennett repeatedly braved the intense enemy fire moving across open areas to give aid and comfort to his wounded comrades. He valiantly exposed himself to the heavy fire in order to retrieve the bodies of several fallen personnel. Throughout the night and following day, Cpl. Bennett moved from position to position treating and comforting the several personnel who had suffered shrapnel and gunshot wounds. On 11 February, Company B again moved in an assault on the well fortified enemy positions and became heavily engaged with the numerically superior enemy force. Five members of the company fell wounded in the initial assault. Cpl. Bennett ran to their aid without regard to the heavy fire. He treated 1 wounded comrade and began running toward another seriously wounded man. Although the wounded man was located forward of the company position covered by heavy enemy grazing fire and Cpl. Bennett was warned {{that it was impossible to}} reach the position, he leaped forward with complete disregard for his safety to save his comrade's life. In attempting to save his fellow soldier, he was mortally wounded. Cpl. Bennett's undaunted concern for his comrades at the cost of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the U.S. Army.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{development}} of Aircraft Collision Avoidance Technology (ACAT) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), a need arose to transition the <b>life-saving</b> technology to <b>aid</b> the general aviation community. Considering the realistic cost of implementation, {{it was decided that}} the technology should be adapted to function on any smartphone, using that device as an end-to-end solution to sense, process, and alert the pilot to imminent threats. In September of 2012, the SAS (Sense and Survive) Senior Project Team at California Polytechnic University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo was assigned the task of using smartphone technology to accurately sense the flight environment and supply usable data to the collision avoidance algorithm. This report outlines the ideation, design selection, and development that the team of students progressed through in the process of determining the feasibility of using a mobile smartphone device to determine attitude and position as algorithm input parameters. Furthermore, this report includes all plans for design verification and product implementation with regards to this teamâ€™s task. It was the conclusion of this team that due to the sensitivity of the phoneâ€™s internal sensors to noise, complimentary and simple low-pass filtering methods are insufficient in terms of determining accurate attitude. However, it is possible to achieve accurate position using GPS sensors. With better filtered GPS data, it could be possible to determine attitude based on flight path. The final product of this process and any results produced by the SAS Senior Project Team was presented at the Senior Project Exposition at Cal Poly on May 30, 2013. Everything produced and all intellectual property relating to this project is the property of NASA, {{and the members of the}} ACAT team will be responsible for any further development and implementation of this technology...|$|R
40|$|For ships at sea. {{satellites}} {{provide the}} only option for high data rate (HDR), long haul communications. Furthermore the demand for HDR satellite communications (SATCOM) for military and commercial ships. and other offshore platforms is increasing. Presently the bulk of this maritime HDR SATCOM connectivity is provided via C-band and X-band. However, the shipboard antenna sizes required to achieve a data rate of, say T 1 (1. 544 Mbps) with present C-/X-band SATCOM systems range from seven to ten feet in diameter. This limits the classes of ships to which HDR services can be provided to those which are {{large enough to accommodate}} the massive antennas. With its high powered K/Ka-band spot beams, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) was able to provide T I and higher rate services to ships at sea using much smaller shipboard antennas. This paper discusses three shipboard HDR SATCOM demonstrations that were conducted with ACTS between 1996 and 1998. The first demonstration involved a 2 Mbps link provided to the seismic survey ship MN Geco Diamond equipped with a 16 -inch wide, 4. 5 -inch tall, mechanically steered slotted waveguide array antenna developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In this February 1996 demonstration ACTS allowed supercomputers ashore to process Geco Diamond's voluminous oceanographic seismic data in near real time. This capability allowed the ship to adjust its search parameters on a daily basis based on feedback from the processed data, thereby greatly increasing survey efficiency. The second demonstration was conducted on the US Navy cruiser USS Princeton (CG 59) with the same antenna used on Geco Diamond. Princeton conducted a six-month (January-July 1997) Western Hemisphere solo deployment during which time T 1 connectivity via ACTS provided the ship with a range of valuable tools for operational, administrative and quality-of-life tasks. In one instance, video teleconferencing (VTC) via ACTS allowed the ship to provide <b>life-saving</b> emergency medical <b>aid,</b> assisted by specialists ashore. to a fellow mariner - the Master of a Greek cargo ship. The third demonstration set what {{is believed to be the}} all-time SATCOM data rate record to a ship at sea, 45 Mbps in October 1998. This Lake Michigan (Chicago area) demonstration employed one of ACTS' fixed beams and involved the smallest of the three vessels, the 45 -foot Bayliner M/V Entropy equipped with a modified commercial-off-the-shelf one-meter antenna. A variety of multi-media services were provided to Entropy through a stressing range of sea states. These three demonstrations provided a preview of the capabilities that could be provided to future mariners on a more routine basis when K/Ka-band SATCOM systems are widely deployed...|$|R
