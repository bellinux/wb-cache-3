30|$|Before the line-up scent identification, all the canines were {{subjected}} to attractivity tests (AT) (see Fig.  2). The sense and details of the attractivity test {{as well as the}} standard human scent identification <b>line-up</b> <b>procedure</b> are described in many studies (e.g., (Pinc et al. 2011; Santariová et al. 2016; Schoon and Haak 2002; Vyplelová et al. 2014).|$|E
30|$|The canines {{were able}} to {{identify}} individual persons successfully using different scent fractions. From this fact, it follows that one scent trace can contain more than only one group of scent compounds {{that can be used for}} scent identification by the trained canines. This observed phenomenon was named as “the multiplicity of the human scent signature” in this study. The scent identification <b>line-up</b> <b>procedure</b> provided the following results: The poorly volatile fraction resulted in an 85 % success rate in the scent identification procedure. The middle fraction resulted in a 58 % success rate, and the highly volatile fraction resulted in a 30 % success rate.|$|E
30|$|The {{essential}} aim of {{this study}} was to specify the group of chemical compounds that specially trained canines use for the scent identification of persons. Therefore, scent samples from 11 volunteers were split into three disjointed fractions using a gas chromatograph connected with a preparative fraction collector (GC-PFC). These scent fractions were subjected to a scent identification line-up using specially trained canines to determine which fraction contains the active scent signature. The volunteers were chosen to be the same type, therefore the same sex, age (approximately 22 [*]years old), and the same European ethnicity, to eliminate possible effects of the “class identification” in our identification <b>line-up</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
40|$|Background Although {{previous}} {{research has indicated that}} sequential <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> result in fewer mistaken identifications, this was found to be at the expense of accurate identifications more typical within simultaneous procedures. Hence, there remains a lack of agreement about which procedure is superior, and the interaction such procedures have with eyewitness confidence. The interaction between witness demographics and identification accuracy also remains unclear. Participants and procedure The opportunistic sample, consisting of 60 people from the general population, was divided randomly into two experimental conditions: simultaneous (SIM) and sequential (SEQ). Participants in the sequential procedure observed 12 photographs, one at a time, deciding if they believed the suspect to be the person shown in the current photograph and unable to return to a given picture once they decided the individual shown was not the suspect described. Participants in the simultaneous condition were shown all 12 photographs concurrently and asked to determine which, if any, of the photographs was the suspect described. Results No significant differences were found in identification accuracy between <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures,</b> but significant differences in confidence levels between the two <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> were found. Additionally, analysis of demographic features showed previous line-up experience to be significantly associated with identification accuracy. Conclusions The present research provides new insight into the interaction of eyewitness confidence between line-up techniques, offering an alternative explanation of witness confidence as well as procedural fairness. Evidence of practice effects increasing the accuracy of identification provides beneficial future implications for police <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> and safer jury decisions, often reliant on identification evidence...|$|R

40|$|When {{participants}} {{are asked to}} provide confidence judgments for each provided alternative in a multiple-choice memory task, such judgments are inflated if assessed alternatives are accompanied by an implausible (dud) alternative. This finding, termed the dud-alternative effect, has been recently documented in a memory setting with a <b>line-up</b> <b>procedure</b> (Charman, Wells, & Joy, 2011). In the present study we develop a novel paradigm to investigate the dud- alternative effect in memory. The paradigm utilizes a multiple-choice associative recognition task in which dud alternatives can be rejected {{on the basis of}} their unfamiliarity. In two experiments we demonstrate a reliable dud-alternative effect with our novel procedure. The results demonstrate that the dud-alternative effect in episodic memory is not limited to tasks based on perceptual factors but is a general phenomenon concerning confidence judgments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{cognitive processes}} theories with {{special emphasis on}} those affecting recognition and identification of human faces, introduces the issue of eyewitness testimony {{and the issue of}} methods and techniques of criminal identification proven in forensic science and actually in use in police work.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Eyewitness identification evidence is less reliable than it could be. This project investigates one {{potential source of}} eyewitness error - a witness' spontaneous tendency to like or dislike lineup members – and explores ways to reduce this bias. The underlying idea is simple: Witnesses {{may be more likely}} to identify a lineup member they don’t like as the perpetrator, and less likely to identify line-up members they like. We call this liking bias. Four experiments - extending pilot work providing the first evidence of liking bias - seek to enhance our understanding of this phenomenon. This research aims to: Understand the basis of liking bias (eg, can liking be reduced to physical attractiveness, or does it have a broader basis?). Investigate variables that affect the strength of liking bias. Biasing effects on identification decisions increase as the quality of the underlying memory decreases. Consequently, liking bias should be stronger with poorer witnessing conditions, and with longer delays between witnessing and identification. Explore ways to reduce liking bias. This will include explicitly warning witnesses of potential liking bias effects, as well as testing the degree to which existing <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> (including the VIPER procedure used in the UK) enhance/attenuate liking bias...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the world's first commercial 155 MBit/s 8 -PSK satellite modem compatible with existing 72 MHz satellite transponders. Applications include fiber restoration; bringing B-ISON to remote or temporary sites; SOH broadcasting. The design relies on an advanced coding/modulation scheme and state-of-the-art signal processing to achieve excellent power/bandwidth performance and robust synchronisation. The IF-loop back BER 1 F is 10 - 10 @ Eb/No = 7. 95 dB, corresponding to a modem implementation loss of only 0. 4 dB. The error-correction scheme {{consists of a}} rate 8 / 9 six-dimensional trellis code with 64 states, plus a rate 235 / 255 Reed-Solomon outer code. Both classical symbol interleaving and a novel bit error despreader are used to match inner and outer code. The soft-decision trellis decoder is built around a single standard CMOS Viterbi decoder chip. A new 8 PSK carrier synchronisation algorithm achieves the Cramer-Rao performance bound at SNR near the coding threshold. The RF performance over non-linear satellite channels has been assessed with an INTELSAT VI Satellite Simulator, and during field tests between UK and Canada over an INTELSAT-VA. These tests demonstrate that the modem is robust {{in the presence of}} channel impairments. In particular it was shown that standard <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> are adequate, and no special channel equalisation is needed...|$|R
40|$|Establishing an {{association}} between the scent a perpetrator left {{at a crime scene}} to the odor of the suspect of that crime is the basis for the use of human scent identification evidence in a court of law. Law enforcement agencies gather evidence through the collection of scent from the objects that a perpetrator may have handled during the execution of the criminal act. The collected scent evidence is consequently presented to the canines for identification <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> with the apprehended suspects. Presently, canine scent identification is admitted as expert witness testimony, however, the accurate behavior of the dogs and the scent collection methods used are often challenged by the court system. The primary focus of this research project entailed an evaluation of contact and non-contact scent collection techniques with an emphasis on the optimization of collection materials of different fiber chemistries to evaluate the chemical odor profiles obtained using varying environment conditions to provide a better scientific understanding of human scent as a discriminative tool in the identification of suspects. ^ The collection of hand odor from female and male subjects through both contact and non-contact sampling approaches yielded new insights into the types of VOCs collected when different materials are utilized, which had never been instrumentally performed. Furthermore, the collected scent mass was shown to be obtained in the highest amounts for both gender hand odor samples on cotton sorbent materials. Compared to non-contact sampling, the contact sampling methods yielded a higher number of volatiles, an enhancement of up to 3 times, as well as a higher scent mass than non-contact methods by more than an order of magnitude. The evaluation of the STU- 100 as a non-contact methodology highlighted strong instrumental drawbacks that need to be targeted for enhanced scientific validation of current field practices. These results demonstrated that an individual 2 ̆ 7 s human scent components vary considerably depending on the method used to collect scent from the same body region. This study demonstrated the importance of collection medium selection as well as the collection method employed in providing a reproducible human scent sample {{that can be used to}} differentiate individuals. ...|$|R
40|$|A live showup (known as {{a street}} {{identification}} in the UK) allows the perpetrator {{to be identified}} shortly after a street crime. If the suspect disputes the identification, a video line-up often ensues. Four experiments examined the reliability of live showups and their influence on a subsequent video <b>line-up</b> using realistic <b>procedures</b> and conditions. Similar proportions of culprits and innocent suspects were identified from live showups and video line-ups. Both culprits and innocent suspects previously identified {{were likely to be}} identified again in a subsequent line-up, with delays from a few minutes to a month. Only a weak effect of clothing bias was observed. There was strong evidence of commitment to a previous identification but no reliable evidence of source monitoring errors. The results suggest that a live showup is not less fair than a line-up, but the use of repeated identification procedures introduces an unfair bias against innocent suspects. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Research {{concerning}} administrator {{effects and}} the wider field of experimenter expectancy effects (Rosenthal, 1976) has established {{the theory that the}} hypotheses and knowledge held by an experimenter can unconsciously influence their results. Therefore, in a novel use of a photographic line-up from an actual police investigation, this research aims to explore the impact of administrator effects without the memory component of a recalled event. Previous research in this area has used a traditional memory paradigm to test administrator effects, however this has clouded the issue of whether the witness is being influenced by the administrator or is actually remembering the event. This research removes the memory component and therefore concentrates on the expectancy effect of the administrator. In order to further the understanding of administrator effects, this research examines whether there is an aspect of interpersonal behaviour which predisposes some individuals to be more susceptible to inferences from others, or predisposes some to be more likely to influence individuals than others. In order to do this the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation: Behaviour (FIRO-B) instrument is utilised to examine the interpersonal relationship behaviour of the administrator and the participant. This research also identifies the cues emitted by the administrator by audio-recording the interaction between the administrator and the participant. Using an experimental design, which manipulated the knowledge of the location of the target, five hundred and twenty six participants were asked to identify the person responsible for the Lockerbie bombing. Line-up administrators, who were either informed of the location of the suspect, informed of the location of an alternative suspect, or uninformed of the location of the suspect, presented the participants with the photographic line-up of twelve men, one of which {{is believed to be the}} person responsible for the Lockerbie bombing. Participants were asked to pick the person they thought was the suspect from the line-up, they then completed the FIRO-B questionnaire. Analysis of the frequency of identifications suggests the presence of an experimenter expectancy effect. A chi-square goodness of fit test indicates that significantly more participants identified the target suspect when the administrator was informed of the location of the target, than when the administrator was uninformed. Analysis of the FIRO-B data found that target identifiers in the informed condition reported significantly higher received control scores than non-identifiers from an informed condition matched comparison group. Target identifiers also reported significantly higher social interactivity and received inclusion scores than non-identifiers. Analysis of the FIRO-B data from the line-up administrators found subtle differences in the FIRO-B scores of the administrators achieving a high number of target identifications compared to administrators achieving a low number of target identifications. In particular, administrators achieving a high number of target identifications reported higher levels of expressed control and lower levels of received control than administrators achieving a low number of target identifications. Analysis of the transcripts of the line-ups indicate that administrators in the informed condition interacted with their participants for longer, and exhibited more verbal cues. Administrators who obtained a target identification also spoke to their participants for longer. Those administrators who spoke to their participants for longer reported higher levels of expressed control and lower levels of received control. The results of this study point to an experimenter expectancy effect. Beyond that though there appears to be an aspect of interpersonal behaviour that may be responsible for a predisposition to influence or to be influenced. This thesis, in line with previous research advocates the use of ‘double-blind’ <b>line-up</b> <b>procedures</b> in order to eradicate the possibility of an administrator effect. However, it also highlights the importance of considering the social interaction between the experimenter and the participant that is at the heart of social psychology research with human participants. In particular, the damning effect on the results of research conducted by an experimenter who assumes the dominant role in a social interaction, with a participant who assumes the submissive role...|$|R
