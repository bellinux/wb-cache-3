5|$|Hansell's first duty {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 2nd Bombardment Group at <b>Langley</b> Field, testing repaired aircraft. In June 1930, he spent three months temporary duty with the 6th Field Artillery at Fort Hoyle, Maryland. In September 1930, he returned to <b>Langley</b> Field and was detached to the Air Corps Tactical School as armament officer. While stationed at <b>Langley,</b> Hansell was involved in two minor accidents in aircraft he was piloting, and in early 1931 was forced to parachute to safety when his Boeing P-12 stalled during a test flight, going into an unrecoverable spin. He was found at fault for the accident and initially charged $10,000 by the Air Corps for {{the expense of the}} aircraft, but the cost was eventually written off.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as an {{engineering}} officer with the Air Corps Materiel Division at Wright Field, Ohio, he attended the Air Corps Tactical School at <b>Langley</b> Field from September 1930 to June 1931. While there, {{he was promoted to}} captain. Returning to the 1st Pursuit Group, he took command of the 36th Pursuit Squadron. He did staff duty tours at Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone with the 16th Pursuit Group, at Barksdale Field with the 20th Pursuit Group, and at the headquarters of the General Headquarters (GHQ) Air Force at <b>Langley</b> Field. He was promoted to temporary major in April 1935 and attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1938.|$|E

50|$|<b>Langley's</b> {{books were}} also {{enormously}} influential in Britain's American colonies. At Mount Vernon, for example, George Washington relied upon plate 51 of <b>Langley's</b> The City and Country Builder's and Workman's Treasury of Designs {{as the source}} for the famous Venetian (or Palladian) window in the dining room; upon plate 54 of the same book for the ocular window on Mount Vernon's western facade; and upon plate 75 of <b>Langley's</b> The Builder's Jewel for the rusticated wood siding.|$|R

5|$|Haynes went to Rockwell Field, California, {{for special}} {{training}} in air navigation and instrument flying. Returning to <b>Langley</b> field in March 1935, {{he was appointed}} commanding officer of the 37th Attack Squadron there. He entered the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in August 1935, and graduated the following June. He returned to <b>Langley</b> Field, where he served as commanding officer of the 49th Bombardment Squadron of the 2nd Bombardment Group, and rose to the temporary rank of major.|$|E

5|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Johnson, Miller and Gil <b>Langley</b> were the tour selectors. <b>Langley</b> and Miller were willing to omit Johnson only if the captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{used this}} {{equation}} {{to calculate the}} amount of lift that a wing would produce. Over the years {{a wide variety of}} values had been measured for the Smeaton coefficient; Chanute identified up to 50 of them. Wilbur knew that <b>Langley,</b> for example, had used a lower number than the traditional one. Intent on confirming the correct Smeaton value, Wilbur performed his own calculations using measurements collected during kite and free flights of the 1901 glider. His results correctly showed that the coefficient was very close to 0.0033 (similar to the number <b>Langley</b> used), not the traditional 0.0054, which would significantly exaggerate predicted lift.|$|E
5|$|While Glenn {{was on duty}} at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to <b>Langley</b> Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at <b>Langley</b> and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at <b>Langley</b> and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E

5|$|Coolidge {{supported}} Ernst, and Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover campaigned in {{the state}} on his behalf. Ernst had opposed a bonus for veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. <b>Langley</b> when <b>Langley</b> was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E
