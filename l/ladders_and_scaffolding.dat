50|$|Construction {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{dangerous}} occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union. In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers. Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers. Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> inspecting <b>scaffolding</b> can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.

5000|$|That {{critical}} kink in {{the road}} put the car on a direct trajectory toward the packed terraces and grandstand. The car landed onto the earthen embankment between the spectators and the track, bounced, then slammed into a concrete stairwell structure and disintegrated. The momentum of the heaviest components of the car - the engine, radiator and front suspension - hurtled straight on into the crowd for almost 100 m, crushing all in their path. The bonnet lid scythed through the air, [...] "decapitating tightly jammed spectators like a guillotine." [...] Spectators who had climbed onto <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> {{to get a better}} view of the track, and those crowding to use the underpass to get to the pits, found themselves in the direct path of the lethal debris.|$|E

The remainder of the car, on the earth bank, exploded into flames, burning with extra heat from its magnesium-alloy body. Levegh was killed instantly in the impact. Given the scale of the disaster, the race officials took the only reasonable action to keep the race running. If the huge crowd had tried to leave ‘’en masse’’ it would have clogged the roads severely restricting access for medical and emergency crews trying to save the injured.|$|E
50|$|Installation of the {{sculpture}} began in January 2006. Under {{the direction of}} Chihuly, a team of glassblowers created the 4,800 glass pieces in Tacoma, Washington before shipping them to Indianapolis in 350 cardboard boxes. After completion of the glass base, three artists from Chihuly's team and six museum collections staff began carefully adding the glass pieces to the metal armature. A plastic tube was inserted into each piece of glass to protect it when placed on the armature and to hold it securely to the metal rods. It took 14 days for all 4,800 pieces of glass to be installed, 1,600 in the pergola ceiling and 3,200 in the tower. The team worked {{from the bottom of}} the tower to the top, using <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> as they went. They followed design plans created by Chihuly, but also had the freedom to make design decisions on site, depending on the surrounding museum environment.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Timaru in 1907 Fr. Tubman had plans drawn up, based on {{photographs}} he brought back with him. The plans were drawn by the noted Dunedin architect, Francis Petre. Although Fr. Tubman thought the plan for the proposed building too ambitious, he was encouraged to continue the large project by the Bishop of Christchurch, John Grimes S.M. Fr. Tubman {{had at the time}} £7,000. In order to maintain the budget, the tradesmen were paid {{at the end of each}} day. Bart Moriarty, a surveyor, was engaged to oversee the construction. Many district farmers contributed their labour and materials. Farmers at the Levels felled blue gums to use as scaffolding, and transported them to the site. Parishioners from St Andrews carted sand and shingle to the railhead and at Timaru, off-loaded, and carted it by bullock teams to the site. It was not uncommon to see Father Tubman climbing <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> to check progress.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Long Bridge {{spanning the}} River Torridge connecting the East and West {{of the town}} {{was said to have}} been built out of timber in the year 1286. In 1474 the original structure was replaced by the masonry arch bridge seen today. The bridge was built around the timber so people could still use it while construction was taking place, possibly resulting in the 24 arches all being of different sizes. A traditional explanation is that each arch was funded by a different local guild, although there are no records to confirm this. Another theory is that the piers of the arches of the bridge were built on naturally existing, and therefore randomly situated, large stones in the river. During {{the first decade of the}} 17th century, the bridge trustees were taken to court by the people of Bideford for feasting and seeing plays at the expense of the trust funds. The people won the court case, although it is unclear whether the trustees were forced to resign after the scandal, or whatever else happened to them. In 1790 the bridge was the longest in Devon. In the 1820s there was talk of converting the bridge so that it could be raised and lowered to allow larger boats and ships to pass under it. In 1886 a Ship called 'Edward Birkbeck' launched from a Bideford shipyard hit the bridge, but only caused small damage by knocking some of the stones out. In 1925 another incident took place on the bridge: during the widening of the bridge a lorry came off the side of the bridge and crashed into the River Torridge, and it is believed that both the people in the lorry survived. During World War Two the 10th arch of the bridge was being repaired, and the police asked for <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> to be removed from the bridge to prevent potential invaders climbing up and capturing the bridge. During the war the Home Guard patrolled the bridge. The Bideford Bridge Trust held responsibility for the long bridge right up until the year 1968 when one of the arches of the bridge collapsed. The Department of Transport then took over the bridge. During the rebuilding of that damaged part of the bridge a crane toppled over, and a man was killed. An inspection by Devon County Council in July 2007 revealed problems with the bridge's concrete and structure, so in September 2008 work began on putting in the cathodic protection system which restored the bridge for another 60 years. A sight which many holiday-makers and locals enjoy is seeing the starlings at dusk, as they roost underneath the bridge.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Falling from {{height is}} {{considered}} one of the most important risks in construction sites and many workers through non-compliance with safety tips lose their lives. This study was conducted in order to survey the relationship between safety climate factors and behavior of workers working in potentially dangerous situations in height among construction workers.   Methods For evaluation of safety climate factors a safety climate questionnaire and for behavior of workers in potentially dangerous situations behavioral questionnaire including potentially dangerous situations, work on <b>ladders</b> <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> has been used. Factor analysis to analyze safety climate factors and Binary logistic regression using SPSS software for the influence of factors on behaviors in potentially dangerous situations are used.   Results Factors of safety attitudes of workers, the level of risk in construction site and working relationships derived from factor analysis are 57 % of the total variance. Situations of working on scaffold without Guard rail and protect the edges, access to the scaffold by going up and down connections and the ladder not secure are usually seen in the most construction sites.   ConclusionResults indicate that workers have awareness of work in dangerous situations but perhaps management ignorance of safety issues and not doing engineering controls to eliminate potentially dangerous situations can be mentioned as the causes of accidents as may result safety issues to be ignored by construction workers working in dangerous situations. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 80 α is a temperate, {{double-stranded}} DNA bacteriophage of Staphylococcus aureus {{that can}} act as a “helper” for the mobilization of S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), including SaPI 1. When SaPI 1 is mobilized by 80 α, the SaPI genomes are packaged into capsids that are composed of phage proteins, but that are smaller than those normally formed by the phage. This size determination is dependent on SaPI 1 proteins CpmA and CpmB. Here, we show that co-expression of the 80 α capsid <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> proteins in S. aureus, but not in E. coli, leads to the formation of procapsid-related structures, suggesting that a host co-factor is required for assembly. The capsid <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> proteins also undergo normal N-terminal processing upon expression in S. aureus, implicating a host protease. We also find that SaPI 1 proteins CpmA and CpmB promote the formation of small capsids upon co-expression with 80 α capsid <b>and</b> <b>scaffolding</b> proteins in S. aureus...|$|R
