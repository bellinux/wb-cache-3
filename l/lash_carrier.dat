25|$|The {{history of}} Sevmorput {{dates back to}} a joint {{decision}} by the Ministry of the Merchant Marine (MORFLOT) and the Ministry of Shipbuilding Industry of the Soviet Union, No C-13/01360, which was signed on 30 May 1978. Following the development of heavy industry in the northern parts of the country, particularly around Norilsk, a reliable transportation method was needed to guarantee year-round shipments of cargo and supplies {{to and from the}} northern communities. Experiences from the nuclear icebreakers operating on the Northern Sea Route since the mid-1950s had shown the advantages of nuclear marine propulsion in the ice-infested waters of the Russian Arctic. Thus a decision was made to construct a new icebreaking <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier,</b> capable of serving high-volume shallow ports, that was powered by a nuclear reactor. The ship was designed by the Baltsudoproect Central Design Bureau.|$|E

50|$|Merchant ship {{construction}} included dry cargo, tankers, <b>lash</b> <b>carriers,</b> {{and passenger}} vessels.|$|R
50|$|The {{lighter aboard ship}} (LASH) system {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of loading barges (lighters) aboard a bigger vessel for transport. It was developed in response to a need to transport lighters, a type of unpowered barge, between inland waterways separated by open seas. Lighters are typically towed or pushed around harbors, canals or rivers and cannot be relocated under their own power. The carrier ships are known variously as <b>LASH</b> <b>carriers,</b> barge carriers, kangaroo ships or lighter transport ships.|$|R
50|$|The München {{departed}} {{the port}} of Bremerhaven on December 7, 1978, bound for Savannah, Georgia. This was her usual route, and she carried a cargo of steel products stored in 83 lighters and a crew of 28. She also carried a replacement nuclear reactor-vessel head for Combustion Engineering, Inc. This was her 62nd voyage, and took her across the North Atlantic, where a fierce storm had been raging since November. The München had been designed to cope with such conditions, and carried on with her voyage. The exceptional flotation capabilities of the <b>LASH</b> <b>carriers</b> meant that she was widely regarded as being practically unsinkable.|$|R
50|$|MS München was a German <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> of the Hapag-Lloyd {{line that}} sank with all hands for unknown reasons in a severe storm in December 1978.|$|E
50|$|The KLT-40 and KLT-40M {{reactors}} are {{nuclear fission}} reactors used {{to power the}} Taymyr-class icebreakers (KLT-40M, 171 MW) and the <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> Sevmorput (KLT-40, 135 MW). They are pressurized water reactors (PWR) fueled by either 30-40% or 90 % enriched uranium-235 fuel to produce 135 to 171 MW of thermal power.|$|E
50|$|Russia {{has four}} Kirov-class battlecruisers, though only one is active, {{the other three}} being laid up. The command ship SSV-33 Ural, based on the Kirov class, is also laid up. Seven {{civilian}} nuclear icebreakers remain in service: four of six Arktika class icebreakers, the two Taymyr-class icebrakers Taymyr and Vaygach, and the <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> and container ship Sevmorput.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of its invention, the system was {{considered}} by experts to be a considerable advancement in shipping technology. <b>LASH</b> <b>carriers</b> were able to transport five times more cargo than a comparable conventional transport ship, the loading and unloading process was much more efficient, and a lack of harbor equipment or quay moorings provided no obstacle, as the lighters could be loaded directly onto the ship. The system also relieved the pressure to unload as quickly as possible, since the lighters already in the water could be moved while others were being unloaded. All told, these ships spent more than 80% of their annual application time at sea, whereas the conventional ships often lay at harbor for as much as half the year.|$|R
50|$|Sevmorput (Севморпуть) is a Russian nuclear-powered icebreaking <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> and {{container}} ship. Named {{after the}} Northern Sea Route (Северный Морской Путь, Severny Morskoy Put), the 1988-built ship {{is one of}} only four nuclear-powered merchant ships ever built. After having been laid up in Murmansk for years awaiting disposal, the vessel was extensively refitted and returned to service in 2016.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} {{developed}} during the 1960s by the American shipbuilding engineer Jerome Goldman. Acadia Forest, commissioned in September 1969, was the first <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> - the ship could take up 75 standardized lighters, with about 376 metric tons of total loading capacity. At the time, it was a novel kind of ship, the first vessel designed primarily to transport other, smaller ships.|$|E
50|$|The LASH {{system was}} {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} and supplement to the developing container system. The lighters, which may be characterized as floating cargo containers, served dual purposes: transportation over water, {{and the establishment of}} a modular, standardized shape for loading and unloading cargo. The lighters, also known as swimming normed cargo containers, are loaded onto a <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> at the port of embarkation and unloaded from the ship at the port of destination.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear-powered, civil {{merchant}} ships {{have not}} developed beyond a few experimental ships. The US-built NS Savannah, completed in 1962, {{was primarily a}} demonstration of civil nuclear power and was too small and expensive to operate economically as a merchant ship. The design {{was too much of}} a compromise, being neither an efficient freighter nor a viable passenger liner. The German-built Otto Hahn, a cargo ship and research facility, sailed some 650000 nmi km on 126 voyages over 10 years without any technical problems. However, it proved too expensive to operate and was converted to diesel. The Japanese Mutsu was dogged by technical and political problems. Its reactor had significant radiation leakage and fishermen protested against the vessel's operation. All of these three ships used low-enriched uranium. Sevmorput, a Soviet and later Russian <b>LASH</b> <b>carrier</b> with icebreaking capability, has operated successfully on the Northern Sea Route since it was commissioned in 1988. , it is the only nuclear-powered merchant ship in service.|$|E
