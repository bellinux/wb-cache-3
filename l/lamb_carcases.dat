On beef carcases (n = 159) mean log AVC/cm 2 was 1. 82 and E. coli was detected on 18. 8 % of carcases (area sampled 200 cm 2) for which the mean log of the positives was 0. 34; for <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases,</b> on which 75 cm 2 was sampled (n = 364), corresponding values were 2. 59, 36. 2 % and log 10 0. 27, respectively. There was little difference in mean log AVC/cm 2 of carcases produced at abattoirs and VSPs, 1. 72 versus 1. 81, respectively, for beef, and 2. 80 versus 2. 44, respectively, for sheep. Prevalence of E. coli was lower at VSPs, however, with abattoirs having 28. 4 % for beef and 61. 5 % for sheep, compared with corresponding values of 4. 7 % and 18. 5 % at VSPs.

The deregulation of export slaughter facilities, Supplementary Minimum Prices, Producer Board intervention, declining livestock numbers and domestic cost pressures have all affected the performance of the domestically based processing sector. Major changes in market access and demand have influenced off-shore marketing operations, particularly for sheepmeats. Additionally, there has been a change in the type of meat exported with a greater proportion of further processed product shipped in recent years. As an example of the impact of these developments on livestock producers, the producer share of the United Kingdom wholesale market return for a representative prime <b>lamb</b> <b>carcase</b> has fallen from 40 per cent in 1978 to 25 per cent in 1988.

However, this study highlighted the significant increases in time required to fabricate more value-added cuts and to breakdown heavier carcases.

40|$|Baiting with sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) {{to protect}} lambs (Ovis aries) from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes L.) {{has become more}} {{frequent}} in NSW {{and other parts of}} Australia during the last 10 years despite the lack of reported evidence evaluating the effects of fox baiting on lamb survival. NSW Agriculture has developed fox control recommendations aimed at minimising impact, but these guidelines have not been tested experimentally. Defining the extent of a pest problem and the effectiveness of pest control are key components of a strategic approach to vertebrate pest management as it is the damage of pests that justifies their control. This thesis describes an experimental evaluation of the recommended practice of fox control in NSW. The effects of three levels of fox control were tested in the experiment; no treatment, baiting once a year before lambing (the recommended practice) and baiting three times a year (thought to be the maximum farmers would instigate). Each treatment had two replicates. No previous manipulative experiment using synchronous controls and matched replicates has been undertaken to test the effects. The study quantifies the level of fox predation on healthy lambs and the level of predation on lambs that had other causes including illness and mismothering contributing to this fox predation. It also examines the response of the fox population, lamb predation and lambing outcomes to different levels of fox control. The cost effectiveness of fox control is examined in relation to lamb predation and an investigation of the optimum level of fox control is begun. The experiment also provides the first chance to consider the examination of multiple response variables and the scale of field ecology experiments required to recognise a significant response and avoid a Type II error due to between replicate variability even with tightly controlled site selection criteria to standardise experimental sites, and with the synchrony of experimental control and treatment surveys. The study occurred on five sheep properties near Boorowa (3428 'S, 14832 'E) and Murringo (3418 'S, 1483 1 'E) in south-eastern Australia. The terrain was undulating to hilly with a maximum elevation of 660 m above sea level. The main agricultural enterprises in the district are Merino wool, fat lamb and beef cattle production and winter cereal cropping. The native vegetation of Eucalyptus woodland has been mostly cleared, though remnant patches occur. Most of the area is now sown with pasture of Phalaris tuberosa, Lolium spp. and clover Trifolium spp [...] The experimental properties grazed self-replacing Merino flocks, primarily for wool production, so lamb survival was vital to the economic operation of the farm. Over 50 selection criteria including lamb survival rates, ewe fertility and bloodline, sheep management practices, climate and habitat features that affect lamb survival, past fox control practices and prey species were used to select sites Sites were representative of most sheep farming properties in the region, but were also extremely similar in factors that affected fox abundance and ewe and lamb survival, thus minimising variation between replicate sites. The manufactured meat baits used to poison foxes contained 3 mg of sodium monofluoroacetate (compound 1080). A replacement baiting program was carried out in 1995 and 1996. Fox control programs were carried out over the experimental units and adjacent buffer zones covering approximately two fox territories, approximately 6 km 2, around the lambing paddock under study. The recommended fox control practices described by NSW Agriculture also included neighbouring farmers taking part in an extended group baiting program. In all the area baited at varying intensities totalled 3400 km 2. Synchronised lambing with neighbours was a further recommended practice to reduce fox predation and was carried out on these sites. Lambing occurred during a six to eight week period in late winter on all sites, a practice known as 'spring lambing', and on many surrounding properties so a surplus of lambs was available to foxes over a relatively short time. The benefits of fox control were measured directly as enhanced lamb survival derived from differences in lamb marking rates between ultrasounded flocks of approximately 1000 ewes and the predation of lambs was measured from over 2000 <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> post-mortemed in 1994, 1995 and 1996. A mean of 138 lambs were expected at ultrasounding from 100 ewes and 113 lambs per 100 ewes were alive at lamb marking. There was no significant (P> 0. 05) effect of fox control on lambing performance (the number of lambs per 100 ewes that lambed) Fox predation was inferred as the cause of lamb death in a minimum of 0. 8 % and a maximum of 5. 3 % of <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> during 1995 and 1996. There was a significant (P< 0 05) effect of fox control on the minimum possible percentage of <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes, with the percentage declining from 1. 50 % (no fox control), to 0. 90 % (fox control once per year) to 0. 25 % (fox control three times per year). There was also a significant (P< 0. 005) effect of fox control on the maximum possible percentage of <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> classified as healthy lambs killed by foxes with the percentage declining from 10. 25 % (no fox control), to 6. 50 % (fox control once per year) to 3. 75 % (fox control three times per year). The observed results were used to estimate the number of treatment replicates needed to be confident of detecting an effect of predator control on lamb marking performance. The estimated numbers were very high if small effects were to be detected. No significant correlation between the fox density and the minimum and maximum possible number of lambs carcases classified as killed by foxes was found. Bait uptake was monitored as were the costs of fox control...|$|E

The different sources providing such data report very different figures and trends over time, but {{they all seem to}} indicate an overall trend of decrease in total farm numbers over the last decades, which appears to be due mainly to a decrease in the numbers of grazing and fattening farms and in the number of arable farms.

40|$|On two {{extensive}} sheep {{farms in}} southern Western Australia, 111 (Farm A) and 124 (Farm B) female crossbred lambs (2 - 6 weeks old) {{were randomly selected}} and individually identified using ear tags (a numbered tag and radio-frequency tag) at marking. On five separate occasions, faecal samples were collected and live weight, body condition score (BCS), faecal consistency score (FCS), breech fleece faecal soiling score and faecal dry matter percentage (DM%) were recorded. <b>Lamb</b> hot <b>carcase</b> weight (HCW) and dressing percentage were measured at slaughter. Faecal samples were screened by PCR for Cryptosporidium (18 S rRNA, actin and 60 kDa glycoprotein [gp 60] loci), Giardia duodenalis (glutamate dehydrogenase [gdh] and triosephosphate isomerise [tpi]) and Campylobacter jejuni (16 S rRNA). Observation of Eimeria oocysts and faecal worm egg counts (WECs) were performed using a modified McMaster technique. The WECs were adjusted for FCS for analyses. Faecal samples were screened for patent strongylid infections using PCR (specifically ITS- 2 nuclear ribosomal DNA for Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus spp. and Haemonchus contortus). Lambs positive for Cryptosporidium at least once had lighter HCWs by 1. 25 kg (6. 6 %) (P = 0. 029) and 1. 46 kg (9. 7 %) (P < 0. 001) compared to lambs never positive for Cryptosporidium for Farms A and B respectively. Similarly, dressing percentages were 1. 7 % (P = 0. 022) and 1. 9 % (P < 0. 001) lower in Cryptosporidium-positive lambs on Farms A and B respectively. Lambs positive for Giardia at least once had 0. 69 kg (P < 0. 001) lighter HCWs and 1. 7 % (P < 0. 001) lower dressing percentages compared to lambs never positive for Giardia on Farm B only. Cryptosporidium-positive lambs at the second sampling were 4. 72 (P = 0. 010) and 3. 84 (P = 0. 002) {{times more likely to}} have non-pelleted faeces compared to Cryptosporidium-negative lambs for Farms A and B respectively.

Live weight, growth rate and BCS were inconsistently associated with protozoa detection across different samplings and farms. Adjusted WEC was correlated positively with FCS and negatively with faecal DM%, differing between sampling occasions and farms. Campylobacter jejuni prevalence was very low (< 1 %). Adjusted WEC were not correlated with carcase attributes, growth rates or live weights.

40|$|Major {{changes are}} taking place in all sectors of the {{livestock}} and meat producing industries from farm to consumer which impinge on the processes and patterns of livestock distribution from farm to slaughter. These changes are identified and described. A survey of the complete journeys from farm to abattoir of 18, 393 slaughterweight lambs sold direct from farm to abattoir, via livestock auction markets and via electronic auctions was conducted. Lambs sold direct from farm to abattoir experienced shorter journeys (in terms of both median duration and distance) than lambs sold through either {{of the other two}} channels. Lambs sold through electronic auctions, on average, travelled longer distances but for shorter times than lambs sold through livestock auction markets. Although these results are broadly consistent with the common perception of direct sale lambs experiencing simpler journeys than lambs passing through the other channels, they do not support this view unequivocally. The journeys were diverse in all three distribution channels and ranged from direct and uninterrupted transfer from farm to abattoir (n= 4, 888) to highly complex itineraries including up to three periods of transportation interspersed with two holding periods at assembly points, staging posts or auction markets (n=l, 034). Journeys also included those with between 2 and 8 pickups en route (n= 2, 369), and those involving holding at assembly points, staging posts or livestock auction markets before transfer to abattoir (n= 10, 102). A total of 26 different journey structures were identified: 18 in direct farm to abattoir sales, 9 in sales via livestock auction markets and 13 within the electronic auction system. The effect of journey structure on the welfare of slaughterweight lambs (90 transported and 45 non-transported controls) was investigated in an experiment comprising 3 journey types (direct transfer from farm to abattoir, a journey involving 3 additional pickups en route and a journey incorporating holding at a livestock auction market) with non-transported controls held in a pen {{for the duration of the}} transport period. Transportation per se affected the liveweight and behaviour of the lambs: transported lambs lost more weight during the transport period and spent less time ruminating and less time lying down than non-transported lambs. Multiple pickup and Market lambs lost more weight and spent less time ruminating whilst lying than Direct <b>lambs.</b> Ultimate <b>carcase</b> pH (pHu) was higher for Multiple pickup and Market lambs than Direct lambs. There were no differences in liveweight loss, ruminating behaviour or pHu between Multiple pickup and Market lambs.

The prevalence of faecal shedding of C. pecorum is relatively common amongst lambs in Australia. The aim of the work presented here was to use qPCR to determine the prevalence of C. pecorum in synovial samples obtained from abnormal joints trimmed from <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> at one abattoir in southern Australia. The study included 53, 131 carcases screened for arthritis, of which 369 had at least one abnormal joint trimmed.

The prevalence of C. pecorum in synovial tissue collected from the abnormal joints was 6. 1 % and the bacterial concentration ranged from 6 × 103 to 7. 6 × 105 /g of synovial tissue. Five of the positive joint samples were from carcases that had one joint trimmed for arthritis and four were from carcases from which two joints had been trimmed. None of the carcases from which the positive joint samples originated were condemned. The average arthritis trim weight of the carcases from which synovial tissue tested positive for C. pecorum was 1. 112 kg (95 % confidence interval 0. 637 - 1. 586 kg) and this did not differ from the carcases from which synovial tissue was not positive for C. pecorum.

40|$|Increased {{growth rate}} and carcass lean meat yield % are key profit drivers for the lamb industry, however redistributing lean tissue to more highly priced {{parts of the}} carcase will also {{increase}} its value. Faster growing lambs {{are known to be}} leaner and less mature at slaughter.

Data was analysed using the log-linearised allometric equation logy = log a + b. logx. Fixed effects were site-year, sex sire type, birth-type rear-type and kill group within site-year, with random terms sire and dam by year. For the same carcass weight PWWT caused no composition differences, except in female lambs which had 3. 3 % more carcase lean (P< 0. 01) across the 25 unis PWWT range. Alternatively for the same fat, lean or bone weight these tissues were all proportionately heavier in the saddle region of the high PWWT lambs by 3 %, 7 %, and 16 % across the PWWT range. Aligning with our hypothesis, PWWT was associated with increased total carcase lean, although only in females. Unexpectedly, PWWT caused a redistribution of carcass tissues to the saddle region, particularly for bone and lean, implying an altered conformation in these high growth lambs. Conflicting with the premise of our hypothesis, these effects appear to be independent of maturity as there was no whole body increase in bone weight. Furthermore loin muscle myoglobin concentration in the high PWWT lambs was increased (by 0. 03 ± 0. 018 mg/g tissue) rather than decreased as would be expected in a less mature animal, In conclusion, PWWT redistributes carcase weight to the saddle region of lambs...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{lean meat}} yield % (LMY%) and rapid growth are {{important}} profit drivers in the sheep supply chain. To optimise these traits, Australian prime lamb producers use the Carcase Plus Index (CP) for selecting sires. The index originally combined breeding values for weight, eye muscle depth and decreased fat depth, with weightings of 60 : 20 : 20 (old CP). Due to perceived gains in leanness in Terminal sires, and concern over reducing intramuscular fat levels in lamb meat, this index was altered {{to the current}} weightings of 65 : 30 : 5 (new (CP).

Data was analysed using the allometric equation y=axb, fitted in its log-linearised form log y = log a + b. log x. The impact on carcase value was determined for new and old CP indexes in a 23 kg carcase. Within the 76 unit range of Terminal sire CP index values, the old CP Index delivered 2. 2, 1. 2 and 0. 5 percentage units more lean in the fore, saddle and hind sections (P< 0. 01) compared to the new CP index. Across this same range in CP index values the old CP increased the value of carcase lean by $ 9. 27, compared to $ 6. 49 for the new CR equating to a value difference of $ 2. 78 within a 23 kg carcase. Aligning with our hypothesis there was decreased gain in LMY% and carcase value using the new CP weightings. The cost in LMY% represents a substantial loss in daily profit for processors, especially when the potential improvement to intramuscular fat levels is not currently rewarded...|$|E

At a given carcase weight the lean tissue was 4. 2 % heavier (P< 0. 01), and fat 8. 7 % lighter in the whole carcase (P< 0. 05) across the 7 unit PEMD range.

The mechanistic reason for this redistribution is not clear, and will be investigated with more extensive sampling from tissues across the carcase.

The overall {{prevalence of}} Cryptosporidium in sheep faeces was 6. 5 % (31 / 474), with the zoonotic species Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium ubiquitum accounting for 54. 2 % of the typed positive samples. Subtyping of the C. parvum and C. ubiquitum positives at the gp 60 locus identified four C. parvum positives as IIdA 18 G 1 and nine C. ubiquitum isolates as the XIId subtype. The overall prevalence of Giardia in sheep faeces was 6. 3 % (30 / 474), with the non-zoonotic assemblage E responsible for the majority (81. 5 %) of positive isolates typed. Median Cryptosporidium and Giardia oo/cyst concentrations in positive faecal samples were 1. 7 × 103 oocysts g- 1 (range 32 - 3. 7 × 106 oocysts g- 1) and 2. 5 × 103 cysts g- 1 (range 143 - 7. 5 × 105 cysts g- 1) respectively. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were identified in 10. 4 % (10 / 96) and 5. 2 % (5 / 96) of abattoir effluent samples (respectively). Median Cryptosporidium and Giardia oo/cyst concentrations in positive effluent samples was 1. 3 × 103 cysts g- 1 (range 393 - 1. 5 × 104) and 1. 5 × 104 oocysts g- 1 (range 759 - 4. 8 × 103) respectively. These findings {{have important implications for}} the sheep meat industry because Cryptosporidium and Giardia have both been associated with reduced carcase productivity in sheep, and the contamination of <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> and watersheds with zoonotic species have important public health consequences...|$|E

New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 31 (1 - 2), 4 - 6 A plug sampling technique based on a modified muscle biopsy instrument, was developed for the measurement of muscle pH without mutilation of the carcase. It was found possible to routinely obtain muscle tissue samples weighing approximately 2 g and when these were incubated for 24 hours under liquid paraffin at room temperature, followed by homogenisation in a 'Colworth Stomacher', the pH of the solution {{was found to be}} an accurate measurement of the ultimate pH of the muscle. Both the sample method and a direct probe method were found to be well suited for measuring the ultimate pH of muscles. However, the sample method had a higher degree of precision as compared to the probe method when used for measuring pre-rigor pH values. In a longitudinal survey, in which 1536 <b>lamb</b> <b>carcases</b> were examined, 85. 2 % of carcases were found to have ultimate pH values below 5. 80. Highly significant associations were found between season (summer period) and breed (Perendales) and unsatisfactorily high values of ultimate pH. There was also a highly significant direct correlation between the duration of holding periods of lambs and the ultimate pH of meat, whereas there was a highly significant inverse correlation between wool score and ultimate pH. It was concluded that nutrition {{plays an important role in}} the development of high ultimate pH values. Studies at the meat works indicated that there is a highly significant linear relationship between the number of times lambs are washed prior to slaughter and the ultimate pH of the longissimus muscle. Subsequent resting of animals for varying periods prior to slaughter has no apparent effect on repletion of glycogen stores and may, in some cases, exacerbate the problem of high pH meat. It was also found that washing of lambs is associated with a highly significant increase in bruising of carcases and that such washing may not necessarily result in a decrease in carcase contamination. Investigations of the changes of body weights and the weights and nature of ruminoreticular contents during the preslaughter holding period indicated that the ideal time to slaughter lambs, in terms of potential carcase contamination, is 18 to 24 hours after removal from pasture. It was found that stunning by a 'head-to-leg' electrical method significantly increased the rate of pH decline compared to other methods of slaughter. A further increase in the rate of pH decline was achieved by low voltage stimulation at the time of slaughter. It was concluded that the combined effects of low voltage and high voltage stimulation can cause irreversible contraction and associated toughness in a large proportion of carcases. Studies of the occurrence of haemorrhages in carcases and organs indicated that these defects are related to the method of stunning. Although blood splash has been reported to be associated with prolonged one stage prothrombin times in lambs, no statistical association was found between this parameter and speckling. It was found that there is a two to threefold increase in arterial pressure following 'head-only' stunning whereas there was only a moderate increase in venous pressure. On the other hand, stunning by the 'head-to-back' method was followed by a decrease in arterial pressure, but venous pressure increased to levels above 50 mm Hg. Electromyographic studies indicated that there is a significant increase in the intensity of muscular activity following 'head-to-back' stunning as compared to 'head-only stunning and that there is a correlation between the increased muscular activity and the increase in venous pressure. It is concluded that these events may lead to pressure changes in the microcirculatory bed which are likely to be associated with the occurrence of haemorrhagic defects following stunning by electrical methods...|$|E
