50|$|Penultimate hop popping (PHP) is a {{function}} performed by certain routers in an MPLS enabled network. It refers to the process whereby the outermost label of an MPLS tagged packet is removed by a Label Switch Router (LSR) before the packet is passed to an adjacent <b>Label</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Router</b> (<b>LER).</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> (<b>LER,</b> {{also known}} as edge LSR) is a router that {{operates}} {{at the edge of}} an MPLS network and acts as the entry and exit points for the network. LERs push an MPLS label onto an incoming packet and pop it off an outgoing packet. Alternatively, under penultimate hop popping this function may instead be performed by the LSR directly connected to the LER.|$|E
50|$|The path {{begins at}} a <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> (<b>LER),</b> {{which makes a}} {{decision}} on which label to prefix to a packet, based on the appropriate FEC. It then forwards the packet along to the next router in the path, which swaps the packet's outer label for another label, and forwards {{it to the next}} router. The last router in the path removes the label from the packet and forwards the packet based on the header of its next layer, for example IPv4. Due to the forwarding of packets through an LSP being opaque to higher network layers, an LSP is also sometimes referred to as an MPLS tunnel.|$|E
30|$|In this scenario, {{upon arrival}} of an IP packet the <b>edge</b> <b>routers,</b> that is, <b>Label</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Routers</b> (<b>LERs)</b> in MPLS terminology, {{look up the}} DSCP and IP {{addresses}} present in the IP header and determine the MPLS Forward Equivalency Class (FEC) the packet belongs to, thus deriving the corresponding LSP that the IP packet will follow along the CN. At each CR, the treatment received by each IP packet {{will depend on the}} marked DiffServ class of service.|$|R

The <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> (<b>LER)</b> at the <b>edges</b> of an MPLS cloud map between the end-to-end identifier, such as an IP address, and a link-local label. At each MPLS hop, there is a forwarding table that tells the label switched router (LSR) which outgoing interface is to receive the MPLS packet, and what label to use when sending the packet out that interface.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} specifies how <b>Label</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Routers</b> (<b>LERs)</b> should behave when {{determining whether}} to MPLS encapsulate an IPv 4 packet with header options. Lack {{of a formal}} standard has resulted in different LER forwarding behaviors for IPv 4 packets with header options despite being associated with a prefix-based Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). IPv 4 option packets that belong to a prefix-based FEC, yet are forwarded into an IPv 4 /MPLS network without being MPLSencapsulated, present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure. Further, LERs that are unable to MPLS encapsulate IPv 4 packets with header options cannot operate in certain MPLS environments. While this newly defined LER behavior is mandatory to implement, it is optional to invoke. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document.

30|$|MPLS is a {{switching}} technique {{based on}} the use of labels. The boundary nodes are called <b>Label</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Router</b> (<b>LER)</b> while the core nodes are known as Label Switching Router (LSR) [8]. LER takes the responsibility of admission control as ingress in Diffserv by assigning labels to traffic as according to the forward equivalence class (FEC). Each LSR removes the previous label and makes the forwarding based on its label lookup table; the established path is called LSP which can guarantee certain level of performance and network utilization by implementing TE.|$|E

New shutter-based free-space multi-channel optical switching cores are employed as the core switch fabric to solve the packet contention and switching path conflict problems.

40|$|Current mobile {{networks}} provide link-layer mobility as {{a mobile}} host changes its {{point of attachment}} {{within the scope of}} an access node, and provide wide-area mobility through global mobility protocols such as Mobile IP. Recently, several proposals have been made for an intermediate level of mobility support, called micro-mobility which addresses the issues of handover latency, signaling overhead and packet loss that are inherent in wide-area mobility protocols. In this paper, we propose a new Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) based network architecture that implements intra-domain micro-mobility using label switched path (LSP) re-direction in a traffic engineered network. We introduce an enhanced <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> (<b>LER),</b> called the label edge mobility agent (LEMA) and describe the operations of the network nodes in our architecture. The advantages of our approach, as compared with the existing proposals, are its distributed and scalable nature, the ability to provision for Quality of Service (QoS) through traffic engineering, its ease of gradual deployment, and its efficient design and handover performance.

40|$|Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) {{has been}} widely {{deployed}} in the Internet. It {{is well known that}} MPLS clouds may potentially lead to inaccurate and incomplete Internet maps when performing active measurements using traceroute. In particular, MPLS tunnels may either obscure the underlying path or be incorrectly classified as direct IP links (between IP routers that are not physically adjacent). However, the quantitative impact of MPLS tunnels on Internet topology measurements is not well understood. The paper uses two features to characterize MPLS tunnels: (i) the ttl-propagate option on ingress <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> (<b>LERs)</b> and (ii) RFC 4950. The ttl-propagate option allows traceroute to reveal IP hops within an MPLS tunnel. RFC 4950 implementation provides all information related to a label switched path (LSP). The paper provides a taxonomy of MPLS tunnels: (i) explicit tunnels, which use both ttl-propagate and RFC 4950, (ii) implicit tunnels, which use only ttl-propagate, (iii) opaque tunnels, which use only RFC 4950, and (iv) invisible tunnels, which use neither option. The paper then develops new inference mechanisms to identify different types of MPLS tunnels and thus reduce the impact of MPLS on IP topology discovery. The focus is on explicit, implici...|$|R
30|$|DiffServ and MPLS may be {{understood}} as complementary methods. The MPLS mechanism is developed to enable multiple path usage for traffic forwarding, {{which is achieved by}} inserting/removing labels at the IRs/ERs of an MPLS domain—that is, <b>Label</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Routers</b> (<b>LERs)</b> in MPLS terminology. Each label defines a path for a traffic flow, referred to as Label Switched Path (LSP). Inside the MPLS domain packets are forwarded through LSPs using these labels. LSPs are unidirectional, meaning that two LSPs, one in upstream and another in downstream, need to be established for bidirectional communication between client and server PCs. While MPLS enables traffic engineering, resource reservation, fault tolerance, and optimization of transmission resources in the CN, it does not define a QoS architecture itself. DiffServ does define a scalable QoS architecture with multiple classes of services [36], namely, Expedited Forwarding (EF) [53], several grades of Assured Forwarding (AF) [54] for different QoS requirements in terms of throughput, delay, loss, and jitter, and Best Effort (BE). The 3 GPP conversational, streaming, and interactive classes are usually mapped to EF, higher AF, and lower AF or BE classes, respectively. IP packets entering a DiffServ domain are assigned a class of service at the domain edge, which is written in the Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value in the IP header. This value defines the per-hop behavior for that class along the CN and therefore the per-hop treatment of IP packets in terms of scheduling and queue management at each CR.|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the recent}} years, {{considerable}} interest {{has been increasing}} in network congestion control associated with traffic engineering (TE) techniques. In addition, in Internet protocol (IP) networks, it {{has been difficult to}} incorporate effective traffic engineering due to limited capabilities of the IP technology. In principle, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), which is a connection-oriented label swapping technology, offers new possibilities in addressing the limitations by allowing the operator to use sophisticated traffic control mechanisms. Problem Considered: This thesis proposes a novel method to dynamically mange the traffic flows throw Diffserv/MPLS network for multimedia traffic during the periods of congestion. It proposes a new queuing management that allows label switch routers (LSRs) within MPLS network to indicate when flows are starting to experience frame/packet loss. Based upon the Abstract : knowledge of the availability of enough capacity inside the congested LSR, the LSR will upgrade the traffic from the congest queue (low priority) to not congested queue (high priority). Otherwise, LSR will send a notification message to ingress <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> (<b>LER)</b> to switch the traffic to another path by using CR- LDP (Constrains- Label Distribution Protocol). The switching step will be done with regards to available bandwidth, End to End delay and maximum number of hops. Investigation Method: Computer simulation has been used for the investigation of the proposed problem. The special purpose package OPNET has been used for this purpose. The developed simulation algorithm incorporates the requirement, and provides modification for Label distribution protocol (LDP).

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Optical Burst Switching (OBS) is {{a viable}} {{technology}} {{for the next generation}} core network. We propose an FEC-assembly scheme that efficiently assembles self-similar traffic and a Pareto-offset assignment rather than a constant offset assignment. Two buffers, a packet buffer and a burst buffer, are implemented at the <b>Label</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>Router</b> (<b>LER),</b> buffering traffic in the electronic domain. The assembler, between the packet and burst buffers, is served by the packet queue while the assembler serves the burst queue. We outline advantages of why burst assembly cannot be implemented independent of offset assignment. The two schemes must be implemented in a complementary way if QoS is to be realized in an OBS network. We show that there is a direct relation between OBS network performance with burst assembly and offset assignment. We present simulation results of the assembly and offset assignment proposals using the ns 2 network simulator. Our results show that the combination of the proposed FEC-Based assembly scheme with the proposed Pareto-offset assignment scheme give better network performance in terms of burst drop, resource contention and delay. Key to any traffic shaping is the nature traffic being shaped. This work also compares performance of both traditional exponential traffic with realistic Self-Similar traffic of Internet traffic on the proposed assembly and offset assignment schemes. In our simulations, we assume that all Label Switch Routers (LSR) have wavelength converters and are without optical buffers. We use Latest Available Unused Channel with Void Filling (LAUC-VF) scheduling scheme and use Just Enough Time (JET) reservation scheme...|$|E

Upon a {{failure in the}} primary path, its segmented backup gets activated to transfer the data, making a network real time. Here we propose a new method of providing backup paths in multicast routing tree. The method is based on segmentation cluster formation, in which backup paths are provided by connecting segmentation points (SPs) of the same cluster rather than providing a backup between the receiver <b>label</b> <b>edged</b> <b>routers</b> as suggested by other researchers. The segmented backup path and hence cluster formation aims at minimizing the number of receivers of the multicast routing tree to be dropped from the communication if a failure occurs.

40|$|Abstract—MultiProtocol Label Switching (MPLS) is an {{emerging}} technology {{that aims to}} address many of the existing issues associated with packet forwarding in today’s Internetworking environment. It provides a method of forwarding packets at {{a high rate of}} speed by combining the speed and performance of Layer 2 with the scalability and IP intelligence of Layer 3. In a traditional IP (Internet Protocol) routing network, a router analyzes the destination IP address contained in the packet header. The router independently determines the next hop for the packet using the destination IP address and the interior gateway protocol. This process is repeated at each hop to deliver the packet to its final destination. In contrast, in the MPLS forwarding paradigm <b>routers</b> on the <b>edge</b> of the network (<b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>routers)</b> attach <b>labels</b> to packets based on the forwarding Equivalence class (FEC). Packets are then forwarded through the MPLS domain, based on their associated FECs, through swappin...|$|R

MPLS technology is currently deployed in designing the backbone infrastructure of service provider networks whereas {{other parts of the}} network are still operated using the traditional IP protocol. This makes the overall topological structure of MPLS-based networks naturally breaks into two prime sub-problems: access network design and backbone network design. The ultimate goal is to identify the locations of label-edge routers and label-switching routers, and to determine the interconnection links and their capacities to accommodate expected traffic demands. The locations of <b>label</b> <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> depend on the demands of a given set of terminal networks which in turn affect the design of the backbone network.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reports on}} modern {{features}} of the optical-label switching (OLS) system in support of multicast, optical time-to-live (TTL), and video-streaming applications. We first propose and demonstrate optical-label switching core router architecture with multicast function. The multicast switching architecture provides reduced complexity and effective multicast contention resolution compared to conventional multicast-capable switch-ing fabric. A proof-of-principle experiment successfully showed packet multicast forwarding with contention resolution. The all-optical TTL monitors the healthiness of the packet, and prevents degraded packets from traveling or looping further in the network. The experiment demonstrated successful packet discards based on optical signal-to-noise ratio degradation. Finally, we present an optical <b>label</b> switching <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> that supports aggregation, quality of service, and class of service, and we further demonstrate a video streaming application between Ethernet clients through the OLS <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> and a core router.

40|$|Abstract [...] Next {{generation}} {{data centers}} and cloud computing design architectures require high data {{rates of the}} order of 100 GBPS from the Internet. This paper presents Random Early Detection (RED) <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> for congestion avoidance in P 2 P networks. The <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> detect the possible congestion by computing the average queue size. The <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> could notify connections of congestion either by dropping packets arriving at the <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> or by setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue size exceeds a preset threshold, the <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> drops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, where the exact probability {{is a function of the}} average queue size. RED <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestion control protocol such as TCP, UDP.

30|$|Multiple domain based: To {{reduce the}} {{overhead}} of mobility signallings, the works [50 – 52] divide the network into many domains. In these papers, {{there are multiple}} <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> responsible for the data plane and a rendezvous server recording the binding relationship in each network domain. Similar as the PS-based scheme, every MH has its own home gateway, and the corresponding network domain is considered as the MH’s home domain. When MH leaves its home network domain, the access router of the new network domain will help MH register the new binding relationship to the rendezvous server. After caching the binding relationship locally, the rendezvous server allocates an <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> to MH {{to take charge of}} MH’s packet forwarding in the new network domain and notifies the corresponding <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> the locator of MH, so that Interests destined to MH can be forwarded to MH by the <b>edge</b> <b>router.</b> Meanwhile, the rendezvous server reports the locator of the <b>edge</b> <b>router</b> allocated to MH to the MH’s home gateway.

However, in these cases, if the attacker changes his MAC address, DFM is still able to trace three levels up to the attacker node.
