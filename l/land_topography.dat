2500|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} most important effects of single nuclear explosions under ideal, clear skies, weather conditions. Tables like these are calculated from nuclear weapons effects scaling laws. Advanced computer modelling of real world conditions and how they impact on the damage to modern urban areas has found that most scaling laws are too simplistic and tend to overestimate nuclear explosion effects. As it is only simplistic and unclassified scaling laws that are commonly encountered, that do not take important things like varying <b>land</b> <b>topography</b> into account to ease calculation time and equation length. The scaling laws {{that were used to}} produce the table below, assume among other things, a perfectly level target area, no attenuating effects from urban terrain masking, e.g. skyscraper shadowing, and no enhancement effects from reflections and tunneling by city streets.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} and largely area of computer image generation is that related with geographic information. Geographic {{data can be}} used for analysis, design and evaluation in natural-resource assessment, regional planning, and large-area landscape design. While Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has focused on delivering traditional cartographic representations, some people demands others aspects be covered: the use of "appropiate" representations to help viewers to understand the information. This is the case of the visualization of the <b>land's</b> <b>topography</b> and how the changes on it affect its appearance. Strangely, the combination of GIS and visualization area still remains unexplored. The elds seem to complement on another, yet they have developed in parallel and the interaction between them is important in providing usable interactive systems. This paper presents a visualization approach of a topographic surface spatially inter- polated from Topographic Reliefs. We hope this will help people with no background in scientific visualization orient themselves to the image.

50|$|While digital {{elevation}} models describe Earth’s <b>land</b> <b>topography</b> often with 1 to 3 arc-second resolution (e.g., from the SRTM or ASTER missions), the global bathymetry (e.g., SRTM30_PLUS) {{is known to}} a much lesser spatial resolution in the kilometre-range. The {{same holds true for}} models of the bedrock of Antarctica and Greenland. Therefore, global relief models are often constructed at 1 arc-min resolution (corresponding to about 1.8 km postings), Some products such as the 30 and 15 arc-sec resolution SRTM30_PLUS/ SRTM15_PLUS grids offer higher resolution to adequately represent SONAR depth measurements where available.|$|E
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of geostationary satellites is the incomplete geographical coverage, since ground stations at higher than roughly 60 degrees latitude have difficulty reliably receiving signals at low elevations. Satellite dishes at such high latitudes {{would need to}} be pointed almost directly towards the horizon.

In the USSR, a practical solution was developed for this problem with the creation of special Molniya / Orbita inclined path satellite networks with elliptical orbits. Similar elliptical orbits are used for the Sirius Radio satellites.|$|E
