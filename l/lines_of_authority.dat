5|$|Shortly after Thomas' election, Lanfranc, {{pursuing}} {{a claim that}} Canterbury was the primatial see, or bishopric, of England, demanded that Thomas provide a written oath swearing to obey both Lanfranc and any future Archbishops of Canterbury. Thomas declined {{to make such a}} written promise, so Lanfranc refused to consecrate him. Thomas argued that Lanfranc's demand was unprecedented, as no other Archbishop of York had been required to swear such an oath before. King William wanted clear <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in the church to match the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in the secular sphere; thus, the King supported Lanfranc in the dispute. Royal pressure induced Thomas to submit to Lanfranc and Thomas was consecrated, but his profession of obedience was made orally to Lanfranc personally and not in writing or to any future archbishops of Canterbury. Although this settled the issue between Thomas and Lanfranc, {{it was the beginning of}} the long-running Canterburyâ€“York dispute over the claims of Canterbury to have jurisdiction over York.|$|E
5|$|Weber's ideal {{bureaucracy}} is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> in a fixed area of activity, by {{action taken}} (and recorded) {{on the basis}} of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.|$|E
5|$|Reactor {{operators}} {{were not}} trained {{to deal with}} accident conditions, and the NRC had not established effective communication with utilities. Moreover, once the accident occurred, the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> proved to be ill defined. The public received conflicting reports that caused needless panic and evacuations. It was these systemic weaknesses in the regulatory system that allowed gifted people to make the mistakes they did.|$|E

25|$|Chandler (1965) {{demonstrates}} that the large-scale problems of management became obvious {{in the middle of}} the 19th century with the rise of the great railroad systems, such as the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore and Ohio. New methods had to be invented for mobilizing, controlling, and apportioning capital, for operating a widely dispersed system, and for supervising thousands of specialized workmen spread over hundreds of miles. The railroads solved all these problems and became the model for all large businesses. The main innovators were three engineers, Benjamin H. Latrobe of the Baltimore and Ohio, Daniel C. McCallum of the Erie, and Thomson of the Pennsylvania. They devised the functional departments and first defined the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority,</b> responsibility, and communication with the concomitant separation of line and staff duties which have remained the principles of the modern American corporation.|$|E
25|$|Partnerships {{present the}} {{involved}} parties with complex negotiation and special challenges {{that must be}} navigated unto agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of responsibility, <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and succession, how success is evaluated and distributed, and often {{a variety of other}} factors must all be negotiated. Once agreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by civil law, especially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement affirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up Articles of Partnership. Trust and pragmatism are also essential as it cannot be expected that everything can be written in the initial partnership agreement, therefore quality governance and clear communication are critical success factors in the long run. It is common for information about formally partnered entities to be made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public records laws.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> {{were also}} blurred as GHQ Air Force {{controlled}} only combat flying units within the continental United States. The Air Corps {{was responsible for}} training, aircraft development, doctrine, and supply, while the ground forces corps area commanders still controlled installations and the personnel manning them. An example of the difficulties this arrangement imposed on commanders was that while the commander of GHQ Air Force {{was responsible for the}} discipline of his command, he had no court martial authority over his personnel, which was retained by the corps area commander. Base commanders of Air Corps installations reported to as many as four different higher echelons. The issue of control of bases was ameliorated in 1936 when GHQAF bases were exempted from corps area authority on recommendation of the Inspector General's Department, but in November 1940 it was restored again to Corps Area control when Army General Headquarters was activated.|$|E

500|$|The South African {{government}} initially {{became involved}} {{in an effort to}} counter the Chinese presence in Angola, which was feared might escalate the conflict into a local theatre of the Cold War. In 1975, South African Prime Minister B.J. Vorster authorized Operation Savannah, which began as an effort to protect engineers constructing the dam at Calueque, after unruly UNITA soldiers took over. [...] The dam, paid for by South Africa, was felt to be at risk. [...] The South African Defence Force (SADF) despatched an armoured task force to secure Calueque, and from this Operation Savannah escalated, there being no formal government in place and thus no clear <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> The South Africans came to commit thousands of soldiers to the intervention, and ultimately clashed with Cuban forces assisting the MPLA.|$|E
500|$|On 1 August 1941, General Marshall named Devers Chief of the Armored Force, {{which was}} {{headquartered}} at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Devers replaced a mechanized cavalry legend, {{the terminally ill}} Major General Adna R. Chaffee, Jr., who had been appointed the first Chief just a year earlier. Devers reported directly to Marshall. He was responsible for inspecting, organizing and training the Army's armored divisions and separate non-divisional tank battalions, including all non-tank personnel assigned. McNair's Army General Headquarters (GHQ) was in tactical charge of all U.S. ground forces, but GHQ specifically did not control the semi-autonomous Armored Force, which was considered a [...] "quasi-arm". The Armored Force had complete control of its own training, doctrine and organization. In a major reorganization of the War Department in March 1942, McNair was named Commander of a new component, Army Ground Forces (AGF), which replaced GHQ. Relations between GHQ/AGF and the Armored Force were distant and <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> and responsibility were often unclear. McNair seemed to prefer leaving Devers alone.|$|E

500|$|Baxter's biggest {{clashes with}} {{academic}} staff were over governance issues. He had {{a preference for}} industry-style organisation, with clear <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> In 1957, he created a committee of deans, chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an administrative mechanism which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away {{with the election of}} deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being primus inter pares among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean {{who was in charge of}} administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors. Ronald Hartwell characterised Baxter's administration as [...] "unusual, undemocratic and unacademic". His successor, Rupert Myers, declared that: [...] "History will show Sir Philip Baxter to have been a great educational administrator who built a fine university and made many beneficial changes in the ways universities handled their business and interacted with governments and the community." ...|$|E

Expressing frustration at the NTSB's unwillingness to speculate on a cause, one FBI agent described the NTSB as [...] "No opinions. No nothing". Meanwhile, the NTSB was required to refute or play down speculation about conclusions and evidence, frequently supplied to reporters by law enforcement officials and politicians. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW), an invited party to the NTSB investigation, criticized the undocumented removal by FBI agents of wreckage from the hangar where it was stored.|$|E
40|$|Extract: FJ Leonhardt Pty Ltd (the 2 Ì† 2 driller 2 Ì† 2) {{sued for}} payment under a {{contract}} to drill for water. The contract had been performed without all the necessary permits.

The Lord, as his part of the covenant, is to pour out his spirit upon them, redeem them from their sins, raise them in the first resurrection, and give them eternal life.
