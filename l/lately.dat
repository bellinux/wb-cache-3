5|$|Michael {{is trying}} to juggle his lives in the two realities, and wears a red {{wristband}} on his wrist in the reality where Hannah is alive and a green one in the reality where Rex is alive. In the Rex, or green, reality, Michael has noticed that Rex has focused a lot on tennis <b>lately,</b> as it was his mother's sport. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) has been talking with Rex <b>lately</b> about his feelings. In the Hannah, or red, reality, Hannah {{is trying to}} write the late Rex out of their lives, wanting to move and try for another child.|$|E

5|$|The National Antarctic Expedition, {{known as}} the Discovery Expedition after the ship Discovery, {{was the brainchild of}} Sir Clements Markham, {{president}} of the Royal Geographical Society, and had been many years in preparation. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant <b>lately</b> promoted Commander, and had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery.|$|E
5|$|They're coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} about them <b>lately,</b> you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Although she was {{a pioneer}} in the white-line woodcut {{technique}} and {{played a role in the}} development of abstract art in the United States, Lazzell's work faded into obscurity for a time. With a resurgence of interest in the modern print, and especially the white-line woodcut, Lazzell's popularity has surged <b>lately.</b> On August 3, 2012, Lazzell's print 'Sail Boat' reached a staggering $106,200 at auction.|$|E
5|$|I am heartily {{sorry that}} after waiting {{so long for}} you I would set out but a day before your arrival.... I am {{exceeding}} unhappy at our not joining at Weelind , but don't know that either of us are to blame, the militia with us continue to desert, and consequently I cannot remain long in one place otherways should be happy in forming a junction here.... I shall move on slowly for the reasons before recited and you will use the greatest industry as you cannot possibly pass us without our knowledge. I have suffered much <b>lately</b> but you again encourage me.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lately,</b> Cookie {{has also}} taught {{children}} {{the importance of}} eating a balanced diet. This doesn't mean that Cookie rounds out his diet with plates, trucks, ukuleles, and other objects the munching monster {{has been known to}} devour. This means that Cookie now eats a fair share of salads, meats, and vegetables to set a good example for viewers at home. And Cookie doesn't mind a bit. Sure he loves cookies, but he likes the act of eating in general. As long as his mouth is full, his heart is happy.|$|E
5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world <b>lately?...</b> There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|Professor Layton and the Last Specter {{takes place}} {{three years before}} the events of Professor Layton and the Curious Village in a fictional English village known as Misthallery. In Misthallery, {{citizens}} have long spoken of legends of a specter who rose from the mist to defend the village whenever the Specter's Flute was played. <b>Lately,</b> a monster who is believed by the town's population to be this specter has been attacking the village {{during the middle of}} the night, destroying homes and buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} strain {{described by}} Escherich {{is believed to}} be lost, consequently a new type strain (neotype) was chosen as a representative: the neotype strain is U5/41T,, the type strain (U5/41T) of Escherichia coli, and a proposal for delineating subspecies in microbial taxonomy|journal=Standards in Genomic Sciences|volume=9|pages=2|year=2013|doi=10.1186/1944-3277-9-2|url=http://www.standardsingenomics.com/content/9/1/2}} also known under the deposit names DSM 30083, ATCC 11775, and NCTC 9001, which is pathogenic to chickens and has an O1:K1:H7 serotype. However, in most studies, either O157:H7, K-12 MG1655, or K-12 W3110 were used as a representative E. coli. The genome of the type strain has only <b>lately</b> been sequenced.|$|E
5|$|The street's {{location}} {{in the city and}} its landmark attraction has made it <b>lately</b> a highly prestigious area, with several new luxurious restaurants. However, the descent's sewer and water systems have not been upgraded within the past 100 years, thereby underlining the need for a new system to be installed. Although, city authorities have not yet scheduled a new sewer project system to be installed.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Soviet {{secondary}} education institutes introduced tuition fees, and the scholarship fund was cut. Shanina received little {{financial support from}} home and on 11 September 1941, she took a job in kindergarten No. 2 (<b>lately</b> known as Beryozka) in Arkhangelsk, with which she was offered a free apartment. She studied in the evenings {{and worked in the}} kindergarten during the daytime. The children liked Shanina and their parents appreciated her. Shanina graduated from college in the 1941–42 academic year, when the Soviet Union was in the grip of World WarII.|$|E
5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division but <b>lately,</b> have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E
5|$|Boydell {{had opened}} up a new market with Niobe and he quickly {{followed}} up this success. With a prospering business and capital in reserve, he embarked on several ambitious projects, often simultaneously. In 1769, he began A Collection of Prints, Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in England. Its last, and ninth volume, was finished in 1792 to great critical and financial success. In 1773, he began A Set of Prints Engraved after the Most Capital Paintings in the Collection of Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of Russia, <b>Lately</b> in the Possession of the Earl of Orford at Houghton in Norfolk, which was finished in 1788.|$|E
5|$|How, indeed, he {{presided over}} the Church which is among us, and saved that sacred ship, in storm, and in wave, and billow; and what a bold front he showed to the emperor, and how he lay down his life for the sheep and {{underwent}} that blessed slaughter; these things and such as these, we will leave to the elder among our teachers, and to our common father, to speak of. For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as happened <b>lately,</b> and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, I mean those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained {{in the suburbs of}} the city....|$|E
5|$|Northern Command was one {{of several}} {{geographically}} based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Established in April 1944, it evolved from No.9 Operational Group, which had been the RAAF's primary mobile formation in the South West Pacific theatre since September 1942, but had <b>lately</b> become a garrison force in New Guinea. Northern Command was headquartered initially at Milne Bay and then, from August 1944, in Madang. It conducted operations in New Guinea, New Britain, and Bougainville {{until the end of the}} war. Re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, it was headquartered in Port Moresby from March 1946 and disbanded in February 1947.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is a type}} of computation {{in which}} many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has been employed for many years, mainly in high-performance computing, but interest in it has grown <b>lately</b> due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years, parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall {{was built}} in the mid-15th century, and in the early 16th century the {{entrance}} porch and oriel room was added to {{the eastern side of the}} hall, and the great parlour and little parlour to the south of the hall, with bedrooms above. Sometime after the Lyte family sold the Manor in 1755, tenants moved in and the house gradually fell into disrepair. In 1810 it was reported by a neighbour that the north range 'had <b>lately</b> been destroyed and a farm house built on the site', (this north range is dated by architectural historians to the late 18th century) and by the time John Buckler came to draw the house in 1835 the west range had also disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood on the Sun. Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys {{had hoped that}} an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box office}} than Johnny Come <b>Lately.</b> At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned out and then sold.|$|E
