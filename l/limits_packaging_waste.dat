40|$|For {{a nuclear}} waste {{repository}} in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain, {{there are two}} thermal loading approaches to using decay heat constructively [...] that is, to substantially reduce relative humidity and liquid flow near <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> for a considerable time, and thereby <b>limit</b> <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> degradation and radionuclide dissolution and release. ``Extended dryout`` achieves these effects with a thermal load high enough to generate large-scale (coalesced) rock dryout. ``Localized dryout``(which uses wide drift spacing and a thermal load too low for coalesced dryout) achieves them by maintaining a large temperature difference between the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> and drift wall; this is done with close <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> spacing (generating a high line-heat load) and/or low-thermal-conductivity backfill in the drift. Backfill can greatly reduce relative humidity on the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> in both the localized and extended dryout approaches. Besides using decay heat constructively, localized dryout reduces the possibility that far-field temperature rise and condensate buildup above the drifts might adversely affect waste isolation...|$|R

A {{detailed}} {{review of}} the inventory data base records and the existing models for source release {{led to the development}} of a new modeling capability to describe the liquid phase aqueous transport from the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> volumes. Inventory is sorted into four release form categories and screened in a comparison of leachate concentrations to the drinking water limit. Percolation through the disposal unit is prescribed in an independent surface water balance model incorporating site rainfall statistics. <b>Waste</b> <b>package</b> types and the disposal unit matrix have independently specified solubility limits and solid-liquid phase partition coefficients, or Kd values. Analytic solutions for inventory limited release of each nuclide in each of the four different <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> release forms are computed. Isotopic contributions are summed over elements to <b>limit</b> the <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> liquid phase concentrations to the elemental solubility limits. Time dependent releases from the <b>waste</b> <b>packages</b> for each nuclide which may be inventory or solubility limited are specified as model output which is provided as the source term to the unsaturated transport model. The <b>waste</b> <b>package</b> efflux is distributed over the 2 -D unsaturated zone model grid points corresponding to the cross-sections for 5 representative disposal units within the mesa top.

The existing solid waste infrastructure does not promote the recovery ofpackaging waste generated in the fast food industry. The theoretical recovery rate of the <b>packaging</b> <b>waste</b> is high, 93 %, while the actual recovery rate is only 29 % consisting of secondary packaging manufactured from cardboard.
