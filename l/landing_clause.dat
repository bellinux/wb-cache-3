5000|$|Apportionment by {{operation}} of law may be brought about where by act of law a lease becomes inoperative as regards its subject-matter, or by the [...] "act of God", as, for instance, where part of an estate is submerged by the encroachments of the sea. To the same category belongs the apportionment of rent which takes place under various statutes (e.g. the <b>Lands</b> <b>Clauses</b> Consolidation Act 1845, § 119, when land is required for public purposes; the Agricultural Holdings Act 1883, § 41, {{in the case of}} a tenant from year to year receiving notice to quit part of a holding; and the Irish Land Act 1903 § 61, apportionment of quit and crown rents).|$|R

25|$|In England and Wales, {{and other}} jurisdictions that follow the {{principles}} of English law, the related term compulsory purchase is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, {{the value of the}} taken land is determined by the Upper Tribunal. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal Acts are the <b>Lands</b> <b>Clauses</b> Consolidation Act 1845, the Land Compensation Act 1961, the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, the Land Compensation Act 1973, the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the Planning and Compensation Act 1991, and the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} proposal {{to construct the}} railway line drew objections from one J.H. Wilson, the owner of [...] "The Grange" [...] house, who refused to allow a station on his estate and demanded that the line be deviated through a tunnel. The railway company {{was not prepared to}} go to such expense and it was agreed instead that the route of the line would be shifted north. Wilson still stubbornly refused to part with his land and required the matter to be taken to arbitration under the <b>Lands</b> <b>Clauses</b> Consolidation Act 1845. Before the arbitrator he demanded £5,500 compensation, but only received £1,400. In deference to Mr Wilson, the station, which opened in March 1860, was named [...] "Grange Road" [...] and later [...] "Grange Road for Crawley Down and Turners Hill".|$|R
40|$|Acquisition law {{during the}} Australian colonial period {{was far more}} robust than many might think. All of the Australian colonies enacted {{acquisitions}} legislation during this time, usually adapting the <b>Land</b> <b>Clauses</b> Consolidation Act 1845 (UK). The Australian colonies modified their acquisitions Acts, tailoring them to their own needs. Unlike the Americans, however, none of the Australian States inserted acquisition language in their Constitutions. There were many acquisition cases in the Australian colonies during the 1900 s. The earliest cases usually dealt with Crown grants and reservations. Later cases described acquisitions law in respect to mill dams and flooding of property, as well as harm to property from the raising of roads or railways. However, {{the largest number of}} acquisition cases dealt with the calculation of compensa- tion. In reviewing acquisition cases, courts usually were quite strict in following the applicable Acts. 20 page(s...|$|R
50|$|To show {{gratitude}} {{to those who}} did not participate in the rebellion, the British government by gazette notification No. 19 of 1818 reduced the grain tax from 1/10 to 1/14. By section 22 of the same order all lands belonging to those in the Korale were exempted from <b>land</b> tax. <b>Clause</b> 53 authorized a centralized civil and judicial system of administration with a headquarters in Kandy. A team of three British civil servants began operating at this administrative headquarters.|$|R
5000|$|The Salic Law (Lex Salica) is {{a code of}} law written {{around the}} time of Clovis I for the Salian Franks, in Latin mixed with Germanic words. It deals mainly with {{monetary}} compensations (wehrgeld) and also with civil law with respect to men and <b>land.</b> <b>Clause</b> 6 in title 59, which deals with inheritance rules for allodial lands (i.e. family lands not held in benefice) specifies that in [...] "concerning salic lands (terra Salica) no portion or inheritance is for a woman but all the land belongs to members of the male sex who are brothers." [...] A capitulary of Chilperic, ca. 575, expands this by admitting inheritance by a daughter in the absence of sons: [...] "if a man had neighbors but after his death sons and daughters remained, as long as there were sons they should have the land just as the Salic Law provides. And if the sons are already dead then a daughter may receive the land just as the sons would have done had they lived." [...] The monarchy is nowhere mentioned. The Salic Law was reformulated under Charlemagne and still applied in the 9th century, but it slowly disappeared as it became incorporated into local common laws. By the 14th century it was completely forgotten.|$|R
60|$|But I {{hope the}} House of Lords {{and those who}} back them will not be under any illusions about the Budget and the {{position}} of the Government. The Government is in earnest about the Budget. The Budget carries with it their fortunes and the fortunes of the Liberal Party. Careful argument, reasonable amendment, amicable concession, not affecting the principles at stake--all these we offer while the Bill is in the House of Commons. But when all that is said and done, as the Bill leaves the House of Commons so it must stand. It would be a great pity if Lord Curzon, the Indian pro-Consul, or the London Spectator--it would be a great pity if those potentates were to make the great mistake of supposing that the Government would acquiesce in the excision of the <b>land</b> <b>clauses</b> of the Budget by the House of Lords. Such a course is unthinkable. Any Liberal Government which adopted it would be swiftly ruined. The land proposals of the Government have not been made without long deliberation and full responsibility. We shall not fail to carry them effectively through the House of Commons; still less shall we accept any amendment {{at the hands of the}} House of Lords.|$|R
50|$|To {{consolidate}} (Latin consolidare, from con-, together, and solidus, firm) is {{to press}} compactly together, {{put on a}} firm basis, and especially bring together into one strong whole. The practice of legislating for small portions of a subject only at a time, which is characteristic of the English parliament, produces as a necessary consequence great confusion in the statute law. The Acts relating to any subject of importance or difficulty will be found to be scattered over many years, and through the operation of clauses partially repealing or amending former Acts, the final sense of the legislature becomes enveloped in unintelligible or contradictory expressions. Where opportunity offers, the law thus expressed in many statutes is sometimes recast in a single statute, called a consolidation Act. By 1911 there were, among such, Acts dealing with the customs, stamps and stamp duties, public health, weights and measures, sheriffs, coroners, county courts, housing, municipal corporations, libraries, trustees, copyhold, diseases of animals, merchant shipping, friendly societies, &c. These observations apply to the public general Acts of the legislature. On the other hand, in settling private Acts, such as those relating to railway and canal enterprise, the legislature always inserted certain clauses founded on reasons of public policy applicable to the business in question. To avoid the necessity of constantly re-enacting the same principles in private Acts, their common clauses were embodied in separate statutes, and their provisions are ordered to be incorporated in any private Act of the description mentioned therein. Such are the <b>Lands</b> <b>Clauses</b> Acts, the Companies Clauses Acts and the Railways Clauses Acts.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest number}} of {{surviving}} charters are diplomas, or royal charters, that granted privileges and rights, usually over land. The typical diploma had three sections: protocol, corpus, and eschatocol. The protocol opened the charter by invoking God and enumerating the pious considerations for the King's act (proem). The corpus was usually in Latin and named the beneficiary, recorded the grant or transfer (dispositive clause), reserved common burdens (reservation clause) and invoked the wrath of God on anyone who failed to observe it (anathema or sanction). The corpus' final section, which was often in Old English, described {{the boundaries of the}} <b>land</b> (boundary <b>clause).</b> The eschatocol was composed of a dating clause and witness-list, which usually included powerful lay and ecclesiastical members of the king's court.|$|R
40|$|India {{has used}} export {{processing}} zones as a development strategy {{since the mid}} 1960 s. The performance of these zones did not meet expectations and, in 2001, the government changed the rules and the name, and recast them as special economic zones. Indian special economic zone policy was formulated to facilitate the private development of big industrial townships. This is {{a significant departure from}} the typical export zone model, where governments usually develop the zone and invite entrepreneurs to start firms within it. However, the zone policy is unlikely to achieve its objective because of land acquisition problems. This paper analyses the effect of land laws such as land ceiling and <b>land</b> use <b>clauses,</b> and the political nature of land dealings in the context of special economic zone development in India, and con-cludes that private land acquisition is not possible with the current structure of land laws in India, and that this is a primary problem for the private development in spe-cial economic zones in India. 1...|$|R
50|$|Bushnell and Langston filed a writ of {{habeas corpus}} with the Ohio Supreme Court, {{claiming}} that the federal court {{did not have the}} authority to arrest and try them because the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was unconstitutional. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three-to-two ruling. Although Chief Justice Joseph Rockwell Swan was personally opposed to slavery, he wrote that his judicial duty left him no choice but to acknowledge that an Act of the United States Congress was the supreme law of the <b>land</b> (see Supremacy <b>Clause),</b> and to uphold it.|$|R
5000|$|Gladstone {{introduced}} the Bill in the House of Commons on 7 April. In his speech, Gladstone proclaimed that [...] "the old {{law of the}} country, corresponding, I believe, with the general law of Europe, recognizes the tenant right, and therefore recognizes, {{if you choose to}} call it, joint proprietorship". He added that [...] "there is no country in the world which, when her social relations come to permit it, will derive more benefit than Ireland from perfect freedom of contract in land. Unhappily she is not in a state to permit of it; but I will not abandon the hope that the period may arrive". The economic situation of Ireland demanded larger farms, but the Bill consolidated the division of Irish land into smallholdings. Gladstone said, [...] "I decline to enter into the economical part of the subject". The <b>Land</b> Court <b>clauses</b> were [...] "the salient point and the cardinal principle of the Bill". The court would inject order into the confused state of Irish social relations, creating stability and reconciliation where coercion could not reach. He added that it was a [...] "right and needful measure" [...] but was also a [...] "form of centralization, referring to public authority what ought to be transacted by a private individual" [...] and urged the Irish not to [...] "stereotype and stamp it with the seal of perpetuity".|$|R
5000|$|The Liberals {{were elected}} in 1880. The Cabinet {{discussed}} the Coercion Act and {{an extension of}} the Bright <b>Land</b> Purchase <b>clauses</b> of the 1870 Act and decided that it was unnecessary to renew the Coercion Act that would expire on 1 June and that amending the Land Act was too complex for that year, the 1880 parliamentary session being a short one. Gladstone wrote to the Duke of Argyll on 14 June, regarding the eviction of tenants: [...] "We never considered the question of ejectments connected with the present distress in Ireland.... I {{was under the impression that}} ejectments were diminishing, but I now find from figures first seen on Saturday June that they seem rather to increase... the duty of enquiring, where I had not previously known there was urgent cause to inquire".A Royal Commission under Lord Bessborough (who held an Irish earldom) was set up in June to enquire into the workings of the 1870 Act and it sat between September and January 1881. It held 65 sessions, heard evidence from 80 landlords, 70 agents, 500 tenants as well from a diverse range of other people. The Commission looked into all aspects of Irish agriculture and the effects of the agricultural depression caused by the export of huge quantities of cheap food from the prairie farms of North America. The Report of the Commission decided for the three Fs: fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.|$|R
40|$|Act no 22 of 1994 promulgated a {{critically}} important legislation allowing for restitution of {{rights in land}} to persons or communities dispossessed of such rights after 19 June 1913 {{as a result of}} past racially discriminatory laws or practices. The Restitution of Land Rights Act as it was titled was firm about the conditions which entitled claimants to lodge a claim and in return, be compensated financially or be offered compensatory State owned <b>land.</b> Whilst these <b>clauses</b> have long been amended, what is evident is that the original legislation and its subsequent versions have missed critical issues in legislating for assessing valid dispossession. Further, {{the manner in which the}} Land Claims Court currently addresses the issues of these claims increasingly allows for restitution beyond the original dispossession, effectively minimising the value of historical reports. This paper will discuss this disarticulation, in the hope that discourse can begin to address the future of investigating land issues, or whether wholesale restitution is the only option...|$|R
5000|$|Federal {{lands are}} {{lands in the}} United States for which {{ownership}} is claimed by the U.S. federal government, pursuant to Article Four, section 3, clause 2 of the United States Constitution. The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that this section empowers Congress to retain federal lands, to regulate federal lands such as by limiting cattle grazing, and to sell such lands. As of March 2012, out of the 2.27 billion acres (918.6 million hectares) in the country, about 28% of the total was owned by the Federal government according to the Interior Department. The United States Supreme Court has upheld the broad powers {{of the federal government}} to deal with federal lands, for example having unanimously held in Kleppe v. New Mexico that [...] "the complete power that Congress has over federal <b>lands</b> under this <b>clause</b> necessarily includes the power to regulate and protect wildlife living there, state law notwithstanding." ...|$|R

(Heavy snow in the western North Carolina mountains made it nearly impossible for those from the Hill and Valley Towns to travel.) After a week of negotiations, Schermerhorn proposed that in exchange for all Cherokee land east of the Mississippi River, the Cherokees would receive $5,000,000 from the U.S. (to be distributed per capita to {{all members of the}} tribe), an additional $500,000 for educational funds, title in perpetuity to land in Indian Territory equal to that given up, and full compensation for all property left behind.

40|$|M. A. This study {{analyses}} {{the government}} mechanisms for resolving conflict over land between white farmers and labour tenants in South Africa. Against {{the background of}} the evolvement of the institutions for resolution of conflict over land, the issues addressed include: problems experienced by the Land Claims Court with the Land Reform Act; acceptability of the Land Reform Act to farmers and labour tenants; {{and the use of the}} government institutions of conflict resolution by farmers and labour tenants. A literature analysis of both primary and secondary sources supplemented by interviews with individuals within the institutions of conflict resolution and land redistribution in KwaZulu- Natal and Mpumalanga form the basis of the research. The institution of conflict resolution came as a result of agreements that were reached at CODESA. The property and <b>land</b> reform <b>clauses</b> that were agreed upon during the negotiations served as the guidelines for the land reform policies, such as the Restitution of Land Rights Act of 1994, Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act of 1996 and the Extension of Security of Tenure Act of 1997. However, labour tenants and farmers did make an input in the Green and White papers on Land Reform, which led to the establishment of the Land Claims Court. The Land Claims Court and magistrate's courts encountered problems in interpreting the Land Reform Act. The Courts are experiencing problems in interpreting the definition of a "labour tenant", particularly in paragraph (a), (b) and (c), and whether these paragraphs should be interpreted cumulatively or disjunctively. Although there is inconsistency in the interpretation of the Labour Tenants Act, the adjudicative bodies are largely becoming predictable in that conflicts are increasingly handled successfully. The bad draftsmanship is not the only problem regarding the Land Reform. Another problem experienced is the evictions of labour tenants. The evictions are attributed to capitalisation of agriculture, drought, fear and non-acceptance of the Land Reform Act. Although some farmers do not utilise the institutions of conflict resolution and disregard some of the clauses in the Act, farmers and labour tenants are nevertheless gradually beginning to accept land reform. Instead of using violent and illegal means, the conflicting parties are beginning to opt for peaceful means of resolving their disputes. The conflicts are submitted to institutions of conflict resolution, particularly the mediation institutions. The high cost involved in litigation and the likelihood of getting rights to land attribute to this development...|$|R
5000|$|After {{setting out}} {{a list of}} {{individual}} grievances and statutes that had been broken, the Petition of Right declares that Englishmen have various [...] "rights and liberties", and provides that no person {{should be forced to}} provide a gift, loan or tax without an Act of Parliament, that no free individual should be imprisoned or detained unless a cause has been shown, and that soldiers or members of the Royal Navy should not be billeted in private houses without the free consent of the owner. In relation to martial law, the Petition first repeated the due process chapter of Magna Carta, and then provided that: [...] Nevertheless, of late divers commissions under Your Majesty's great seal have issued forth, by which certain powers have been assigned and appointed commissioners, with power and authority to proceed within the land according to the justice of martial law against such soldiers and marines or other dissolute persons going with them as should commit robbery murder, etc...and by such summary course and order as is used by armies in time of war, to proceed to the trial and condemnation of such offenders, and to cause them to be executed and put to death according to the law martial...We do humbly pray, Your most excellent Majesty...that the aforesaid commissions...may be revoked and anulled; and that hereafter no commission of like nature may issue forth to any person or persons whatsoever to be executed as aforesaid, lest by color of them any of Your Majesty's be destroyed or put to death contrary to the laws or practises of the <b>land.</b> [...] This <b>clause</b> was directly addressed to the various commissions issued by Charles and his military commanders, restricting the use of martial law except in war or direct rebellion and prohibiting the formation of commissions. A state of war automatically activated martial law; as such, the only purpose for commissions, in their view, was to unjustly permit martial law in circumstances that did not require it.|$|R
