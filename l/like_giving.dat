5|$|The {{genesis of}} the project came in 1998 as Pixar was {{finishing}} work on A Bug's Life. At that time Jorgen Klubien began writing a new script called The Yellow Car, about an electric car living in a gas-guzzling world. Some of the original drawings and characters were produced in 1998 and the producers agreed that Cars {{could be the next}} movie after A Bug's Life and would be released in early 1999, particularly around June 4. However, the movie was eventually scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2. Later, production resumed with major script changes, <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> Mater, Doc, and a few other characters a bigger part.|$|E

25|$|Gaye was {{inspired}} by the Black Panther Party and supported the efforts they put forth <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> free meals to poor families door to door, however, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were nonviolent. The lyrics and music of What's Going On discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues. Gaye {{was inspired}} to make this album because of events such as the Vietnam War, the 1967 race riots in Detroit, and the Kent State shootings.|$|E

25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not feel like they actually received what they expected in return and this made them feel like they had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E
25|$|For this reason, Egyptian rituals often {{included}} {{actions that}} symbolized mythical events. Temple rites included {{the destruction of}} models representing malign gods like Set or Apophis, private magical spells called upon Isis to heal the sick as she did for Horus, and funerary rites such as the Opening of the Mouth ceremony and ritual offerings to the dead evoked the myth of Osiris' resurrection. Yet rituals rarely, if ever, involved dramatic reenactments of myths. There are borderline cases, like a ceremony alluding to the Osiris myth in which two women took on the roles of Isis and Nephthys, but scholars disagree about whether these performances formed sequences of events. Much of Egyptian ritual was focused on more basic activities <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> offerings to the gods, with mythic themes serving as ideological background rather than {{as the focus of}} a rite. Nevertheless, myth and ritual strongly influenced each other. Myths could inspire rituals, like the ceremony with Isis and Nephthys; and rituals that did not originally have a mythic meaning could be reinterpreted as having one, {{as in the case of}} offering ceremonies, in which food and other items given to the gods or the dead were equated with the Eye of Horus.|$|E
25|$|Having won the toss again, Stephen Fleming {{elected to}} bat first but once more New Zealand {{failed to produce}} a {{competitive}} total and South Africa chased it down comfortably. The New Zealanders, needing a win to force the finals series into a third match, had started their innings slowly and it wasn't until the fifth over that they scored their maiden run. An entertaining run a ball 43 from Lou Vincent got the team back on track but after he fell and Jacques Kallis dismissed Craig McMillan, New Zealand were struggling at 5–72. Although a 75 run partnership from Chris Cairns and Chris Harris looked <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> New Zealand a chance of posting over 200, the tail fell cheaply due to good bowling from Allan Donald. During their innings, the match {{had been reduced to}} 46 overs due to rain and the South Africans were thus chasing a revised target of 172. Herschelle Gibbs, despite losing his opening partner Gary Kirsten for just two runs, scored an aggressive 46 to give the South Africans a good platform. Jonty Rhodes brought up his half century and accumulated 16 runs in the 38th over, bowled by Andre Adams, before a pull to the boundary by Mark Boucher off Daniel Vettori the following over gave South Africa the title.|$|E

Thompson and Maguire stayed in Bulawayo to defend the concession against potential challenges. Rudd reached Kimberley and Rhodes on 19 November 1888, a mere 20 days after the document's signing, and commented with great satisfaction that this marked a record that would surely not be broken until the railway was laid into the interior. Rhodes was elated by Rudd's results, describing the concession as [...] "so gigantic it is <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> a man the whole of Australia".

500|$|Cortese {{believed}} that Ruby {{fell in love}} with Sam {{over the course of the}} season, though she questioned whether this was [...] "true love" [...] or her being [...] "in love with what he can do". As Cortese noted, [...] "He has something she can nurture. It's almost like a mother bear and her cub [...] how protective she is... Sam's all , so it's almost <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> birth, in a weird, messed-up way." [...] She stated that the sex scene between her character and Sam was [...] "about two people who are so broken and sad" [...] and compared it to similar sex scenes from the film Monster's Ball. Although Ruby eventually reveals herself as a traitor, Kripke wrote her final scene with the intention of depicting Ruby as [...] "the opposite of evil" [...] and to show that Ruby does care about Sam, despite her manipulation of him to free Lucifer; Kripke explained that, in Ruby's mind, she had to lead Sam down that path because [...] "it was for his own good".|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 interview, Pierre {{notes that}} fans {{have told him}} that they find Commit This to Memory a [...] "winter album," [...] to which he agrees, noting the unintentional mention {{of the new year}} in several songs. [...] His lyricism on Commit This to Memory centralizes around change and, in his words, [...] "being a {{complete}} fuckup, yet, at the same time, being somewhat successful". On the record, he [...] "addresses the themes of substance abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships." [...] Pierre penned [...] "Everything Is Alright" [...] as a summary of his OCD (Obsessive–compulsive disorder) tendencies. He intended to utilize his social anxiety and fears in the song's form, which he has since employed in numerous other compositions. [...] "I don’t think the [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] is correct, but it’s something where the verses are one thing and then the chorus is another, but it's sort of <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> yourself a pep talk," [...] said Pierre. The song's lyrics include hating such mundane things as [...] "theme parks, flying, strangers, [...] waiting in line," [...] things that Pierre genuinely disliked {{at the time of the}} song's writing. For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson's writing styles. Keeping in the Waits/Folds inspiration, Pierre strove to write from another person's point of view; in the case of [...] "Time Turned Fragile", it is sung from the perspective of his father.|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible {{has also}} {{received}} {{a large amount of}} criticism from people and organizations who find its content to be dangerous. Much of this criticism came during the period of [...] "Satanic panic," [...] when Satanic ritual abuse was feared to be epidemic. Much of this media coverage, however, has been denounced as [...] "uncritical and sensationalized." [...] Tom Harpur condemns the book as [...] "blasphemous" [...] and [...] "socially seditious," [...] and blames it for causing an increase in gruesome violence, ritual abuse, and other obscene acts. Critics have also accused The Satanic Bible of encouraging violence and murder, particularly in young people considered to be impressionable. Dawn Perlmutter criticizes it for providing adolescents with bad messages and messages that can be easily misinterpreted. Possession of The Satanic Bible has been used by some studies to identify adolescents who are antisocial, and some warn that possession of the book is a warning sign of emotional issues. The Council on Mind Abuse took a very negative view of The Satanic Bible. Former Executive Director Rob Tucker warned parents to look for The Satanic Bible in their children's bedrooms, saying, [...] "You have to help the child fight this obsession like any other addiction" [...] and [...] "It's <b>like</b> <b>giving</b> drugs to a kid who is already on the edge." [...] Attempts to ban the book from schools and public libraries have been made in various places around the world, and bans or limitations on the book in prisons have been repeatedly challenged in court. However, opposition to The Satanic Bible has rarely led to its removal; these bans are rare. The book was banned in South Africa from 1973 to 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} {{the social}} reforms {{presented by the}} Prime Minister Giuseppe Zanardelli in November 1902, Sonnino introduced a reform bill to alleviate poverty in southern Italy.
