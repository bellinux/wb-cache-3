But {{this should not}} add much extra cost. Compared with the DC system, the AC system can save the anti-stray current devices along the metro line, save rectifier units and DC switches at each substation, and save expensive energy storage devices or renewable energy feedback devices. Consequently the metro’s underground equipment can be simplified, thus occupied area is reduced. In terms of integrated automatic control devices [4, 5, 6], both the DC and AC systems have the similar scale and costs. However, the AC system needs to have the NCDs, the cost for an AC–DC–C train is higher than that for a DC–AC train. Generally, one-time costs of an AC system may be close {{to that of a}} DC system, but the MSS installed capacity of an AC traction system is significantly lower than the capacity sum of all individual SSs. Thus power resources and costs of the basic electricity are saved. In an AC system, the renewable energy can be directly used in an efficient way, resulting in further saving of power cost. All of these merits to an AC system are beneficial to the economy and in line with the national policy of energy conservation and emission reduction.|$|E
40|$|Interactions between {{nutrient}} limitation {{and light}} limitation are fundamental for the dynamics {{and structure of}} phytoplankton communities. We investigate a model that predicts the outcome of competition for nutrients and light in a mixed water column {{on the basis of}} monoculture characteristics. Growth in monoculture leads to a steady state. The nutrient availability and light penetration in this steady state characterize the minimal resource requirements of a species. These minimal requirements not only determine monoculture growth but also the outcome of competition. We show that competition for nutrients and light can be investigated by means of a graphical isocline approach. In contrast to earlier resource-based approaches, our model predicts that {{it is not only the}} ratio of nutrient <b>supply</b> to <b>light</b> <b>supply</b> that matters for the outcome of competition but also their absolute supply rates. It is even possible that a species that competes successfully when there is a high or low <b>light</b> <b>supply</b> is displaced when the <b>light</b> <b>supply</b> is intermediate. Factors such as mixing depth and background turbidity also affect the composition of phytoplankton communities.

Many {{studies have examined the}} effects of heterogeneous <b>light</b> <b>supply</b> on growth, morphology, physiology and biomass allocation of clonal plants, but few have tested those effects on intraspecific competition. In a greenhouse experiment, we grew one (no competition) or nine ramets (with intraspecific competition) of a stoloniferous clonal plant, Duchesnea indica, in three homogeneous light conditions (high, medium and low light intensity) and two heterogeneous ones differing in patch size (large and small patch treatments). The total light in the two heterogeneous treatments was the same as that in the homogeneous medium light treatment. Both decreasing light intensity and intraspecific competition significantly decreased the growth (biomass, number of ramets and total stolon length) of D. indica. As compared with the homogeneous medium light treatment, the large patch treatment significantly increased the growth of D. indica without intraspecific competition. However, the growth of D. indica with competition did not differ among the homogeneous medium light, the large and the small patch treatments. Consequently, light heterogeneity significantly increased intraspecific competition intensity, as measured by the decreased log response ratio. These results suggest that spatial heterogeneity in <b>light</b> <b>supply</b> can alter intraspecific interactions of clonal plants...|$|R

40|$|Cultivation of microalgae in the {{photobioreactor}} at {{the optimum}} growth needs many considerations {{to be put}} in. The growth of microalgae {{will be based on}} CO 2 supply, temperature and mixing. Another consideration is about the <b>lighting</b> <b>supply.</b> Thus, photobioreactor is designed based on the best criteria to produce the optimum growth. Based on the best criteria, scale-up process is done. To be successful in the scale-up process has many challenges and difficulties. Some of challenges with the growth of microalgae for oil production are that only a very thin layer of suspended algae in a few centimeters deep, is actually active in photosynthesis and. The objective of the research is to do the troubleshooting on scale-up process by using tubular photobioreactor. In this experiment, the microalgae used is Nannochloropsis sp. There are two parts of microalgae cultivation which are in lab scale (2 L) flask and in 390 L tubular photobioreactor. The reconstituted medium using sea salt and F/ 2 are prepared. Four runs with different condition in inoculum volume and sparging air flow rate have been done. Because of the unsuccessful scale-up run, two monitor experiments has been done in flasks based on insufficient inoculum volume and addition of carbon dioxide as causes of failure. From the monitor experiment on insufficient inoculum volume, it can be concluded that the failure of scale-up process is because of inoculum volume which is too dilute; 2. 5 %, 3. 5 %, 5 % and also 10 %. To ensure the scale-up process is successful, the inoculum volume need to be increased as well as denser the concentration of microalgae. In the monitor experiment on the addition of carbon dioxide, with the supplying of carbon dioxide at low flow rate, the growth of microalgae is increased day by day. It is proved that the addition of carbon dioxide at low flow rate is not the cause of failure of the scale-up process. Other causes of failure maybe because of the lower level in sparging air flow rate and photoperiod cycle. As a conclusion, the objectives is achieved and the troubleshooting process is done...|$|E
40|$|Light {{is never}} {{distributed}} homogeneously since {{it forms a}} gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the common theories on nutrient competition are not applicable to competition for light. In this paper, we investigate a model for light-limited growth and competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed water column. The model is based on standard assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics of growth and competition can be quantified {{not only in terms}} of depth but also directly in terms of light availability. We argue that the crucial measure for phytoplankton growth is not a ''critical depth'' but a ''critical light intensity,'' I-out*. For each species, I-out* corresponds to the equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water column when the species is grown in monoculture. I-out* plays a role similar to the ''critical nutrient concentration'' R* used in models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant <b>light</b> <b>supply,</b> the species with the lowest I-out* will competitively exclude all other species. There are, however, some important differences between R* and I-out*. Whereas R* reflects both the local and the total balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient losses, I-out* only reflects the total carbon balance. Moreover, I-out* decreases with increasing <b>light</b> <b>supply,</b> whereas R* is independent of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the outcome of competition for light may depend on the <b>light</b> <b>supply,</b> (2) the compensation point is not a good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3) the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when species compete for both nutrients and light. The outcome of competition for nutrients and light may depend on the nutrient and <b>light</b> <b>supply,</b> on the mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to inanimate substances...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Photosynthetic {{microorganisms}} {{are often}} discussed {{as a new}} feed-stock for food, biochemicals and biofuels. Their production requests however the design and optimisation of specific processes, namely photobioreactors that differs from more classical bioprocesses by the need of a <b>light</b> <b>supply.</b> Some of the applications, as for biofuels, will require mass scale production systems, working thus ideally with solar energy. Further from the technological development of cost-effective mass scale solar production systems, using solar energy induces specific problems. <b>Light</b> <b>supply</b> is indeed the main parameter driving photosynthesis, and thus the process. In solar conditions, this <b>light</b> <b>supply</b> is obviously highly variable (diurnal variation, seasons, clouds…). The process is then fully dynamic and driven by an uncontrolled input, the solar incident flux. A relative simple model integrating radiative transfer, kinetics of photosynthetic growth and solar illumination database is presented so as to emphasize the dynamic behavior of photobioreactors when exploited in solar conditions. This illustrates the full-dependency of the process to illumination regimes, resulting in a complex and transient behaviour of the process. Effects of night, culture harvesting, and more interesting, the interdependency of physical (light) and biological (growth) kinetics are discussed. Results are presented for a location in France for two typical months in the year (June for a summer exploitation, January for a winter exploitation).
