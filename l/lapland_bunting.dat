50|$|The Lapland longspur (Calcarius lapponicus), {{also known}} as the <b>Lapland</b> <b>bunting,</b> is a {{passerine}} bird in the longspur family Calcariidae, a group separated by most modern authors from the Fringillidae (Old World finches).|$|E
50|$|Broadcast 16 December 1998, the {{penultimate}} installment {{concentrates on}} {{the ways in which}} birds rear their offspring. Having successfully incubated their eggs, the moment arrives when they hatch — and then the real challenge begins: feeding the chicks. <b>Lapland</b> <b>buntings</b> and dippers are shown doing so virtually non-stop throughout the day. The Gouldian finch has a further problem in that its tree-hollow nest is dark inside, so its young have conspicuous markings inside their mouths for identification. Grebes are fed feathers with which to line the stomach, and so protect it from fish bones. Coots and pelicans are among those that turn on their own and force death by starvation if there is insufficient food. The European cuckoo tricks other species into raising its chick, but {{it is by no means}} alone in doing this. Protecting a family is also a priority, and brent geese are shown nesting close to snowy owls as a means of insurance, but as soon as the eggs hatch, they and their young must flee to avoid giving their neighbours an easy meal. The million or so sooty terns in the Seychelles prove that there is safety in numbers and the nearby predatory egrets have little success when attempting to steal. The behaviour of Arabian babblers is more akin to that of a troop of monkeys: they do everything for the benefit of a group as a whole. Eventually the day will come when flight beckons, and the grown bird will leave the nest to start a family of its own.|$|R
25|$|The provincial fish is {{the brown}} trout which is found {{together}} with common whitefish, grayling, European perch, Arctic char, burbot, salmon and the carnivorous northern pike. Roughly 250 types of birds {{have been observed}} in Jämtland. The species presence greatly varies, in the fells bluethroat, long-tailed skua, Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, <b>Lapland</b> and snow <b>bunting</b> are found. The forested region is inhabited by species such as hazel hen, black grouse, capercaillie, Siberian jay, three-toed woodpecker and rustic bunting. Several different types of owls dwells in the province and the provincial owl is the northern hawk owl.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ranges of}} the other species in the family are less {{expansive}} {{than those of the}} snow <b>bunting</b> and the <b>Lapland</b> longspur. McKay's <b>bunting</b> breeds solely on several islands in the Bering Sea, and winters primarily on the western coast of Alaska. Additionally, it has been reported occasionally in the Aleutian Islands, and has been a vagrant in British Columbia in Canada as well as Washington (state) and Oregon in the United States. [...] Smith's longspur breeds in Alaska and northern Canada, and winters in the central southern United States. [...] The chestnut-collared longspur's breeding range consists solely of prairie regions in the northern Great Plains and southern Canadian Prairies, while its winter range extends from the southern United States to central Mexico. The breeding range of McCown's longspur {{is similar to that of}} the chestnut-collared longspur, but its winter range does not extend as far south, ending in northern Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The Cairngorms {{provide a}} unique alpine semi-tundra moorland habitat, {{home to many}} rare plants, birds and animals. Speciality bird species on the plateaux include {{breeding}} ptarmigan, dotterel, snow bunting, golden eagle, ring ouzel, and red grouse, with snowy owl, twite, purple sandpiper and <b>Lapland</b> <b>bunting</b> seen on occasion. In the forests, capercaillie, black grouse, Scottish crossbill, parrot crossbill and crested tit are found.|$|E
50|$|These are chunky ground-feeding {{birds with}} long wings {{which are usually}} seen in open areas. Males declare {{ownership}} of a territory by singing during short flights over it. The male's breeding plumage is much brighter than his winter plumage. These birds gather in large flocks in winter. The longspurs are all found in North America; the Lapland longspur, or <b>Lapland</b> <b>bunting,</b> {{is also found in}} Europe and Asia.|$|E
50|$|At least 94 {{bird species}} have been counted on Herschel Island, 40 of which breed there. The island hosts the largest colony of black guillemots in the western Arctic, nesting in the old Anglican mission house.

50|$|Birds, {{especially}} seabirds, are {{an important}} part of Greenland's animal life. On steep mountainsides breed large colonies of auks, puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes. By common ducks include eiders, long-tailed ducks and the king eider and in West Greenland white-fronted goose and in East Greenland pink-footed goose and barnacle goose. Breeding migratory birds are also including snow bunting, <b>lapland</b> <b>bunting,</b> ringed plover, red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope. Of land birds that are usually sedentary, can be highlighted arctic redpoll, ptarmigan, short-eared owl, snowy owl, gyrfalcon and in West Greenland the white-tailed eagle.|$|E
50|$|In its history, many {{rare and}} scarce {{migrating}} birds {{have turned up}} {{on the north side}} of the lake. The island that has 3 resident goats to graze the vegetation, is primarily for bird life. Many common bird species breed on the spit that can be viewed from the only hide on the lake, the north hide. Here are some of the most notable visitors to the lake: Red-throated Diver (1986), Great Northern Diver (1994), Fulmar (2001) Great Shearwater (1999), Leach's Petrol (1987), Gannet (2002), Night Heron (1987), Glossy Ibis (1987), Spoonbill (1995), Pink footed Goose (1992), White-Fronted Goose (1992), Green-Winged Teal (1994), Ring-Necked Duck (1996), Long-Tailed Duck (1981), Velvet Scoter (2006), Spotted Crake (1995), Avocet (2011), Kentish Plover (1981), Temmick's Stint (2004), Pectoral Sandpiper (1995), Purple Sandpiper (1977), Red-Necked Phalarope (1995), Grey Phalarope (1987), Wilson's Phalarope (2007), Pomarine Skua (1982), Great Skua (1987), Sabine's Gull (1981), Caspian Tern (2001), Roseate Tern (1994), Whiskered Tern (2001), Cetti's Warbler (2011), Great Reed Warbler (2008), Golden Oriole (1997), <b>Lapland</b> <b>Bunting</b> (1966), Snow Bunting (1997), and a pair of Black-winged Stilt staying the summer of 1988.|$|E
40|$|Fieldwork in {{different}} parts of Severnaya Zemlya in 1985, 1991, 1992 and 1993 and aerial surveys in 1994 revealed a limited bird fauna with a total of 17 breeding species. The most numerous breeding birds are cliff-nesting seabirds, comprising little auk (Alle alle), 10 000 - 80 000 pairs; kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), 5000 - 10 000; black guillemot (Cepphus grylle), 1000 - 5000; ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea), 1000 - 2000; and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), 500 - 1000. They breed all over the archipelago, usually in rather small mixed- or single-species colonies. Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea) 100 - 500, and herring gull (Larus argentatus) 1 - 10, breed as solitary pairs or with a few pairs together. Of tundra birds, only brent goose (Branta bernicla), purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima) and snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) are found breeding on most of the major islands. The other tundra species-red-throated diver (Gavia stellata), king eider (Somateria spectabilis), sanderling (Calidris alba), Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus), long-tailed skua (Stercorarius longicaudus), snowy owl (Nyctea scandiaca) and <b>Lapland</b> <b>bunting</b> (Calcarius lapponicus) -breed in small numbers and in limited areas, often not every year. Of the even fewer mammal species, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) occurs occasionally, while Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus) are locally common in some years...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{studies of}} bird {{communities}} in Arctic regions are rare {{in comparison to}} studies performed in temperate regions, particularly studies that takes detectability into consideration. Finding a suitable and robust method for long-term monitoring of bird populations in the low Arctic which includes a correction of imperfect detection, can contribute to increased ecological understanding and easier identification of changes over time. During two field seasons (June-July) in 2015 and 2016, the bird population on Erkuta tundra monitoring site, Yamal, Russia, was surveyed using the three different methods: distance sampling on line transects, repeated point counts and double observer point counts. The comparison between the methods was done by estimating abundances and densities of the three most common species in the area, i. e. <b>Lapland</b> <b>bunting</b> (Calcarius lapponicus), Red-throated pipit (Anthus cervinus) and Wood sandpiper (Tringa glareola). I found that the most plausible density estimates of the common target species were provided by the line transect distance sampling. Although all assumptions were difficult to completely fulfil in the field, the method could be improved by more exact distance measurements in the field, since the degree of overestimation {{is limited to the}} extent of which the assumptions are violated. In addition, the line transect distance sampling method have the least impact of “floaters” (non-breeders), which also makes this method more robust. Repeated point counts heavily overestimated the densities, and the models fitted poorly for Red-throated pipit. The overestimation was likely due to violation of the assumption of closed population, and could be reduced by using a model allowing for temporary emigration. Also, too short distance between points, and thus a risk of double counting, could have contributed to the overestimation. However, the double observer point counts offer an alternative approach for long-term monitoring, where the slight overestimation also can be decreased with increased distance between points. In addition, the double observer method requires less effort than the other two methods...|$|E
