5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have <b>limited</b> <b>availability</b> in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E

5|$|In general, 20th-century historians from Palestine and the Arab world, and Palestinian and Arab nationalists, communists and leftists of all stripes, held a {{negative}} {{view of the}} Ottoman era, which they associated with backwardness, corruption and tyranny. According to historian Adel Manna, this uniformly negative perception of the Ottomans and the high regard for Muhammad Ali as a modernizer and a liberator of Arab lands from the Ottomans, which he sought to unite under his rule, influenced the later historiography of the 1834 revolt. Another factor that influenced the historians of the 20th century was the <b>limited</b> <b>availability</b> of primary sources from Palestine {{at the time of}} the revolt. Most primary Arabic accounts of the events were kept by Egypt's bureaucracy at the time. Other accounts were from European travelers or consuls in the area, while there were no known written 19th-century accounts by people living in Palestine's towns and villages.|$|E

The gliders landing on LZ-W contained the remaining men of the 2nd OBLI, and 'A' Company, 12th Devons landed at LZ-W. Given the <b>limited</b> <b>availability</b> of aircraft, the remainder of the Devons battalion and the divisional troops were transported by sea, arriving at Sword Beach on 7June.

However, they only lost one man, who was killed by a sniper.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March, the Greek Central Macedonia Army Section—comprising the 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions—were {{put under}} the command of General Wilson, who {{established}} his headquarters to the north-west of Larissa. The New Zealand division took position north of Mount Olympus, while the Australian division blocked the Haliacmon valley up to the Vermion range. The RAF continued to operate from airfields in Central and Southern Greece; however, few planes could be diverted to the theater. The British forces were near to fully motorised, but their equipment was more suited to desert warfare than to Greece's steep mountain roads. They were short of tanks and anti-aircraft guns and the lines of communication across the Mediterranean were vulnerable, because each convoy had to pass close to Axis-held islands in the Aegean; despite the British Royal Navy's domination of the Aegean Sea.

The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed to have a high probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles.

40|$|We {{are mainly}} {{interested}} in the <b>limiting</b> <b>availability</b> of a one-unit repairable system supported by one spare and maintained through repair of failed units or preventive maintenance of recalled units, under a perfect repair policy. ^ In Chapter 1, we investigate a one-unit system aided by an identical spare unit and serviced by a facility that performs perfect repair on a failed unit or preventive maintenance on a recalled unit. We extend the results in the existing literature to the most general distributional assumption by obtaining the system up time, the system down time and the <b>limiting</b> <b>availability.</b> ^ Chapter 2 {{is the study of}} a one-unit system supported by an identical spare unit. It is perfectly repaired by an in-house repair person, if doable within a random or deterministic patience time, or else by a visiting expert. We study four models in terms of <b>limiting</b> <b>availability</b> and <b>limiting</b> profit per unit time, using semi-Markov processes (SMP), when all distributions are exponential. We show that a deterministic patience time is preferable to a random patience time, and characterize conditions under which the expert should repair multiple failed units (rather than only one failed unit) during each visit. ^ In Chapter 3 we generalize the results of Chapter 2 to the case of arbitrary continuous life and repair time distributions. Our technique involves extending the limiting probability theorem of semi-Markov processes to that of extended semi-Markov processes. ^ In Chapter 4 we try to generalize the results of Chapter 2 by employing the traditional Laplace transformation technique. While we can derive a formal expression of the <b>limiting</b> <b>availability,</b> obtaining the profit per unit time seems intractable with this approach. We demonstrate that our approach in Chapter 3 is superior to the Laplace transformation approach. ^ In Chapter 5 we introduce the line digraph approach which methodically converts the continuous time stochastic process (CTSP) into an SMP (albeit on a different state space). Thereafter, standard limiting theorems for an SMP yield the steady state probabilities, which can be related back to those of the original CTSP. The line digraph approach is applicable to many other stochastic models. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{scheduling}} theory {{the basic}} model assumes that all machines are continuously available for processing throughout the planning horizon.

In this chapter we discuss results related to deterministic scheduling problems where machines are not continuously available for processing. Examples of such constraints can be found in many areas. <b>Limited</b> <b>availabilities</b> of machines may result from pre-schedules which exist mainly because most of the real world resources planning problems are dynamic. A natural approach to cope with a dynamic environment is to trigger a new planning horizon when the changes in the data justify it.

40|$|Traditionally, {{the optimal}} {{preventive}} maintenance interval for an unreliable production {{system has been}} determined by maximizing its <b>limiting</b> <b>availability.</b> Nowadays, it is widely recognized that this performance measure does not always provide relevant information for practical purposes. This is particularly true for order-driven manufacturing systems, in which due date performance has become a more important, and even a competitive factor. Under these circumstances, the so-called interval availability distribution is often seen as a more appropriate performance measure. Surprisingly enough, the relation between preventive maintenance and interval availability has received little attention in the existing literature. In this article, a series of mathematical models and optimization techniques is presented, with which the optimal preventive maintenance interval can be determined from an interval availability point of view, rather than from a <b>limiting</b> <b>availability</b> perspective. Computational results for a class of representative test problems indicate that significant improvements of up to 30 % in the guaranteed interval availability can be obtained, by increasing preventive maintenance frequencies somewhere between 10 and 70 %...|$|R
