Female rats which were able to conceive but unable to reproduce when fed a diet deficient in vitamin E were fed the various feeds as a source of vitamin E during a second breeding period.

Heuser, Norris and McGinnis (1946) showed that {{as little as}} fifteen percent of <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> in the diet caused poor growth in White Leghorn chicks. McGinnis and Polis (1946) tried several methods of treating <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> to improve its nutritive value for growing chicks. They found that a marked improvement resulted when the <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> was water-treated. This treatment consisted of wetting the <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> with approximately two times its weight of water and al-lowing the mixture to stand for 18 hours at 37 °C.

40|$|NUMEROUS {{workers have}} {{reported}} on the growth-depressing effect of <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> in chick rations. Bethke and co-workers (1928) reported poor growth in chicks on a linseed supplement, com-pared with cottonseed meal and meat scraps. Ackerson and co-workers (1938) compared cottonseed <b>meal</b> and <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> with other protein supplements in the chick ration. <b>Linseed</b> <b>meal</b> produced less growth than cottonseed meal, and both protein sources were inferior to dried buttermilk or soybean meal. Slinger and co-workers (1943) showed that as <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> replaced meat scraps in the diet growth became successively poorer, and with the total protein supplement in the diet as <b>linseed</b> <b>meal,</b> growth was approxi-mately 50 percent of that obtained with meat scraps as the supplement.

In the test both <b>meal</b> and pelleted <b>feed</b> were used. The conclusions are: I. <b>Meal</b> <b>feed</b> gave a significantly lower salmonella level than heat-treated, pelleted feed. 2. The number of salmonella positive pigs were lower when using coarse grinding, but the effect of grinding level was not significant (P= 0. 08). 3. Pelleted feed gave a significantly higher production economy compared to <b>meal</b> <b>feed</b> - mainly due to a better feed conversion. 4. The content of starch in manure was affected by both grinding level and the pelleting process.

40|$|In {{the first}} section of this thesis the {{literature}} relating to the uses of protected proteins fed to ruminants is reviewed. The second section describes an investigation into the effect of formaldehyde treatment of concentrate diets for lambs. The diets consisted essentially of wheat alone and wheat plus 10 % <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> or 10 % rapeseed meal, containing 11. 2, 13. 7 and 13. 8 % crude protein respectively. These were fed to 20 kg Corriedale lambs under feedlot conditions. The growth rates of the lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets in all cases, but the differences were not statistically significant. Feed intakes were highest with the diets containing <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> (P< 0. 0 5). The wool growth rates of lambs fed the treated diets were higher than those fed the untreated diets, but the difference was significant only {{in the case of the}} wheat diet (PC 0. 05). Increasing the level of the protein meals in the diets to 20; (about 15. 8 % CP) resulted in increased rates of weight gain with the untreated diets but decreased weight gains and feed intakes in the case of the treated diets. At the higher protein level the feed intakes and growth rates of lambs fed the untreated <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> diet were greater (P< 0. 05) than those of the lambs on the treated <b>linseed</b> <b>meal</b> diet. No other differences between treated and untreated diets were significant. Investigation into methods of applying formalin to hammermilled wheat showed that neither the dilution of the applied formalin nor the air temperature at the time of application had any marked effect on the amount of formaldehyde bound. The use of unsealed containers for storage of the wheat immediately after treatment caused a reduction in the amount of formaldehyde bound. Pelleting of treated wheat stored for two weeks in sealed plastic bags did not result in losses of bound formaldehyde, but considerable losses occurred when the pelleted material was subsequently stored in hessian bags for a further ten weeks.
