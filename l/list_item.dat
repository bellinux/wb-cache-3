25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a minimum equipment <b>list</b> <b>item)</b> because of technical {{problems with the}} thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E

Acknowledging the cathartic irony of being accepted for who he is by the man he once feared the most, he thanks Earl and says he can cross him off his list.|$|E

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that recall of an item from a free recall list interferes with subsequent retrieval of other <b>list</b> <b>items.</b> Experiments by Slamecka (Journal of Experimental Psychology 1968, 76, 504 - 513) showing that providing {{part of a}} free recall ist {{at the time of}} test impaired recall of the remaining <b>list</b> <b>items</b> illustrate this effect. Two experiments were performed examining the decrement in recall resulting from providing various numbers of <b>list</b> <b>items</b> to the subject at the time of test. Both studies found a negative r lationship between the number of items given and the recall probability of the remaining <b>list</b> <b>items.</b> A model combining a general organizational structure of memory with a retrieval process and a rule for terminating recall {{is proposed}} {{and the way in which}} this model accounts for the obtained ata is described. There is an almost universal reaction of sur-prise among subjects when they first attempt to free-recall a list of words. Although a subject may feel he has "memorized " most of the <b>list</b> <b>items</b> during study, he discovers that he can retrieve only a few items during recall. Wha...|$|R

40|$|In list-method {{directed}} forgetting (LMDF), {{people are}} cued to forget a previously studied <b>item</b> <b>list</b> (List 1) {{and to learn}} a new <b>list</b> of <b>items</b> (<b>List</b> 2) instead. Such cuing typically enhances memory for the <b>List</b> 2 <b>items,</b> in both recall and (sometimes) item-recognition testing. It has recently been hypothesized that the enhancement effect for <b>List</b> 2 <b>items</b> (partly) reflects the result of a reset-of-encoding process. The proposal is that encoding efficacy decreases with an increase in study material, but the forget cue can reset the encoding process to make the encoding of early <b>List</b> 2 <b>items</b> as effective as the encoding of early <b>List</b> 1 <b>items.</b> An experiment is reported that examined the reset-of-encoding hypothesis with item-recognition testing, examining influences of items’ serial learning position on the effects of the forget cue. Item-recognition tests were conducted separately for the two lists. Consistent with the reset-of-encoding hypothesis, the results showed strong enhancement effects for early <b>List</b> 2 <b>items,</b> but hardly any enhancement effects for middle and late <b>List</b> 2 <b>items.</b> Like in previous item-recognition studies, no cuing effects were found for <b>List</b> 1 <b>items.</b> The results support two-mechanism accounts of LMDF, which assume a critical role for a reset-of-encoding process for List 2 enhancement...|$|R
