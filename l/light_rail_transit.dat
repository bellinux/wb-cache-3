5|$|Near {{the end of}} 1982, Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications James W. Snow {{announced}} the launching of GO-ALRT (Advanced <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit),</b> an interregional <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> program providing $2.6 billion (1980 dollars) of infrastructure. Although this plan {{did not come to}} fruition, certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks of buses and trains interconnected the network.|$|E

5|$|The Mass Rapid Transit, or MRT, is a {{rapid transit}} system forming the major {{component}} of the railway system in Singapore, spanning the entire city-state. The earliest section of the MRT, between Toa Payoh and Yio Chu Kang, opened on 7 November 1987, making it the second-oldest metro system in Southeast Asia, after Philippine's Manila <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> System Line 1 that was established in 1984. The network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as {{the backbone of the}} public transport system in Singapore, with an average daily ridership of 3.031 million in 2015 (including the <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> (LRT)), approximately 78% of the bus network's 3.891 million in the same period.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Toronto City Council again {{proposed}} {{to extend the}} line northeastward {{as a replacement for}} the aging Scarborough RT. In 2006, this proposal was then altered when Scarborough councillors agreed to support plans to refurbish the existing line using other light-metro options for Scarborough. Using heavy-rail rapid transit {{like the rest of the}} Toronto subway in Scarborough was not yet examined. In 2007, mayor David Miller included the refurbishment of the Scarborough RT using modern <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> <b>transit</b> as part of his Transit City plan.|$|E

5|$|Before Imbudo struck, {{officials}} evacuated over 14,000people to {{at least}} 60shelters. Government offices were closed along the typhoon's path, and schools were closed in the capital, Manila. PAGASA issued a number 4 warning signal, the highest level, for three northern provinces, indicating the imminent threat of a powerful storm. Despite the warning, a post-storm survey in Isabela province indicated that 34% were unaware of the storm's arrival, while others believed the typhoon {{would not be as}} strong. In Manila, four flights were canceled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, and the Manila <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> System was shut down for two hours. Travel by ship and bus were halted in some areas. On July22 before the storm struck, the Philippine military was put on red alert, increasing security at the presidential palace. The military stated it was due to the typhoon, although newspapers suggested it was to prevent a coup attempt; a failed coup ultimately did occur on July27 in what would become known as the Oakwood mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Power outages {{affected}} Metro Manila, {{and several}} billboards were damaged in the city, {{although there was}} minimal flooding in the capital. Adverse conditions caused the Manila <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> System Line 1 to close for two hours, stranding hundreds. High winds knocked over a 12m (40ft) tree that killed five on Romblon Island. The rains brought the Magat Dam on Luzon to capacity. Landslides blocked a national highway in Nueva Ecija with debris and fallen trees, which were quickly cleared within a few days. On Mindanao, flash flooding from the outer periphery of the storm affected 18towns, killing 11people. In Maguindanao in the southern Philippines, flooding washed away 50houses, forcing over 2,000people to evacuate. Damage extended {{as far south as}} the Western Visayas. Across the Philippines, Imbudo damaged 62,314houses, of which about 20% were destroyed. Housing damage was estimated at P1.2billion (PHP, $22million USD), most of which in the Cagayan Valley. Overall damage in the country was estimated at about P4.7billion (PHP, $86million USD). Of the total, about P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD) was in agriculture damage. Imbudo killed 64people in the Philippines, mostly in Cagayan Valley, and injured another 154.|$|E
5|$|The MRT {{has been}} expanded. The first {{expansion}} was in 1996. This was a S$1.2 billion {{expansion of the}} North South Line into Woodlands, merging the Branch Line into the North South Line and joining Yishun and Choa Chu Kang Stations. The concept of having rail lines that bring people almost directly to their homes led {{to the introduction of}} the <b>Light</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Transit</b> (LRT) lines connecting with the MRT network. On 6 November 1999, the first LRT trains on the Bukit Panjang LRT went into operation. In 2002, the Changi Airport and Expo stations were added to the MRT network. The North East Line, the first line operated by SBS Transit, opened on 20 June 2003, one of the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world. On 15 January 2006, after intense two-and-a-half years lobbying by the public, Buangkok station was opened. The Boon Lay Extension of the East West Line, consisting of Pioneer and Joo Koon stations, began revenue service on 28 February 2009. The Circle Line opened in four stages from 28 May 2009 to 14 January 2012. Stage 1 of Downtown Line opened on 22 December 2013 with its official opening made on 21 December 2013 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. Stage 2 opened on 27 December 2015, and was officially opened on 26 December by Prime Minister Lee. Stage 3, the final stage of Downtown Line, opened on 21 October 2017 with its official opening made on 20 October 2017 by Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan.|$|E
