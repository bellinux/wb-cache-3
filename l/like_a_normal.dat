5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E

5|$|Sparrow's {{weapons are}} genuine 18th century pieces: his sword {{dates to the}} 1740s and his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London. Depp used two pistols on set, one of rubber. Both survived {{production}} of the first film. Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director Gore Verbinski had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> compass, a magnet was used to make it spin. Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989 and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year-old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props to which Depp gave backstories: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East. Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the Pelegosto prepare to eat him, and the sceptre was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.|$|E
25|$|Menthol reacts in {{many ways}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> {{secondary}} alcohol. It is oxidised to menthone by oxidising agents such as chromic acid or dichromate, though under some conditions the oxidation can go further and break open the ring. Menthol is easily dehydrated to give mainly 3-menthene, {{by the action of}} 2% sulfuric acid. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) gives menthyl chloride.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essey is through {{empirical}} methods investigate usability factors on Video On Demand applications for the Internet. More specificly we will focus on a application called Voddler. The purpose is to identify usability problems that exist in Voddler, and present the reader with suggestions on possible solutions. This {{could be used as}} guidelines to how to design for usability in this kind of system. We will use an online survey to investigate Voddler usability and use this data as a basis for our analysis. We will also conduct a expert evaluation of the system. The data collected from the survey will be compared to the expert evalutation and different theories behind usability. We will {{come to the conclusion that}} through a usability perspective Voddler has designed the software as an interactive Video On Demand service meanwhile the target audience want the application to function more <b>like</b> <b>an</b> <b>normal</b> computer program. This causes a conflict between the two that has to be resolved if one wants to optimize usability this kind of software...|$|R

The programme and purpose of these additional units vary to meet specific requirements. For example, a climbing activity unit can be created which provides climbing activity leaders and arranges for visits to indoor and outdoor climbing venues. Another specialised unit is the Young Leaders Unit. The implementation of the Young Leaders Unit varies from district to district, with some acting <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> unit which also provides the Young Leader training, while others meet less frequently.|$|E
25|$|A Simpsons fan, Rob Baur of Lake Oswego, Oregon, was {{inspired}} by the episode. Remembering the article in a textbook, Baur cultivated real tomacco in 2003. The plant produced offspring that looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> tomato, but Baur suspected that it contained a lethal amount of nicotine and thus would be inedible. Testing later proved that the leaves of the plant contained some nicotine. Both plants are members of the same family, Solanaceae or nightshade. The tomacco plant bore tomaccoes until it died after 18 months, spending one winter indoors. Baur appeared on the episode's DVD commentary, discussing the plant and resulting fame.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's success, the entire show was {{overhauled}} in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute Scooby and Scrappy cartoons, who in previous Scooby series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now real {{within the context of}} the series.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} this is to use two {{capacitors}} in series for the output smoothing on a bridge rectifier then place a switch between the midpoint of those capacitors and one of the AC input terminals. With the switch open, this circuit acts <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> bridge rectifier. With the switch closed, it act like a voltage doubling rectifier. In other words, this makes it easy to derive a voltage of roughly 320V (Â±15%, approx.) DC from any 120V or 230V mains supply in the world, this can then be fed into a relatively simple switched-mode power supply. However, for a given desired ripple, the value of both capacitors must be twice the value of the single one required for a normal bridge rectifier; when the switch is closed each one must filter the output of a half-wave rectifier, and when the switch is open the two capacitors are connected in series with an equivalent value of half one of them.|$|E

25|$|The flipper is bowled on the {{opposite}} side to a slider, much {{in the same way that}} the top-spinner is bowled. On release, the bowler 'pinches' or clicks the thumb and forefinger, causing the ball to come out underneath the hand. There must be sufficient tension in the wrist and fingers to impart a good helping of backspin or underspin. In doing so the flipper will float on towards the batsman and land on a fuller length than he anticipated, often leaving him caught on the back foot when he wrongly assumes it to be a pullable or a cuttable ball. The back spin or underspin will cause the ball to hurry on at great pace with very little bounce, though this may be harder to achieve on softer wickets. A series of normal leg spinners or topspinners, with their dropping looping flight, will have the batsman used to the ball pitching on a shorter length. The batsman may wrongly assume that the flipper will drop and loop <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> overspinning delivery, resulting in the ball pitching under the bat and going on to either hit the stumps or result in leg before wicket.|$|E

[...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly speculated that mainstream success eluded the show because of its mixing of genres. He said, [...] "Brisco refuses to behave <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>normal</b> Western, mixing in sci-fi, slapstick, and... kung fu."
