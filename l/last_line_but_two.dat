60|$|Athelstane {{burst into}} a loud laugh, when he heard it, at the <b>last</b> <b>line,</b> <b>but</b> Rowena {{would have had the}} fool whipped, had not the Thane interceded; and to him, she said, she could refuse nothing.|$|R

5000|$|A ticking {{sound is}} {{heard from the}} package that Harbottle earlier picked up and they find pocket watches inside. Harbottle then recites a rhyme which tells {{the legend of the}} Headless Horseman, {{although}} he doesn't know the <b>last</b> <b>line,</b> <b>but</b> his father does. So the trio decide to pay him a visit. Harbottle's father reveals the line thus also revealing the place, the Devil's Cave where the smuggling is taking place.|$|R
50|$|The Credo {{is divided}} into {{sections}} that generally reflect the text, but with Haydn's usual overriding sense of structure. At the opening, as each voice part enters with a joyous and rhythmic theme, it takes a different line of the text. The Crucifixus is set in triple meter. A truncated fugue begins at the <b>last</b> <b>line,</b> <b>but</b> it is interrupted midway by an elaborate coda using the solo quartet, with the chorus joining in antiphonally.|$|R

50|$|Wonthaggi was {{a railway}} station {{located in the}} town of Wonthaggi, Victoria, Australia.

50|$|One minute {{into the}} game, Atlanta {{receiver}} Harry Douglas gave his team a scoring opportunity by returning a punt 21 {{yards to the}} Cardinals 48-yard <b>line.</b> <b>But</b> <b>two</b> plays later, rookie quarterback Matt Ryans pass was intercepted by Ralph Brown. The Cardinals offense started off their ensuing drive with three runs for 21 yards by Edgerrin James, and then took the lead over the Falcons with a 42-yard touchdown pass from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald on a flea flicker play.|$|R
50|$|New Orleans {{tied the}} game on their first drive of the second quarter with Brees 9-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Devery Henderson. Later on, the Vikings got a scoring opportunity when New Orleans running back Reggie Bush muffed a punt that Minnesotas Kenny Onatolu recovered on the Saints 10-yard <b>line.</b> <b>But</b> <b>two</b> plays after that, the Vikings lost the ball themselves on a fumbled handoff from Favre to Peterson that was recovered by linebacker Scott Fujita {{with less than a}} minute left in the half.|$|R

New York was forced to punt on their ensuing drive, and Rico Murray gave the Bengals good field position with a 23-yard return to the New York 45.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} is a monocoque pod and {{boom structure}} also built with composite sandwich layers, but with carbon fibre added. Its T-tail is constructed from GRP; the tailplane carries an elevator. There is {{no provision for}} water ballast. The two tandem seats have a common upper <b>line</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> single piece canopies, the forward one forward hinged and the rear opening to starboard. The undercarriage is fixed, with a main monowheel, fitted with an hydraulic brake, placed at the pod-boom transition within a prominent fairing and assisted by a smaller nosewheel.|$|R

25|$|Originally, a full-back was the <b>last</b> <b>line</b> of defence, <b>but</b> as {{the game}} {{developed}} in the early 20th century, the centre-half role was dropped backwards and {{came to be known}} as 'centre-back', and the full-backs were then pushed out wider to create the right-back and left-back positions.|$|R
25|$|On the Panthers third {{play of the}} game, Delhomme {{completed}} a 70-yard pass to Smith on the Cowboys 1-yard line, setting up Kasay's first field goal.

On the Cowboys ensuing drive, Carter {{completed a}} 28-yard pass to Joey Galloway and Troy Hambrick ran for 16 yards, giving Dallas a first down at the Panthers 20-yard <b>line.</b> <b>But</b> <b>two</b> plays later, fullback Richie Anderson fumbled the ball and Carolina safety Mike Minter recovered it.|$|R
50|$|The Giants {{had several}} {{opportunities}} to take command {{in the second}} half, but red zone difficulties, similar to those experienced against the Cowboys in week 13, hurt their chances. Eli Manning hit Plaxico Burress in stride for a big gain to get inside the 10, but were forced {{to settle for a}} field goal. After forcing a fumble on the ensuing Eagles possession, the Giants had the ball first and goal from the seven-yard <b>line,</b> <b>but</b> <b>two</b> runs and a pass yielded zero yards and Feely kicked another short field goal, putting the Giants ahead 16-14.|$|R

25|$|Meggett {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 21 {{yards to the}} Patriots 25-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bledsoe completed a 19-yard pass to Coates to advance to their own 44-yard <b>line.</b> <b>But</b> <b>two</b> plays later, Packers defensive back Mike Prior intercepted a long pass that was intended for wide receiver Shawn Jefferson, and returned it 8 yards to the Packers 26-yard line. After the turnover, Favre completed a 22-yard pass to Freeman, and Levens rushed four times for 31 yards on a 9-play, 74-yard drive that took 5:59 minutes off the clock and ended with Favre's 2-yard touchdown run to give Green Bay a 27–14 lead with just 1:11 left in the half.|$|R

50|$|The East Hills railway line, which {{originally}} terminated {{one stop}} away at East Hills divided the suburb into two distinct precincts.

6000|$|Until Mr. Masters came on {{the scene}} there was just one thing which, like a salient {{fortress}} {{in the midst of an}} enemy's advancing army, acted as a barrier to the youth of the country.
