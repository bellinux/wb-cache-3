5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired <b>Lawyer</b> <b>is</b> accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E

40|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{perceptions about}} the use of technology by <b>lawyers.</b> One view <b>is</b> that <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> traditional individuals who are slow to adopt cutting edge technology. The opposing view <b>is</b> that <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> technology leaders. I subscribe to the latter view. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>were</b> the first to fully utilize full-text databases. <b>Lawyers</b> <b>were</b> searching Lexis-Nexis during the late 702 ̆ 7 s and early 802 ̆ 7 s. Lawyers quickly adopted fax machines, e-mail and Internet services {{as soon as they were}} available. Consequently, I think <b>lawyers</b> <b>are</b> technology leaders. In order to remain technology leaders, we must be informed about the latest technology developments. The purpose of this segment of the CLE program is to gaze into the crystal ball and to offer some predictions for the future of technology. In a few simple words, the future of technology will be faster, smaller, more integrated and wireless. Will these predictions be accurate? Only time will tell...|$|R

Usually a private <b>lawyer</b> <b>is</b> appointed, one for each defendant, and conflict of interest between contradicting suspects is avoided, e.g. the same lawyer may not represent two accused whose evidence is mutually contradictory. If convicted, the defendant is in principle liable for the fee, but is rarely pursued.|$|E

She also stated that she had been detained in Russia since 24 June, not 30 June as the Russian investigation reported. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court extended Savchenko's detention for a further two months and ordered that she be sent for a month to the Serbsky Institute for a forensic psychological evaluation, which Savchenko opposed.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Government {{and every}} {{province}} and territory in Canada has enacted human rights acts that prohibit discrimination and harassment on several grounds (e.g. race, sex, gender identity or expression, marital status, religion, disability, age and sexual orientation) {{in private and}} public sector employment, housing, public services and publicity. Some acts also apply to additional activities. These acts are quasi-constitutional laws that override ordinary laws as well as regulations, contracts and collective agreements. 2 S.C.R. 150 (S.C.C.)]. Accessed November 10, 2013. They are typically enforced by human rights commissions and tribunals through a complaint investigation, conciliation and arbitration process that is slow, but free, and includes protection against retaliation.

25|$|Jake, Riggan's {{best friend}} and <b>lawyer,</b> <b>is</b> {{producing}} the play which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict whom {{he is trying to}} reconnect with, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hopeless co-star Ralph, which Riggan tells Jake he caused. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to have real sex with Lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun does not look real which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike and is incensed at influential theater critic Tabitha Dickinson's praise for Mike's performance, but Jake persuades him to continue with the play. Riggan catches Sam using marijuana and berates her; she tells him he is expendable and that his play is a vanity project.|$|E

25|$|Complaints {{about the}} conduct of advocates and solicitors may be {{referred}} by the Council of the Law Society of Singapore to an inquiry panel appointed by the Chief Justice. The inquiry panel investigates the complaint and reports on the matter to the Council. The Council, on considering the report, may decide that no formal investigation is necessary, impose a penalty on the lawyer concerned, or apply to the Chief Justice for a disciplinary tribunal to be appointed to formally investigate the complaint. If a disciplinary tribunal is convened, it hears and investigates the matter and decides whether any disciplinary action against the <b>lawyer</b> <b>is</b> warranted. If not, it may dismiss the matter or impose a penalty appropriate to the misconduct. However, if it determines that disciplinary action is necessary, the Law Society must apply to the Supreme Court for the matter to be heard by a court of three judges, which has power to order that a lawyer be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors, suspended from practice for not more than five years, fined up to $100,000, or censured.|$|E

My <b>lawyer</b> <b>is</b> following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E

Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the <b>lawyer</b> <b>is</b> present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outburst of rage when the notary leaves is countered by a love duet from Lauretta and Rinuccio, [...] "Lauretta mia"; there is now no bar to their marriage, since Schicchi can provide a full dowry. Schicchi chases the relatives out of what is now his house, and when he returns stands moved at the sight of the two lovers. He turns to the audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth.

Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would do that on a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's Glorious Revolution, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills.

500|$|A Dream Play is {{positioned}} at the median of Strindberg's series of portrayals {{of his own}} marriage, the Bosse role imbued with both light and darkness. With its associative dream structure, this play is a milestone of modernist drama, described by Strindberg as a lawless reflection of The Dreamer's (Strindberg's) consciousness, limited only by his imagination which [...] "spins and weaves new patterns… on an insignificant basis of reality". Agnes, played by and representing Bosse, {{is the daughter of}} the Vedic god Indra, descending to earth to observe human life and bring its disappointments to the attention of her divine father. [...] The [...] "Oriental" [...] aspect of the play is based on Bosse's dark, exotic looks. [...] Yet she is also drawn into mere humanity and into a claustrophobic marriage to The Lawyer, one of the versions of The Dreamer and, thereby, of Strindberg. [...] Shut up indoors by a possessive husband, Agnes can not breathe; she despondently watches the servant working to exclude light and air from the house by pasting insulating strips of paper along the windows' edges. Recognizably, the [...] "insignificant basis of reality" [...] of Agnes' marriage to The <b>Lawyer</b> <b>is</b> the frustration of the newly married Bosse, yearning for fresh air, sunshine, and travel but fobbed off with a Baedeker.|$|E
