5|$|Much of {{the early}} work {{leading up to the}} {{discovery}} of the ubiquitin proteasome system occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the Technion in the <b>laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Avram Hershko, where Aaron Ciechanover worked as a graduate student. Hershko's year-long sabbatical in the <b>laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Irwin Rose at the Fox Chase Cancer Center provided key conceptual insights, though Rose later downplayed his role in the discovery.

5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Michigan and University of California, Berkeley, Spedding became an assistant professor {{and head of the}} department of physical chemistry at Iowa State College in 1937. His efforts at building up the school were so successful that he would {{spend the rest of his}} career there, becoming a professor of chemistry in 1941, a professor of physics in 1950, a professor of metallurgy in 1962, and ultimately professor emeritus in 1973. He co-founded, along with Dr. Harley Wilhelm, the Institute for Atomic Research and the Ames <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> the Atomic Energy Commission, and directed the Ames Laboratory from its founding in 1947 until 1968.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked {{the discovery}} team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium (symbol Fl), after the Russian Flerov <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Nuclear Reactions (FLNR), named after the Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov (also spelled Flerov); earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flyorov. In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Nuclear Reactions (an older name for the JINR), not after Flyorov himself. Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and pointing out the silence in scientific journals {{in the field of}} nuclear fission in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries. Flyorov's work and urgings {{led to the development of}} the USSR's own atomic bomb project.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Bacher became {{director}} of the <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Nuclear Studies at Cornell. He also served on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency that replaced the wartime Manhattan Project, and in 1947 {{he became one of}} its inaugural commissioners. He left in 1949 to become head Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy at Caltech. He was appointed a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) in 1958. In 1962, he became Caltech's vice president and provost. He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He died in 2004 at the age of 99.|$|E
5|$|Although most of {{his career}} was at Princeton, he spent some time in England, where was a Churchill Fellow at Cambridge University in 1973 and 1974. He was later a visiting Senior Research Fellow at the <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Molecular Biology at Oxford University, and a visiting {{professor}} at Oxford Research Unit of the Open University, from 1981 to 1982, and a Royal Society Guest Research Fellow at Oxford University in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov <b>Laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E

5|$|In the beginning, {{the major}} part of his work {{revolved}} around valvular and congenital diseases; later on he became interested in other areas. Every day, having hardly finished working in the operating room, Favaloro would spend hours and hours reviewing coronary angiograms and studying coronary arteries and their relation with the cardiac muscle. The <b>laboratory</b> <b>of</b> Sones, father of the coronary angiography, had the largest collection of angiograms in the United States.|$|E
