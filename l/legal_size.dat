Results of mark-and-recapture surveys have indicated that some movement occurs across the boundaries of these zones, suggesting {{that they are not}} entirely discrete and that some immigration and emigration does occur. Sigurjónsson estimated in 1995 that total pre-exploitation population size in the entireNorth Atlantic ranged between 50,000 and 100,000 animals, but his research is criticized for lack of supporting data and an explanation of his reasoning.

Two aerial surveys in Canadian waters since the early 1970s gave numbers of 79 to 926 whales on the eastern Newfoundland-Labrador shelf in August 1980, and a few hundred in the northern and central Gulf of Saint Lawrence in August 1995– 1996. Summer estimates in the waters off western Greenland range between 500 and 2,000, and in 1974, Jonsgard considered the fin whales off Western Norway and the Faroe Islands to [...] "have been considerably depleted in postwar years, probably by overexploitation". The population around Iceland appears to have fared much better, and in 1981, appeared to have undergone only a minor decline since the early 1960s. Surveys during the summers of 1987 and 1989 estimated of 10,000 to 11,000 between eastern Greenland and Norway.

40|$|Australian {{recreational}} and commercial fishers catch snapper (Pagrus auratus) from down to ∼ 120 m, often evoking barotrauma. Owing to minimum <b>legal</b> <b>sizes</b> and quotas or non-consumptive fishing practices, some afflicted fish are released, raising {{concerns over the}} potential for unaccounted fishing mortality. Two experiments were completed to quantify the (1) clinical signs of barotrauma among fish angled from 6 to 120 m (experiment 1) and (2) mortality (over 3 d) of fish with barotrauma that were released following either no treatment, venting (e. g. needle) or recompression (e. g. release weight) (experiment 2). In experiment 1, barotrauma was evident in some fish angled from 11 m and all from 3 ̆e 20 m. Fish were considered to have barotrauma {{if they had a}} prolapsed cloaca combined with a distended coelomic cavity and/or gastric herniation into the buccal cavity. Despite similar clinical signs among fish in experiment 2, none died, however, the associated trauma raises welfare concerns. Both recompression and venting offered benefits over no treatment by returning fish to depth quickly and releasing gases, respectively. Nevertheless, the release method should be dictated by the clinical signs of barotrauma and extrinsic conditions, including the competency of the fisher (e. g. for venting), presence of predators (e. g. for recompression), and exposure to sun or warm water (e. g. no treatment). More selective gears, spatial and temporal closures, or possibly replacing minimum <b>legal</b> <b>sizes</b> with quotas in deep water only could also reduce the frequency of barotrauma among released P. auratus and therefore, negative impacts on stocks...|$|R
40|$|Retaining {{coral reef}} fish for {{subsistence}} during commercial fishing {{is a common}} practice for indigenous fishers in the Torres Strait, Australia, despite being inconsistent with legislation. Fisher access point surveys were completed between 2004 and 2006 on three islands in Torres Strait to characterise this subsistence practice and assess the level to which it undermines current minimum <b>legal</b> fish <b>sizes.</b> Approximately 15 % of the annual total catch was retained for subsistence during commercial fishing. Notably, subsistence catch of the most commercially valuable species almost entirely comprised individuals smaller than the minimum <b>legal</b> <b>sizes.</b> The higher proportions of undersized individuals of valuable species retained during commercial fishing {{on some of the}} islands were most likely associated with an increase in professionalism of the fishers. These results demonstrate how the intended outcomes from a management strategy can be undermined when the specific operational conditions of the fishery are not considered. Successful implementation of management arrangements in indigenous communities ultimately depends on the sociocultural conditions of the communities and their understanding and adherence to the rules. A productive way forward for the management of this fishery is greater engagement of indigenous communities and managers in co-management arrangements...|$|R

Many dacha owners grew crops for market. Since then, growing garden crops has been of lesser importance, but continues to be widespread. Many Russian dacha owners still see gardening as a key value of dachnik culture.

Our approach differs from most previous work in that we make an additional restriction that we wish to enhance the resolution of documents which consist primarily of regions that are spatially piecewise constant (e. g. monochrome text on a monochrome background). We show that this enables us to achieve resolution enhancement that is superior to previously reported schemes.

40|$|Trawling is an {{important}} fishing method used by the inshore fishermen of Nha Trang city, Khanh Hoa province, Vietnam. The inshore trawl fishery in Nha Trang city {{is known to have}} very low selectivity, which may not be a responsible fishing practice. The trawl nets of the fishery retain large numbers of juvenile individuals, which has negative effects on the marine resources. The goal of this thesis is to provide initial suggestions to improve the selectivity of the inshore trawl fishery of Nha Trang city {{in order to reduce the}} catch of trash fish and juveniles of economically important species. 			To fulfil this goal, I performed the following steps: (1) studied the current status of juvenile and trash fish caught by the fishery in order to gather information on the composition and sizes of untargeted species; (2) studied the selectivity of conventional codends with different diamond mesh sizes and with a square mesh panel; (3) aimed to determine the willingness of fishermen to use a bycatch reduction device (BRD) to reduce the catch of juvenile individuals. 			The status of juvenile specimens caught by the fishery was determined by: (1) direct access to trash fish samples from the trawlers of the fishery; and (2) catch notes made by the wives of fishermen who were responsible for selling the catch at landing points. The selectivity of the codends tested was studied during sea trials on chartered trawlers from the fishery where the cover codend method was used. I also interviewed the captains of the trawlers to collect information about their willingness to test future versions of a BRD. 			We found that trash fish accounted for reasonable part of the catch by trawlers from the fishery and played {{an important}} role in the incomes of fishermen, especially fishermen from small trawler fleets (i. e., trawlers with an engine power of less than 33 Hp). The trash fish comprised several economically important species (i. e., Cephalopoda spp., Portunidae spp., Penaeidae spp., Trichiurus lepturus, Saurida tumbil, and Epinephelus spp.). Most of the economically important species in the trash fish category measured less than 13 cm in total length (TL), except for Trichiurus lepturus where TL could reach 15 cm. This project also showed that the current mesh size of the diamond mesh at the codend had very poor selectivity performance. An increase in the mesh sizes used by the fishery to the <b>legal</b> mesh <b>size</b> would help to increase the selectivity for lizardfish, shrimp, squid, and threadfin bream. In addition, increasing the current codend mesh size to match the <b>legal</b> mesh <b>size</b> would help to reduce the catch of trash fish significantly. However, the <b>legal</b> mesh <b>size</b> is not sufficient to totally protect juveniles caught by the gears. With the current situation, the <b>legal</b> mesh <b>size</b> would be accepted to compromise between the protection of juveniles and the economic loss of fishermen. In the future, mesh sizes which is larger than current <b>legal</b> mesh <b>sizes</b> are suggested. The square mesh panel also helped to reduce the catch of trash fish and increased the selectivity for squid and lizardfish. Fishermen from the small trawler fleet refused to use the BRD to release the juvenile individuals. Fishermen from the larger trawler fleets may use the BRD provided there is no reduction in their catch of small squid. Information learnt from interviews with fishermen showed that the fish stocks exploited by the studied trawl fishery are declining sharply and it is necessary to deliver suitable measures to protect the fish stocks. Improving selectivity of the trawls used in the fishery is one of the measures...|$|R
