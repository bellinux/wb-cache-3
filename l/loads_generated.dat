50|$|Because {{the flange}} rides on a {{continuous}} surface in a fully flange-bearing mode, the impact <b>loads</b> <b>generated</b> by the flangeway gap of conventional frogs are eliminated. This reduces maintenance and extends {{the life of}} the frog, which leads to an operational cost savings that exceeds the increase in initial costs, when compared to conventional frogs. As previously mentioned, flange-bearing frogs are quieter than conventional frogs—again, because of the reduced impact loads—which provides a potential benefit when implemented near residential areas.|$|E

In such system, the user interaction and processing are separated by a network. User input such as keystrokes and mouse clicks are sent to the server over the network and graphical updates are transported the reverse way. The cache proposed {{in this article is}} static, meaning that it is composed before the thin client computing session starts and that the cache does not change during the session. Through experiments with an implementation of the cache, we show that graphical update caching effectively reduces the network <b>load</b> <b>generated</b> by thin client computing...|$|R

The number of feasible joint assignments (i.e., {{the number of the}} joint events) is combinatorial in the number of the measurements and the number of the tracks. In multiple detection multi-target tracking, most of the computational <b>load</b> is <b>generated</b> by these joint assignments. The computational <b>load</b> <b>generated</b> by this part is identical in MD-JITS and MD-JIPDA, because the same joint assignment process is used in these two algorithms.|$|R
50|$|Bracing wires {{primarily}} {{divide into}} flying wires which hold the wings down when flying and landing wires which hold the wings {{up when they}} are not generating lift. (The wires connecting a basket or gondola to a balloon are also called flying wires.) Thinner incidence wires are sometimes run diagonally between fore and aft interplane struts to stop the wing twisting and changing its angle of incidence to the fuselage. In some pioneer aircraft, wing bracing wires were also run diagonally fore and aft to prevent distortion under side loads such as when turning. Besides the basic loads imposed by lift and gravity, bracing wires must also carry powerful inertial <b>loads</b> <b>generated</b> during manoeuvres, such as the increased load on the landing wires at the moment of touchdown.|$|E

The consortium of IBM, Siemens the hardware and software developer EURISCO, Denmark's largest energy company DONG Energy, the regional energy company Østkraft, the Technical University of Denmark and the Danish Energy Association, explored how to balance the unpredictable electricity <b>loads</b> <b>generated</b> by Denmark's many wind farms, currently generating ~20% of the country's total electricity production, by using electric vehicles (EV) and their accumulators. The aim of the project is to develop infrastructure that enables EVs to intelligently communicate with the grid to determine when charging, and ultimately discharging, can take place.At least one rebuild V2G capable Toyota Scion will be used in the project.The project is key in Denmark's ambitions to expand its wind-power generation to 50% by 2020.According to a source of British newspaper The Guardian 'It's never been tried at this scale' previously. The project concluded in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{provisions for}} seismic resistance were {{the requirement to}} design for a lateral force equal to a proportion of the building weight (applied at each floor level). This approach was adopted in the appendix of the 1927 Uniform Building Code (UBC), which was used {{on the west coast}} of the United States. It later became clear that the dynamic properties of the structure affected the <b>loads</b> <b>generated</b> during an earthquake. In the Los Angeles County Building Code of 1943 a provision to vary the load {{based on the number of}} floor levels was adopted (based on research carried out at Caltech in collaboration with Stanford University and the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, which started in 1937). The concept of [...] "response spectra" [...] was developed in the 1930s, but it wasn't until 1952 that a joint committee of the San Francisco Section of the ASCE and the Structural Engineers Association of Northern California (SEAONC) proposed using the building period (the inverse of the frequency) to determine lateral forces.|$|E

The model uses a mass-balance approach and predicts the total <b>loads</b> <b>generated</b> and the total loads exported from each sub-catchment for the pathogens Cryptosporidium and Giardia and the faecal indicator E. coli. Briefly, the PCB model consists of 5 components: a hydrologic module, a land budget module, an on-site systems module, a sewage treatment plant (STP) module and an in-stream transport module. PCB is an event-based model, representing the likely fluxes from sub-catchments in dry, wet and flood conditions. The model was developed in th...|$|E

Water absorbed by the z-pinned joint weakened the mode I bridging traction <b>load</b> <b>generated</b> by the z-pins. However, the structural properties of the z-pinned joint were not affected by the hot-wet environment because they are strongly influenced by the friction-induced traction <b>load</b> <b>generated</b> during z-pin pull-out, which was not affected by absorbed water.
