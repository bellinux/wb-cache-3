5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with <b>long,</b> <b>red</b> hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives. Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the <b>long</b> <b>red</b> trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E

5|$|The {{instruments}} of the Passion were sometimes split between a shield and crest {{in the form}} of an achievement of arms (Neubecker, 222). The Hyghalmen Roll (c. 1447–1455) shows Christ holding an azure shield charged with Veronica's Veil proper. The heraldry continues with the 15th century jousting helmet, which is covered by the seamless robe as a form of mantling, and the Cross, scepter (of mockery) and flagellum (whip) as crest. The banner's <b>long</b> <b>red</b> schwenkel is a mark of eminence in German heraldry, but it was omitted when this image was copied into Randle Holme's Book (c. 1464–1480). The image on the opposing page (shown above) includes a shield quartered with the five Wounds of Christ, three jars of ointment, two rods, and the head of Judas Iscariot with a bag of money (Dennys, 97–98).|$|E

Blue light generally causes chloroplasts to seek shelter, while red light draws them out to maximize light absorption.|$|E

The three highest-rolling players bank their roll value into their Personal Bank; the lowest-rolling player is eliminated. If two players are tied, they roll again concurrently and the closest to the edge without going over goes through. These rolls score no money.|$|R
25|$|The {{youngest}} in the group, Lester has {{the ability}} to shape-shift, and appears initially in the series as a teen with <b>long</b> <b>red</b> hair tied in a single braid. He has a rather sadistic personality. He is particularly skillful at creating illusions. It is later revealed he is the incarnation of Aporia's preteen years, and his despair of becoming an orphan. Lester's ace monster is Meklord Emperor Skiel. He transfers into Duel Academy in order to get close to Luna, and ends up dueling both her and Leo. After the duel, Lester wipes the memories of the Duel Academy students so they behave like he doesn't exist. He is also the first character in the series to use a Duel Board.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{yet another}} {{change of design}} that was {{controversial}} with the fans, a kit that featured a white drop—down V with a black and red mesh design {{at the bottom of}} the jersey. This was Mizuno's first design, taking over from Stag. The traditional red V was once more reverted to, after the controversial design, with a more circular design used for the 1999 season. In 2000, a more regular V was seen again. In 2003, a triple—V design was seen, and the first to be used by long—serving kit designers Puma AG. 2004 saw a double curvy red V used, before, in 2005, yet again tradition was reverted to in the design and this design was used until 2009. The away strip used in 2005 was the famous blue strip with a dark blue V. 2009 saw the <b>long</b> <b>red</b> V of 1985's design appear again, before, in 2010, a casual thin red V was seen.|$|E
25|$|Noelle is a brown-haired {{young woman}} who {{initially}} serves as 'leader' of the girls in Billings House. Fiercely loyal to her friends, she is the implied counterpart to Reed, being similarly skilled in lacrosse and soccer, and apparently coming from a shaken family of her own. However, her privileged upbringing tends to make her blunt and sometimes insensitive, as she enjoys intimidating other {{students as well as}} the Easton staff. She is shown to be overly self-confident to the point of arrogance, but very intelligent. According to some of her peers, she cannot live without drama in her life. Noelle possesses a <b>long,</b> <b>red</b> scar along her stomach, just above her hipbone from a childhood horseback riding accident. She has an unstable longtime romantic relationship with another senior named Dash McCafferty. As the series progresses, Noelle becomes Reed's best friend and ally.

25|$|Minsc is a {{supporting}} {{character in the}} 2000 novelization of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn by Philip Athans. He is depicted as a well-built man with <b>long</b> <b>red</b> hair, a patchy orange beard, and a jagged scar along {{the right side of}} his head. He is no longer a warrior, and is physically smaller than the novel's protagonist, Abdel. In contrast, Boo is unchanged, and is still referred to by Minsc as his miniature giant space hamster. Held prisoner alongside Abdel at the start of the novel, Minsc is set free and accompanies Abdel until they reach an inn, where he decides to work. Abdel repeatedly shows discomfort for his presence, using Minsc's employment as an excuse to leave him behind and steal his sword, though he later returns for his help in securing travel aboard a ship. After Abdel returns to kill his employers, Minsc realizes the inn will close permanently; he and Boo leave to find another place to work.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{different}} vein, much later, in the 1980s, a talented generation of players revived the club's spirit. They carried {{it back to the}} top of French rugby thanks to their performances on the pitch, but they also wanted to bring the fun back into the game, to take rugby out of its Parisian anonymity. They did so through a combination of serious football, humour and self-mockery. Their famous antics were invented by the club's backs (including France flyhalf Franck Mesnel and France wing Jean-Baptiste Lafond) who once played a game in Bayonne with berets on their heads as a tribute to the tradition of attacking play of the Basque club Aviron Bayonnais (11 Jan 1987). As members of a gang which they called le show bizz, they played other matches with black make-up on (10 April 1988 at Stade Toulousain), hair dyed yellow, bald caps (26 Feb 1989 against Béziers), wigs and even dressed up as pelote players (white shirts, black jackets and berets, again) in March 1990 at Biarritz Olympique. In April 1989, they wore <b>long</b> <b>red</b> and white striped shorts to celebrate the sans-culotte who took the Bastille on 14 July 1789. They wore long white trousers to look like players of old in the French championship semi-final on 26 April 1987—and won. Their best prank was in the next game though: they played the 1987 final against Toulon with a pink bow tie (2 May). Just before kick-off, Lafond presented French president François Mitterrand, who always attended the national final, with one of those bow ties. They lost that match but went on to play the 1990 final with the same bow ties. At half-time, they had a drink of champagne on the pitch to recover from the efforts of the first half—and won what proved to be the club's last top-flight title for a quarter-century.|$|E
