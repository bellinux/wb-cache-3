There were no C rations in Korea and only a small reserve in Japan at the outbreak of the war. The Quartermaster General of the United States Army immediately began moving all available C rations and 5-in-1 B rations from the United States to the Far East. Field rations at first were largely the less nutritious and palatable World War II K rations. The UN had to rely on much of the US stock of World War II-era material for much of this phase of the war. Provisioning of the ROK troops was an equally important and difficult problem. The regular issue ration to ROK troops was rice or barley and fish. It consisted of about [...] of rice or barley, one half pound of biscuit, and one half pound of canned fish with spices. Often the cooked rice, made into balls and wrapped in cabbage leaves, was sour when it reached the combat troops on the line, and frequently it did not arrive at all. Occasionally, <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> of foods on a basis of 200 Won ($0.05 USD) per day per man supplemented the issued ration. An improved ROK ration consisting of three menus, one for each daily meal, was ready in September 1950. It provided 3,210 calories, weighed , and consisted of rice starch, biscuits, rice cake, peas, kelp, fish, chewing gum, and condiments, and was packed in a waterproofed bag. With slight changes, this ration was found acceptable to the ROK troops and quickly put into production. It became the standard ration for them during the first year of the war.|$|E

50|$|The {{first public}} meeting for {{planning}} a railway in the Grenland region {{was conducted on}} 19 January 1874. At a second meeting on 28 January a planning committee was appointed, with representatives from the various municipalities in the area. It proposed three alternative routes for a railway: {{a continuation of the}} proposed Vestfold Line from Larvik, a railway down the valley of Lågendalen from Kongsberg, or a link from the Kongsberg-Drammen Line via Siljan to Skien. The Vestfold alternative was the cheapest and was thus preferred. The committee's proposals called for a branch from the Vestfold Line to Brevik, although it would run from Porsgrunn via Roligheten and Kleveland. The branch was estimated to cost 226,000 Norwegian speciedaler. Two thirds would be financed by the state and the remaining 70,000 speciedaler would have to be financed through <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> of shares in the railway company. Brevik Municipality bought half the shares, but {{it was not possible to}} fill up the quota with private sales. When Parliament voted over the construction of the Vestfold Line in 1875, the branch to Brevik was dismissed. Discussion of a branch to Brevik resumed in 1887, when parliamentarian Livius Smitt proposed for Parliament a line from Eidanger to Brevik on behalf of the municipal council. It was considered by the legislature in 1888, but only 39 parliamentarians supported it, compared to the 68 who voted the proposal down. Thus the following year detailed planning commenced to better the political support for a line. Funding for the Brevik Line was dismissed by Parliament again in 1890, but the following year, on 4 July 1890, a majority voted in favor of the line. The condition was that 30,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) be funded locally. Most of the railway would be located in the former Eidanger Municipality. Eidanger Municipal Council was not particularly interested in the railway, and was not willing to pay for expropriation in their own municipality. Thus Brevik Municipality was forced to pay for all expropriation along the line and limited their support for the entire project to NOK 16,000. Brevik Municipal Council passed the plans and their financing on 31 March 1893. However, there was not community consensus as to the location of Brevik Station, with large camps each preferring Strømtangen and Setretangen. The municipal council voted in favor of Strømtangen on 25 June.|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The military exchange services purchase alcoholic beverages for resale on military installations {{as part of their}} mission to provide quality goods and services at competitive low prices to their customers [...] primarily military service members and their families. The revenue generated from the retail sale of products, including alcoholic beverages, supports most of the operating costs of the exchanges and military package stores as well as Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs. Such programs generally provide for the physical, cultural, and social needs of service members and their families, and include fitness centers, child development services, libraries, and recreation centers. As primarily self-supporting enterprises, military exchanges and package stores are funded predominantly with nonappropriated funds, such as cash and other assets generated through business operations and sales to Department of Defense (DOD) authorized patrons, but certain administrative and support costs of the exchanges are paid by DOD using appropriated funds. In Guam, the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM) operates exchange activities on Naval Base Guam and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) operates exchange activities on Andersen Air Force Base. Section 652 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 required us to evaluate the impact of reimposing a requirement that DOD not provide support funds to exchanges unless they purchase all alcoholic beverages intended for resale on military installations on Guam from local distributors. Section 8073 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2008 required that no funds appropriated by that act be used to support nonappropriated fund activities that did not use local distributors when making wholesale purchases of alcoholic beverages for resale at military installations on Guam during fiscal year 2008 (hereafter "local purchase requirement"). This requirement was not reenacted in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009, and currently there is no <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> requirement on Guam. This report examines the (1) actions taken by DOD to address the <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> requirement; (2) impact of the fiscal year 2008 <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> requirement on wholesale and retail prices; (3) impact of the <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> requirement on funding for Morale, Welfare, and Recreation programs; and (4) perspectives of NEXCOM and AAFES on the imposition of the <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> requirement. ...|$|E

40|$|Measures of {{the state}} and local {{government}} capital stock and investment are necessary inputs into several areas of economic analysis, including the measurement of national wealth and its growth. We estimate net investment and depreciation of state and local government nonresidential capital. In aggregate, we estimate a net state and local nonresidential capital stock of $ 1. 8 trillion in 1985, 17 % larger than that estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Net state and local government investment has exceeded the state and local deficit annually for the last forty-five years. While the fraction of state and <b>local</b> <b>purchase</b> of goods and services devoted to net investment has fallen, it has exceeded federal government net capital formation except during defense buildups and has averaged more than 40 % of private fixed nonresidential net investment since 1951.
