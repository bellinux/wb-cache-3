Any poor design of shafting arrangement for each vertical static bearing location and/or bearing off-set design value may cause a failed shafting alignment calculation and a non-uniform bearing load or over excessive bearing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> on the propulsion shaft stern tube/strut supporting bearing and possible further damage, for example, excessive wastage and/or crack on a damaged aft shaft strut bearing for a high speed craft. The objective {{of this study was to}} find and verify the design {{reliability of}} the applied theoretical method for calculating the suitable design values of each vertical static bearing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> on the propulsion shafting system at the initial design stage of shafting arrangement. The design values for each vertical static bearing <b>load</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> calculated by theoretical design methodologies of the finite element method (FEM) and the three moment equation method (TMEM) were compared with the shipyard original design values for the same design case of propulsion shafting system. The design deviation of the vertical static bearing from the shipyard original design values was determined in order to decide which design methodology (TMEM or FEM) would be adopted and developed for further numerical algorithm design on shafting alignment optimization. According to the obtained results, both the FEM and the TMEM theoretical design accuracy and reliability were well matched with the shipyard original design values.

In this study, the makeup, sealability and joint strength was analyzed from conditions of make-up loading, tension <b>loading,</b> compression <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> internal <b>pressure</b> <b>loading</b> by finite element method. The makeup torque, the contact pressure distributions of metal seal along the axis and the stress distributions of threaded connection are given. The results show that under tension <b>loading,</b> compression <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> internal <b>pressure,</b> the overall stress level of threaded connection is lower than of pipe. The anti-compression performance and joint strength of threaded connection is greater than of pipe.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, a strong {{foundation}} for the professional discipline of bulk solids handling has been provided, but so far, the theories for predicting funnel-flow are still quite empirical. In most cases, only two-dimensional stress field models are applied, which overestimate the stable pipe or rathole dimensions defining {{the core of the}} funnel and lead to draw-down and live capacity determinations, which are too conservative. More recently, Roberts [1] introduced a new, more realistic, hoop stress theory based on the three-dimensional stress state occurring in a rathole. To verify the validity of the new theory, the current research upon which this paper is based, involves an experimental study of rathole formation in laboratory scale model funnel-flow bins and gravity reclaim stockpiles. A two-dimensional laser line scanner is used to depict rathole profiles, while <b>load</b> cells <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors are applied to determine instantaneous <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> <b>pressure</b> conditions during filling, storage and discharge. Iron ore fines are used as the test material, with the test program including flat-bottom bins with different diameters as well as varying filling levels and outlet diameters and stockpiles with variable heights and outlet diameters.

Anon-linear converging cosine dies profiles are used for square to square extrusion process. Extrusion through mathematically contoured die plays a critical role in improvement of surface finish of extruded product. The cosine die profile designed using CATIA, Solidworks and MATLAB was used to find out the coordinate of the cosine die profile and solid model was generated using CATIA the STL files of extrusion dies generated by solid work and CATIA. The STL files are used in DEFORM- 3 D Software for FEM simulation. The work piece, punch and container with cosine die profiles are used in DEFORM- 3 D software for simulation purpose.
