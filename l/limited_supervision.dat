5000|$|Lack of {{transparency}} - A lack {{of transparency}} {{in the operation}} of the legislative, legal or administrative provisions is another factor used to identify tax havens. The OECD is concerned that laws should be applied openly and consistently, and that information needed by foreign tax authorities to determine a taxpayer’s situation is available. Lack of transparency in one country can make it difficult, if not impossible, for other tax authorities to apply their laws effectively. ‘Secret rulings’, negotiated tax rates, or other practices that fail to apply the law openly and consistently are examples of a lack of transparency. <b>Limited</b> regulatory <b>supervision</b> or a government’s lack of legal access to financial records are contributing factors.|$|R
