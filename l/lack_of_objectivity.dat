Vlahogiannis, in his preface to the Memoirs, praises his honesty and {{contrasts}} it to his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and impartiality. While always straightforward, Makriyannis clearly holds a grudge against people he had come into conflict with. He often uses disparaging language against people like Kolokotronis, while staying silent about the more questionable deeds of people he had a favourable opinion of. According to Sphyroeras, however, his judgements do not stem from selfishness, but rather from his severity against those he considered were defaming the cause of Greece.|$|E

The tribunal rarely advised the release of detainees, and its <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> was reflected in its general report on the emergency and detention exercise of 1959, which completely whitewashed the regime's actions.

40|$|The {{approach}} to evaluate handwriting quality is usually {{based on the}} use of check-lists and scales regarding qualitative, postural and pen grasp aspects that are detected during task execution and through a visual analysis of written texts. Nevertheless, this approach <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and all the parameters have the same weight. On the other hand, objective evaluation methods focusing on the qualitative approach are available in the literature. For example, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a technique that allows to organise complex relationships between elements into a system based on subjective judgements. In this paper we present an innovative evaluation scale, based on a new neuromotor model of handwriting production, which associates a specific weight to each parameter during the calculation of a quality score. The scale allows teachers, speech therapists and all those interested in diagnostic and rehabilitative phase to identify subjects who show some handwriting difficulties compared to the average performance of their peers. The new approach was applied to two groups of students, following different teaching methods, in order to evaluate suitably weighted aspects of handwriting quality...|$|R

40|$|The {{calibration}} of DEM {{models is}} typically accomplished by trail and error. However, the procedure <b>lacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and has several uncertainties. To {{deal with these}} issues, the particle filter is employed as a novel approach to calibrate DEM models of granular soils. The posterior probability distribution of the microparameters that give numerical results in good agreement with the experimental response of a Toyoura sand specimen is approximated by independent model trajectories, referred as ‘particles’, based on Monte Carlo sampling. The soil specimen is modeled by polydisperse packings with different numbers of spherical grains. Prepared in ‘stress-free’ states, the packings are subjected to triaxial quasistatic loading. Given the experimental data, the posterior probability distribution is incrementally updated, until convergence is reached. The resulting ‘particles’ with higher weights are identified as the calibration results. The evolutions of the weighted averages and posterior probability distribution of the micro-parameters are plotted to show the advantage of using a particle filter, i. e., multiple solutions are identified for each parameter with known probabilities of reproducing the experimental response...|$|R

To evaluate the ATDS clinical stability, 2 sets of tongue images taken 1 hour apart from 20 patients with possible variations in lighting and extruding tongue, are employed to investigate intra-agreement of the ATDS, intra-agreement of the TCM doctors, and the inter-agreement between the ATDS and TCM doctors. The ATDS is shown to be more consistent with significantly higher intra-agreement than the TCM doctors (kappa value: 0. 93 ± 0. 06 versus 0. 64 ± 0. 13) with P< 0. 001 (Student’s t-test). Inter-agreements between the ATDS and TCM doctors, as well as among the TCM doctors are both moderate.

He also questioned the degree to which the protests were representative of the wider society and criticized the media's disproportionate coverage of the demonstrations as well as the media anchors' <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> (i.e. when reporting on the actions of police officers) due to [...] "becoming factors in determining the political processes" [...] rather than relaying information. Analysts who tended to be opposed to the protests pointed out that Bulgarian society had begun to suffer from a [...] "protest fatigue" [...] and the majority of citizens wanted the government to be given a chance to implement its policy aims before casting judgment on it. They also downplayed the parallels between the then anti-government wave and the 1997 demonstrations that brought down the Zhan Videnov cabinet because of their belief that the economic and financial climate in Bulgaria during Oresharski's tenure could hardly be depicted as being in an acute state of crisis. In this context, it is emphasized that the government was able to continue its mandate for longer than expected due to a combination of chance factors outside of its control (not necessarily related to the protests), including the reduction in the negative externalities because of the subsiding of the economic crisis and the relatively benevolent investment climate in Bulgaria as well as the lack of viable political alternatives. The protests have also come under fire by some sources due to exhibiting a general spirit of negativity and placing illogical demands.|$|E
