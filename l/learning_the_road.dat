40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} <b>the</b> problem of <b>road</b> {{segmentation}} and free space detection {{in the context}} of autonomous driving. Traditional methods either use 3 -dimensional (3 D) cues such as point clouds obtained from LIDAR, RADAR or stereo cameras or 2 -dimensional (2 D) cues such as lane markings, road boundaries and object detection. Typical 3 D point clouds do not have enough resolution to detect fine differences in heights such as between road and pavement. Image based 2 D cues fail when encountering uneven road textures such as due to shadows, potholes, lane markings or road restoration. We propose a novel free road space detection technique combining both 2 D and 3 D cues. In particular, we use CNN based road segmentation from 2 D images and plane/box fitting on sparse depth data obtained from SLAM as priors to formulate an energy minimization using conditional random field (CRF), for road pixels classification. While <b>the</b> CNN <b>learns</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> texture and is unaffected by depth boundaries, the 3 D information helps in overcoming texture based classification failures. Finally, we use <b>the</b> obtained <b>road</b> segmentation with <b>the</b> 3 D depth data from monocular SLAM to detect the free space for the navigation purposes. Our experiments on KITTI odometry dataset, Camvid dataset, as well as videos captured by us, validate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state of the art.

40|$|Abstract—Road scene {{analysis}} is a challenging {{problem that has}} applications in autonomous navigation of vehicles. An inte-gral component of this system is the robust detection and tracking of lane markings. It is a hard problem primarily due to large appearance variations in lane markings caused by factors such as occlusion (traffic on <b>the</b> <b>road),</b> shadows (from objects like trees), and changing lighting conditions of the scene (transition from day to night). In this paper, we address these issues through a learning-based approach using visual inputs from a camera mounted {{in front of a}} vehicle. We propose, (i) a pixel-hierarchy feature descriptor to model contextual information shared by lane markings with <b>the</b> surrounding <b>road</b> region, (ii) a robust boosting algorithm to select relevant contextual features for detecting lane markings, and (iii) particle filters to track the lane markings, without the knowledge of vehicle speed, by assuming the lane markings to be static through the video sequence and then <b>learning</b> <b>the</b> possible <b>road</b> scene variations from the statistics of tracked model parameters.

40|$|Abstract — The {{majority}} of current image-based road following algorithms operate, {{at least in}} part, by assuming the presence of structural or visual cues unique to the roadway. As a result, these algorithms are poorly suited {{to the task of}} tracking unstructured roads typical in desert environments. In this paper, we propose a road following algorithm that operates in a selfsupervised learning regime, allowing it to adapt to changing road conditions while making no assumptions about the general structure or appearance of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface. An application of optical flow techniques, paired with one-dimensional template matching, allows identification of regions in the current camera image that closely resemble <b>the</b> <b>learned</b> appearance of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in <b>the</b> recent past. The algorithm assumes the vehicle lies on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> in order to form templates of <b>the</b> <b>road’s</b> appearance.
