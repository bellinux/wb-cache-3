5|$|This in turn {{endangered}} <b>Libyan</b> {{control over}} the Aouzou Strip, and Aouzou fell in August to the FANT, only to be repelled by an overwhelming <b>Libyan</b> counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habré readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in <b>Libyan</b> territory of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful raid against the key <b>Libyan</b> air base at Maaten al-Sarra. This attack {{was part of a}} plan to remove the threat of <b>Libyan</b> airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any {{of the leaders of}} the Volcan Army and had not {{recognized}} <b>Libyan</b> claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor <b>Libyan</b> military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 <b>Libyan</b> troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The <b>Libyan</b> forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with <b>Libyan</b> military support.|$|E
5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a <b>Libyan</b> intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without <b>Libyan</b> armor and airpower.|$|E
50|$|Herodotus divided {{them into}} Eastern <b>Libyans</b> and Western <b>Libyans.</b> Eastern <b>Libyans</b> were nomadic shepherds east of Lake Tritonis.

He emphasized that no other people worshipped Poseidon from early times apart from the <b>Libyans</b> who spread his cult:..these I think received their naming from the Pelasgians, except Poseidon; but about this god the Hellenes learnt from the <b>Libyans,</b> for no people except the <b>Libyans</b> have had the name of Poseidon from the first and have paid honour to this god always.|$|R
5|$|Habré started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of {{northern}} Chad with a successful {{attack on the}} well-defended <b>Libyan</b> communications base of Fada. Against the <b>Libyan</b> army the Chadian commander Hassan Djamous {{conducted a series of}} swift pincer movements, enveloping the <b>Libyan</b> positions and crushing them with sudden attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the battles of B'ir Kora and Ouadi Doum, inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the new US President Ronald Reagan {{pursued a}} hard line {{approach}} to Libya, erroneously claiming it to be puppet regime of the Soviet Union. In turn, Gaddafi played up his commercial relationship with the Soviets, visiting Moscow again in April 1981 and 1985, and in 1978 threatening to join the Warsaw Pact. The Soviets were nevertheless cautious of Gaddafi, seeing him as an unpredictable extremist. Beginning military exercises in the Gulf of Sirte – an area of sea that Libya claimed {{as a part of}} its territorial waters – in August 1981 the US shot down two <b>Libyan</b> Su-22 planes monitoring them. Closing down Libya's embassy in Washington, D.C., Reagan advised US companies operating in the country {{to reduce the number of}} American personnel stationed there. In March 1982, the US implemented an embargo of <b>Libyan</b> oil, and in January 1986 ordered all US companies to cease operating in the country, although several hundred workers remained when the <b>Libyan</b> government doubled their pay. Diplomatic relations also broke down with the UK, after <b>Libyan</b> diplomats were accused in the killing of Yvonne Fletcher, a British policewoman stationed outside their London embassy, in April 1984. In Spring 1986, the US Navy again began performing exercises in the Gulf of Sirte; the <b>Libyan</b> military retaliated, but failed as the US sank several <b>Libyan</b> ships.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} <b>Libyan</b> air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories {{in the first three}} months of 1987, more than 3,000 <b>Libyan</b> soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned <b>Libyan</b> equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, <b>Libyan</b> soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that <b>Libyan</b> forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators should accept the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while <b>Libyan</b> withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept {{the decisions of the}} OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce <b>Libyan</b> military support, necessary for dealing with Habré's FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April, only a {{few days}} after signing the ceasefire, Oueddei left Faya-Largeau, leaving there a <b>Libyan</b> {{garrison}} of 800 men. Relying on <b>Libyan</b> armor and air power, Goukouni's forces conquered a small FAT garrison and turned towards N'Djamena.|$|E

5|$|Only a {{few months}} after the failed {{offensive}} against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of unity and badly weakened <b>Libyan</b> power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of <b>Libyan</b> troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all <b>Libyan</b> military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} {{the signing of the}} 1972 treaty, <b>Libyan</b> troops moved into the Strip and {{established}} an airbase just north of Aouzou, protected by surface-to-air missiles. A civil administration was set up, attached to Kufra, and <b>Libyan</b> citizenship was extended to the few thousand inhabitants of the area. From that moment, <b>Libyan</b> maps represented the area as part of Libya.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} the war {{delineated}} itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed {{the bulk of the}} scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, {{towards the end of the}} war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing the <b>Libyan</b> occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad. This deprived the <b>Libyan</b> forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling the <b>Libyan</b> superiority in firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which the <b>Libyan</b> forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Alexander William O. Owumi (born May 4, 1984) is a Nigerian {{professional}} basketball player and author.

He joined the team shortly before the outbreak of the <b>Libyan</b> Civil War in 2011. Owumi currently plays for the Surrey Scorchers of the British Basketball League (BBL). As an author, he has written three books, including an autobiography focusing on his time in Libya.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{fighting}} in October between Gaddafi's Islamic Legionnaires and Goukouni's troops, and rumors that Acyl was planning a coup d'état {{to assume the}} leadership of the GUNT, Goukouni demanded on 29 October the complete and unequivocal withdrawal of <b>Libyan</b> forces from Chadian territory, which, beginning with the capital, was to be completed by 31 December. The Libyans were to be replaced by an OAU Inter-African Force (IAF). Gaddafi complied, and by 16 November all <b>Libyan</b> forces had left Chad, redeploying in the Aouzou Strip.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the <b>Libyan</b> {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. <b>Libyan</b> garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the <b>Libyan</b> army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
50|$|The Italian aim was {{to drive}} the local {{population}} to the marginal land in the interior and to resettle the Italian population in the most fertile lands of Libya.The Italians did not provide the <b>Libyans</b> with adequate education or improved native administration, the Italian population (about 10% of the total population) had 81 elementary schools in 1939-1940, while the <b>Libyans</b> (more than 85% of total population) had 97.There were only three secondary schools for the <b>Libyans</b> by 1940, two in Tripoli and one in Benghazi.|$|R

50|$|Some {{have argued}} that the impact of an Internet {{shutdown}} in Libya was less severe than in countries like Egypt because relatively few <b>Libyans</b> have Internet access. According to the research group OpenNet Initiative, at the time only about 6 percent of <b>Libyans</b> had home or public Internet access. In Egypt the number was 24 percent, in the United States 81. However, as noted by Jillian York, coordinator of the OpenNet Initiative, the few <b>Libyans</b> that did have Internet access were educated and politically aware and therefore more influential. Leslie Harris, president of the Center for Democracy and Technology, noted that the Internet shutdown would {{make it more difficult for}} <b>Libyans,</b> especially those in the capital Tripoli, to receive updates about the state of the protests around the country.|$|R

5|$|Habré {{selected}} as the first target for his reconquest of northern Chad the well-fortified <b>Libyan</b> communications base of Fada. It was defended by 2,000 Libyans and {{the bulk of the}} Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) militia (Gaddafi's closest Chadian allies), well-provided with armour and artillery. Hassan Djamous, the thirty-year-old FANT commander-in-chief, pitched about 4,000–5,000 men against Fada's <b>Libyan</b> garrison. Taking advantage of his army's superior knowledge of the terrain, which apparently included unknown access points to the base, Djamous avoided a frontal assault and used his forces' high mobility to surround the <b>Libyan</b> positions and then unleashed his troops, destroying the defending garrison. In the battle, 784 Libyans were killed and 100 tanks destroyed, while only 50 FANT soldiers died.|$|E
