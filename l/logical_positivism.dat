5|$|The <b>logical</b> <b>positivism</b> {{movement}} {{originated in}} the Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while synthetic statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E

Besides Popper and Kuhn, other postpostivist philosophers of science—including Paul Feyerabend, Imre Lakatos, and Larry Laudan—have all but unanimously rejected inductivism. Among them, {{those who have}} asserted scientific realism—that scientific theory can and does offer approximately true understanding of nature's unobservable aspects—have tended to claim that scientists develop approximately true theories about nature through IBE. And yet IBE, which, so far, cannot be trained, lacks particular rules of inference. By the 21st century's turn, inductivism's heir was Bayesianism.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Kuhn's {{landmark}} book of 1962, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions—which identified paradigms {{of science}} overturned by revolutionary science within fundamental physics—critically destabilized confidence in scientific foundationalism, commonly if erroneously attributed to verificationism. [...] Popper, {{who had long}} claimed to have killed verificationism but recognized that some would confuse his falsificationism for more of it, was knighted in 1965. At 1967, John Passmore, a leading historian of 20th-century philosophy, wrote, [...] "Logical positivism is dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes"—a general view among philosophers. [...] <b>Logical</b> <b>positivism's</b> fall heralded postpositivism, where Popper's view of human knowledge as hypothetical, continually growing, and open to change ascended, and verificationism became mostly maligned.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{book called}} Science Versus Crime, Houck writes that Popper's falsificationism can be {{questioned}} logically: {{it is not clear}} how Popper would deal with a statement like [...] "for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt." [...] The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that <b>Logical</b> <b>Positivism's</b> verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature.|$|R

40|$|What is W. V. O. Quine’s {{relationship}} to classical pragmatism? Although he resists the comparison to William James in particular, commentators {{have seen an}} affinity between his “web of belief” model of theory confirmation and James’s claim that our beliefs form a “stock” that faces new experience as a corporate body. I argue that the similarity is only superficial. James thinks our web of beliefs should be responsive not just to perceptual but also to emotional experiences in some cases; Quine denies this. I motivate James’s controversial view by appealing to an episode {{in the history of}} medicine when a researcher self-experimented by swallowing a vial of bacteria that at the time had not been studied in much detail. The researcher’s commitment to his own as-yet untested hypothesis was based in part on emotional considerations. Finally, I argue that Quine’s insistence that emotions can never be relevant to adjusting our web of belief reflects a tacit holdover of one of <b>logical</b> <b>positivism’s</b> crucially anti-pragmatist commitments—that philosophy of science should focus exclusively on the context of justification, not the context of discovery. James’s emphasis on discovery as a (perhaps the) crucial locus for epistemological inquiry is characteristic of pragmatism in general. Since Quinean epistemology is always an epistemology of justification, he is not happily viewed {{as a member of the}} pragmatist tradition...|$|R
40|$|URL] Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia (1974), {{along with}} John Rawls's A Theory of Justice (1971), radically changed the {{landscape}} in analytic political philosophy. For much of the preceding half-century, {{under the influence of}} <b>logical</b> <b>positivism's</b> heavy emphasis on empirical verifiability, much of moral philosophy was taken up with meta-ethics (e. g., the semantics of moral discourse) —with little attention given to normative moral theories. Moreover, to the extent that normative theories were considered, utilitarianism was the center of attention. This all changed with the publication of Rawls's articulation and defense of liberal egalitarianism and Nozick's libertarian challenge to the legitimacy of anything more than the night-watchman state. At the core of Nozick's book are two arguments. One is that a night-watchman state (which protects only against violence, theft, fraud, and breach of contract) could be legitimate, even without the consent of all those to be governed. The other is that nothing more extensive than the night-watchman state is legitimate, except with the consent of all. The argument is complex, and Nozick often inserts long—and very interesting—digressions. Below I shall focus only on his core argument. I shall thus not address his discussions of Rawls' theory of justice (Ch. 7, Section 2) and other arguments attempting to justify more than the night-watchman state (Ch. 8), nor his discussion of utopias (Ch. 10) ...|$|R

My option of understanding uses the propositions of Boaventura Santos when talks about the project of modernity and the contribution of Whitehead, when he speaks of the details present in the frequencies of life. I conclude by saying that the perception of other possibilities for what has been explained from a single point of view, is something that depends on the availability of the researcher to find them in small signs that commonly despised when we succumb to the simplistic speech...|$|R

40|$|Evidentialism, a {{doctrine}} of epistemic justification stipulating that a belief is warranted {{if and only if}} it is supported by evidence, is a central tenet of Anglo-American empiricism particularly in its form as <b>logical</b> empiricism or <b>positivism.</b> Advocated by Locke and Hume, it is found early on in this tradition. Perhaps the most impassioned advocate of evidentialism is the English mathematician and philosopher, William K. Clifford, who in his “The Ethics of Belief” gave this doctrine a moral twist by declaring uncompromisingly that to believe anything on insufficient evidence is not merely imprudent or foolish, but morally wrong no less. Clifford is perhaps remembered today outside of mathematical circles for William James’ riposte to him in the “Will to Believe. ” James contended that we are not in the wrong to believe things without sufficient evidence; indeed, we have the right, no less, in certain cases so to believe. James’ contention is based on his exposure of an unacknowledged bias behind Clifford’s stricture against believing on insufficient evidence, namely, the fear of error. However, James appeals to another bias, no less legitimate than the fear of error, which justifies believing on insufficient evidence, namely, the hope of truth. In what follows I hope to show that, though it may not be initially apparent, James is actually closer to Clifford’s views than one might suppose. Both are pragmatists (Clifford in spirit if not in name), and James no less than Clifford is committed to the empiricist principle of verification. James, moreover, concedes that Clifford’s epistemological strictures should be observed in assessing scientific beliefs, but makes a qualified exception for moral and religious beliefs. James, I think, does not so much refute Clifford’s evidentialism—much of which he accepts—as significantly qualify and even expand upon it. I shall begin by explaining why Clifford holds such a strong evidentialist view, and then go on to consider James’ response. This is followed by a consideration of their agreements and differences, and finally by an assessment of the merits of James’s response...|$|R
5000|$|Behaviorist sentiments are not {{uncommon}} within philosophy of language and analytic philosophy. It is sometimes argued that Ludwig Wittgenstein defended a behaviorist position (e.g., the beetle in a box argument)—but while there are important relations between his thought and behaviorism, the claim {{that he was a}} behaviorist is quite controversial. Mathematician Alan Turing is also sometimes considered a behaviorist, but he himself did not make this identification. In <b>logical</b> and empirical <b>positivism</b> (as held, e.g., by Rudolf Carnap and Carl Hempel), the meaning of psychological statements are their verification conditions, which consist of performed overt behavior. W.V. Quine made use of a type of behaviorism, influenced by some of Skinner's ideas, in his own work on language. Gilbert Ryle defended a distinct strain of philosophical behaviorism, sketched in his book The Concept of Mind. Ryle's central claim was that instances of dualism frequently represented [...] "category mistakes", and hence that they were really misunderstandings of the use of ordinary language. Daniel Dennett likewise acknowledges himself to be a type of behaviorist, though he offers extensive criticism of radical behaviorism and refutes Skinner's rejection of the value of intentional idioms and the possibility of free will. This is Dennett's main point in [...] "Skinner Skinned." [...] Dennett argues that there is a crucial difference between explaining and explaining away… If our explanation of apparently rational behavior turns out to be extremely simple, we may want to say that the behavior was not really rational after all. But if the explanation is very complex and intricate, we may want to say not that the behavior is not rational, but that we now {{have a better understanding of}} what rationality consists in. (Compare: if we find out how a computer program solves problems in linear algebra, we don't say it's not really solving them, we just say we know how it does it. On the other hand, in cases like Weizenbaum's ELIZAprogram, the explanation of how the computer carries on a conversation is so simple that the right thing to say seems to be that the machine isn't really carrying on a conversation, it's just a trick.)

Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological nominalism. Proponents such as Bertrand Russell emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, Ludwig Wittgenstein attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. H. L. Mencken sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea that science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle of}} the 20th century was the {{beginning}} of the dominance of analytic philosophy in America. Analytic philosophy, prior to its arrival in America, had begun in Europe with the work of Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the logical positivists. According to <b>logical</b> <b>positivism,</b> the truths of logic and mathematics are tautologies, and those of science are empirically verifiable. Any other claim, including the claims of ethics, aesthetics, theology, metaphysics, and ontology, are meaningless (this theory is called verificationism).

25|$|The {{philosophical}} {{position of}} the Vienna Circle was called Logical Empiricism (German: Logischer Empirismus), <b>Logical</b> <b>Positivism</b> or Neopositivism. It was influenced by Ernst Mach, David Hilbert, French Conventionalism (Henri Poincaré and Pierre Duhem), Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Albert Einstein. The Vienna Circle was pluralistic and committed to the ideals of Enlightenment. It was unified by the aim of making philosophy scientific {{with the help of}} modern logic. Main topics were foundational debates in the natural and social sciences, logic and mathematics, the modernization of empiricism by modern logic, the search for an empiricist criterion of meaning, the critique of metaphysics and the unification of the sciences in the unity of science.|$|E
25|$|Based on Henri Poincaré's conventionalism, {{philosophers}} such as Pierre Duhem (1914) or Hugo Dingler (1920) {{argued that}} the classical concepts of space, time, and geometry were, and will always be, the most convenient expressions in natural science, therefore the concepts of relativity cannot be correct. This was criticized by proponents of <b>logical</b> <b>positivism</b> such as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, or Reichenbach. They argued that Poincaré's conventionalism could be modified, as to bring it into accord with relativity. Although {{it is true that}} the basic assumptions of Newtonian mechanics are simpler, it can only be brought into accord with modern experiments by inventing auxiliary hypotheses. On the other hand, relativity doesn't need such hypotheses, thus from a conceptual viewpoint, relativity is in fact simpler than Newtonian mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{responses}} to relativity were also expressed by proponents of Neo-Kantianism (Paul Natorp, Bruno Bauch, etc.), and Phenomenology (Oskar Becker, Moritz Geiger etc.). While {{some of them}} only rejected the philosophical consequences, others rejected also the physical consequences of the theory. Einstein was criticized for violating Immanuel Kant's categoric scheme, i.e., it was claimed that space-time curvature caused by matter and energy is impossible, since matter and energy already require the concepts of space and time. Also the three-dimensionality of space, Euclidean geometry, {{and the existence of}} absolute simultaneity were claimed to be necessary for the understanding of the world; none of them can possibly be altered by empirical findings. By moving all those concepts into a metaphysical area, any form of criticism of Kantianism would be prevented. Other pseudo-Kantians like Ernst Cassirer or Hans Reichenbach (1920), tried to modify Kant's philosophy. Subsequently, Reichenbach rejected Kantianism at all and became a proponent of <b>logical</b> <b>positivism.</b>|$|E

[...] Theoretical laws would be reduced to empirical laws, while theoretical terms would garner meaning from observational terms via correspondence rules.

[...] A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a logical calculus or empirical operation could verify its falsity or truth.|$|E
500|$|While {{philosophical}} thought {{pertaining to}} science dates {{back at least}} to the time of Aristotle, philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only {{in the middle of the}} 20th century in the wake of the <b>logical</b> <b>positivism</b> movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. Thomas Kuhn's landmark 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was also formative, challenging the view of scientific progress as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a [...] "paradigm," [...] the set of questions, concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period. Karl Popper and Charles Sanders Peirce moved on from positivism to establish a modern set of standards for scientific methodology.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America.

[...] The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of analytic philosophy, and dominated Anglosphere philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s. [...] Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems, and its doctrines were increasingly assaulted.

500|$|Sapir had a {{profound}} influence on Whorf's thinking. Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views {{of the relation between}} thought and language stemming from the Humboldtian tradition he acquired through Franz Boas, which regarded language as the historical embodiment of volksgeist, or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of <b>logical</b> <b>positivism,</b> such as that of Bertrand Russell and the early Ludwig Wittgenstein, particularly through Ogden and Richards' The Meaning of Meaning, from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is. In this view, proper perception could only be accomplished through formal logics. During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards. As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight. One of these was Polish philosopher Alfred Korzybski's General semantics, which was espoused in the US by Stuart Chase. Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be [...] "utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject."
