5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks <b>like</b> <b>something</b> else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example when a flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object looks <b>like</b> <b>something</b> else {{which is}} of no special {{interest}} to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E

25|$|The {{forensics}} reinforced this theory. On {{a record}} player atop the stack was a thumb-shaped bloodstain. It had no print, suggesting whoever left it was wearing gloves to avoid leaving identification. But {{the blood was}} Rasmussen's, suggesting the equipment had been stacked after the struggle and shooting. They had been left behind, the detectives realized, to make the crime look <b>like</b> <b>something</b> other than what it really was. From the four bound volumes of the case file they developed a list of five women who might be suspects. Nuttall was taken aback when Ruetten told him over the phone that Lazarus was a police officer. By then, Lazarus had been promoted {{to a higher level}} of detective, and was working art theft cases as part of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD).|$|E
25|$|Dyson {{also did}} {{work in a}} variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices. There is an {{interesting}} story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist Hugh Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg who said it looked <b>like</b> <b>something</b> in mathematical physics and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the distribution of primes 2,3,5,7,11,... and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium.|$|E

25|$|His major prose {{work was}} The History of King Richard the Third, which he {{completed}} in 1619 {{and left in}} rough draft at his death, and which, in 1731, was burnt around the edges in the Cotton library fire. Before that, the work had suffered more serious damage, coming {{into the hands of}} Buck's great-nephew, George Buck, who used it as he did others of Buck's works: he produced manuscript copies that he dedicated to various patrons from whom he sought advancement, passing them off as his own. Gradually he altered the History, cutting it, making it look <b>like</b> <b>something</b> written in his own time, rather than earlier, by deleting names of Buck’s learned contemporaries who had shared sources and viva voce information with him, and altering or deleting documentation of sources, with the details of which, also, his copyist was careless. Finally in 1646 he published a version of the History that was slightly over half the length of the original. A second issue (usually referred to erroneously as a second edition) appeared the next year, leading to the assumption that Buck invented many of his sources. This damaged Buck's scholarly reputation for centuries. The authentic text of Buck's History was not published until 1979; the editor, Arthur Kincaid, was able to find all but seven of the hundreds of sources that Buck had meticulously documented.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers of {{the book}} were {{impressed}} by Irving's characters. English author Giles Foden wrote in The Guardian that Ketchum is [...] " [...] magnificent creation, he's <b>like</b> <b>something</b> out of The Last of the Mohicans", while Ron Charles said in The Washington Post that he is [...] "one of Irving's most endearing and memorable characters", a cross between Shakespeare's Falstaff and Louise Erdrich's Nanapush. Literary critic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times described Constable Carl, the policeman who pursues Dominic and Danny, as not unlike Victor Hugo’s obsessive Inspector Javert in Les Misérables. Foden said Irving's manipulation of the character's identities was [...] "nothing less than show-stopping".|$|E

They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks <b>like</b> <b>something</b> from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E
