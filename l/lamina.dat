5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected <b>lamina.</b> The reflected <b>lamina</b> is found on the articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected <b>lamina</b> became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} N. rajah are very {{distinctive}} and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the tendril joins the <b>lamina</b> on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is {{more pronounced in}} N. rajah {{than in any other}} Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is not unique to these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the <b>lamina</b> and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The <b>lamina</b> is oblong to lanceolate-shaped, ≤80cm long and ≤15cm wide.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAmounts of silty <b>laminae</b> in {{continental}} {{shale gas}} reservoir were investigated in the Zhangjiatan shale of the Yanchang Formation, Ordos Basin. The {{purpose of this}} study is to provide awareness in terms of the nature and discrepancies in pore structure between silty <b>laminae</b> and clayey <b>laminae.</b> By mechanically separating the silty <b>laminae</b> from the shale core, a combination measurement series of mercury injection capillary pressure, N 2 adsorption, and carbon dioxide adsorption were performed on the aforementioned two parts. An integrated pore size distribution, with a pore diameter range of 0. 1  nm- 100  μm, was obtained by using appropriate sample particle size and calculation model. The comparative analysis of the pore structure shows that the clayey <b>laminae</b> are dominated by mesopore and micropore; meanwhile, the silty <b>laminae</b> are dominated by macropore alone. The pore volume distribution in clayey <b>laminae</b> is sorted as mesopore volume > micropore volume > macropore volume, on the other hand, for silty <b>laminae</b> it is macropore volume > mesopore volume > micropore volume. The averaged total pore volume of silty <b>laminae</b> is 2. 02  cc/ 100  g, and for clayey <b>laminae,</b> it is 1. 41  cc/ 100  g. The porosity of silty <b>laminae</b> is 5. 40 %, which is greater than that of clayey laminae's 3. 67 %. Since silty <b>laminae</b> have larger pore width and pore space, they are more permeable and porous than the clayey laminae; it also acts as a favorable conduit and reservoir for shale gas...|$|R
40|$|Pale green <b>laminae</b> < 2 mm thick {{are common}} {{features}} of the Neogene and Quaternary sediment of Lord Howe Rise. We believe these <b>laminae</b> represent diagenetically altered volcanic ash layers from regional volcanic events. Although no consistent high abundances of volcanic glass are found within the <b>laminae,</b> the volcanic origin of the <b>laminae</b> is suggested by (1) similar temporal distribution of the <b>laminae</b> {{and the distribution of}} volcanic ash layers elsewhere in the southwest Pacific; (2) the high abundances of authigenic smectite in the laminae; and (3) the common occurrence of iron sulfides in proximity to most of the <b>laminae.</b> The resulting tephrostratigraphy is considerably more complex and detailed than was previously known...|$|R
5|$|The nuclear <b>lamina</b> is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear <b>lamina.</b> Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it is excluded from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the layers}} of pinacocytes and choanocytes {{resemble}} the epithelia of more complex animals, they are not bound tightly by cell-to-cell connections or a basal <b>lamina</b> (thin fibrous sheet underneath).

50|$|The {{bones of}} the hoof are {{suspended}} within the axial hooves of ungulates by layers of modified skin cells, known as <b>laminae</b> or lamellae, which act as shock absorbers during locomotion. In horses, there are about 550-600 pairs of primary epidermal <b>laminae,</b> each with 150-200 secondary <b>laminae</b> projection from their surface. These interdigitate with equivalent structures {{on the surface of}} the coffin bone (PIII, P3, the third phalanx, pedal bone, or distal phalanx), known as dermal <b>laminae.</b> The secondary <b>laminae</b> contain basal cells which attach via hemidesmosomes to the basement membrane. The basement membrane is then attached to the coffin bone via the connective tissue of the dermis.|$|R
5|$|During its lifetime, {{a nucleus}} may {{be broken down}} or destroyed, either {{in the process of}} cell {{division}} or as a consequence of apoptosis (the process of programmed cell death).

5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal <b>lamina,</b> the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular <b>lamina</b> lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|In animal cells, two {{networks}} of intermediate filaments provide the nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear <b>lamina</b> forms an organized meshwork {{on the internal}} face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope.

50|$|The {{posterior}} grey column, {{also known}} as the posterior (or dorsal) horn of spinal cord, is divided into several <b>laminae,</b> based on the type of sensory information sent to each section. <b>Laminae</b> I and II are sent information from afferent neurons that sense nociception, temperature, and itching, <b>laminae</b> III and IV are sent information from neurons that sense mechanical pressure, and <b>laminae</b> V and VI are sent information from proprioceptors. It is known to be the primary relay point for haptic and nociceptive messages. The posterior horn is {{also known as}} a partially layered structure because only <b>laminae</b> I and II are well defined.|$|R

Clustering of the NFT was observed in all gyri. A significant peak-to-peak distance was observed in the upper <b>laminae</b> in 13 / 15 (87 %) gyri and in the lower <b>laminae</b> in 8 / 12 (67 %) gyri, suggesting a regularly repeating pattern of NFT clusters along the cortex. The regularly distributed clusters of NFT were between 500 and 800 μm in size, the estimated size of the cells of origin of the FF and FB cortico-cortical projections, in the upper <b>laminae</b> of 6 / 13 (46 %) gyri and in the lower <b>laminae</b> of 2 / 8 (25 %) gyri.

In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the <b>lamina</b> propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The paper {{describes}} a Thermally-Enhanced Edge Registration (TEER) technique for precision aligning {{large numbers of}} <b>laminae</b> in diffusion bonding processes. This technique is particularly relevant {{for the formation of}} micro heat exchangers and microreactors requiring highly paralleled microchannel arrays but is also being used to register other laminated devices with precision alignment requirements such as ion traps for quantum computing. The technique uses the difference in thermal expansion between a graphite fixture and metallic <b>laminae</b> to produce a registration force at the bonding temperature. At room temperature, a clearance is designed into the graphite fixture to allow for easy loading of the <b>laminae.</b> At the bonding temperature, the <b>laminae</b> interfere with the side of the fixture producing the registration force. The technique has been extensively studied and found to provide an average layer-to-layer misalignment of 5 microns for <b>laminae</b> with a thickness of 75 microns. The technique provides a plausible means for high-volume registration of large quantities of <b>laminae</b> when compared with other techniques...|$|R
40|$|Vertebral <b>laminae</b> are bony ridges or sheets {{that connect}} {{important}} morphological landmarks on the vertebrae, like diapophyses or zygapophyses. They usually exhibit some serial variation throughout the column. A consistent terminology facilitates the morphological description of this variation, and {{the recognition of}} patterns that could be taxonomically significant and could serve as phylogenetic characters. Such a terminology was designed for saurischian dinosaurs, and has also been applied to other members of Archosauriformes. Herein, this terminology is applied {{for the first time}} to lizards (Squamata). Probably due to their generally smaller size compared to saurischian dinosaurs, lizards have less developed vertebral <b>laminae.</b> Some <b>laminae</b> could not be recognized in this group and others require new names to account for differences in basic vertebral morphology. For instance, the fusion of diapophysis and parapophysis in lacertids into a structure called synapophysis necessitates the creation of the new term synapophyseal <b>laminae</b> for both diapophyseal and parapophyseal <b>laminae.</b> An assessment of occurrence and serial variation in a number of lacertid species shows that some <b>laminae</b> develop throughout ontogeny or only occur in large-sized species, whereas the distribution of other <b>laminae</b> might prove to be taxonomically significant in future...|$|R
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear <b>lamina</b> is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear <b>lamina</b> are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva ("gums") is the mucosal {{tissue that}} {{overlays}} the jaws. There are three {{different types of}} epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth. The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth. The junctional epithelium, composed of the basal <b>lamina</b> and hemidesmosomes, forms an attachment to the tooth. The sulcular epithelium is nonkeratinized stratified squamous tissue on the gingiva which touches but is not attached to the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Apoptosis is a {{controlled}} {{process in which}} the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and <b>lamina.</b> The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic proteases called caspases, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in assays for early apoptotic activity. Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus. Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} length of primary and {{secondary}} epidermal <b>laminae</b> of the toe and the lateral and medial quarters of horses, distributed into proximal, middle and distal thirds of the hooves. Eight limbs from adult crossbred horses, four females and four males, used to pull carts without pedal conditions.

The primary epidermal <b>laminae</b> were higher in the hooves of forelimbs compared to hindlimbs in the proximal and middle thirds and the regions of the medial quarter and toe. The secondary <b>laminae</b> were higher in forelimb of the middle third and medial quarter.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} the rate of ozone loss in both polar and mid-latitudes, derived from {{ozonesonde}} and satellite data, has almost the same vertical distribution (although opposite sense) to that of ozone <b>laminae</b> abundance. Ozone <b>laminae</b> appear in the lower stratosphere soon after the polar vortex is established in autumn, increase in number throughout the winter and reach a maximum abundance in late winter or spring. We indicate a possible coupling between mid-winter, sudden stratospheric warmings (when the vortex is weakened or disrupted) and the abundance of ozone <b>laminae</b> using a 23 -year record of ozonesonde data from the World Ozone Data Center in Canada combined with monthly-mean January polar temperatures at 30 hPa. Results are presented from an experiment conducted during the winter of 1994 / 95, in phase II of the Second European Stratospheric And Mid-latitude Experiment (SESAME), in which 93 ozone-enhanced <b>laminae</b> of polar origin observed by ozonesondes at different time and locations are linked by diabatic trajectories, enabling them to be probed twice or more. It is shown that, in general, ozone concentrations inside <b>laminae</b> fall progressively with time, mixing irreversibly with mid-latitude air on time-scales of a few weeks. A particular set of <b>laminae</b> which advected across Europe during mid February 1995 are examined in detail. These <b>laminae</b> were observed almost simultaneously at seven ozonesonde stations, providing information on their spatial scales. The development of these <b>laminae</b> has been modelled using the Contour Advection algorithm of Norton (1994), adding support to the concept that many <b>laminae</b> are extrusions of vortex air. Finally, a photochemical trajectory model is used to show that, if the air in the <b>laminae</b> is chemically activated, it will impact on mid-latitude ozone concentrations. An estimate is made of the potential number of ozone molecules lost each winter via this mechanism...|$|R
40|$|In our {{previous}} studies, we {{paid attention to}} acoustic emission (AE) as a non-destructive method, and bending test for finger-jointed <b>laminae</b> with starved joints was performed. In addition, for installing the AE monitoring method into the production line of the finger-jointed <b>laminae,</b> a special attachment (jig) for the AE sensor installed into the production line was developed. However, this method with the jig was not efficient for the following two reasons; first, {{it is difficult to}} set the position of the jig. Secondly, it is necessary to stop the production line for the bending process. In this study, the new type jig which installed the AE sensor for the detection of the <b>laminae</b> with starved joints regardless of both the position and the number of finger-joint parts is designed, and the evaluation tests of finger-jointed <b>laminae</b> were conducted by using this jig. That is, the evaluation system which installed the jig was constructed, and hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtua) finger-jointed <b>laminae</b> with starved joints were prepared, and the evaluation tests of finger-joint properties were conducted by using this system. The main results are summarized as follows: The evaluation system for the finger-jointed <b>laminae</b> was constructed. This system was composed of the motive power part, the AE measurement part, and the data collection part which controls some devices and collects sampling data. For the <b>laminae</b> with starved joints, the peak of AE signals which were measured by this system corresponded to the position of starved joints in the finger-jointed <b>laminae.</b> In addition, for the <b>laminae</b> with defects such as knots and loosed grain, the peak of AE signals which were measured besides the finger-joint part corresponded to the position of defects. From these results, this evaluation system which installed the jig with AE sensor was promising for detecting of the starved joints and the presence of defects in the finger-jointed <b>laminae.</b> It was found that modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the lamine during the evaluation test with this system could be measured in the grasp of the section size of the <b>laminae</b> beforehand. Therefore, it was suggested that the grading for the <b>laminae</b> after finger-jointing based on MOE could be possible by this system...|$|R
