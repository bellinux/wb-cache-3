5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in <b>laundries</b> for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's <b>laundries.</b> By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial <b>laundries</b> in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial <b>laundries</b> were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to {{a large percentage of the}} populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory <b>laundries</b> turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, Charles F. Brown, {{who entered}} the laundry {{business}} in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and {{the main part of}} the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial <b>laundries</b> of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, one of the larger <b>laundries,</b> employed 125 people, many of whom were women.|$|E

While RFID has been used for commercial <b>laundry</b> applications for several years now, the process presented here is based on a bank automated teller machine (ATM) style interaction for dropping, and picking up the <b>laundry.</b> The process consists of the following steps: the customer drops the <b>laundry</b> to be cleaned using an ATM style interaction, the <b>laundry</b> gets picked up and cleaned using an automated system requiring minimum human interaction, the cleaned <b>laundry</b> is sent to the pickup location, the customer receives an alert for picking up the <b>laundry,</b> and finally the customer picks up the <b>laundry,</b> again using an ATM style interaction. The use of RFID enables the tracking of the movement of garments through the <b>laundry</b> loop in real-time. The anticipated benefits for the <b>laundry</b> industry include customer convenience, savings in labor, and automated delivery...|$|R

5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building {{was built}} to house a {{commercial}} laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before {{the invention of the}} steam laundry machine in the mid-19thcentury, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines.

40|$|<b>Laundry</b> is {{relatively}} new business, but it has already socialized. Basically, the establishment of <b>laundry</b> is giving advantages for consumers and producers. The orientation of getting benefit is something natural because that is people attraction {{when they want to}} establish a business is done by ignoring consumers importances. Practically, <b>laundry</b> consumers are still getting lost because of <b>laundry</b> producers error. <b>Laundry</b> consumers can complain for their losses to Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen (YLK). The aim of this writing is to know, to describe, and to analyze the function of Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen in law protection for <b>laundry</b> consumers, the effectiveness of Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen in law protection for <b>laundry</b> consumers and Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen barriers law protection for <b>laundry</b> consumers. Approaching method that is used for this writing is sociology juridiction method. The data collection is analyzed by using qualitative descriptive. The function of Yayasan Lembaga Konsumen Malang (YLKM) in law protection for consumers is as source in socialy and mediator in advocacy. Pratically, giving law protection to <b>laundry</b> consumers for their losses because of <b>laundry</b> producers error in Malang, YLKM still doesn’t especially give socialy about <b>laundry</b> trade. Mean while, the advocacy that is used by YLKM is mediation which is incorrect, because YLKM is not neutral. Advocacy that is given more correcty to <b>laundry</b> consumers is negotiation in which YLKM is functioned as negotiation. YLKM is not neutral because in advocacy process, YLKM is functioned as vice consumers visualizing that YLKM is defending consumers importances and supporting consumers. It is unsuitable for mediator function in which mediator is functioned as neutral side. Besides, the advocacy step that is done by YLKM will be incorrect if it is called as mediation advocacy step. In which, mediation step has to create forums first, and then collect the data facts from all sides. The ways, that have been finished by YLKM in advocacy <b>laundry</b> cases, are collecting the data or facts from <b>laundry</b> consumers and <b>laundry</b> producers first and then creating forums. It is unsuitable for lawsuit solution by mediation that’s is considered in (6 chapter Code of Law Number 30 Year 1999) about arbitration and lawsuit solution. Doing the works in socialy for <b>laundry</b> consumers and <b>laundry</b> producers is not effective yet because some of YLKM structures don’t work full time. It influences <b>laundry</b> consumers knowledge and <b>laundry</b> producers knowledge to UUPK and YLKM. Therefore, it will influence the law in societyfor their attitude and their knowledge about UUPK and YLKM. Mean while, the advocacy is not effective yet because there was only one case that could be solved by YLKM since 1999, in which YLKM was being established, up to 2006 whereas <b>laundry</b> is growing up all year. Because of that case any kinds of law problems in <b>laundry</b> will be appeared. YLKM barriers to give the law protection for <b>laundry</b> consumers are internal, in which YLKM side is less pro-active, and still passive in responding <b>laundry</b> consumers complaint because in 2004 and 2005 there were two <b>laundry</b> consumers complained their problems to YLKM, but it did nothing to help them. Another barrier is that each member of YLKM as their priorities. It can be seen from socialy about <b>laundry</b> which is not especially held yet.
