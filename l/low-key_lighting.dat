5|$|The Battle of Shrewsbury {{sequence}} {{has been}} particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan. Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in Battleship Potemkin and the Battle on the Ice sequence in Alexander Nevsky, both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's Henry V used Welles's Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff {{in a way that}} was more influenced by Chimes at Midnight than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of Chimes at Midnight starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that Chimes at Midnights use of wide angle lenses, <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced My Own Private IdahoGus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of Henry IV Parts 1 and 2.|$|E
5|$|The <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> schemes of many classic film noirs are {{associated}} with stark light/dark contrasts and dramatic shadow patterning—a style known as chiaroscuro (a term adopted from Renaissance painting). The shadows of Venetian blinds or banister rods, cast upon an actor, a wall, or an entire set, are an iconic visual in noir and had already become a cliché well before the neo-noir era. Characters' faces may be partially or wholly obscured by darkness—a relative rarity in conventional Hollywood filmmaking. While black-and-white cinematography {{is considered by many}} to be one of the essential attributes of classic noir, the color films Leave Her to Heaven (1945) and Niagara (1953) are routinely included in noir filmographies, while Slightly Scarlet (1956), Party Girl (1958), and Vertigo (1958) are classified as noir by varying numbers of critics.|$|E
50|$|Hoey enjoyed {{working with}} Stanley Cortez {{but was not}} happy with the {{practical}} effects used to create the moving tree monsters:Jack Broder wouldn't hire the guy that we originally had meetings with, a guy who could have done a marvelous job...I wanted the monster trees to look like the other trees, so that there wouldn't be the feeling that they stood out like sore thumbs, which is what those stupid things did. Broder hired some guy who did them for $1.98. When they showed up on the set the first day, I refused to film them, I was so upset. A lot of what happened at the back end of the movie, like the little stumps walking around in the sand, was stuff that Jon Hall shot. I {{had nothing to do with}} it...Yes, the famous Jon Hall from The Hurricane 1937. In later years he had a production company, and apparently he made a deal with Broder and went out and shot more stuff. The only tree that I worked with was the one that had the guy in it manipulating the limbs, which is the one that has the fight with the C-47 pilot. We shot it in pretty <b>low-key</b> <b>light,</b> to try to hide as much of it as we possibly could.|$|R
5000|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air in March 1949 as WBAP-FM on 100.5 FM under the control of Amon G. Carter (later taken over by Carter Publications after Amon's death in 1955). The station moved to 96.3 in 1955. WBAP-FM aired mostly {{classical}} music. After the success of sister station WBAP's [...] "Country Gold" [...] format which began in 1970, it was decided to extend the country music brand to FM, and on January 15, 1973, 96.3 was renamed KSCS [...] "Silver Country Stereo". The initial design behind KSCS was to for it be a country station with beautiful music-style formatics, including playing several songs in a row, <b>low-key</b> announcers, and <b>light</b> commercial loads. A year later, Carter Publications sold KSCS to Capital Cities (taken over by ABC in 1985).|$|R
50|$|In {{his next}} fight, Barkley lost his title via split {{decision}} in a 12 round war with Roberto Durán, {{in a fight}} proclaimed 1989 Fight of the Year by Ring Magazine. Following the defeat to Duran, Barkley took on undefeated Michael Nunn for the IBF and lineal middleweight titles, dropping a close majority decision. He next fought Nigel Benn in a challenge for the WBO middleweight title and was stopped on the three knockdown rule {{at the end of}} a wild first round in which both fighters were hurt. Barkley returned with two <b>low-key</b> wins at <b>light</b> heavyweight in 1991, then defeated Darrin Van Horn to win the IBF super middleweight title in two rounds in January 1992 in Paramount Theatre, New York. Just two months later, he went on to again defeat Hearns and take his WBA light heavyweight title via a twelve round split decision. Barkley vacated the title without defending it, choosing instead to defend his super middleweight title against IBF and lineal middleweight champion James Toney. Barkley reportedly had trouble getting back down to the 168lb weight limit and lost his IBF title via a corner retirement after nine rounds due to severe swelling around both eyes.|$|R
25|$|In 1920, Menichelli {{starred in}} La Storia di Una Donna (The Story of a Woman), her first {{production}} at Rinascimento Film. Highly unusually for the time, {{the story of}} the protagonist is told through an extended flashback. An unconscious woman with gunshot wounds is brought into the city hospital. After conversing with her doctor, a detective finds the woman's diary, which is then used {{to tell the story of}} her life. At the end of the film, the unknown woman dies, having never regained consciousness, and the detective sets off to arrest her killer. The sets and interiors, extravagant in Menichelli's earlier films, were reduced to a bare minimum, and the film used <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> in a similar way to the German Expressionists, creating large areas of shadow within the set.|$|E
500|$|Though {{film noir}} is often {{identified}} with a visual style, unconventional within a Hollywood context, that emphasizes <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> and unbalanced compositions, films commonly identified as noir evidence a variety of visual approaches, including ones that fit comfortably within the Hollywood mainstream. Film noir similarly embraces a variety of genres, from the gangster film to the police procedural to the gothic romance to the social problem picture—any example of which from the 1940s and 1950s, now seen as noir's classical era, {{was likely to be}} described as a [...] "melodrama" [...] at the time.|$|E
500|$|According to Life magazine, [...] "Eastwood's {{style is}} to shoot first and act afterward. He etches his {{characters}} virtually without words. He has developed {{the art of}} underplaying {{to the point that}} anyone around him who so much as flinches looks hammily histrionic." [...] Interviewers Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter note that Eastwood's films are [...] "superbly paced: unhurried; cool; and [...] a strong sense of real time, regardless of the speed of the narrative" [...] while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood's pacing [...] "unrushed and relaxed." [...] Eastwood is fond of <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> and back-lighting to give his movies a [...] "noir-ish" [...] feel.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{style was}} {{described}} by the director as a mix of his own former films which varied from [...] "film-noir in its essence, very dark and very eclectic" [...] to [...] "hand-held", [...] "more visually relaxing". Guy Lodge of Incontention described it as [...] "owing much to film noir in the intricacy of its narrative and the lush, shadow-drenched stylization of its visuals". Wally Hammond, for Time Out London, said its cinematography varies [...] "between atmospheric, noir-esque period evocation and modern widescreen stylings, with excellent use of <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> silhouettes and location". Mark Jenkins of NPR said it had a [...] "classic look" [...] both in visuals and in storytelling; visually, [...] "with widescreen compositions, overhead shots and dramatic contrasts of light and dark", and in its narrative [...] "ome sequences are quick and messy, but others are grand and theatrical." [...] Joe Morgenstern, critic for The Wall Street Journal, said the [...] "pace is deliberate, [...] the tone is pensive, albeit punctuated by occasional violence." ...|$|E
500|$|Designers {{aimed to}} make the younger Batman's outfit look [...] "assembled versus manufactured", pieced {{together}} {{from a number of}} sources. Holmes said, [...] " [...] not something that was made in a factory. He's taken pieces of tech either he's invented, he's fabricated or things from the Wayne facilities, and he has made this costume out of these pieces." [...] To emphasize the mystery and fear instilled by Batman in this early stage of his career, art director Jeremy Price and the design team used silhouettes and film noir-style <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> {{to make the}} character more imposing. The name [...] "Batman" [...] is used sparingly in this game to emphasize his urban-legend status and the lack of understanding of the character. It was suggested that Batman make mistakes because of his inexperience (such as tripping or missing with batarangs), but this idea was discarded as inconsistent with the character. His inexperience was instead personality-based: learning how to be the city's protector and overcoming his obsession with vengeance. In designing Batman's abilities and gadgets, gameplay took precedence over narrative consistency with the previous games; the designers thought that removing features players had already experienced in those games would make playing Arkham Origins feel less empowering.|$|E
2500|$|With its <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> and inventive and arresting angles, {{the work}} of Director of Photography Arthur Edeson {{is one of the}} film's great assets. Unusual camera angles—sometimes low to the ground, {{revealing}} the ceilings of rooms (a technique also used by Orson Welles and his cinematographer Gregg Toland on Citizen Kane)—are utilized to emphasize the nature of the characters and their actions. Some of the most technically striking scenes involve Gutman, especially the scene where he explains the history of the Falcon to Spade, purposely drawing out his story so that the knockout drops he has slipped into Spade's drink will take effect. Meta Wilde, Huston's longtime script supervisor, remarked of this scene: ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Low-key</b> <b>{{lighting}}</b> is a {{style of}} lighting for photography, film or television. It is a necessary element in creating a chiaroscuro effect. Traditional photographic lighting, three-point lighting uses a key light, a fill light and a back light for illumination. <b>Low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> often uses only one key light, optionally controlled with a fill light or a simple reflector.|$|E

5000|$|More recently, {{film critic}} Tom Vick praised the film, writing, [...] "Lang beautifully evokes the Victorian era with his {{customary}} attention to detail. Cinematographer Edward J. Cronjager's <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> fills the Byrnes mansion with appropriately gloomy shadows, and the moonlit river scenes {{make it seem}} as if nature itself is offended by the crime.

50|$|<b>Low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> schemes mark most noirs. The series {{incorporates}} {{the use of}} long dark shadows {{in the tradition of}} chiaroscuro and tenebrism. Film noir is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger's low shot introduction in the first episode. Noir cinematographers favoured this angle because it made characters almost rise from the ground, giving them dramatic girth and symbolic overtones. Other disorientating devices like dutch angles, mirror reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.|$|E
50|$|Contre-jour {{produces}} backlighting of the subject. This effect usually hides details, {{causes a}} stronger contrast between light and dark, creates silhouettes and emphasizes lines and shapes. The sun, or other light source, {{is often seen}} as either a bright spot or as a strong glare behind the subject. Fill light {{may be used to}} illuminate the side of the subject facing toward the camera. Silhouetting occurs when there is a lighting ratio of 16:1 or more; at lower ratios such as 8:1 the result is instead called <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
50|$|Seitz {{retired in}} 1960 and devoted himself to {{photographic}} inventions {{for which he}} held 18 patents.

He was also noted for his innovations with <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> which enhanced the film noir style.A widower, he married screenwriter Marie Boyle in 1934 who raised his daughter Margaret Alice Marhoefer and later gave birth to a son, John Lawrence Seitz.|$|E
5000|$|Critic Dennis Schwartz {{questioned}} the noir {{aspects of the}} film and discussed the cinematography in his review.

Roy Hunt, the 70-year-old cinematographer, who goes back to the earliest days of Hollywood, shot the film using the style of <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> providing dark shots of Monty, contrasted with ghost-like shots of Mary Mitchell (Jacqueline) as she angelically goes to help her troubled husband Arthur." ...|$|E

50|$|For instance, both movies contain {{shots that}} create an {{artificial}} lighting situation such that a character is lit {{in the background}} and walks or runs through dark areas to the foreground, where his arrival triggers, off-screen, a light not on before. The result is so visually dramatic because a character moves, only barely visible, through vast pools of shadow, only to exit the shadow very close to the camera, where his whole face is suddenly completely lit. This use of much more shadow than light, soon one of the main techniques of <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> heavily influenced film noir.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} direct {{intended}} use of chiaroscuro in filmmaking would be Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. When informed that no lens currently had a wide enough aperture to shoot a costume drama set in grand palaces using only candlelight, Kubrick bought and retrofitted a special lens for these purposes: a modified Mitchell BNC camera and a Zeiss lens manufactured for the rigors of space photography, with a maximum aperture of f/.7. The naturally unaugmented lighting situations in the film exemplified low-key, natural lighting in filmwork at its most extreme outside of the Eastern European/Soviet filmmaking tradition (itself exemplified by the harsh <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting</b> style employed by Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein).|$|E

5000|$|The term {{film noir}} (French for [...] "black film" [...] or [...] "dark film") was coined by critic Nino Frank in 1946, but was rarely used by filmmakers, critics or fans until several decades later. The classic era of film noir is usually dated to a {{period between the}} early 1940s and the late 1950s. Typically American crime dramas or {{psychological}} thrillers, films noir {{had a number of}} common themes and plot devices, and many distinctive visual elements.

50|$|The {{fill light}} also shines on the subject, {{but from a}} side angle {{relative}} to the key and is often placed at a lower position than the key (about {{at the level of}} the subject's face). It balances the key by illuminating shaded surfaces, and lessening or eliminating chiaroscuro effects, such as the shadow cast by a person's nose upon the rest of the face. It is usually softer and less bright than the key light (up to half), and more to a flood. Not using a fill at all can result in stark contrasts (due to shadows) across the subject's surface, depending upon the key light's harshness. Sometimes, as in <b>low-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> this is a deliberate effect, but shots intended to look more natural and less stylistic require a fill.|$|E
