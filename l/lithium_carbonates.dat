Both ex situ and in situ microscope FTIR spectroscopy (MFTIRS) in a reflection configuration were employed to investigate interfacial processes of the graphite thin film anodes in lithium-ion batteries. A solid electrolyte interphase layer (SEI layer) was formed on the cycled graphite thin film anode. Ex situ MFTIRS revealed that {{the main components of}} the SEI layer on cycled graphite film anodes in 1 mol L- 1 LiPF 6 /ethylene carbonate + dimethyl carbonate (1 : 1) are alkyl <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates</b> (ROCO 2 Li).

40|$|Composite {{electrolytes}} {{based on}} Gd-doped ceria (from 50 to 95 vol%) and one eutectic mixture of sodium and <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates</b> were prepared by co-firing, {{in order to}} identify the compositional range where both oxide and carbonate-ion transport are balanced, as required for high performance CO 2 separation membranes. Considering the adequacy of this technique, the effects of composition and microstructure on oxide-ion transport were inspected by impedance spectroscopy. The specific features of low temperature impedance spectra allowed access to data on oxide-ion transport based on a hereby suggested equivalent circuit where the individual characteristics of both constituent phases are considered, as well as the variable nature and relevance of interfaces. Combined analysis of all information indicates that the range of interesting compositions for balanced dual ionic conduction corresponds to a ceramic phase content around 85 yo 1 %, for the present microstructural characteristics and a target temperature below 550 degrees C.

40|$|The {{anticipated}} worldwide {{increase in}} biodiesel production {{will result in}} an accumulation of glycerol for which there are insufficient conventional uses. The surplus of this by-product has increased rapidly during the last decade, prompting a search for new glycerol applications. We describe here the synthesis of dissymmetric chlorohydrin esters from symmetric 1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl esters obtained from glycerol. We studied the influence of two solvents: 1, 4 -dioxane and 1 -butanol and two bases: sodium carbonate and 1 -butylimidazole, on the synthesis of dissymmetric chlorohydrin esters. In addition, we studied the influence of other bases (potassium and <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates)</b> in the reaction using 1, 4 -dioxane as the solvent. The highest yield was obtained using 1, 4 -dioxane and sodium carbonate.

US Patent No. 3857920 (1974) describes a method for the recovery of <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonate</b> from slurries resulting from the dispersion of CFA in water. In this method, CFA slurry is treated with carbon dioxide to convert the <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonate</b> to the more soluble lithium bicarbonate.

40|$|Advanced {{metal oxide}} {{electrodes}} in Li-ion batteries usually show reversible capacities exceeding the theoretically expected ones. Despite many studies and tentative interpretations, {{the origin of}} this extra-capacity is not assessed yet. Lithium storage can be increased through different chemical processes developing in the electrodes during charging cycles. The solid electrolyte interface (SEI), formed already during the first lithium uptake, is usually considered to be a passivation layer preventing the oxidation of the electrodes while not participating in the lithium storage process. In this work, we combine high resolution soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy with tunable probing depth and photoemission spectroscopy to obtain profiles of the surface evolution of a well-known prototype conversion-alloying type mixed metal oxide (carbon coated ZnFe 2 O 4) electrode. We show that a partially reversible layer of alkyl <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates</b> is formed (∼ 5 - 7 nm) at the SEI surface when reaching higher Li storage levels. This layer acts as a Li reservoir and seems to give a significant contribution to the extra-capacity of the electrodes.

40|$|While CO 2 storage {{technologies}} via carbon mineralization {{have focused}} on the use of earth-abundant calcium- and magnesium-bearing minerals, there is an emerging interest in the scalable synthesis of alternative carbonates such as lithium carbonate. Lithium carbonate is the carbonated end-product of lithium hydroxide, a highly reactive sorbent for CO 2 capture in spacecraft and submarines. Other emerging applications include tuning the morphology of <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates</b> synthesized from the effluent of treated Li-bearing batteries, which can then be reused in ceramics, glasses, and batteries. In this study, in operando Ultra-Small-Angle, Small-Angle, and Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (USAXS/SAXS/WAXS) measurements were used to link the morphological and crystal structural changes as lithium hydroxide monohydrate is converted to lithium carbonate. The experiments were performed in a flow-through reactor at PCO 2 of 1 atm and at temperatures in the range of 25 – 500 °C. The dehydration of lithium hydroxide monohydrate to form lithium hydroxide occurs in the temperature range of 25 – 150 °C, while the onset of carbonate formation is evident at around 70 °C. A reduction in the nanoparticle size and an increase in the surface area were noted during the dehydration of lithium hydroxide monohydrate. Lithium carbonate formation increases the nanoparticle size and reduces the surface area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCyclic voltammetry, XPS, RBS and AFM {{have been}} {{combined}} {{to study the}} ageing mechanism of Li intercalation in V 2 O 5 thin films prepared by thermal oxidation of vanadium metal. Multi-cycling tests were performed in 1 M LiClO 4 -PC in the potential range E epsilon [3. 8, 2. 8 V] versus Li/Li+, corresponding to the alpha-to-delta phase transition. XPS and AFM were performed using direct anaerobic and anhydrous transfer. Capacity fading remains inferior to 20 % during similar to 2500 cycles. XPS shows slight modifications of the oxide composition with a V 4 + concentration increasing from similar to 5 % prior to cycling to similar to 16 - 27 % after cycling, due to Li trapped in the oxide film and {{to the loss of}} V 2 O 5 active material. The presence of lithium carbonate and lithium-alkyl carbonate species evidences the formation of the so-called SEI layer. AFM evidences the loss of crystalline material by grain exfoliation from the outer V 2 O 5 layer of the oxide film. By further exfoliation, the inner VO 2 layer of the oxide film is reached and pits are formed, occupying similar to 9 - 13 % of the surface. This de-cohesion at grain boundaries is attributed to the strain generated by repeated lattice distortions. After 3300 cycles, the disappearance of <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> whereas Li-alkyl carbonates and/or Li-alkoxides remain on the surface, indicates the dissolution and/or conversion of the SEI layer. After 4500 cycles, the oxide film became very labile and could be stripped away by rinsing to reveal the vanadium metal substrate. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{the use of the}} Molten Salt Destruction (MSD) Process for destroying explosives, liquid gun propellant, and explosives-contaminated materials on a 1. 5 kg of explosive/hr bench- scale unit (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In our recently constructed 5 kg/hr pilot- scale unit we have also demonstrated the destruction of a liquid gun propellant and simulated wastes containing HMX (octogen). MSD converts the organic constituents of the waste into non-hazardous substances such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water. Any inorganic constituents of the waste, such as metallic particles, are retained in the molten salt. The destruction of energetic materials waste is accomplished by introducing it, together with air, into a vessel containing molten salt (a eutectic mixture of sodium, potassium, and <b>lithium</b> <b>carbonates).</b> The following pure explosives have been destroyed in our bench-scale experimental unit located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory`s (LLNL) High Explosives Applications Facility (HEAF) : ammonium picrate, HMX, K- 6 (keto-RDX), NQ, NTO, PETN, RDX, TATB, and TNT. In addition, the following compositions were also destroyed: Comp B, LX- IO, LX- 1 6, LX- 17, PBX- 9404, and XM 46 (liquid gun propellant). In this 1. 5 kg/hr bench-scale unit, the fractions of carbon converted to CO and of chemically bound nitrogen converted to NO{sub x} were found to be well below 1 %. In addition to destroying explosive powders and compositions we have also destroyed materials that are typical of residues which result from explosives operations. These include shavings from machined pressed parts of plastic-bonded explosives and sump waste containing both explosives and non-explosive debris. Based on the process data obtained on the bench-scale unit we designed and constructed a next-generation 5 kg/hr pilot-scale unit, incorporating LLNL`s advanced chimney design.
