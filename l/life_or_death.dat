5|$|Gregory also {{instructed}} Augustine {{on other}} matters. Temples {{were to be}} consecrated for Christian use, and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death.</b> They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman St Sixtus.|$|E
5|$|In article {{published}} by the Guardian newspaper, the community importance of pirate radio was highlighted. Sanjae a young girl {{at the age of}} 3 was told she had just weeks to live due to a rare lung tissue disease. It would require at least £50.000 to send Sanjae to the US to have a <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death</b> operation. A weekly popular talk show entitled the 'Nubian Forum talk show' which took place on the now deceased radio station, Power Jam FM raised awareness and began raising money. Within days two other pirate radio stations, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM joined forces to help; both of which helped raise thousands of pounds each. With the exception of the Hackney Gazette, no other mainstream media was interested. It is therefore argued that {{had it not been for}} Power Jam FM, Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, Sanjae would have died.|$|E

25|$|Any {{advance warning}} for {{the enemy of}} the {{approaching}} helicopters, and the anticipated reactions caused by surprise and confusion, were decisive factors in the coming engagement.

25|$|Modern smog, {{as found}} {{for example in}} Los Angeles, {{is a type of}} air {{pollution}} derived from vehicular emission from internal combustion engines and industrial fumes that react in the atmosphere with sunlight to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. In certain other cities, such as Delhi, smog severity is often aggravated by stubble burning in neighboring agricultural areas. The atmospheric pollution levels of Los Angeles, Beijing, Delhi, Lahore, Mexico City, Tehran and other cities are increased by inversion that traps pollution close to the ground. It is usually highly toxic to humans and can cause severe sickness, shortened <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
25|$|Section 3 bars Congress from {{changing}} or modifying Federal law on treason {{by simple}} majority statute. Treason is also defined in this section. It's not enough merely {{to think a}} treasonous thought, {{there must be an}} overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death</b> proposition. However, Congress does provide for other less subversive crimes and punishments such as conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Eyes are {{internal}} {{liberties of}} a group of stones that, like external liberties, prevent the group's capture, but unlike external liberties are much harder for an opponent to fill due to the only way to kill a group with an eye is to fill all of its liberties before calling atari. The presence or absence of eyes in a group determine <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death</b> of that group. A group with no eyes, or only one eye, will die unless its owner can develop them. Conversely, a group with two or more eyes will live. An opponent cannot capture such a group because it is impossible to remove all liberties of the group by playing one stone, without violating the suicide rule.|$|E

Saving contracts and receipts thus assumed a vital importance in Babylon - in fact it could literally be a matter of <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death.</b> A buyer had to be sure of the seller's title. If he bought (or received on deposit) property from even a minor or a slave without witnessing contracts, he would be executed as a thief (§7). If purchased goods were stolen and the rightful owner reclaimed them, he had to prove his purchase by producing the seller and the deed of sale, or witnesses to it; otherwise, he would be adjudged a thief and die. If he proved his purchase, he had to give up the property but could pursue a remedy against the seller or, if the seller had died, could reclaim fivefold from his estate.|$|E

[...] Speaking in Ahmedabad, Jinnah echoed this, [...] "Pakistan {{is a matter of}} <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death</b> for us." [...] In the December 1945 elections for the Constituent Assembly of India, the League won every seat reserved for Muslims. In the provincial elections in January 1946, the League took 75% of the Muslim vote, an increase from 4.4% in 1937. According to his biographer Bolitho, [...] "This was Jinnah's glorious hour: his arduous political campaigns, his robust beliefs and claims, were at last justified." [...] Wolpert wrote that the League election showing [...] "appeared to prove the universal appeal of Pakistan among Muslims of the subcontinent". The Congress dominated the central assembly nevertheless, though it lost four seats from its previous strength. During this time Muhammad Iqbal introduced Jinnah to Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, whom Jinnah appointed to edit a magazine, Tolu-e-Islam, to propagate the idea of a separate Muslim state.|$|E

Hemingway scholars, such as Benson, rank [...] "Indian Camp" [...] as one of Hemingway's [...] "greatest short stories," [...] a story that is described as [...] "best known", [...] "violent" [...] and [...] "dramatic". In 1992, Frederick Busch wrote in The New York Times that Hemingway had gone out of fashion. While his antisemitism, racism, violence, and attitudes toward women and homosexuals made him objectionable by current standards, he turned violence into art unlike any other American writer of his time by showing that [...] "the making of art is a matter of <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death,</b> no less". Busch believes Hemingway's characters either faced life or chose death, a choice shown most starkly in [...] "Indian Camp".

500|$|This commandment demands {{respect for}} human life and is more {{accurately}} translated as [...] "thou shalt not murder." [...] Indeed, killing may, under limited circumstances, be justified within Catholicism. Jesus expanded it to prohibit unjust anger, hatred and vengeance, and to require Christians to love their enemies. The basis of all Catholic teaching about the fifth commandment is the sanctity of life ethic, which Kreeft argues is philosophically opposed {{to the quality of}} life ethic, a philosophy which he characterizes as introduced by a book entitled Die Freigabe der Vernichtung des Lebensunwerten Lebens (The Permission to Destroy Life Unworthy of Life) (see Life unworthy of life) and which he asserts was the [...] "first to win public acceptance... by German doctors before World War II—the basis and beginning of Nazi medical practices." [...] This interpretation is supported by modern medical journals that discuss the dilemma posed by these opposing philosophies to physicians who must make <b>life</b> <b>or</b> <b>death</b> decisions. Some bioethicists characterize the use of the [...] "Nazi analogy" [...] as inappropriate when applied to quality of life decisions; Arthur Caplan called this rhetoric [...] "odiously wrong".
