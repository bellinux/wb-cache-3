2500|$|Cadastral {{comes from}} the French word which refers to the {{register}} of lands. The [...] "cadastral fabric" [...] of B.C. refers to property boundaries, <b>survey</b> <b>monuments,</b> <b>legal</b> documents, maps, and regulations which are required {{to make the system}} work. Cadastral <b>legal</b> <b>surveys</b> involve the measurement, placement, title descriptions and/or re-establishment of legal boundaries on land (at, above, or below the surface), water, and air space. This scope of work includes leases, mineral claims, and the determination of any approved physical right of tenure, occupation, and title. Many BCLSs are also consulted in matters such as land use applications, approvals, and re-zonings.|$|R
40|$|<b>Survey</b> <b>monuments</b> are {{physical}} markers {{indicating the}} location of land boundary corners, geodetic control points, or local control points. They enable a surveyor to relate narrative boundary descriptions or improvements, and boundaries drawn {{on a set of}} plans to the actual location on the ground. Why Are <b>Survey</b> <b>Monuments</b> Important? All real properties, such as parcels, lots, rights-of-way, and easements can only be located or staked on the ground by starting from a monument. Legal descriptions of the horizontal and vertical locations of properties and structures all require {{the location of}} a monument as their beginning point of reference. The accuracy and relevancy of the City’s Geographic Information System (GIS) maps are also based on <b>survey</b> <b>monuments.</b> The network of <b>survey</b> <b>monuments</b> protects and delineates public and private property, and is critical to the enforcement and enjoyment of real property rights. <b>Survey</b> <b>monuments</b> are important assets belonging to the City and its citizens, and are protected and maintained as such. How to Locate or Identify a <b>Survey</b> <b>Monument?</b> Most <b>Survey</b> <b>Monument</b> locations {{can be found in the}} City’s GIS system and on the City’s Quarter Section Maps (also called Engineering Maps). The City’s Survey Field Books can also help determine monument locations. These books may show how a monument was set, and what condition it was in when it was last seen. The books may also where there may be ties to a monument, if the monument has been buried or lost. <b>Survey</b> <b>Monuments</b> used for horizontal location are typically found in the City’s Right of Way (ROW), typically in the center of the ROW, and most often at intersections.

5000|$|The term [...] "Tallahassee meridian" [...] is also loosely used to {{describe}} the <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> (see <b>survey</b> marker) located at the intersection of these lines of longitude and latitude (the longitude line being the [...] "Tallahassee meridian" [...] and the latitude line being the [...] "Tallahassee Parallel" [...] or “Tallahassee Base Line”). This <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> serves as the initial point for U.S. government surveys in the state of Florida. The 6 mile × 6 mile townships originate from here and are numbered by township (see survey township) depending upon whether they are north or south of this point, and are numbered by [...] "range" [...] depending upon whether they are east or west of this point. Thus, Township 3 South Range 26 East would extend from approximately 12 to 18 miles South of the monument, and would be positioned from approximately 150 to 156 miles East of the monument. Each township/range is then divided into 36 sections of 1 mile by 1 mile each.|$|R

40|$|The International Polar Year and the {{proposed}} development of the Mackenzie Delta gas reserves will focus attention on Arctic observation in the coming years. Methods of geodetic observation will be used alongside other scientific experiments {{to determine the effects}} of man-made and global warming changes to the environment, which will have impacts on civil infrastructure, and geological and ecological conditions. Changes in elevation are indicative of subsidence due to gas extraction, deepening of the permafrost active layer, the thawing of ground ice, and changes in the eco-system. The challenges of measuring elevation change in such a remote area, where there are few naturally stable areas or artificial benchmarks such as tide gauges, and where observations utilising conventional methods are hampered by the complex hydrol-ogy in the Mackenzie Delta, ensure the pre-eminence of global positioning in this area. Differential GPS (DGPS) levelling has its own unique challenges at 70 º North, such as degraded satellite geometry and increased ionospheric effects. In addition, the full error budget of a DGPS method includes the signal of the <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> in the permafrost environment, which is subject to seasonal heave and settlement. This paper reports on two studies that, combined, indicate the accuracy that can be expected using DGPS levelling onto <b>survey</b> <b>monuments</b> in permafrost at this latitude.
