5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies were made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day.

However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from <b>local</b> <b>agencies.</b> Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. This {{is the result of}} the region’s oil and gas industry being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by <b>local</b> <b>agencies.</b> Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E

40|$|After a project’s {{location}} and design have been approved, work begins {{on the final}} version of its plans, specifications, and cost estimates (PS&E).

PS&E approval is done by the <b>local</b> <b>agency</b> as identified in the Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) / <b>Local</b> <b>Agency</b> Certification Acceptance (CA) Agreement. The approving authority identified on the CA Agreement must approve the plans and specifications, and a professional engineer licensed in the state of Montana must seal and date the plans and specifications. The <b>local</b> <b>agency</b> should use the Project Development Checklist (Chapter 4, Developing Projects Using <b>Local</b> <b>Agency</b> Guidelines) to check for completeness of the contract plans prior to approving them. The <b>local</b> <b>agency</b> should have a commitment file, when applicable, containing a summary of commitments made during project development. The file should be reviewed to ensure that the commitments are incorporated in the PS&E. These commitments typically involve right-of-way or environmental considerations (see Appendix 16. 74 for list of possible required permits). A copy of the bid documents should be furnished to MDT CTEP Engineer prior to advertisement for a check of completeness. Any <b>local</b> <b>agency</b> project with work on state routes shall obtain PS&E approval from MDT CTEP Engineer.
