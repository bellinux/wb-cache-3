2500|$|In the Western world, {{women are}} {{generally}} taught to sit or squat while urinating. Many therefore {{do not know}} how – or even that it is possible – for a woman to aim her urine stream as would be required to use a male urinal. Thus, several different types of urinal have been designed for women that do not require the user to aim her urine stream. Additionally, a few urinal designs are marketed as unisex. They are generally more conventional designs, but perhaps with a wider bowl and <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> height. A typical female user could thus approach such a urinal squatting backwards over it without necessarily trying to aim her stream.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{stint as}} Platoon Leader and the {{subsequent}} XO for H Co, Baker began working with the Armor and Engineering Board to draft blueprints of a revolutionary new prototype rack. The advantages of the rack's unique [...] "quick disconnect" [...] design featured the use of standard quick disconnect pins already in use as fasteners on the tank's armored skirts. These pins enabled the easy removal of the bustle rack should it become damaged during combat or training operations. Removing the handful of <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> pins allowed the rack to be [...] "pivoted" [...] onto the blowout panels located on top and {{to the rear of}} the turret. Pivoting the rack eliminated interference between the rack and the back deck panel, providing unobstructed access to the tank's power plant during maintenance operations. The rack became widely known around the Army's Armor community as [...] "The Baker Bustle". The rack quickly gained popularity among M1 tankers and the fielded design, though slightly modified by General Dynamics Land Systems, is still the rack seen on M1A1 tanks in combat today, though as you can see from the inset photo, some units have modified their M1's with an extended framework added to the standard bustle rack for additional stowage capacity.

5000|$|An {{induction}} lamp features extremely long lamp life (100,000 hours), energy efficiency, high {{color rendering}} index, and a color temperature close to incandescent lights. The life of induction (also known as electrodeless fluorescent) lamps is negatively affected by heat, particularly {{as the temperature}} exceeds 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). Since temperatures in this range commonly occur during early night hours in the summer {{in much of the}} US, induction lamp applications have not extended beyond test and demonstration projects for street lighting. The larger size of the induction lamps also inhibits the effective control of the light they emit, limiting their use to <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> applications. [...] In 2009, PSEG in New Jersey began using induction lighting from US Lighting Tech, Inc (Irvine, CA) to replace very old and even some pre-2008 mercury vapor lights, and have had success in their reliability and output of the fixtures. Unfortunately, some failed induction lights were spot replaced with the HPS lights that were being removed to begin with and many new installs, PSEG is still using HPS. An updated design of the induction lights is now being used and these seem more reliable and brighter than the original design. Beginning in September 2011 the City of San Diego, CA will replace some 35,000 street lights with induction lamps costing $16,000,000.00. In Mexico, the city of Linares and Acapulco also have begun the replacement of 6,500 and 42,000 street lights with induction lamps from Amko SOLARA Lighting (Taipei, Taiwan), selected for their smart controls, since October 2011. A portion of these street lights from Amko will feature smart grid compatibility to allow the lights to be remotely monitored and controlled via the Internet.|$|E

50|$|The tiltmeters are {{horizontal}} pendulums {{installed by}} the Geodesist Antonio Marussi in 1959. The instruments {{are sensitive to}} deviations of the vertical, to rotations and shearing of the cave. Some movements are aperiodic, others regular, as the Earth Tides caused by the lunar and solar gravitational field. The pendulums measure a distance of 95 m between {{the upper and lower}} mountings, which contributes {{to the fact that the}} instruments detect tectonic movements with high precision and are relatively immune to some of the noise which affects smaller instruments. The pendulum beam is suspended horizontally by two steel wires, an upper one fixed to the roof of the cave, the lower one fixed to the floor. The pendulum beam rotates in the horizontal plane around a virtual near-to-vertical axis that passes through the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> points. The Earth crust (the outer brittle layer of our planet, on average 35 km thick in continental areas) moves up and down by ten centimeters during the time of 12 and 24 hours due to the attraction of Moon and Sun, and is accompanied by a local tilting of some parts in a billion of radians.The movements of the pendulums has contributed to identify the free oscillations of the Earth, and to show that the secular term tilting of the cave is towards North-West. The marine tides of the Adriatic have a loading effect in the cave, as have also the underground carstic floods of the river Timavo that disappears at the Skocjanske Cave in Slovenia. The Grotta Gigante tiltmeters are the only existing instruments to have recorded four out of five greatest earthquakes in the recent 50 years, which are the earthquakes of Chile 1960 (the greatest earthquake ever instrumentally recorded) and Chile 2010 (the fifth in the scale of recorded worldwide mega-events) the tsunami-generating event of the Sumatra-Andaman islands of 2004 (third greatest event) and the event of Japan 2011 (fourth greatest event), allowing an absolute-amplitude comparison between these events.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical study of active vibration isolation on a two {{degree of freedom}} system. The system consists of two lumped masses connected by a coupling spring. Both masses are also attached to a firm reference base by a mounting spring. The lower mass is excited by a point force. A reactive control force actuator is used between the two masses in parallel with the coupling spring. Both masses are equipped with an absolute velocity sensor. The two sensors and the actuator are used to implement velocity feedback control loops to actively isolate the upper mass from the vibrations of the lower mass over {{a broad range of}} frequencies. The primary concern of the study is to determine what type of velocity feedback configuration is suitable with respect to the five parameters that characterise the system (the three spring stiffnesses and the two masses). It is shown analytically that if the ratio of the <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> spring stiffness to the lower mass is lar ger than the ratio of the upper mounting spring stiffness to the upper mass (supercritical system), feeding back the absolute upper mass velocity to the reactive force actuator results in an unconditionally stable feedback loop and the vibration isolation objective can be fully achieved without an overshot at higher frequencies. In contrast, if the ratio of the <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> spring stiffness to the lower mass is smaller than the ratio of the upper mounting spring stiffness to the upper mass (subcritical system), the upper mass velocity feedback is conditionally stable and the vibration isolation objective cannot be accomplished in a broad frequency band. For subcritical systems a blended velocity feedback is proposed to stabilise the loop and to improve the broad-band vibration isolation effect. A simple inequality is introduced to derive the combinations between the two error velocities that guarantee unconditionally stable feedback loops...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} study of active vibration isolation on a two {{degree of freedom}} system is presented. The system consists of two lumped masses connected by a coupling spring. Either mass is also attached to a firm reference base by a mounting spring. The vibrations of the lower mass are excited by a point force and transmitted to the upper mass via the coupling spring. A reactive control force actuator is used between the two masses in parallel with the coupling spring. Either mass is equipped with an absolute velocity sensor. The two sensors and the actuator are used to implement velocity feedback control loops to actively isolate the upper mass form the vibrations of the lower mass over {{a broad range of}} frequencies. The primary concern of the study is to determine what type of velocity feedback is suitable with respect to the five system parameters (the three spring stiffnesses and the two masses). It is shown analytically that there are two groups of passive systems; supercritical and subcritical. Supercritical systems are characterised by the ratio of the upper mass to the lower mass being larger than the ratio of the upper mounting spring stiffness to the <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> spring stiffness. With supercritical systems, feeding back the absolute upper mass velocity to the reactive force actuator results in an unconditionally stable feedback loop. The vibration isolation objective can be fully achieved without an overshot at higher frequencies. In contrast, if the ratio of the upper mass to the lower mass is smaller than the ratio of the upper mounting spring stiffness to the <b>lower</b> <b>mounting</b> spring stiffness, the system is subcritical. With subcritical systems the upper mass velocity feedback is conditionally stable and the vibration isolation objective can not be accomplished in a broad frequency band. For subcritical systems a blended velocity feedback is proposed. The error velocity signal is obtained by subtracting weighted outputs of the two sensors. It is shown that the stability and the performance of the active vibration isolation greatly depend upon the velocity weighting factor used. It is shown that the use of an appropriate velocity weighting factor for subcritical systems can significantly improve the vibration isolation performance with reference to the passive isolation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a refined geologic map and stratigraphy for <b>lower</b> <b>Mount</b> Sharp using coordinated analyses of new spectral, thermophysical, and morphologic orbital data products. The Mount Sharp group consists of seven relatively planar units delineated by differences in texture, mineralogy, and thermophysical properties. These units are (1 – 3) three spatially adjacent units in the Murray formation which contain a variety of secondary phases and are distinguishable by thermal inertia and albedo differences, (4) a phyllosilicate-bearing unit, (5) a hematite-capped ridge unit, (6) a unit associated with material having a strongly sloped spectral signature at visible near-infrared wavelengths, and (7) a layered sulfate unit. The Siccar Point group consists of the Stimson formation and two additional units that unconformably overlie the Mount Sharp group. All Siccar Point group units are distinguished by higher thermal inertia values and record a period of substantial deposition and exhumation that followed the deposition and exhumation of the Mount Sharp group. Several spatially extensive silica deposits associated with veins and fractures show that late-stage silica enrichment within <b>lower</b> <b>Mount</b> Sharp was pervasive. At least two laterally extensive hematitic deposits are present at different stratigraphic intervals, and both are geometrically conformable with <b>lower</b> <b>Mount</b> Sharp strata.
