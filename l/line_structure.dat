40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{large-scale}} indoor model test with water pressure is conducted {{in order to}} investigate the stress and deformation properties of reinforced concrete <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> with circular cross-sections. After <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> cracks, the stress and deformation of reinforcement in <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> tend to decrease. Although the interaction force between <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> and surrounding rock increases {{with the increase of}} water pressure, but the ratio of interaction force and water pressure decreases, which reveals that the load-bearing capacity of <b>lining</b> <b>structures</b> decreases, and surrounding rock gradually performs as the primary load-bearing body. The internal water pressure carried by <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> is about 20 %~ 40 % of water pressure before cracking and less than 30 % after cracking. Test results illustrate that surrounding rock and inner water seepage significantly influence the stress and deformation properties of <b>lining</b> <b>structure,</b> and inner water seepage is the main reason for the reduction of load-bearing capacity of <b>lining</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Gerhard Kubik {{notes that}} with the {{exception}} of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex polyrhythms, and there was a [...] "very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns (key patterns) in virtually all early-twentieth-century African American music [...] [...] [...] only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called 'stomp' patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function {{in the same way as}} African time lines." [...] In the late 1940s this changed somewhat when the two-celled time <b>line</b> <b>structure</b> was brought into the blues. New Orleans musicians such as Bartholomew and Longhair incorporated Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as [...] "Carnival Day," [...] (Bartholomew 1949) and [...] "Mardi Gras In New Orleans" [...] (Longhair 1949). While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.|$|E

Scattering of SH wave by {{an elastic}} half {{space with a}} <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> and a crack in any {{position}} and direction is studied with Green’s function, complex function and multi-polar coordinate method. First, a suitable Green’s function is constructed, which is a fundamental solution to the displacement field for the elastic space possessing circular <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> while bearing out-of-plane harmonic line source load at arbitrary point. Then a crack in any position and direction is constructed by means of crack-division in half space. Finally the displacement field and stress field are established {{in the case of}} coexistence of circular <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> and crack, and the expression of dynamic stress intensity factor (DSIF) at the tip of crack is given. According to numerical examples, the influences of different parameters on DSIF are discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the dynamic}} damage {{constitutive}} model of concrete material and seismic rock-lining structure interaction analysis method, the seismic response of <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> in large underground powerhouse is studied in this paper. In order to describe strain rate dependence and fatigue damage of concrete material under cyclic loading, a dynamic constitutive model for concrete lining considering tension and shear anisotropic damage is presented, {{and the evolution}} equations of damage variables are derived. The proposed model is of simple form and can be programmed into finite element procedure easily. In order to describe seismic interaction characteristics of the surrounding rock and lining, an explicit dynamic contact analysis method considering bond and damage characteristics of contact face between the surrounding rock and lining is proposed, and this method can integrate directly without iteration. The proposed method is applied to seismic stability calculation of Yingxiuwan Underground Powerhouse, results reveal that the amplitude and duration of input seismic wave determine the damage degree of <b>lining</b> <b>structure,</b> the damage zone of <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> is mainly distributed in its arch, and the contact face damage has great influence on {{the stability of the}} <b>lining</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

30|$|Assembled lining is {{the primary}} <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> type for {{domestic}} and foreign shield tunnel construction. Driven by the requirements of earthquake resistance, line profile modifications, and corrosion resistance, double-layer lining has been adopted. It was applied early in Japan in high-speed railway tunnels, urban arterial road tunnels, metro tunnels, and water transfer tunnels [24]. Double-layer lining will soon be used in China because the diameter and buried depth of underwater highway tunnels continue to increase. Consequently, determining when to choose double-layer lining and the forces between the assembled lining and inner lining must be carefully studied. A new kind of <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> between the single lining and double-layer lining is proposed {{to deal with the}} riverbed scouring problem posed by river-crossing highway shield tunnels in the Yangzi River region, which has high water pressure and permeable stratum [46]. If this new <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> can reduce riverbed scouring, then further research and performance measurement will be needed to verify its long-term stability and suitability.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of Bolt anchored catenary on tunnel lining under the aerodynamic load, the paper takes a tunnel on Qinhuangdao -Shenyang Railway as an example. The force of <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> is studied using numerical simulation based on the research and analysis of relevant theory and model test results. Firstly, the variation of the air pressure in the tunnel was calculated caused by the train when it is passing through the tunnel at different speeds (200 ~ 400 km/h). Then, by ANSYS the aerodynamic load calculated by FLUENT {{is applied to the}} simplified catenary suspension. The main results are as follows: 1. The maximum normal stress of tunnel lining with train speed according to the power law, and maximum normal stress with train speed according to quadratic function relation; 2. Tunnel lining is subjected to push-pull stress because the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic loads change with the advance of the train; 3. The <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> is mainly subjected to the stress of the Y direction, and this stress should not be neglected when design the structure of tunnel secondary lining. 4. The load spectrum of the <b>lining</b> <b>structure</b> under different train speed is given. The research results of this paper are of great significance to the optimization design of tunnel <b>lining</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R
