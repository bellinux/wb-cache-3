They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E
25|$|James Mensch {{provided}} {{an understanding of}} imagining the experiences of others (what can also be called empathic envisioning) and what that might look <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> talked about literary imagination humans: the capacity of humans to imagine the experiences of characters in novels. Mensch explained that human beings' embodiment provides them with the capacity to imagine these experiences and then relate to them through empathy. For Mensch, people are only capable of having experiences because of and through their body. Humans (Dasein) experience life, others, the world, etc. via their bodies which can taste, smell, hear, feel, and see. More to the point, their bodies encapsulate our various mental faculties required for processing and retaining those experiences. This means human experiences are experiences of the body. Relating to others then is when two bodies experience one another: they inter-relate. Because humans (Dasein) hold their bodily experiences in their memory, {{they are able to}} use our literary imagination to envision the experiences of characters in novels.|$|E

[...] In June 1980, the posthumous single [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart" [...] was released, which hit number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart. In July 1980, Closer was released; subsequently peaking at number six on the UK Albums Chart.

2500|$|The Bocksten Man (...) is {{the remains}} of a medieval man's body found in a bog in Varberg Municipality, Sweden. It is one of the best-preserved finds in Europe from that era and is {{exhibited}} at the Varberg County Museum. The man had been killed and impaled to the bottom of a lake which later became a bog. The bog where the body was found lies in Rolfstorp about [...] east of Varberg on the west coast of Sweden, close to the most important medieval road in the area: the Via Regia.

Wang {{was the only person}} capable of controlling Puyi; once, Puyi decided to [...] "reward" [...] a eunuch for a well done puppet show by having a cake baked for him with iron filings in it, as Puyi said [...] "I want to see what he looks <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> eats it". With much difficulty, Wang talked Puyi out of this plan.|$|E

2500|$|George's {{occasional}} impulsiveness {{often gets}} him into trouble, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> flees a burning kitchen, knocking over several children {{and an old}} woman in the process, so he could escape first during his girlfriend's son's birthday party in [...] "The Fire". However, there are moments where George exhibits remarkable courage, but usually accidentally and often in support of inane lies he'd rather not confess to. For instance, in [...] "The Marine Biologist", {{he goes into the}} sea alone to save a beached whale because his date, a woman on whom he had a crush in college, thinks he's a marine biologist and even tells her the truth about his occupation after he saves the day. However, this causes her to reject him immediately, and he's forced to take the bus home.|$|E
2500|$|Combs and his son, Ghent, {{were arrested}} in 1995 after a police raid on his house {{produced}} a cannabis plant as well as [...] of processed marijuana. Combs accused police of planting evidence to support their charge and initially denied that he had ever used marijuana. He later admitted to using the drug to help with insomnia, but maintained he had only been using it since retiring from the Supreme Court in 1993. Reporters later uncovered testimony from Combs' psychiatrist in a 1992 civil case that Combs had told him after a 1989 motorcycle accident that he used marijuana for insomnia. Combs later blamed his inconsistency on his Alzheimer's-like memory disorder that {{made it difficult for}} him to remember details <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> began smoking marijuana. Charges against Combs were dismissed on the condition that he have no further legal issues with drugs for two years.|$|E

Dr. Vink." [...] He would also get his name mispronounced, usually something like [...] "Dr. Fink?" [...] When this happened, he would respond [...] "Vink. With a va-va-va!" [...] Often, the protagonist would call him a [...] "nutbag" [...] behind his back, assuming he could not hear him, only to have him reply later, [...] "...and I am not a nutbag." [...] Unlike Sardo whose character was set in a magic shop, Dr. Vink had many 'unique endeavors' as he called them, for his stories. These ranged from living deep in the woods conducting strange nature experiments, being a retired filmmaker, owning his own restaurant as head chef and lastly a barbershop. His activities were usually villainous and designed to put the characters in peril and allow him the last laugh. However, in his last appearance, [...] "The Tale of Cutter's Treasure" [...] (which was told by both Frank and Gary), he allied himself with Sardo and the main characters without his usual maliciousness. He appeared in Frank's stories. Aron Tager also played the carnival worker who {{stands in front of}} the Funhouse and invites people to go inside in the episode [...] "The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the Doctor next {{encounters}} River, in [...] "The Husbands of River Song" [...] (2015), as the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi), {{she does}} not initially recognise him and {{he is able to}} learn more about what she is <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is not around. The Doctor accompanies River (from her perspective, shortly after [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan") on a scheme to obtain a rare diamond. He learns that in addition to him, River has had several spouses, both male and female, and is not above ruthless behaviour as she goes about her work. He also discovers that she truly loves him, but that she also genuinely believes that he does not love her back. She feels that the Doctor is above such petty emotions as love, and that he would never willingly jeopardise himself simply to help her. River ultimately discovers that the man she's been having this adventure with is actually the Doctor, with a new face she doesn't have a record of, thinking he only had 12 regenerations and that she'd already seen his last one. The pair later crash-land on the planet Darillium, where River had told the Doctor in [...] "Forest of the Dead" [...] that they would have their last night together. He uses time travel to ensure a perfect date, gifts her the sonic screwdriver that she had in [...] "Silence in the Library", and comforts her by revealing that the nights on Darillium last [...] "24 years", giving River a happy life spent with the Doctor before her impending death in the Library.|$|E
2500|$|Rohan Singh {{is played}} by Murtuza Kutianawala. He is the eldest Singh sibling. He and Dolly often fight, {{although}} they care about each other, and he usually gets along well with his younger brother, Sunny. He often appears awkward, somewhat careless, and childish, but on numerous occasions {{has been known to}} be resourceful, creative, and intelligent. He has also been shown to be a good cook, and Avatar once tricked Himani (who isn't a very good cook) into working later so that Rohan would cook. He and his best friend Popi have their own band. Rohan occasionally uses his younger sister Nikki for his personal gain, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> uses her to make big tips while working for Kukkad Nukkad by saying that his mother was in the hospital when she actually worked there (customers just assumed she was ill). He dated Dolly's friend Maya, who like him is a scatterbrain, but they broke up in Rohan in the City, when Maya had to move to Mumbai because of her father's new job. He was originally intended to be named Rohan Singh, but Avatar was nervous as he was writing on his birth certificate, resulting in the legal name of [...] "Rohini Singh". Despite Avatar trying to correct this in the season two episode Can You Keep a Secret?, he accidentally changed the intended name to [...] "Rona Ping". In season three, Rohan moves into an apartment shared with Popi, but is still in the Singh house a lot. In Good Luck Charlie, Rohan is the equivalent of PJ Duncan who {{is played by}} Jason Dolley.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{listening}} {{session in}} New York City, J. Cole previewed the album to a select few, including Insanul Ahmed of Complex. At the listening session {{it was revealed}} the song [...] "In the Morning" [...] featuring Drake off his Friday Night Lights mixtape would appear on the album. Cole defended this decision saying, he felt the song never got the push it deserved, and {{he wanted it to}} reach more people. Another song that was previously released on another project The Warm Up, was [...] "Lights Please". Cole explained this song was the track that won over his manager Mark Pitt and Jay-Z. The interlude, was revealed to be a quick skit where Cole talks about the day he found out Jay-Z wanted to sign him. As soon as Cole got the good news he was pulled over and ended up spending the night in jail for parking violations. Even so, he explains that it was [...] "the easiest time ever" [...] because he knew success was coming around the corner. The track [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] opens with a sample from the documentary, Backstage where Jay-Z is talking about finding that one great artist that he'll sign. [...] "Dollar and a Dream III" [...] was revealed, produced by Kyle Justice, the third in the [...] "Dollar and a Dream series" [...] following the two from his first two mixtapes. In an interview with VIBE Cole admitted that he originally wanted Jay-Z to appear on the song [...] "God's Gift" [...] rather than [...] "Mr. Nice Watch." [...] He continued saying, [...] "Everything worked out, I'm a true believer that everything happens for a reason. <b>Like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> did that, it made way more sense than my song. It's a bigger record, a more universal record. Being the hip-hop nerd that I am, I would have loved to hear Jay-Z on that [...] beat. But really, I'm fine on that song alone." [...] J. Cole released [...] "Mr. Nice Watch" [...] himself through the internet, for promotional purposes, on September 14, 2011. The song contains elements of Dubstep and Electronica. Two days before the album's release, J. Cole released a music video for the bonus track, [...] "Daddy's Little Girl". [...] On October 25, J. Cole released a three-year-old never-before seen music video for the track, [...] "Lost Ones".|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always Get Lucky with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
