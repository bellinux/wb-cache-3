In the market climate of today more and more companies are listed on the stock exchange and the business press is constantly reporting about highly increasing stock values. This validates the current interest of the subject and the importance of finding the underlying reasons of the decisions made. Interviews have been conducted with three newly listed companies, who all had a high initial price increase, and with their underwriters. Thanks to the underwriters {{we have been able to}} triangulate the empirical data provided by the companies. Therefore we could also put the motives and reasoning’s of the company management into words. What the study has shown is that founders have the ambition to develop the company further, rather than to conduct the IPO in order to cash out from the business as suggested in the theories. The choices they make in the form of <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> <b>agreements,</b> pre-IPO call options and rights offerings will signal long-term commitment and market interest regarding the company. This can build an amount of trust towards the investors and the demand for risk compensation in the shape of underpricing will be lowered. Committed investors will establish consensus in the market and others will follow in their footsteps, creating an information cascade. As a consequence, IPOs rarely are moderately subscribed but rather very over- or undersubscribed. Small price changes can therefore make the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful IPO. Because of this, the company is forced to underprice in order to create more attractive circumstances even though the market climate is good. Sammanfattning Studiens mål är att belysa hur företagsledningar strategiskt resonerar om underprissättning vid börsintroduktion. I rådande marknadsklimat noteras fler och fler bolag där branschpress ständigt rapporterar om kraftigt stigande initiala aktiekurser. Detta gör ämnet aktuellt och intressant att undersöka bakomliggande faktorer kring. Intervjuer har gjorts med tre nyligen börsintroducerade bolag som haft en kraftig initial kursstigning, samt deras finansiella rådgivare. Tack vare den finansiella rådgivaren har vi kunnat triangulera empirin från bolagen och därmed kunnat sätta ord på bakomliggande resonemang och motiv till underprissättningen. Det studien visat är att företagsledningen har ambitionen att driva bolaget vidare mot tillväxt snarare än att sälja ut till marknaden för snabb avkastnings skull, vilket hävdats i teorier. Besluten dessa fattar i form av lock up-avtal, teckningsoptioner och teckningsförbindelser kommer leda till signaler om långsiktighet och intresse kring bolaget. På så vis kan ett förtroendekapital byggas mot investerarna och kompensationskrav i form av underprissättning minskar från dessa. Engagerade investerare kommer skapa konsensus på marknaden och övriga kommer följa i deras steg vilket skapar en informationskaskad. På grund av detta blir sällan börsintroduktioner medeltecknade utan snarare mycket över- eller undertecknade. Marginella prisändringar kan därför göra skillnaden mellan en lyckad och misslyckad börsintroduktion. Detta gör att bolaget tvingas skapa mer attraktiva förhållanden för investerarna genom underprissättning trots ett gynnsamt börsklimat...|$|E

Despite minimum requirements {{in terms of}} the length and percentage of shares <b>locked</b> <b>up,</b> lockup <b>agreements</b> are not only highly diverse across firms but also across the different shareholders of a single firm as most firms have different agreements in place for executives, non-executives and venture capitalists. The diversity across firms and types of shareholders can be explained by firm characteristics—such as the level of uncertainty—as well as the type and importance of each shareholder within the firm...|$|R

The construction of the Toowoomba Court House at the intersection of Margaret and Neil street in the 1876-78 and the Toowoomba Post Office facing Margaret Street in 1880, were followed by a substantial two-storeyed U shaped brick Police Station, incorporating barracks, <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> and <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> keeper's quarters.
