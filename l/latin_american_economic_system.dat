50|$|Paraguay is {{a member}} of the Common Market of the South (Mercado Común del Sur or Mercosur). Most of Paraguay’s trade takes place with Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina. In 2002 Paraguay {{conducted}} more than US$400 million in trade with Argentina and nearly US$800 million with Brazil. Paraguay is also a member of the Inter-American Development Bank, Latin American Integration Association, and <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>System</b> and a signatory to the agreement creating the South American Community of Nations. In 2004 Paraguay signed an energy cooperation agreement with Venezuela to purchase oil and petroleum. Venezuela agreed to concessional financing that allowed Paraguay to pay over a 15-year period at a nominal interest rate. Imports totaled US$3.3 billion in 2004. Principal import commodities included automobiles, chemical products, consumer goods, tobacco, petroleum, and machinery. Brazil was the leading source of imports to Paraguay (24.3 percent), followed by the United States (22.3 percent), Argentina (16.2 percent), China (9.9 percent), and Hong Kong (5 percent). Experts note that import statistics are difficult to confirm for Paraguay because as much as half of all imports are illegally re-exported to Argentina or Brazil. Imports from Mercosur countries continue to rise, up to 57 percent in 2003. Paraguay’s export revenues totaled about US$2.9 billion in 2004. Agricultural commodities continue to drive Paraguay’s export totals. Soybeans are particularly vital, accounting for 35 percent of total export revenues in 2003. Other agricultural cash crops include cotton, sugarcane, cassava, sunflowers, wheat, and corn. Other significant exports include feed, meat, edible oils, electricity, wood, and leather. Even as Paraguayan export revenue has fluctuated, Brazil remained Paraguay’s principal export destination (27.8 percent in 2004), followed by Uruguay (15.9 percent), Italy (7.1 percent), Switzerland (5.6 percent), Argentina (4.3 percent), and the Netherlands (4.2 percent). In 2003 nearly 60 percent of Paraguayan exports went to Mercosur countries. Paraguay had a negative trade balance of about US$400 million in 2004. Higher earnings from soybeans and cotton could not offset the surge in imported consumer goods and petroleum products. After years of negative balances, Paraguay achieved a positive balance of payments totaling US$234 million in 2003. In 2004, however, the current account had an estimated deficit of US$35.1 million. Paraguay has a sustainable debt level according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). External debt totaled about US$3.4 billion in 2004, low compared to most Latin American countries. Continued reductions in Paraguay’s debt to gross domestic product ratio are expected in coming years. Paraguay paid US$412 million in debt service to the IMF in 2004. Foreign investment in Paraguay nearly disappeared in 2002. After direct foreign investment of US$84 million in 2001, only US$9 million in investment came from abroad in 2002. This drop was largely the result of the financial crisis in Argentina and the banking collapse in Paraguay. Direct foreign investment rebounded in 2003, reaching US$90.8 million for the year. Paraguay has depended on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank for economic development assistance. The World Bank has promised Paraguay assistance totaling US$325 million between 2003 and 2007. Projects currently underway in Paraguay aim to improve education, transportation, and rural development.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis {{document}} was prepared {{at the request}} of the Secretariat of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), and was presented on 17 March 2003 during the 12 th Meeting of the Committee on Trade Development and External Economic Relations. In order to maintain the quality of the document, the observations expressed by member countries were incorporated into the original version. In addition, the data and information contained in that version were updated and expanded. Collaborating on its preparation were officials from the International Trade and Integration Division of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Headquarters in Santiago (Johannes Heirman, Carla Macario, Jaime Contador, Verónica Silva, Mikio Kuwayama and José Durán) and Esteban Pérez of the ECLAC Subregional Headquarters for the Caribbean, in Port of Spain. Viviane Ventura Dias, ECLAC's Director of International Trade and Integration provided continuous encouragement and support for the project. Valuable assistance was also obtained in the preparation of the document from the Subregional Headquarters of ECLAC in Mexico, and from the ACS Secretariat, which was involved in all stages of the research. ECLAC Headquarters in Santiago together with the Subregional Headquarters in Port of Spain prepared the final version of the document. The Permanent Secretariat of the <b>Latin</b> <b>American</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>System</b> (SELA) edited the final version of this document in Spanish and English. Chapter I provides a brief presentation on the objectives of the ACS and its origin. It highlights the great diversity of the countries that make up the Association, and makes reference to the problems faced by small economies. It ends with a description of the main features of the international insertion of member countries. Chapter II examines recent developments in external trade, with special attention being paid to trade within the ACS, and the possibility of strengthening such trade. A large part of the chapter is devoted to foreign investment in the region, including the emerging development of intraregional investment. The following chapter examines in detail these countries' trade policies, and highlights the effect of commitments undertaken in subregional agreements within the Association on such policies. The final chapter gives an account of the trade agreements entered into by the different members of the Association, and examines their position in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its trade negotiation agreements with developed countries. The chapter closes with an analysis of the main areas of action outlined in the ACS, namely, attempts to set up a preferential trade zone, transport, trade facilitation and tourism, as well as joint action in light of natural disasters. Due to the range of topics dealt with and the large number of Member States involved, the document must focus on the main features of the international insertion of these countries and this analysis, therefore, may not always achieve the level of detail desired. Finally, it must be stated that the views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of ECLAC...|$|E

We conduct simulations using our calibrated model to provide lower bounds for country-by-country gains from larger allocations. We also discuss the impact of alternative regulatory regimes on the feasibility to achieve those social gains.
