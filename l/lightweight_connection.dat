The world wide web supports asynchronous collaboration by allowing people to share distributed information repositories. This paper presents a new technique for creating applications that tightly integrate synchronous groupware with the world wide web. The key points of the technique are: two new HTML tags allow synchronous views to be embedded within WWW pages without programming; <b>lightweight</b> <b>connection</b> of WWW documents and applications is achieved {{through the use of}} constraints, {{and the use of the}} model-view-controller architecture allows easy integration of applications and WWW pages that were developed separately. This technique has been demonstrated in the context of the new multiuser GroupScape HTML browser, developed using the Clock groupware development toolkit...|$|E

According to the current development status of Chinese electrical power fittings and the demand for new technique, combined with hot stamping technology, a new solution for reduction of weight in transmission line fittings has been proposed. This paper focuses on a new <b>lightweight</b> <b>connection</b> fitting with multilayer stack structure of ultra-high strength boron steel, and the key issue in design and manufacturing process of the deep U-shaped hot stamping stacked steel sheet. Numerical simulation method combining the experimental data is also used to predict mechanical performance of the new connection fitting, which provides guidance for the manufacturing process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{will address}} two {{underlying}} problems of Web service continuity in mobile ubiquitous networks. On the one hand, our work presents a <b>lightweight</b> solution for <b>connection</b> interruption. On the other hand, we introduce {{a technique to}} switch between devices during service invocation. The Suspend-Relocate-Resume for Web Services (SRR-WS) Framework meets these challenges by allowing a device to disconnect in-between Web service invocation and response in order to retrieve the reply upon reconnection. Moreover, our proposed framework also enables on-demand transfer of service control from one device to another. Our first reference implementation demonstrates how Web service continuity can be achieved across devices as well as unreliable connections. ...|$|R
40|$|Life-cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) regarding personal electronic products receives little attention, {{probably due}} to the fact that most of them are compact in size; hence, the environmental impact per unit is relatively <b>lightweight.</b> In this <b>connection,</b> how to perform eco-design for electronic products in practice with respect to all phases of their life cycle is unclear. However, taking their total (annual) consumption into consideration, the total impact cannot be underestimated. The main objective of this paper is to fill this gap by analysing a personal electronic product from the eco-design point of view. The results are presented in terms of different environmental aspects (like emissions to air) and associated suggestions for eco-redesign. More specifically, this paper aims to: (i) reveal a case study in which LCA is applied to an electronic product. The focus is on how to collect relevant data in this regard; (ii) summarise the results in terms of a variety of environmental impacts so that key items or key issues can be identified and quantified accordingly and (iii) suggest a set of associated eco-redesign options responding to the aforementioned issues. Improvement of the new design is then compared with the original design.; Life-cycle assessment (LCA) regarding personal electronic products receives little attention, {{probably due to}} the fact that most of them are compact in size; hence, the environmental impact per unit is relatively <b>lightweight.</b> In this <b>connection,</b> how to perform eco-design for electronic products in practice with respect to all phases of their life cycle is unclear.

40|$|Supporting {{scalable}} {{and efficient}} parallel programs {{is a major}} challenge in parallel computing with the widespread adoption of large-scale computer clusters and supercomputers. One of the pronounced scalability challenges is the management of connections between parallel processes, especially over connection-oriented interconnects such as VIA and InfiniBand. In this paper, we take on the challenge of designing efficient connection management for parallel programs over InfiniBand clusters. We propose adaptive connection management (ACM) to dynamically control the establishment of InfiniBand reliable connections (RC) based on the communication frequency between MPI processes. We have investigated two different ACM algorithms: an on-demand algorithm that starts with no InfiniBand RC connections; and a partial static algorithm with only 2 âˆ— logN number of InfiniBand RC connections initially. We have designed and implemented both ACM algorithms in MVAPICH to study their benefits. Two mechanisms have been exploited {{for the establishment of}} new RC connections: one using InfiniBand unreliable datagram and the other using InfiniBand connection management. For both mechanisms, MPI communication issues, such as progress rules, reliability and race conditions are handled to ensure efficient and <b>lightweight</b> <b>connection</b> management. Our experimental results indicate that ACM algorithms can benefit parallel programs in terms of the process initiation time, the number of active connections, and the resource usage...|$|E
