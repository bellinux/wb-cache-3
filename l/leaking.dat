5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to <b>leaking</b> out, may have adverse effects on them, such as hydrogen embrittlement, leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas <b>leaking</b> into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{pipelines}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular ways of delivering gas phases as shown by numerous examples in hydrocarbon transportation systems in Arctic regions, oil and gas production facilities in onshore and offshore wells, and municipal gas distribution systems in urban areas. A gas <b>leak</b> from pipelines can cause serious problems not only because of the financial losses associated but also its social and environmental impacts. Therefore, establishing an early <b>leak</b> detection model is vital to safe and secure operations of such pipeline systems. A <b>leak</b> detection model for a single gas phase is presented in this study by using material balance and pressure traverse calculations. The comparison between two steady states, with and without <b>leak,</b> makes it possible to quantify the magnitude of disturbance in two <b>leak</b> detection indicators such as the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) and the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) in a broad range of <b>leak</b> locations (x <b>leak)</b> and <b>leak</b> opening sizes (d <b>leak).</b>  The results from the fit to large-scale experimental data of Scott and Yi (1998) show that the value of <b>leak</b> coefficient (C D), which is shown to be the single-most important but largely unknown parameter, ranges from 0. 55 to 4. 11, and should be a function of Reynolds number (N Re) which is related to <b>leak</b> characteristics such as <b>leak</b> location (x <b>leak),</b> <b>leak</b> opening size (d <b>leak),</b> <b>leak</b> rate (q <b>leak)</b> and system pressure. Further investigations show that between the two <b>leak</b> detection indicators, the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) is superior to the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) because of larger disturbance, if the pressure drop along the pipeline is relatively small compared to the outlet pressure; otherwise, the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) is superior to the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out).

40|$|Gas {{pipeline}} leakages do {{not only}} represent loss of valuable non-renewable resources {{but also a}} potential source of environmental pollution and fire disaster, thus making it very {{important to have a}} quick and accurate <b>leak</b> awareness scheme in pipeline systems. In a novel approach of providing industry with more reliable, friendly and cost effective technique in handling pipeline leakage especially in countries were pipeline vandalism has been widely reported. This require urgent detection and intervention, the potential of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in detecting and locating <b>leaks</b> from everyday flow line measurements was explored in this research paper. Pipeline responses under zero (no) <b>leak</b> condition, and realistic different <b>leak</b> conditions were simulated on a gas pipeline using OLGA simulator. Simulated <b>leaks</b> were seen to be characterized with unique flow rate, velocity, pressure and temperature signatures that were identifiable by the neural network. The network during training was able to learn the correlation between these signatures and the <b>leak</b> parameters and then use the learning in predicting and locating <b>leaks</b> from new signature data. The network predictions showed final RMSE values of 6. 14 and 0. 977 for the single and multiple <b>leaks</b> model respectively. The correlations between the actual and predicted <b>leak</b> sizes gave R values of 0. 95 and 0. 60 for the single and multiple <b>leaks</b> respectively while those of the actual and predicted <b>leak</b> locations were 0. 97 and 0. 96. The system was able to locate 90 % of the induced <b>leaks</b> to a distance that is less than 10 m away from the actual <b>leak</b> locations while 62 % of the ANN predicted <b>leak</b> sizes differed from the actual value by less than 50 % of the actual <b>leak</b> size and the remaining 38 % differed by about 65 – 400 % the actual sizes. This thus implies that the set has a better precision in predicting <b>leak</b> locations than predicting <b>leak</b> sizes. Based on obtained results, {{it can be said that}} with sufficiently large number of measurements, neural networks are of great potential in predicting and locating <b>leaks.</b> Results also showed that <b>leak</b> detectability tends to improve with increasing <b>leak</b> size and increasing distance from the source and the relatively low correlation obtained for the multiple <b>leaks</b> model can be attributed to the partial masking of smaller downstream <b>leaks</b> by larger upstream <b>leaks.</b> These characteristics of <b>leaks</b> are predominant to the countries with cases of vandalism, and could be a potential approach in handling pipe <b>leaks...</b>|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: A newly {{constructed}} single-lined geomembrane {{municipal solid}} waste (MSW) landfill cell developed <b>leaks</b> after two to five meters of waste {{were placed in the}} cell. The primary liner was initially <b>leak</b> tested using an electrical <b>leak</b> location method after the protective drainage soil was placed on the liner. All <b>leaks</b> that were located were repaired. Therefore, the reported leakage was caused by damage to the liner during the placement of the waste material. Because the landfill had up to five meters of waste material covering the liner, a standard electrical <b>leak</b> location survey was not practical. Therefore the newly-developed Electrical <b>Leak</b> Imaging Method (ELIM) was used to locate <b>leaks.</b> Three <b>leaks</b> were located using ELIM.

40|$|Threshold <b>leak</b> {{sizes and}} <b>leak</b> rates were {{calculated}} {{for a number of}} liquid food products exhibiting a wide range of surface tension and viscosity values. From this data, one can see that mathematically, under typical pressure differentials generated in food packages (≤ ± 34. 5 kPa), a <b>leak</b> will never start through a 2 µm defect. The calculated <b>leak</b> rates were compared to calculated evaporation rates. The evaporation rate exceeds the <b>leak</b> rate at lower sized microholes (2, and 5 µm diameter) under typical pressure differentials found in food packages. If the liquid, typically aqueous in food products, is evaporating off faster than the <b>leak</b> itself, then there will be solids left behind that could effectively plug the <b>leak.</b> The critical <b>leak</b> size is the size micro-defect that allows microbial penetration into the package.

40|$|Small <b>leaks</b> {{in water}} supply {{networks}} often remain undiscovered, resulting in {{large amounts of}} lost water. Moreover, small <b>leaks</b> can grow larger over time and may result in pipe bursts, having negative consequences for the surroundings. An automatic <b>leak</b> localization method is required to decrease the search area and hence localize small <b>leaks</b> earlier. In this research, the automatic <b>leak</b> localization method of Quevedo et al. (2011) is validated in DMA Leimuiden (the Netherlands). A prerequisite of the localization method is a detailed consumption distribution of the inflow for the hydraulic model. The goal {{of this research is}} to study the need for a detailed consumption distribution model in a DMA with a small MNF compared to the <b>leak</b> size (MNF: 4. 5 m 3 /h, <b>leak</b> size: 5. 2 m 3 /h, 7. 5 m 3 /h and 15 m 3 /h). The <b>leak</b> localization method was applied to eight artificial <b>leaks</b> that lasted 15 minutes and measurements of one day of a real <b>leak</b> (5. 2 m 3 /h). <b>Leak</b> localization results of the artificial <b>leaks</b> showed that there was no influence of the consumption distribution during the night. The <b>leak</b> localization method performs the same with both consumption models in case of low flow conditions and when <b>leak</b> localization results of the real <b>leak</b> for a whole day are combined. The performance of the <b>leak</b> localization method depends on the location of the <b>leak.</b> For some <b>leak</b> locations more flow in the system is required to create detectable head loss at the sensor locations. Uncertainties in the model cause larger pressure variations with higher flow conditions and a more detailed consumption distribution model must be used when there is more flow (morning peak). Too short measurement periods make the <b>leak</b> localization result sensitive to unexpected consumption inside the DMA. An accumulation of hourly results of a whole day makes the method more robust and gave satisfying performance irrespective of the used consumption models and with only 6 pressure sensors inside the network.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{treated with}} nasal {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) for {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) often have adverse effects from and poor adherence to CPAP. OBJECTIVE: To describe abnormal CPAP <b>leak</b> profiles and assess inter-observer reliability in identifying <b>leak</b> profiles and the correlation of <b>leak</b> profiles with <b>leak</b> rate and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In a sleep-disorders clinic we prospectively studied 35 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with moderate or severe OSA, and who had undergone polysomnographic diagnosis and nasal CPAP titration. We analyzed the data recorded by their CPAP machines during their first week of CPAP. Two independent clinical sleep specialists inspected each night’s <b>leak</b> profiles. We defined a “continuous ” <b>leak</b> profile segment as a <b>leak</b> increase of> 20 L/min for> 5 min. We defined a “serrated ” <b>leak</b> profile segment as a <b>leak</b> that oscillated up to> 20 L/min in< 5 min. With a validated questionnaire, we surveyed the patients about adverse effects. RESULTS: Overall inter-observer agreement was 88 % for continuous <b>leak</b> and 92 % for serrated <b>leaks.</b> The kappa values were 0. 76 and 0. 85, respectively. Deviance (2 SD) between scorers was 14 % to 11 % for continuous <b>leaks,</b> and 15 % to 9 % for serrated <b>leaks.</b> The duration of manually scored profiles correlated modestly but significantly with the machine-recorded <b>leaks.</b> The mean SD adherence to CPAP was lower in the patients with the highest quartile of continuous <b>leak</b> (5. 28 2. 24 h/night versus 6. 66 1. 72 h/night). Adverse effects increased with increasing serrated <b>leak</b> (P. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Manually scored <b>leak</b> profiles in patients treated with nasal CPAP can guide clinicians with respect to short-term adherence to nasal CPAP and adverse effects.
