5|$|Davis {{returned}} to work a week later, on , 2015. She said that, while she would not interfere with any deputy clerk who issues marriage licenses, she would not personally issue or authorize any of the forms. She created several altered versions of the Kentucky marriage license form and instructed her deputy clerks to use them, which had her name and reference to the clerk's office removed. The ACLU sued Davis separately for these form alterations, which they found to be of questionable <b>legality.</b> Governor Steve Beshear was asked by Bunning to brief the court on {{the validity of the}} licenses. Governor Beshear acknowledged that Kentucky would recognize the licenses being issued, but he could not verify the <b>legality</b> of the licenses issued or the means by which the marriage licenses were altered. Bunning ultimately denied the ACLU's separate suit, stating the altered forms were likely legal and that Davis was now abiding by the court's order.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the question}} on whether a Hercules legislator would validly propose a global standard, in particular, exchange of information between tax officials and those taxpayers who have a connection {{with one of the}} countries involved. This suggestion covers tax matters, including tax crimes, and is being put forward by the Global Forum. In recent decades, a global legal discourse has spread, but this trend has also been confronted with the acknowledgment that plural <b>legalities</b> coexist in domestic boundaries. Validity of a tax reform implies taking into account binding non-state and supra-state <b>legalities.</b> Individual <b>legalities</b> in force in a certain state are the cause of an important tension, and can result in important obstacles to the validity of state law, if the latter is not the product of argumentative interaction. The risk that such interaction does not exist is higher in the case of supra-national <b>legalities,</b> as is the case of exchange of information. It is herein claimed that a Hercules legislator would propose exchange of information on tax matters as an international standard, as long as the taxpayers’ fundamental rights as acknowledged in rule-of-law states are not jeopardized. It is also suggested that transitional regimes should be adopted in respect of some States...|$|R
