5|$|Carriage and {{shipment}} of {{some kinds of}} <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> to fully discharge very rapidly when short-circuited, leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway. Most consumer <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries</b> have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.|$|E

5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio.

Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} <b>lithium</b> <b>batteries,</b> which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.
