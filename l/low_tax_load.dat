40|$|The article {{analysis}} the tax load for {{the banking}} system in general. Analysis showed the tax load of the banks is rather low and does not reach the fifth part of 1 percent. At the same time, by individual branches of the real sector of economy this indicator is in an average for 5 years 5 – 8 percent, which confirms violation {{of the principle of}} proportionality of the taxation system of Ukraine. The ratio of elasticity of taxes of the banks showed unevenness of distribution of taxes if compared with dynamics of change of GDP. However, taxes of the real sector are distributed in proportion to the change of the GDP share. Calculation of the Herfindahl index allowed assessment of efficiency of taxation of banks {{in the structure of the}} economy of Ukraine. The index of concentration of taxation of banks had a rather low value during the analysed period (2008 – 2012), which is confirmed by data on a <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> <b>load</b> of the banks if compared to rather high values of tax load at enterprises of the real sector of economy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The tax and {{budgetary}} policy is important instruments of state regulation of national economy. Improvement of {{the mechanism of}} use of these tools allows to stimulate cumulative demand therefore develops productions. As, cumulative demand defines a level of production of goods and services. However in many countries with a transitional economy rather high level to <b>tax</b> <b>loading,</b> deficiency of the state budget is observed that negatively influences stability of macroeconomic growth. In this article topical issues of the tax and {{budgetary policy}} {{of the government of}} the Republic of Uzbekistan are considered and scientific and practical recommendations about its improvement are developed. Key words: state budget, public debt, deficiency, surplus, <b>tax</b> <b>loading.</b> One of key questions of a tax policy is providing an optimum level of <b>tax</b> <b>loading</b> for taxpayers. High <b>tax</b> <b>loading</b> limits financial opportunities of managing subjects and by that constrains production development. Besides, the increase in rates of taxes will lead to decrease in expenses of the companies and house farms. Below we will consider level to <b>tax</b> <b>loading</b> in separately taken countries (Karimov, 2009, p. 4) ...|$|R

All {{but one of the}} eight renewable projects carry higher tax burdens under current tax codes. These higher <b>tax</b> <b>loads</b> proportionately reduce the competitiveness of renewables. Three tax neutralizing policies are applied to the renewable projects, each restoring competitiveness for some of the projects. The results show that RD&D must be accompanied with such public initiatives as tax neutrality in order for the majority of renewable projects to compete with advanced gas turbines in the emerging electric services market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a two-country {{model with}} an international investor considering acquisitions of already existing target firms in a high-tax country and a low-tax country. The investor is able to shift profits from one location to another for tax saving purposes. Two systems of corporate taxation are compared, a system with separate accounting and a system with tax base consolidation and formula apportionment. It is shown that, under separate accounting, the number of acquisitions is inefficiently high in both the high <b>tax</b> and the <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> country. If a tax on acquisitions is available the high tax country will levy a positive acquisitions tax rate whereas the <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> country {{has no interest in}} doing so. Under formula apportionment, the number of acquisitions is inefficiently high in the <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> country and inefficiently low in the high tax country. The reason is that the firm has an incentive to inflate its stocks in the <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> country to reduce its effective tax rate. Now, the <b>low</b> <b>tax</b> country has an incentive to unilaterally decrease the number of acquisitions within its borders...|$|R

Therefore, {{it may be more}} profitable for Internet retailers to be located in high tax regions.

To examine the implication of opportunistic foreign earnings management on investors' equity valuation, I find evidence that investors do not seem to overvalue foreign managed earnings compared to domestic managed earnings, though foreign earnings are on average valued higher than domestic earnings...|$|R
