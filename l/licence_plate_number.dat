They kidnapped {{the couple in}} a Scorpio SUV driven by Mandeep Singh. Kuldip Thekedar, a road contractor, witnessed the kidnapping and filed a complaint at the Butana police station in Karnal district, giving the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> of the Scorpio. Later, Chanderpati ascribed the murder to the unauthorised withdrawal of the couple's security team ignoring the orders given by the district and sessions judge (DSJ) of Kaithal. Upon receiving no further news, Chanderpati's nephew, Narendra Singh traced the contractor, and after he was shown {{a photo of the}} couple, the contractor recognised the couple. The family then understood that Manoj and Babli were the victims of the kidnapping.|$|E

50|$|Private car <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> {{began in}} the early 1900s when Singapore was one of the four Straits Settlements, with a single prefix S for {{denoting}} Singapore, then adding a suffix letter S 'B' to S 'Y' for cars, but skipping a few like S 'A' (reserved for motorcycles), S 'H' and S 'Z' (reserved for taxis and buses), S 'D' (reserved for municipal vehicles), and S 'G' for goods vehicles large and small. No changes were made when Singapore became independent in 1965. There was no checksum letter, for example, SS1234, similar to vehicle registration plates of Malaysia. When the checksum letter was implemented, these <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> were given checksum letters as well, for example SS1234 became SS1234K.|$|R

5000|$|Vehicles {{are often}} {{required}} to be registered. Registration may be for purely legal reasons, for insurance reasons or to help law enforcement recover stolen vehicles. Toronto Police Service, for example, offers free and optional bicycle registration online. On motor vehicles, registration often {{takes the form of}} a vehicle registration plate, which makes it easy to identify a vehicle. In Russia, trucks and buses have their <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> repeated in large black letters on the back. On aircraft, a similar system is used where a tail number is painted on various surfaces. Like motor vehicles and aircraft, watercraft also have registration numbers in most jurisdictions, however the vessel name is still the primary means of identification as has been the case since ancient times. For this reason, duplicate registration names are generally rejected. In Canada, boats with an engine power of [...] or greater require registration, leading to the ubiquitous [...] "" [...] engine.|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyCar make and model recognition (CMMR) has become {{an important part of}} intelligent transport systems. Information provided by CMMR can be utilized when <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>numbers</b> cannot be identified or fake <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> are used. CMMR can also be used when automatic identification of a certain model of a vehicle by camera is required. The majority of existing CMMR methods are designed to be used only in daytime when most car features can be easily seen. Few methods have been developed to cope with limited lighting conditions at night where many vehicle features cannot be detected. This work identifies car make and model at night by using available rear view features. A binary classifier ensemble is presented, designed to identify a particular car model of interest from other models. The combination of salient geographical and shape features of taillights and <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> from the rear view are extracted and used in the recognition process. The majority vote of individual classifiers, support vector machine, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbours is applied to verify a target model in the classification process. The experiments on 100 car makes and models captured under limited lighting conditions at night against about 400 other car models show average high classification accuracy about 93...|$|R

Besides the stringent provisions of MCOCA and the Arms Act she has also been charged under various sections of IPC including criminal conspiracy, murder and destruction of evidence. Jigna Vora had been under the Mumbai police's radar since 4 July 2011 after the police intercepted a conversation between Manoj, brother of Vinod Asrani, who has also been arrested and the gangster Chhota Rajan. The police alleged that Vora had supplied address and <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>number</b> of Dey's motorcycle to Chhota Rajan. Police claimed Vora's professional rivalry {{was the reason for}} Dey's murder. On 27 July 2012, Jigna Vora was granted bail by a special court reasoning that she has a child to look after and is a single parent and that she had no previous criminal record.|$|E
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} film's early 1960s-culturally {{influenced}} conclusion that homosexual men are inherently dangerous to young boys {{the film has}} been noted for its unusual perception of police procedure: the first boy, named Jimmy, was supposedly playing a game of ball and did not feel like walking home, {{so he decided to}} [...] "thumb" [...] a ride. A few moments later, a car pulls up and Jimmy enters the stranger's car. Jimmy and the stranger start a conversation while on the way to Jimmy's house. They arrive at his house and Jimmy gets out of the stranger's car. The following day, the stranger was in his car waiting for him. Jimmy noticed that it was the same car and decided to ride once again. Instead of going straight to Jimmy's house, [...] "They went to a Drive-in and the Blue Bloodsstranger greeted him to a Coke." [...] The scene after shows ducks in a pond, and then switches to Jimmy and the stranger fishing together on a dock. Jimmy and the stranger (Ralph) reveal their names when they pull out their lunch. Jimmy then eats a sandwich, while Ralph pulls out an album of [...] "pornographic pictures." [...] Later, Jimmy is taken to a hotel with Ralph, presumably to be molested, and later reports the crime. The perpetrator is arrested; the victim is put on probation. This could be seen as an instance of victim blaming. [...] Another incautious, unsuspecting boy, Mike, is seen playing a game of basketball with a group of friends while ignoring a man watching them. The group decides to leave, but Mike decides stay and practice. The man then joins Mike, which is better than playing alone, according to Mike. Mike then decides to leave, and the stranger offered him a ride home. Mike accepts the offer, and enters the vehicle. Mike is supposedly killed that night, and having [...] "traded his life for a newspaper headline". [...] A third boy, Denny, is tricked into entering a man's car while he and his friend were sorting out newspapers. The car leaves, and the friend writes down the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>number.</b> Denny's friend is later delivering papers and talks to Denny's mother, who is seen watering her lawn. Denny's mother decides to go inside and call the police. Right after Denny's mother called the police, the car is quickly spotted and the stranger is arrested. A fourth boy is Bobby, who was in a beachside restroom where he and his friends were changing. Bobby's friends decide to go back home elsewhere, while Bobby decides to take a [...] "shortcut" [...] under a pier. As Bobby is walking to the shortcut, he notices that a man, who was seen at the restroom, was following him. Bobby then waves to his friends, and runs from the shortcut. The film equates homosexuals with child molesters and pedophiles, repeatedly describing homosexuality as a mental illness. True to the stereotypes of its time, the gay men in the film have mustaches, sunglasses and/or bow ties.|$|E
40|$|Two field {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} establish the most effective method of enforcement in reducing driving speed and to establish the most efficient strategy in terms of police force personnel required. In the first experiment, the effect of three variables on driving speed on motorways was studied. The first variable, intensity of enforcement, was manipulated by creating three different objective levels of apprehension for detected speeding drivers. The second variable was method of enforcement. On-view stopping and ticketing of offenders was compared to mailing of fines {{on the basis of}} the car's <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>number.</b> The third variable manipulated was the time delay in the mailing of fines. Time delay between detection of the offence and feedback to the driver was shortened in one condition. In a second experiment, police enforcement effort was optimized by relating intensity level of enforcement to the proportion of speeding vehicles. In the first experiment, police enforcement was applied for four weeks; in the second experiment, enforcement activities were continued for 12 consecutive weeks. In both cases the main dependent variable was driving speed. Before, during, and after the application of enforcement, speed was registered using induction loops. In addition, driver opinion about speeding and speed enforcement was studied using postal questionnaire surveys. The results show the largest and longest lasting reduction in driving speed in the highest intensity level-condition, giving support for a relation between objective chance of apprehension and speed choice. On-view stopping of offenders was shown to be a more effective method to reduce driving speed than mailing of fines. Some of these results are discussed in the light of game theory. The questionnaire surveys indicated that most drivers did not notice the recurrence in enforcement activities due to infrequent passing of the sections of motorways studied. The preventive effect of police enforcement appeared to be far more substantial than its repressive effect. Enforcement primarily deters the current nonoffender from speeding...|$|E

2500|$|The German {{government}} reformed {{its security}} rules {{in response to}} the attack. Among the proposals in the anti-terror plan were easing the deportations of rejected asylum seekers, increasing surveillance of those to be deported and those considered to be terror risks, limiting movement of some asylum seekers within Germany, using electronic tags on those deemed terror threats without a trial, lengthening the period suspects can be held in custody and limiting development aid to countries that don’t cooperate in deportation processes. President of Tunisia Beji Caid Essebsi meanwhile stated that Europe [...] "must be calm", vowing {{to take responsibility for the}} attacks, but insisted that it was necessary to verify citizenship before accepting deportations. The Bundestag passed a new surveillance law on 9 March {{in response to the}} attack as well as other attacks that occurred in Germany in 2016.

40|$|The {{traditional}} bottleneck {{model for}} road congestion promotes {{the implementation of}} a triangular, and time varying, charge as the optimal solution for the road congestion externality. However, cognitive and technological barriers put a practical limit to the degree of differentiation real world implementations can handle. The traditional approach to accommodate for this concern has been a step toll, with the single step coarse charge as its simplest case. In this paper we study how efficiency of the coarse charge can be improved by differentiating its level and timing across groups of travellers. We use the traditional bottleneck model to analyse how the coarse charge can be differentiated over two groups of travellers assuming inelastic peak-hour demand. The results of our analysis indicate that differentiating the coarse charge across two groups of travellers considerably improves its efficiency without increasing cognitive effort and decision making costs for the individual traveller. A numeric illustration reveals a welfare gain of 69 % of the first-best charge, up from 53 % for the generic coarse charge. This increase is similar to what is obtained by moving from the coarse charge to a generic two step toll. Once different groups have been defined, one could in fact achieve the same gains by temporal separation of drivers, for example by use of <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> <b>numbers.</b> The presented charging regime has a considerable degree of flexibility with respect to the share of travellers to attribute to each scheme, which further adds to its merits in practical applicability...|$|R
