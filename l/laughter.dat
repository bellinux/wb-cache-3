5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking <b>laughter</b> from the audience. The <b>laughter</b> recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at the <b>laughter.</b> Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E
5|$|Two {{incomplete}} versions (takes 12 and 13), {{which both}} break down into <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the factory}} {{temporarily}} shut down, Sulley is named the new CEO of Monsters, Inc. Under his leadership, {{the energy crisis}} is solved by harvesting children's <b>laughter</b> instead of screams, as <b>laughter</b> {{has been found to}} be much more potent. Mike takes Sulley aside, revealing he has rebuilt Boo's door and only needs one final piece, which Sulley took as a memento. Sulley enters and joyfully reunites with Boo.|$|E
5|$|You {{can hear}} the cars and the shouts from bars and the <b>laughter</b> and the fights.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, he {{made his}} third and final {{appearance}} as art dealer James Garrett in My Family. He also {{played the role of}} Mr Weston in the BBC costume drama Emma, which was broadcast in October 2009 on BBC One. He previously played Weston in a two-part adaptation of Emma for BBC Radio 4 in 2000. Between January and April 2010, Bathurst starred as Garry Essendine in a national touring revival of Noël Coward's Present <b>Laughter.</b> He had not seen Present <b>Laughter</b> before, though had seen several Coward plays in his 20s and did not imitate Coward's speech patterns while performing. Present <b>Laughter</b> was the first time Bathurst had appeared in a Coward play and he was cast in another, Blithe Spirit, later in the year. He plays Charles Condomine opposite Alison Steadman and his Cold Feet co-star Hermione Norris. The play toured theatres around southern England in 2010 and early 2011 before beginning a three-month run at the Apollo Theatre in London.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{exterior}} shots were always filmed {{on location in}} Holmfirth and the surrounding countryside, the interior shots were, until the early 1990s, filmed {{in front of a}} live studio audience at BBC Television Centre in London. The amount of location work increased, however, as studio work became a drain on time and money. Under Alan J. W. Bell, Last of the Summer Wine became the first comedy series {{to do away with the}} live studio audience, moving all of the filming to Holmfirth. The episodes were filmed and then shown to preview audiences, whose <b>laughter</b> was recorded and then mixed into each episode's soundtrack to provide a laugh track and avoid the use of canned <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unser Mund sei voll Lachens (May our mouth {{be full of}} <b>laughter),</b> , is {{a church}} cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He {{composed}} the Christmas cantata in Leipzig for Christmas Day and first performed it on 25 December 1725.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of the shopping channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for each other who would try to promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|As San Miguel {{lost her}} {{composure}} in giving her answer, the audience reacted with jeers and applause, {{as well as}} <b>laughter</b> from the panel of judges and other contestants. Midway through her answer, pageant host Paolo Bediones encouraged her off-microphone to continue in Tagalog, though she proceeded with her response in English.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot met {{his second}} wife, Inès de Gonzalez, {{for the first}} time at a casting call for a film based on Vladimir Nabokov's <b>Laughter</b> in the Dark. In 1962, Clouzot met de Gonzalez again after she had {{returned}} from South America. In December 1963, Clouzot and Inès de Gonzalez married. In the 1960s, Clouzot converted to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked <b>laughter</b> more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did. His goal during {{oral argument}}s was to get across his position to the other justices.|$|E
5|$|Kefka {{has been}} rated {{one of the}} most memorable and most evil video game villains ever created, with critics and fans noting his intense hatred and maniacal <b>laughter</b> as {{defining}} characteristics. He has also been compared to the Joker from the Batman universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Mr. Bean was developed while Rowan Atkinson was studying for his master's degree {{in electrical engineering}} at Queen's College, Oxford. A sketch featuring Bean was performed at the Edinburgh Fringe in the early 1980s. A similar character called Robert Box, played by Atkinson himself, appeared in the one-off 1979 ITV sitcom Canned <b>Laughter,</b> which also featured routines used in the feature film in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and <b>laughter,</b> although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{television}} and film roles, Bathurst {{has developed a}} theatre career. He appeared in several Cambridge Footlights Revues between 1977 and 1981, and co-directed the 1978 Footlights pantomime with Martin Bergman. From his first professional stage role playing Tim Allgood in Michael Frayn's Noises Off (1983), Bathurst has starred in Judgement (1987), Getting Married (1993), The Nose (1995), The Rover (1996), Alarms and Excursions (1998–1999), The Three Sisters (2003), Whipping it Up (2006, 2007), Present <b>Laughter</b> (2010), and Blithe Spirit (2010, 2011).|$|E
5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's <b>laughter</b> and the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present <b>Laughter</b> and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E
5|$|Daljit {{manages to}} crawl to the {{recording}} room, where Karan {{is still on}} air. When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt <b>laughter.</b> After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum. Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, <b>laughter,</b> and other battle cries.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience's <b>laughter,</b> he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with <b>laughter</b> as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen and Les Charles decided to lift the <b>laughter</b> from the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
5|$|Later, Liz apologizes to Jenna for {{allowing}} her to be injured, and agrees to let Jenna tell the TGS writing staff about her role in an advertisement for a phone sex line. The writers find the ad online, and greatly enjoy watching it. Jack comes in while the writers are watching and laughs so hard that he vomits. The <b>laughter</b> lifts Jack out of his bad mood, and he tells Liz what an important friend she is.|$|E
5|$|Olga's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} ill health. Lameness {{restricted}} her to a wheelchair, and she stayed in Paris several times to undergo treatment for her eyes. Her poor eyesight caused George V much <b>laughter</b> when she mistook a statue of a naked Lady Godiva for one of Queen Victoria. Increasingly dependent, Olga finally settled with her youngest son, Prince Christopher, shortly {{after the death of}} his first wife, Princess Anastasia, in 1923. Olga died on 18 June 1926 either at Christopher's Villa Anastasia in Rome, or at Pau, France.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. The interplay between these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sabhapathi (Paruchuri Venkateswara Rao) {{works for}} Bhagavan. Munna mistreats Sabhapathi, but Bhagavan doesn't care. Sabhapathi joins Kulkarni's gang to protect himself. Jaidev kidnaps Sampath's (Sampath Raj) son. Munna kills Sampath's son due to <b>laughter</b> over Jahnavi loving Jaidev. Munna confronts Jahnavi at Jaidev's flat. Munna brutally murders her. Jaidev kills Munna by {{throwing}} {{him from his}} flat. This scene is seen by Guravayya (Tanikella Bharani), an associate of Bhagavan who is an informer to Kulkarni. He reports this to Bhagavan {{to get rid of}} Jaidev.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is a {{loud and}} vocal species, {{and makes a}} variety of calls. Its main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human <b>laughter.</b> Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with <b>laughter.</b> Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} voice acting in the game, {{as is the case}} in most The Legend of Zelda titles to date. Link remains silent in conversation, but grunts when attacking or injured and gasps when surprised. His {{emotions}} and responses are largely indicated visually by nods and facial expressions. Other characters have similar language-independent verbalizations, including <b>laughter,</b> surprised or fearful exclamations, and screams. Midna has the most voice acting—her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Japanese voice actress Akiko Kōmoto.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a dog was required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into <b>laughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{the first}} version of the song had stayed largely in the key of G major (except for {{transient}} modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges), the reprise starts in F and features a modulation, to G. The mono and stereo mixes of the song differ slightly: the former has a fractionally different transition from the previous song, and includes crowd noise and <b>laughter</b> in the opening bars that are absent from the stereo mix.|$|E
5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that <b>laughter</b> is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very {{unsuccessful}} show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
25|$|Gelotology {{was first}} studied by psychiatrists, {{although}} some doctors in antiquity recommended <b>laughter</b> {{as a form}} of medicine. It was initially deprecated by most other physicians, who doubted that <b>laughter</b> possessed analgesic qualities. One early study that demonstrated the effectiveness of <b>laughter</b> in a clinical setting showed that <b>laughter</b> could help patients with atopic dermatitis respond less to allergens. Other studies have shown that <b>laughter</b> can help alleviate stress and pain, and can assist cardiopulmonary rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Popularly {{known as}} the Laughing Philosopher (for {{laughing}} at human follies), the terms Abderitan <b>laughter,</b> which means scoffing, incessant <b>laughter,</b> and Abderite, which means a scoffer, are derived from Democritus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laughter</b> {{might not}} be {{confined}} or unique to humans. The differences between chimpanzee and human <b>laughter</b> {{may be the result}} of adaptations that have evolved to enable human speech. Self-awareness of one's situation as seen in the mirror test, or the ability to identify with another's predicament (see mirror neurons), are prerequisites for <b>laughter,</b> so animals may be laughing for the same reasons that humans do.|$|E
