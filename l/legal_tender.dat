5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after that. Even after the old currencies ceased to be <b>legal</b> <b>tender,</b> they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for ten years or more.|$|E
5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close {{economic}} integration between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii reflected this, making gold American coins <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> for an unlimited amount and American silver coins <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, technically certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E
5|$|Hell money: Hell {{money is}} a form of joss paper printed to {{resemble}} fake <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> bank notes. The notes are not an official form of recognized currency or <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Commemorative coins with €2 {{face value}} {{have been issued}} with changes {{to the design of}} the {{national}} side of the coin. These include both commonly issued coins, such as the €2 commemorative coin for the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and nationally issued coins, such as the coin to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics issued by Greece. These coins are <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> throughout the eurozone. Collector coins with various other denominations have been issued as well, but these are not intended for general circulation, and they are <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> only in the member state that issued them.|$|E
5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent cheques quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro cheques (Agricultural Cheques) were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer cheques, it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These cheques also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency cheques been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b>|$|E

50|$|Immediately {{confronted with}} {{inflation}} {{caused by the}} government's wartime issue of greenbacks, he recommended their retirement {{and a return to}} the gold standard. In McCulloch's first annual report, issued on December 4, 1865, he strongly urged the retirement of the <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> or greenbacks as a preliminary to the resumption of specie payments. However this would have reduced the supply of currency and was unpopular during the period of postwar reconstruction and westward expansion.|$|R
50|$|In {{accordance}} with this suggestion an act was passed, on March 12, 1866, authorizing {{the retirement of}} not more than $10,000,000 in six months and not more than $4,000,000 per month thereafter. This act met with strong opposition and was repealed on the February 4, 1868, after only $48,000,000 had been retired. The battle over its revival raged for the next fifty years. McCulloch was also disappointed by {{the decision of the}} United States Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the <b>legal</b> <b>tenders.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this digital era, {{one thing}} that still holds the {{convention}} is a printed archive. Printed documents find their use in many critical domains such as contract papers, <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> and proof of identity documents. As more advanced printing, scanning and image editing techniques are becoming available, forgeries on these <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> pose a serious threat. Ability to easily and reliably identify source printer of a printed document can help a lot in reducing this menace. During printing procedure, printer hardware introduces certain distortions in printed characters' locations and shapes which are invisible to naked eyes. These distortions are referred as geometric distortions, their profile (or signature) is generally unique for each printer {{and can be used}} for printer classification purpose. This paper proposes a set of features for characterizing text-line-level geometric distortions, referred as geometric distortion signatures and presents a novel system to use them for identification of the origin of a printed document. Detailed experiments performed on a set of thirteen printers demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art performance and gives much higher accuracy under small training size constraint. For four training and six test pages of three different fonts, the proposed method gives 99 % classification accuracy. Comment: 20 page...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{aspects of}} {{currency}} and money circulation - abstract "Legal aspects of currency and money circulation" {{is a very}} interesting matter that comprises a wide range of various issues. Issues related with currency and money circulation are not only issues of law - these are related to day-to-day life as well. The purpose of my diploma thesis is to deal with these issues, that are not usually in the centre of attention and also I would like to focus on relatively new legal regulation in the area of money circulation. This diploma thesis is concerned with relevant Czech legislation. Relevant European legislation is mentioned as well. This diploma thesis is divided into four parts, each of them is subdivided into chapters and subchapters. The first part briefly explains the terms of money, currency, <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> and related problems. Its aim is also to outline basic information about relevant Czech legislation and several activities of the Czech National Bank. The second part is concerned with circulation of money and related matters. At first it is necessary to define the term of money circulation. In the centre of attention in this part is the obligation to accept <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> and the related right to deny their acceptation. The second part is also dealing with imitations of money and money substitutes [...] . ...|$|R

30|$|Peter Kankonde makes {{a similar}} {{argument}} when he underlines “what lies {{beneath the surface}} of sent <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> is in fact the social and cultural subjective self of remitters as human beings and family members […] migrants remit primarily in a bid to foster familial belonging in order to escape social death {{and at the same time}} buy and sustain social status” (Kankonde, 2010, pp. 225 - 240). Expanding upon these insights, I claim that migration scholars could benefit from recent findings emerging from the field of economic sociology in order to systematically study how economic transactions fulfill social functions.|$|R

50|$|Until 1975, old coins {{denominated}} in milliemes (equal to the dirham) circulated. In 1975, coins {{were introduced}} in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dirhams which bore the coat of arms of the Federation of Arab Republics. These were followed in 1979 by a second series of coins, in the same denominations, which bore a design of a horseman {{in place of the}} arms. ¼ and ½ dinar coins were issued in 2001 and 2004, respectively. In 2009, new 50, 100 dirhams, ¼ and ½ dinar coins were issued. 1, 5, 10, and 20 dirham coins are rarely used as units of exchange.

In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $20. It was not until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> without limit.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how the Japanese {{government}} financed war expenditures locally in {{the occupied}} territories during the Pacific War. First, the reserve banks, founded instantly by the government, funded the occupation forces by issuing their bank notes in North/Central China, and Southern Regions. Second, the Japanese government financed military expenses by requesting the existing central banks to issue their <b>legal</b> <b>tenders</b> in Manchuria, Indochina, and Thailand. In the years 1943 - 1945, the first method in the regions with sharp inflations yielded 559. 7 billion yen at face value, but only 7. 2 billion yen at purchasing power parity (PPP), while the second in the regions with relatively low inflations generated only 5. 8 billion yen at face value, but still 3. 6 billion yen at PPP. In the former regions, the occupation forces did not acquire that much purchasing power, while in the latter regions, non-negligible portions of the occupied countries' nominal GDP were transferred to the occupation forces...|$|R
