5|$|A fire {{destroyed}} part of {{the monastery}} during the War of the Spanish Succession. During the Peninsular War, French troops looted the buildings and used them as barracks.

However, the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king. The monastery ceased to operate in 1835: the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; the monastery had only four monks and one lay brother, who were cast out.|$|E

5|$|Air Marshal Philip Joubert de la Ferté, {{commander-in-chief}} of RAF Coastal Command agreed {{this was}} the probable route. He expected the Germans to make an attempt anytime after the 10 February. Unfortunately, the Air Ministry and the three RAF commands, RAF Coastal Command, RAF Bomber Command and RAF Fighter Command, believed the Germans would use the darkness for the longest and most dangerous {{part of the journey}} through the straits and would <b>leave</b> <b>in</b> daylight. The far from adequate forces at their disposal, they believed, would be best used at night. Most of RAF Bomber Command was ordered to stand down accordingly. Such an order made it totally unprepared to strike in daylight hours on 12 February.|$|E
