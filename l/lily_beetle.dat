50|$|The scarlet <b>lily</b> <b>beetle,</b> red <b>lily</b> <b>beetle,</b> or {{lily leaf beetle}} (Lilioceris lilii), is a leaf beetle that {{eats the}} leaves, stem, buds, and flower, of lilies, fritillaries {{and other members of}} the family Liliaceae. It lays its eggs most often on Lilium and Fritillaria species. In the absence of Lilium and Fritillaria species, there are fewer eggs laid and the {{survival}} rate of eggs and larvae is reduced. It is now a pest in most temperate climates where lilies are cultivated.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} 100 {{years it has}} been known that the sclerotised median lobe of beetles {{harbours}} a membranous structure (the "internal sac" or "endophallus") which is everted during copula inside the female genital tract. In order to explore the functional role of this structure and those associated with it, we cryofixed copulating pairs of Donacia semicuprea and Lilioceris lilii and studied the relative position {{of the elements of}} the copulatory apparatus of males and females by micro-computer-tomography. We found that the everted endophallus fills the lumen of the bursa copulatrix completely. Our data suggest that in L. lilii the tip of the sclerotised distal part of the ejaculatory duct, the flagellum, is positioned exactly over the opening of the spermathecal duct inside the bursa copulatrix. The mouth of the bursa copulatrix in D. semicuprea is armed with a strong muscle ring, and the whole wall of the bursa is covered externally with a layer of muscle fibres. These morphological differences correspond with differences in mating behaviour: In reed beetles (Donaciinae), females seemingly can control mating to a higher degree than in <b>lily</b> <b>beetles</b> (Lilioceris spp.) ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli), first officially {{reported}} in the U. S. in 1992, has become a serious pest of native and cultivated lilies throughout its North American distribution. With no effective North American natural enemies, this exotic insect poses a potential economic threat to horticulturists and an environmental threat to native lilies. This study {{presents the results of}} an ongoing classical biological control program initiated against L. lilii in North America. ^ Based on its Eurasian geographic distribution, L. lilii seems capable of spreading throughout much of North America. In Europe, the <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> is well known but is not considered a problem. We traveled to Europe where we discovered L. lilii to be under good natural control by six species of parasitoids: five wasps and a fly. Of these, four larval parasitoids were identified as potential candidates for introduction to the United States: Tetrastichus setifer Thomson (Hym: Eulophidae), Lemophagus pulcher Szepligeti (Hym: Ichneumonidae), L. errabundus Gravenhorst, and Diaparsis jucunda (Holmgren) (Hym: Ichneumonidae). ^ We collected parasitized larvae throughout Europe from 1998 – 2002. The larvae were shipped to the University of Rhode Island quarantine facility for use in laboratory studies to evaluate host range and host preferences. Lemophagus errabundus, D. jucunda and T. setifer were found to have the requisite degree of host specificity needed for release in North America. We selected T. setifer as the first parasitoid to release, based its effectiveness in Europe, where it demonstrates high parasitism rates and wide climatic range. ^ Three release and two control sites were established and T. setifer was released from 1999 – 2002. We sampled all plots to detect parasitism and overwintering and to evaluate phenology. Tetrastichus setifer was recovered in the weeks immediately following release, but overwinter survival was not detected until 2002. Tetrastichus setifer is established in two sites and showed high rates of parasitism in these plots in 2003. ...|$|R
50|$|This <b>lily</b> <b>beetle</b> may be {{confused}} with the cardinal beetle (Pyrochroa serraticornis), which also has red elytra and a black underside. The wing cases of the lily leaf beetle are dimpled and are shinier and more rounded than those of the cardinal beetle, which are relatively dull, and narrower, flatter, and more elongated. The cardinal beetle also has comb-like antennae. The lily leaf beetle is herbivorous, while the cardinal beetle preys on insects. The lily leaf beetle is also confused with unspotted ladybirds, but it is narrower in shape.|$|E
50|$|People often {{mistake the}} smaller scarlet <b>lily</b> <b>beetle,</b> Lilioceris lilii, for a {{cardinal}} beetle as {{they also have}} a black underside and wings that are spotless and red. However, the scarlet lily leaf beetle's wing cases have tiny dimples and are shinier and more rounded than the dull, narrow, flattened and elongated cardinal beetle. The beetles can also be distinguished by the cardinal's toothed antennae. Another difference between the two is their diets. Scarlet lily leaf beetles are herbivores and are usually found eating lily leaves, whereas cardinal beetles are usually found on tree bark and flowers and feed on flying insects.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Horticultural Society {{has given}} Lilium regale its Award of Garden Merit. It {{is among the}} easiest lilies to grow in most {{temperate}} climate gardens. It tolerates most soils, except ones prone to waterlogging. It may naturalise in suitable conditions. It can also be grown in large containers. The bulbs themselves are very hardy, but the shoots appear {{early in the season}} and may be damaged by frost. Plants can be raised from seed, and often flower in their second year.

40|$|The <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> Lilioceris lilii Scopoli, {{was first}} found in North America near Montreal, Canada, in 1943 (LeSage 1992). It was {{recovered}} in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1992 (Livingston 1996), and now occurs throughout {{all of the}} New England states and in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Manitoba. It is a serious pest of native and cultivated lilies (Liliaceae) (Livingston 1996). This univoltine insect overwinters as an adult and after initiating feeding in the spring, oviposits in rows on the undersides of lily leaves. Larvae, which carry a fecal shield, pass through four instars before pupating in the soil. In North America, larval feeding often results in complete plant defoliation. Lilioceris lilii apparently originated in Asia (Berti and Rapilly 1976), and now exists throughout Eurasia from Siberia to Morocco and from the United Kingdom to China (Labeyrie 1963; Lu and Casagrande 1998).

50|$|The <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> is {{indigenous}} {{to parts of}} Europe and Asia. It {{is thought to have}} been introduced to North America through the importation of plant bulbs in 1943. First spotted in Montreal, it spread throughout Canada and appeared in Massachusetts in 1992, and by 2012 was in all six New England States, as well as New York and Washington states. In Canada it is found from the Maritime Provinces west to Manitoba.. As of 2001, it spread as far west as Alberta, and as of 2017 full infestations reported as far north as the Edmonton, AB area. It has also become established as an invasive species in the United Kingdom since being first recorded in 1839, although the first colony did not become established until 1939 and it did not spread far until the 1980s, then more rapidly from the 1980s. Since then it has spread from Surrey in southern England as far north as Inverness, Scotland and is also found in Ireland. It is also found in the Middle East and North Africa.|$|R
5000|$|Baeometra is a genus in {{the family}} Colchicaceae {{containing}} a single species, Baeometra uniflora. It is native to South Africa, where it is commonly called <b>beetle</b> <b>lily</b> due to the dark markings on the tepals. The genus was erected when the British botanist Richard Salisbury described the species [...] "Baeometra columellaris" [...] in 1812, although the plant had already been discovered, described and painted in 1793 by the Austrian botanist Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin under the name Melanthium uniflorum. The correct name for the species was thus settled in 1941 by the South African botanist Gwendolyn Lewis to be Baeometra uniflora (Salisb.) G.J.Lewis. The epithet means [...] "single-flowered", which is contradicted {{by the fact that}} the stem usually bears at least two yellowish flowers.|$|R
5000|$|There are no {{registered}} chemicals for {{lily leaf beetle}} control, {{which limits}} options for the gardener. Although the most surefire strategy for preventing infestation by any pest is to avoid planting susceptible plants in the first place, with <b>lily</b> <b>beetle</b> this necessitates avoiding growing so many desirable cultivars of lilium, that other strategies may be preferred. Regular handpicking and crushing of eggs, larvae and adults is effective if somewhat laborious. Domestic insecticides registered for general leaf beetle control containing carbaryl, methoxychlor, malathion and rotenone can prove useful in controlling populations. However, malathion and carbaryl, effective on adults and larvae, are toxic to bees and other insects, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Aphids may infest plants. Leatherjackets {{feed on the}} roots. Larvae of the Scarlet <b>lily</b> <b>beetle</b> {{can cause}} serious damage to the stems and leaves. The scarlet beetle lays its eggs and completes its life cycle only on true lilies (Lilium) and fritillaries (Fritillaria). [...] Oriental, rubrum, tiger and trumpet lilies as well as Oriental {{trumpets}} (orienpets) and Turk's cap lilies and native North American Lilium species are all vulnerable, but the beetle prefers some types over others. The beetle could also be having an effect on native Canadian species and some rare and endangered species found in northeastern North America. Daylilies (Hemerocallis, not true lilies) are excluded from this category. Plants can suffer from damage caused by mice, deer and squirrels. Slugs, snails and millipedes attack seedlings, leaves and flowers. Brown spots on damp leaves may signal botrytis (also known as lily disease). Various fungal and viral diseases can cause mottling of leaves and stunting of growth.|$|E
40|$|The <b>lily</b> <b>beetle</b> (Lilioceris lilii, Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) has a {{univoltine}} {{life cycle}} and a limited host range (Lilium, Fritillaria and Cardiocrinum). A survey of 237 professional growers indicates that L. lilii {{is a problem}} for many in the UK lily industry. A three-year field trial using six different Lilium indicated that the species Lilium regale is more resistant to L. lilii than the hybrids L. ‘Tiber’, L. ‘Brindisi’, L. ‘Conca d’Or’, L. ‘Eliganzer’ and L. ‘Golden Joy’. Phenology observations between the trial and an established population of the beetle have provided base-line data to which further observations can be compared. Future host susceptibility trials should use a standard lily such as L. regale against which others can be compared. Behavioural bioassays using a linear-track olfactometer demonstrated that the responses of L. lilii to hosts and conspecifics are at least in part odour-mediated. Significantly more diapaused females moved into airstreams containing the odour of intact hosts over clean air, to that of hosts and beetles combined over that of undamaged or manually-damaged plants, and into airstreams from intact plants over larval-infested plants. Pre-diapause males moved into the airstreams of intact hosts in preference to L. lilii-infested plants. Using air entrainment, gas chromatography (GC) and coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), headspace volatiles from beetleinfested host plants have been collected and identified. From these compounds, methyl salicylate, nonanal, cis-jasmone, linalool, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one and β-pinene elicited electrophysiological responses from L. lilii using electroantennography (EAG) and coupled GC-EAG. Bioassays indicate that diapaused female beetles move into the airstream of clean air in preference to cis-jasmone. Investigations from all areas of the project have progressed our understanding of the ecology of L. lilii but further studies are needed before more effective control strategies can be developed.

40|$|A host {{race is a}} {{population}} which is partially reproductively isolated as {{a direct consequence of}} adaptation to a certain host. For host race formation to occur five conditions should be met. First of all, the populations should occur in sympatry, which means that they co-occur within the normal cruising range of the herbivore species. The second condition is that individuals with a different phenotype use different resources. Thirdly, some degree of host preference should be shown. The fourth condition is that fitness consequences are associated with the host preference. Finally, positive assortative mating is the fifth condition for host race formation. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether sympatric speciation via host race formation occurs in nature. This question was addressed by testing these five conditions in part of the Galerucella nymphaeae-complex, the water <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetle,</b> living on Yellow and White waterlily (Nuphar lutea and Nymphaea alba, both Nymphaeaceae) and Amphibious bistort and Great waterdock (Polygonum ampbibium and Rumex hydrolapathum, both Polygonaceae). Furthermore, it was investigated whether morphological and ecological differences have led to reduced gene flow between sympatric populations living on different hosts. Finally, the taxonomic status of the host-associated populations was examined, using molecular DNA techniques. All five conditions for host race formation are met in G. nymphaeae. Furthermore, RAPD analysis revealed that gene flow is indeed limited between sympatric beetle populations living on Nymphaeaceae and Polygonaceae. Breeding experiments and ITS- 1 sequence data show that all beetles studied belong to one biological species. Thus, G. nymphaeae provides an excellent example of host race formation in nature, in which all conditions were tested and met. Hence, host race formation, and eventually sympatric species, is possible in nature, even when none of the hosts is recently introduce...|$|R
40|$|Modern farming {{practices}} create inhospitable {{environments for}} natural enemies reducing {{their capacity to}} control pest insects. Conservation biological control (CBC) is a practice that aims to provide natural enemies with the resources they lack. This thesis investigated the potential of CBC for two important horticultural pests, the cabbage root fly Delia radicum and the <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetle</b> Lilioceris lilii. The natural enemy complex of L. lilii larvae in Sweden is unknown, so a survey was conducted to collect information on the types of natural enemies present and the levels of parasitism. Four larval parasitoids of L. lilii were found, in varying relative abundance depending on the regions surveyed. Parasitism ranged between 21 and 57 % depending on year and region. A three-year field experiment in the south-east of Sweden investigated CBC-based pest management for D. radicum that relied on within-field habitat manipulation practices. Nectar resources for the parasitoid Trybliographa rapae and perennial grass as overwintering habitat for epigeal predators were combined in conservation strips (CS). It was found that providing vegetative resources within the crop potentially improved the conditions for natural enemies of D. radicum. Activity density of the predator and pupal parasitoid Aleochara bipustulata was higher in plots with CS, {{at the time of}} D. radicum egg-laying, in two out of three years. In 2009 this was associated with a significant {{reduction in the number of}} infested cabbage plants. Other natural enemies, such as Cynipoidae wasps, were also more abundant in plots with CS. A parallel semi-field experiment showed that T. rapae could parasitise significantly more D. radicum larvae when given access to flowering buckwheat plants. However, parasitism by T. rapae and A. bipustulata was not higher in field plots with CS in any study years. On the other hand, egg-laying by D. radicum was not enhanced despite the provision of food plants which were not solely selective for natural enemies...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{highlights}} the practical {{application of a}} Piper-based botanical insecticide for controlling insect pests {{of the home and}} garden in urban areas in eastern Canada and northeastern North America. Biopesticides, including botanicals, can offer a safe and effective alternative to conventional insecticides for controlling major insect pests within an IPM program. Secondary compounds from the Piperaceae family, specifically the abundant isobutyl amides and lignans, have shown promise for insecticidal applications. A method for extraction and HPLC-MS analysis of Piper spp. was developed in order to allow quick and accurate measure of piperamide levels in P. nigrum, P. tuberculatum, West African Guinea pepper, P. guineense Schum and Thonn, and in less recognized species from Central America. Extraction of leaf and peppercorn material with 50 : 50 ethyl acetate and water provided a greater than 80 % recovery of spiked piperine. HPLC analysis using a binary gradient of acetonitrile and water provided a clean separation of the major amide peaks between 5 and 12 min. The use of APCI-MS improved the detection limit 10 fold below the 2 -ng limit of the HPLC-DAD method. Extracts from P. nigrum, P. guineense and P. tuberculatum were tested for efficacy against insects from five orders. Among the insect pests tested, the most sensitive species were, in order of increasing lethal concentration: Eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum F. < European pine sawfly larvae, Neodiprion sertifer Geoffroy < spindle ermine moth larvae, Yponomeuta cagnagella Hubner < Viburnum leaf beetle larvae, Pyrrhalta viburni Paykull < stripped cucumber beetle adult, Acalymma vittatum Fabrcius < Colorado potato beetle adult, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) < Japanese beetle adult, Popillia japonica Newman < hairy chinch bug, Blissus leucopterus hirtus Montandon. Greenhouse trials revealed that the pepper formulations also had a repellent activity thus protecting plant leaves from: (1) herbivory by <b>lily</b> leaf <b>beetles,</b> Lilioceris lilii (Scopoli) adults and larvae, and striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum F. adults and (2) oviposition by European corn borer, Ostrina nubilalis (Hubner). When an insecticide resistant strain of potato beetle larvae was tested with the P. tuberculatum extract, there was less than a two fold tolerance ratio compared to the 22 -fold tolerance ratio to cypermethrin, a pyrethroid. An in vitro polysubstrate monoxygenase (PSMO) enzyme assay, using the substrate methoxyresorufin O-demethylation (MROD), determined that piperine, is responsible for inhibition of that specific enzyme. A subsequent toxicokinetic study determined that piperine is quickly eliminated from the exoskeleton (t 1 / 2 = 16. 5 h) and hemolymph (t 1 / 2 = 12 h) of the adult American cockroach Periplaneta americana L. after a topical application.
