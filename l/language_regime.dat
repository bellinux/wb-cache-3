40|$|In the European Union <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> debate, theorists of {{multiculturalism}} and cosmopolitanism have framed their arguments {{in reference to}} different theories of justice and democracy. Philippe Van Parijs advocates the diffusion of a lingua franca, namely English, as means of changing {{the scale of the}} justificatory community to the European level and allowing the creation of a transnational demos. Paradoxically, one key dimension of democracy has hardly been addressed in this discussion: the question of the democratic legitimacy of <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> choices and citizens’ preferences on the different <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> scenarios. Addressing the question of the congruence of language policy choices operated by national and European elites and ordinary citizens’ preferences, this paper argues first that the dimension of democratic legitimacy is crucial and needs {{to be taken into account}} in discussions around linguistic justice. Criticizing the assumption of a direct correspondence between individuals’ language learning choices and citizens’ <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> preferences made by different authors, the analysis shows the ambivalence of citizens’ preferences measured by survey data.

40|$|There are {{two main}} aims of this dissertation: to present a legal and ideological history of the {{formation}} of the <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> in Turkey in the Republican period; and to analyze its transformation in the post- 1980 era. A <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> is defined in this dissertation as a de jure or de facto regulation of the linguistic behavior, in its content or in its status, within a space of communicative action, such as that of a nation-state or a speech group. In other words, a <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> is a system of the governance of the linguistic domain within a defined political territory by planning and employment of particular policies. Language ideologies, on the other hand, are inseparable aspects of the formulation and operation of the language regimes. Such a conception of language enables an analysis of language as a domain of social and political power. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation, the history of the language politics in the Republican Turkey is analyzed through the concept of <b>language</b> <b>regime,</b> and the ideological repercussions pertaining to the designation and practicing of these regimes are assessed. The second part concentrates on the changes in post- 1980 s, within a globalizing environment, in the broadcasting policies and the ways in which language regimes have been transformed.

In line with authors who have analysed internationalisation at Danish universities as an uneven and differentiated process due to the counter discourse of immigration prevailing on the Danish labour market [Valentin, 2012, Caught between internationalization and immigration.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{elaboration}} of {{a theoretical framework}} we developed in the introductory chapter of our co-edited volume, State Traditions and <b>Language</b> <b>Regimes</b> (McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2015). Using a historical institutionalism approach derived from political science, we argue that language policies need to {{be understood in terms}} of their historical and institutional context. The concept of ‘state tradition’ focuses our attention on the relative autonomy of the state in terms of its normative and institutional traditions that lead to particular path dependencies of language policy choices, subject to change at critical junctures. ‘Language regime’ is the conceptual link between state traditions and language policy choices: it allows us to analytically conceptualize how and why these choices are made and how and why they change. We suggest that our framework offers a more robust analysis of language politics than other approaches found in sociolinguistics and normative theory. It also challenges political science to become more engaged with scholarly debate on language policy and linguistic diversity...|$|R

40|$|Like other linguistically diverse institutions, the European Union {{promotes}} conflicting {{values as}} it chooses official languages. Increased activism and {{the admission of}} new states threaten a language-policy crisis. One approach to a solution is to analyze more carefully than before the universe of possible language regimes for institutions like the EU and the justifications for deeming any alternative "optimal. " We can define a <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> {{as a set of}} official languages and a set of rules permitting complete mutual comprehension in a "deliberation " among representatives of language groups. If only the groups ' languages and one synthetic language are relevant, if the representatives are monolingual, if translators are bilingual, and if other simplifications are assumed, there are almost five times as many potentially optimal language regimes as language groups (e. g. with nine groups, 40). We can partition the language regimes into ten classes, distinguished by their official languages and whether they translate directly, via intermediate group languages, or via the synthetic language. The duration and urgency of the deliberation, the capacity of translation facilities, the importance of language equality, the distribution of group sizes, and the relative cost of learning the synthetic language are some conditions that determine which <b>language</b> <b>regime</b> is optimal. The prevailing conditions in the EU create a clear choice between two families of language regimes. One family satisfies the professed norm of equal language treat ment by making either none or all of the groups ' languages official. The other family, by making only the largest languages official, systematizes the common EU practice of sacrificing language equality for cost reduction. A victory for one normative position would favor a corresponding <b>language</b> <b>regime,</b> but a continued daily normative struggle would tend to produce complex variation in language regimes across EU agencies...|$|E

Access to the legitimate language, distribution of linguistic capital and strategies of legitimization and de?legitimization in specific fields like adult language schooling can indicate how social inequalities and hierarchies are constructed. In this paper, I focus on Catalan language classes provided to Moroccan immigrant women in a small town north of Barcelona. Basing my analysis on a set of qualitative data collected between December 2013 and January 2014, I argue that these classes contradict public policies that promote the use of Catalan.

40|$|The {{management}} of multilingualism in the European Union (EU) {{has become an}} increasingly debated issue. Some argue that ‘English as a lingua franca' (ELF) should help solve many of the attendant challenges.

In this article, we question {{the relevance of the}} concept of ELF from a language policy perspective, showing that the socioeconomic implications of using ELF are no different from those of using English only. We examine the costs associated with alternative <b>language</b> <b>regimes</b> for the EU, showing that a reduction in the direct costs of European multilingualism through the imposition of a single language merely shifts costs towards citizens whose mother tongue is not English, and that re-labelling it as ‘ELF' makes no difference.

The main research question of this contribution is: What can drawings as parts of School Language Profiles {{tell us about the}} multilingual environments of bilingual families and schools? The analytical framework of spatial and language practices provides a means to talk about how and why certain expressions are chosen and which influences are mentioned in relation to school and family. In particular, the focus is on how heteroglossic spaces are constructed through local/spatial/language practices and how these constructions are represented in the drawings of children. The drawings were collected in a bilingual school in Austria, with Slovene and German as languages of instruction. Children’s drawings present a fine-grained perception of their multilingual surroundings and we see how children refer to home/school in their drawings and distinguish language realities. Findings indicate that <b>language</b> <b>regimes</b> and goals of families and school are in close relation to each other, have influence on each other but do not necessarily always complement each other.
