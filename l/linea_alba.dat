25|$|Guanajuato's {{three main}} {{literary}} figures are Jorge Ibargüengoitia, Juan Ibáñez and Efraín Huerta. Ibargüengoitia {{was one of}} Mexico's most important writers of the 20th century, noted for his satirical works with social themes. Examples of his work include Los relámpagos de agosto, Los pasos de Lopez and Estas ruinas que ves. Ibáñez was a dramatist who {{was active in the}} second half of the 20th century. His best known work is Los caifanes, produced as a movie in 1966. Huerta began as a journalist and movie critic but his fame came as a poet. Some of his works include Absoluto amor, <b>Línea</b> del <b>alba,</b> Poemas de guerra y esperanza, and La rosa primitiva.|$|R
40|$|We report our {{experience}} on clinical outcomes of elderly {{patients who have}} undergone laparoscopic repair for incisional and primary inguinal hernias. Patients and methods To assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic [1 - 5] primary inguinal and incisional repair we reviewed the records of our patients of over 70 years old, who underwent such a procedure from June 2007 to September 2010 : hernia defect size, recurrence, operative time, and procedure-related complications [6] were evaluated and a laparoscopic approach was attempted in all patients who required a mesh repair. We scheduled 42 patients (32 M- 10 F, with 53 wound defects totally) for laparoscopic incisional [7] and primary inguinal hernia repair and we performed 17 surgical repair for incisional hernia and 36 for primary hernia. Of those, 13 were done for incisional hernias with a single defect (24. 5 % recurrence hernias), 4 with multiple defects (7. 54 % recurrence hernias), 12 were performed for unilateral inguinal hernias (22. 56 % recurrence hernias), 16 for bilateral inguinal hernias (30. 08 % recurrence hernias), 4 for umbilical hernias (1 recurrence hernias), 2 for epigastric and <b>linea</b> <b>alba’s</b> hernias, and 2 for rectum diastasis. The majority of the patients were normal weight with a mean BMI of 25 kg/m 2 (45 %), 38 % 25 > BMI> 30 (overweight), 17 % BMI> 30 (obesity). There was no conversion to an open procedure. The mean operative time was 128 minutes (range: 50 – 325). In all the patients only mesh was used (37. 5 % polypropylene not reabsorbable, 42. 5 % tridimensional polyestercollagen composite mesh, 20 % lightweight multifilament mesh partly reabsorbable) [8]. The meshes were fixed i...|$|R
50|$|Huerta is {{best known}} for his poetry, which he began writing as a student. His first {{publication}} was a poem called El Bajío, appearing in a local paper called La Lucha, followed by Tarde provinciana. His first book was Absoluto amor (Absolute love), published in 1935, but very few copies remain. This success convinced Huerta to dedicate himself full-time to poetry, politics and journalism. Huerta’s first important publication is Los hombres del alba (Men of the dawn), published in 1944, and is considered a classic of 20th century Mexican poetry. In this volume his first works using Mexico City as a subject appears. It was followed by <b>Línea</b> del <b>alba</b> in 1946, with similar themes, a compilation of poems previously published in magazines such as Taller.|$|R
25|$|An incisional hernia {{occurs when}} the defect {{is the result of}} an incompletely healed {{surgical}} wound. When these occur in median laparotomy incisions in the <b>linea</b> <b>alba,</b> they are termed ventral hernias. These can be the most frustrating and difficult to treat, as the repair utilizes already attenuated tissue.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{ligament}} that attaches {{the ovaries}} {{to the body}} wall, which {{may need to be}} broken down so the ovaries can be identified. The ovarian arteries are then ligated with resorbable suture material and then the arteries transected. The uterine body (which is very short in litter-bearing species) and related arteries are also tied off {{just in front of the}} cervix (leaving the cervix as a natural barrier). The entire uterus and ovaries are then removed. The abdomen is checked for bleeding and then closed with a three-layer closure. The <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> and then the subcutaneous layer are closed with resorbable suture material. The skin is then stapled, sutured, or glued closed.|$|E
2500|$|Pigmentation of the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> – linea nigra, (darkening of {{the skin}} in a midline of the abdomen, caused by {{hyperpigmentation}} resulting from hormonal changes, usually appearing around the middle of pregnancy).|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{polyester}} with absorbable layer prosthesis with collagen-elastin/polypropylene prosthesis in {{the repair}} of abdominal wall defects. METHODS: The 16 studied rabbits were divided in groups A and B (euthanized on the 30 th and 60 th days, after the implant of the mesh). The animals underwent laparotomy {{and received a}} 2 cm wall "defect" {{on each side of}} the <b>Alba</b> <b>linea.</b> The repair was made with the suture of a polyester mesh with absorbable film on the left side of the <b>Alba</b> <b>Linea</b> and with collagen-elastin/polypropylene mesh on the right side. Adherences were classified according to Nair Score and microscopic evaluation observing types I and III collagen formation and other immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in adhesion formation. The collagen type I showed higher deposition in polyester with absorbable layer. In group B, the difference between the meshes was significant, with higher collagen III deposition in polyester with absorbable layer (60 º P. O.). About the metalloproteinases, the presence of MMP - 1 and MMP- 8 were about the same; the expression of MMP- 13 increased near to the 60 th day. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant difference between the two meshes in adhesion formation and immunohystochemical evaluation. The polyester mesh resorbable film presented a higher deposition of collagen...|$|R

OBJETIVO: Comparar a tela poliéster com lâmina absorvível e a confeccionada pela aposição da tela de colágeno-elastina/polipropileno no reparo de lesões da parede abdominal. MÉTODOS: Foram avaliados 16 coelhos, divididos aleatoriamente em dois grupos e submetidos a eutanásia no 30 º e no 60 º dia P. O. Os animais foram submetidos à laparotomia e confecção de dois defeitos triangulares de 2 cm, de espessura total, na parede abdominal ventral. A correção foi realizada através de fixação, na metade esquerda da linha alba, da tela de poliéster com lâmina absorvível e na direita, tela composta por colágeno-elastina/polipropileno. As aderências foram classificadas conforme o escore de Nair e a avaliação microscópica incluiu avaliação do colágeno (tipos I e III) e imunoistoquímica. RESULTADOS: Não houve diferença quanto à formação de aderências. O colágeno tipo I apresentou maior concentração com a tela Poliéster com lâmina absorvível. No grupo B foi encontrada diferença significativa entre as telas, com aumento do colágeno tipo III com a tela Poliéster com lâmina absorvível (60 º P. O.). A avaliação das metaloproteinases MMP- 1 e MMP- 8 não apresentaram diferença significativa; a MMP- 13 apresentou aumento significativo na imunoexpressão no 60 º P. O. CONCLUSÕES: Não há diferença significativa entre as telas quanto às aderências e avaliação imunoistoquímica. A tela de poliéster com lâmina absorvível apresenta maior formação de colágeno...|$|R
2500|$|The {{superficial}} {{group is}} subdivided into a lateral and a medial group. [...] In the medial superficial group, {{on both sides}} of the centre of the abdominal wall (the <b>linea</b> <b>alba),</b> the rectus abdominis stretches from the cartilages of ribs V-VII and the sternum down to the pubic crest.

2500|$|The Eurasian teal {{was first}} scientifically named by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of Systema naturae. His Latin {{description}} reads: [...] macula alarum viridi, <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> supra infraque oculos – [...] "a duck with green speculum, a white line {{above and below}} the eyes" [...] – and his primary reference was the bird's description in his earlier work Fauna Svecica. In fact, the description he used in Systema Naturae was the name under which the bird went in the Fauna Svecica, demonstrating the value of his new binomial nomenclature by compressing the long-winded names formerly used in biological classification into much simpler scientific names like Anas crecca. Linnaeus also noted in his description that earlier authors had already written about the Eurasan teal at length: Conrad Gessner had described it in the Historiae animalium as the anas parva ("small duck") among his querquedulae ("teals"); Ulisse Aldrovandi had called it phascade or querquedula minor ("lesser teal"), and was duly referenced by Francis Willughby who named the species querquedula secunda Aldrovandi ("the second teal of Aldrovandus"). John Ray may be credited with formally introducing the name [...] "common teal", while Eleazar Albin called it simply [...] "the teal". As regards the type locality Linnaeus simply remarked that it inhabits freshwater ecosystems in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> (Latin, white line) is a fibrous {{structure}} that {{runs down the}} midline of the abdomen in humans and other vertebrates. In humans <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> runs from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis. The name means white line and the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> is indeed white, being composed mostly of collagen connective tissue.|$|E
50|$|The <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> {{is usually}} present bilaterally.|$|E
50|$|Epigastric hernia: a hernia {{through the}} <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> above the umbilicus.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, when contracting, {{it has the}} {{function}} of tensing the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-line {{a slight}} furrow {{extends from the}} xiphoid process above to the pubic {{symphysis}} below, representing the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> in the abdominal wall. At about its midpoint sits the umbilicus or navel. The rectus abdominis {{on each side of}} the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> stands out in muscular people. The outline of these muscles is interrupted by three or more transverse depressions indicating the tendinous intersections. There is usually one about the xiphoid process, one at the navel, and one in between. It is the combination of the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> and the tendinous intersections which form the abdominal [...] "six-pack" [...] sought after by many people.|$|E
50|$|Where crenation {{is caused}} by parafunctional habits, {{there may also be}} {{associated}} bruxism, <b>linea</b> <b>alba,</b> or morsicatio buccarum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{incision}} for laparotomy a vertical incision {{in the middle}} of the abdomen which follows the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{making the}} {{longitudinal}} inscision for a classical caesarean section the pyramidalis {{is used to}} determine midline and location of the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Other parafunctional {{activity}} {{which may}} occur together with bruxism: cheek biting (which may manifest as morsicatio buccarum and/or <b>linea</b> <b>alba),</b> and/or lip biting.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} line, it interlaces with the {{aponeurosis}} {{of the opposite}} muscle, forming the <b>linea</b> <b>alba,</b> which extends from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis.|$|E
50|$|The fundiform {{ligament}} or fundiform ligament of {{the penis}} is a specialization, thickening, of the superficial (Scarpa's) fascia {{extending from the}} <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> of the lower abdominal wall.|$|E
50|$|The rectus abdominis {{muscle is}} divided {{down the middle}} by the {{tendinous}} line called the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b> It is kept in line by the transverse abdominal and oblique abdominal muscles. During pregnancy, {{the growth of the}} fetus exerts pressure on abdominal cavity muscles, in particular the rectus abdominis. In pregnancies that experience rapid fetus growth or women with particularly weak abdominal muscles, this pressure can sometimes causes the rectus abdominis muscle to separate along the <b>linea</b> <b>alba,</b> creating a split between the left and right sides of the rectus abdominis.|$|E
5000|$|Kustner’s {{incision}} - A transverse incision is made 5 cm {{above the}} symphysis pubis but below the anterior iliac spine. The subcutaneous tissue is then separated in the midline and the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> is exposed. A vertical midline incision is made through the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b> Care {{is taken to}} control and ligate any branches of the superficial epigastric vessels. This step of the incision is usually time consuming {{and is one of}} the limitations associated. This type of incision offers little extensibility and less exposure than a Pfannestiel incision.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{consists}} of mostly connective tissue, and does not contain any primary nerves or blood vessels, a median incision through the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> is a common surgical approach.|$|E
5000|$|Pigmentation of the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> - linea nigra, (darkening of {{the skin}} in a midline of the abdomen, caused by {{hyperpigmentation}} resulting from hormonal changes, usually appearing around the middle of pregnancy).|$|E
50|$|The {{superficial}} {{group is}} subdivided into a lateral and a medial group. In the medial superficial group, {{on both sides}} of the centre of the abdominal wall (the <b>linea</b> <b>alba),</b> the rectus abdominis stretches from the cartilages of ribs V-VII and the sternum down to the pubic crest. At the lower end of the rectus abdominis, the pyramidalis tenses the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b> The lateral superficial muscles, the transversus and external and internal oblique muscles, originate on the rib cage and on the pelvis (iliac crest and inguinal ligament) and are attached to the anterior and posterior layers of the sheath of the rectus.|$|E
50|$|The rectus abdominis {{is a long}} flat muscle, {{which extends}} along the whole length of {{the front of the}} abdomen, and is {{separated}} from its fellow of the opposite side by the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Superiorly, the fleshy {{portion of}} the muscle passes upward, {{diminishing}} in size as it ascends, and ends by a pointed extremity which is inserted into the <b>linea</b> <b>alba,</b> midway between the umbilicus and pubis.|$|E
50|$|In extreme cases, diastasis recti is {{corrected}} {{during the}} cosmetic surgery procedure {{known as an}} abdominoplasty by creating a plication or folding of the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> and suturing together. This creates a tighter abdominal wall.|$|E
50|$|This {{muscle is}} the {{innermost}} abdominal muscle. Its origin {{is the second}} sheet of the lumbodorsal fascia and the pelvic girdle and its insertion is the <b>linea</b> <b>alba.</b> Its action is the compression of the abdomen.|$|E
50|$|The {{distance}} between {{the right and left}} rectus abdominis muscles is created by the stretching of the <b>linea</b> <b>alba,</b> a connective collagen sheath created by the aponeurosis insertions of the transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique.|$|E
50|$|The pyramidalis {{muscle is}} small and triangular. It {{is located in the}} lower abdomen in front of the rectus abdominis. It {{originates}} at the pubic bone and is inserted into the <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> halfway up to the navel.|$|E
50|$|This muscle's origin is the lumbodorsal fascia and ribs. Its {{insertion}} {{is at the}} pubis and <b>linea</b> <b>alba</b> (via aponeurosis), and its {{action is}} the compression of abdominal contents. It also laterally flexes and rotates the vertebral column.|$|E
