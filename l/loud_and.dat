5|$|Lightning Bolt {{are known}} for their guerrilla-style live performances, where they {{typically}} play on the ground rather than a stage, with the crowd gathered around them. The band's sound is typically <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> aggressive, though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as compositional influences.|$|E
5|$|Martin Phipps {{composed}} the score for North & South. The short piano tune is played {{throughout the whole}} series in different rhythms. The music is especially <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> clear whenever there is {{a turning point in}} the relationship between Margaret and Thornton.|$|E
5|$|Sanjeev Bhaskar has a cameo {{role as a}} <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> {{offensive}} restaurant patron (who {{refers to}} Meg Ryan as the actress who has an orgasm every time she's taken out {{for a cup of}} coffee) in the restaurant Anna and Will visit.|$|E

60|$|A {{minute later}} {{there was a}} faint moaning sound, which grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder.</b>|$|R
5|$|Speech {{assessment}} {{also contributes}} to assessment of mood, for example people with mania or anxiety may have rapid, <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> pressured speech; {{on the other hand}} depressed patients will typically have a prolonged speech latency and speak in a slow, quiet and hesitant manner.|$|E
5|$|A <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found}} in pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple's live {{shows were}} from the start very <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> hard rocking and their stage set {{included}} stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses. The dualism between Blackmore's flamboyant guitar playing, which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch, and Lord's rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage, but it would soon {{become an integral part}} of the band's dynamics.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{from somewhere}} {{out of the}} air came a humming sound. It grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> the boys felt a strange suction of wind which made them hold tightly to the rail for fear of being pulled {{overboard}} by some uncanny force. There followed a <b>loud</b> snap <b>and</b> a crash, and the mast began to come down.|$|R
50|$|The band {{performed}} live often, {{and their}} performances became <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> harsher and often included extended improvisations.|$|R
60|$|That gentle {{fluttering}} {{was a sweet}} lullaby, and Bobby {{slept and}} dreamed--he dreamed that the fluttering became <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> that, instead of birds, it {{was a group of}} angels that shook their wings and stood around him as he slept.|$|R
5|$|The design's lack of {{structural}} integrity {{is seen as}} another significant weakness of the Quad ESL-63 since its inception, and lived on in its various successors. Other shortcomings include very limited sound pressure levels, meaning that it won't play <b>loud,</b> <b>and</b> its bass response was lacking. In addition, one reviewer experienced problems with shut-downs playing music with high intensity bass drums.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Stowe's {{writings}} about Florida were duly noted by authorities. Her brother Charles purchased his own land upon her recommendation, not in Mandarin but in Newport near Tallahassee. During {{a visit to}} his home in 1874, she and a few Northern investors had an audience with Governor Marcellus Stearns. They were met by his cabinet and staff {{on the steps of the}} state capitol building—which was festooned with greenery and a large welcome sign for the occasion—and they gave Stowe a round of <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> exuberant cheers.|$|E
5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
60|$|The dawn broke, and the {{awakening}} {{hum of the}} city grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder.</b> Peter rose <b>and</b> stretched himself.|$|R
60|$|It was done, and in {{ten minutes}} the men were all at quarters, while the thunder rolled <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> overhead, <b>and</b> the breeze freshened fast.|$|R
60|$|He spoke <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> as Tressilian, by whom he {{felt himself}} overawed, got farther and farther out of hearing.|$|R
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud {{to each other and}} then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|In the series' story, the Nemesis is {{the result}} of infecting a Tyrant — a {{humanoid}} bio-weapon created to be the ultimate lifeform—with a parasitic organism designed to increase its intelligence. Upon infection, the parasite takes control of the Tyrant's nervous system, forming its own brain and enabling it to follow precise instructions and make decisions without a need for constant direction. Clothed in black trousers, an overcoat, boots, and gloves, the Nemesis is armed with a rocket launcher mounted on its left arm. To emphasize its design as a prototype, the game developers left exposed muscles on its body and added stitches to cover the right eye. Upon spotting its target, it says the target's name out <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> attacks.|$|E
60|$|Crack, crack, {{went the}} whip; the dogs yelped with eagerness,--they don't bark, those Northern dogs; the little Kamschatkadale bawled <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> never saw when Lucy rolled off behind, and {{was left in}} the middle of a huge snowdrift, while he flew on with his load.|$|R
6000|$|... [MAX {{attempts}} {{once more}} to approach THEKLA. WALLENSTEIN [...] prevents him. MAX stands irresolute, and in [...] apparent anguish. In the mean time the stage fills [...] more and more; and the horns sound from below [...] <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> each time after a shorter [...] interval.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} a deep, mournful sound was heard. <b>Louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> it rose, <b>and</b> then {{gradually}} died away. The soldiers stood as if paralysed. Even the high official--who had been obliged {{to leave his}} horse, and make {{his way across the}} fallen blocks on foot--stepped back a pace, with an expression of awe. He soon recovered himself, and shouted angrily to the men to go on. But again the dirge-like noise rose, <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder.</b> It swelled, <b>and</b> then as gradually died away; but this time with a quavering modulation.|$|R
5|$|My {{situation}} is most critical, not from anything the enemy can do, {{but from the}} disposition of the people– The Population, believe me is essentially bad– A full belief possesses them that this Province must inevitably succumb– This Prepossession is fatal to every exertion– Legislators, Magistrates, Militia Officers, all, have imbibed the idea, and are so sluggish and indifferent in all their respective offices that the artful and active scoundrel is allowed to parade the Country without interruption, and commit all imaginable mischief... What a change an additional regiment would make {{in this part of}} the Province! Most of the people have lost all confidence– I however speak <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> look big.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and <b>loud,</b> <b>and</b> {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
60|$|<b>Louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> grew {{the sounds}} of the chase; then the deep tones of the hounds were {{exchanged}} for a fierce angry barking.|$|R
60|$|The cry rose again, {{a trifle}} <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> George nodded complacently.|$|R
60|$|Tommy {{immediately}} whistled, a <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more glorious note than before.|$|R
5|$|The Simpsons go to {{the local}} movie theater to see a film. Bart and Lisa see Space Mutants VI, while Homer, Marge, and Maggie see The Stockholm Affair. As the film starts, Homer acts <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> obnoxious, {{embarrassing}} Marge. When he gives away the film's ending, Marge berates him and the audience heckles Homer, embarrassing them both. During the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer will not accept it, by dropping Marge and the children off at home and goes off on a long drive into the night, finally stopping at a redneck bar called Beer 'N' Brawl, where he grabs a beer while listening to an attractive waitress named Lurleen Lumpkin performing on stage. She sings a song that follows Homer's current state with every detail, and once she finishes, Homer introduces himself to her.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is a <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> vocal species, {{and makes}} a variety of calls. Its main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can be silent when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.|$|E
5|$|The floury baker's {{distinctive}} {{appearance and}} loud call make it popular with children. Both the common and genus name {{are derived from}} the white, flour-like filaments covering the adult body. Its body and eyes are generally brown with pale patterns including a light-coloured line along the midline of the pronotum. Its forewings have distinctive dark brown patches {{at the base of}} two of their apical cells. The female is larger than the male, although species size overall varies geographically, with larger animals associated with regions of higher rainfall. The male has distinctive genitalia and a <b>loud</b> <b>and</b> complex call generated by the frequent buckling of ribbed tymbals and amplified by abdominal air sacs.|$|E
50|$|For we {{who grew}} up tall and proudIn {{the shadow of the}} {{mushroom}} cloudConvinced our voices can't be heardWe just wanna scream it <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> louderWhat the hell we fighting forJust surrender and it won't hurt at allYou've just got time to say your prayersWhile you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.|$|R
60|$|The noise grew <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> <b>louder,</b> <b>and</b> {{from where}} she stood now--it {{seemed to her that}} she could trace in her mind the {{progress}} of the rebels, as they spread themselves from the foot of the Palatine and from the Forum, upwards to the heights until they had the palace of the Cæsar completely surrounded.|$|R
60|$|As {{the time}} went on, the roaring became <b>louder</b> <b>and</b> more continuous.|$|R
