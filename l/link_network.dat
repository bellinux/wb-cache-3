25|$|Parliament {{decided in}} 1957 that a {{national}} television network should be built. The main concern was transmission lines to the terrestrial transmitters. Using telephone lines required 300 lines. The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment and Nera developed technology which made this possible. NATO had financed a radio <b>link</b> <b>network</b> for the military, which the latter had offered NRK to use. This was largely used as a bargaining chip to either crate acceptance for the plan within the Telegraphy Administration, or allow NRK to take control over {{the construction of the}} transmission system. The tactics worked and the Telegraphy Administration accepted in February 1957 the construction of a television network.|$|E

The Signal Box reuses the sign {{from the former}} Kidderminster Station Signal Box whilst the lever frame is from Acton Yard. Most lines under the signal box's control are track circuited, the notable exception is No. 1 engine line. The line between Kidderminster and Bewdley South is worked by acceptance lever, thus avoiding the need for physical tokens.

The main advantage of functional <b>link</b> <b>networks</b> (compared to multilayer perceptrons trained with the backpropagation learning rule) is that they are easier to train, and that insight may be gained in the problem that it solves.
