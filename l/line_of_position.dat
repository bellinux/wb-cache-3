25|$|Aligning two {{fixed points}} on land {{provides}} a navigator with a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> called a {{range in the}} U.S. and a transit in Britain. Ranges {{can be used to}} precisely align a vessel within a narrow channel such as in a river. With landmarks of a range illuminated with a set of fixed lighthouses, nighttime navigation is possible.|$|E
25|$|The last voice {{transmission}} received on Howland Island from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (running N–S on 157–337 degrees) which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland. After all contact was lost with Howland Island, {{attempts were made}} to reach the flyers with both voice and Morse code transmissions. Operators across the Pacific and the United States may have heard signals from the downed Electra but these were unintelligible or weak.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{approximately}} one hour after Earhart's last recorded message, the USCGC Itasca undertook an ultimately unsuccessful search {{north and west}} of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the aircraft. The United States Navy soon joined the search and {{over a period of}} about three days sent available resources to the search area in the vicinity of Howland Island. The initial search by the Itasca involved running up the 157/337 <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> to the NNW from Howland Island. The Itasca then searched the area to the immediate NE of the island, corresponding to the area, yet wider than the area searched to the NW. Based on bearings of several supposed Earhart radio transmissions, some of the search efforts were directed to a specific position on a line of 281 degrees (approximately northwest) from Howland Island without evidence of the flyers. Four days after Earhart's last verified radio transmission, on July 6, 1937, the captain of the battleship Colorado received orders from the Commandant, Fourteenth Naval District to take over all naval and coast guard units to coordinate search efforts.|$|E
50|$|It was phase {{comparison}} at {{this common}} frequency {{that resulted in}} the hyperbolic <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position.</b> The interval between two adjacent hyperbolas on which the signals are in phase was called a lane. Since the wavelength of the common frequency was small compared with the distance between the Master and Slave stations there were many possible <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> for a given phase difference, and so a unique position could not be arrived at by this method.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{navigator}} draws two <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position,</b> {{and they}} intersect {{he must be}} at that position. [...] A fix is the intersection {{of two or more}} LOPs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to bearings, navigators also often measure distances to objects. [...] On the chart, a distance produces a circle or arc <b>of</b> <b>position.</b> [...] Circles, arcs, and hyperbolae <b>of</b> <b>positions</b> are {{often referred to}} as <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
500|$|These {{stars are}} {{typically}} used {{in two ways}} by the navigator. [...] The first is to obtain a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> by use of a sextant observation and the techniques of celestial navigation. [...] Multiple lines of position can be intersected to obtain a position known as a celestial fix. [...] The second typical use of the navigational stars is to determine gyrocompass error by computing the azimuth of a star and comparing it to an azimuth measured using the ship's gyrocompass. [...] Numerous other applications also exist.|$|E
2500|$|In 1631, Pierre Vernier {{described}} his newly invented quadrant that was accurate to one minute of arc. [...] In theory, {{this level of}} accuracy could give a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> within a nautical mile of the navigator's actual position.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{researchers}} believe that the Electra ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and that Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. The plane would have carried enough fuel to reach Howland with some extra to spare. The extra fuel would cover some contingencies such as headwinds and searching for Howland. The plane could fly a compass course toward Howland through the night. In the morning, the time of apparent sunrise would allow the plane to determine its <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (a sun line that ran 157–337). From that line, the plane could determine how much further it must travel before reaching a parallel sun line that ran through Howland. At 6:14 AM Itasca time, Earhart estimated they were 200 miles away from Howland. As the plane closed with Howland, it {{expected to be in}} radio contact with Itasca. With the radio contact, the plane should be able to use radio direction finding (RDF) to head directly for the Itasca and Howland. Unfortunately, the plane was not receiving a radio signal from Itasca, so it would be unable to determine an RDF bearing to the ship. Although Itasca was receiving HF radio signals from the plane, it did not have HF RDF equipment, so it could not determine a bearing to the plane. The communications going to the plane were almost non-existent. Consequently, the plane was not directed to Howland; it was left on its own with little fuel. Presumably, the plane reached the parallel sun line and started searching for Howland on that <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position.</b> At 7:42 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We must be on you, but cannot see you – but gas is running low. Have been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." [...] At 8:43 AM, Earhart reported, [...] "We are on the line 157 337. We will repeat this message. We will repeat this on 6210 kilocycles. Wait." ...|$|E
50|$|When resecting or {{fixing a}} position, the {{geometric}} strength (angular disparity) of the mapped points affects the {{precision and accuracy}} of the outcome. Accuracy increases as the angle between the two position lines approaches 90 degrees. Magnetic bearings are observed on the ground from the point under location to two or more features shown on a map <b>of</b> the area. <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> reverse bearings, or <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position,</b> are then drawn on the map from the known features; two and more lines provide the resection point (the navigator's location). When three or more <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> are utilized, the method is often popularly (though erroneously) referred to as triangulation (in precise terms, using three or more <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> is still correctly called resection, as angular law of tangents (cot) calculations are not performed). When using a map and compass to perform resection, {{it is important to}} allow for the difference between the magnetic bearings observed and grid north (or true north) bearings (magnetic declination) of the map or chart.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes on the {{development}} of a hybrid location and positioning (L&P) system by combining range measurements and angle measurements for a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. The proposed hybrid technique called as hybrid multiple linear <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (HMLLOP) algorithm extends the fundamental idea of using the multiple linear <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (MLLOP) scheme when extra information in the form of direction of arrival (DOA) measurements at a minimum of three base stations (BSs) is available. The technique explores the use <b>of</b> multiple <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (LOP) instead <b>of</b> circular LOP and determines new lower and upper bounds of DOA according to the measurements obtained from an MLLOP scheme which aims to minimize the DOA error caused by non-line of sight (NLOS) propagation. Simulation results have been provided that show that the proposed hybrid schemes outperform the range-only algorithm in terms of estimated location accuracy. It has been shown that time of arrival (TOA) -based location {{can be used as a}} baseline location estimation technique, with additional DOA measurements being used to further improve accuracy...|$|R

2500|$|In 1988, The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) {{began an}} {{investigation}} of the Earhart/Noonan disappearance and since then has sent ten research expeditions to Gardner Island/Nikumaroro. They have suggested Earhart and Noonan may have flown without further radio transmissions {{for two and a half}} hours along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> Earhart noted in her last transmission received at Howland, then found the then-uninhabited Gardner Island, landed the Electra on an extensive reef flat near the wreck of a large freighter (the [...] ) on the northwest side of the atoll, and ultimately perished. In 2012, a photograph taken in October 1937 of the reef at Nikumaroro after her disappearance was enhanced. According to the analysts who viewed it, [...] "a blurry object sticking out of the water in the lower left corner of the black-and-white photo is consistent with a strut and wheel of a Lockheed Electra landing gear".|$|E
2500|$|Through a {{combined}} sequence of misunderstandings or mishaps (that are still controversial), over scattered clouds, the final approach to Howland Island failed, although Earhart stated by radio {{that they believed}} {{they were in the}} immediate vicinity of Howland. The strength of the transmissions received indicated that Earhart and Noonan were indeed in the vicinity of Howland island, but could not find it and after numerous more attempts it appeared that the connection had dropped. The last transmission received from Earhart indicated she and Noonan were flying along a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (taken from a [...] "sun line" [...] running on 157–337 degrees) which Noonan would have calculated and drawn on a chart as passing through Howland. Two-way radio contact was never established, and the aviators and their aircraft disappeared somewhere over the Central Pacific Ocean. Despite an unprecedented, extensive search by the U.S. Navy—including the use of search aircraft from an aircraft carrier—and the U.S. Coast Guard, no traces of them or their Electra were ever found.|$|E
2500|$|David Jourdan, {{a former}} Navy submariner and ocean {{engineer}} specializing in deep-sea recoveries, has claimed any transmissions attributed to Gardner Island were false. Through his company Nauticos he extensively searched a [...] quadrant {{north and west}} of Howland Island during two deep-sea sonar expeditions (2002 and 2006, total cost $4.5million) and found nothing. The search locations were derived from the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> (157–337) broadcast by Earhart on July 2, 1937. Nevertheless, Elgen Long's interpretations have led Jourdan to conclude, [...] "The analysis of all the data we have – the fuel analysis, the radio calls, other things – tells me {{she went into the}} water off Howland." [...] Earhart's stepson George Palmer Putnam Jr. has been quoted as saying he believes [...] "the plane just ran out of gas". Susan Butler, author of the Earhart biography East to the Dawn, says she thinks the aircraft went into the ocean out of sight of Howland Island and rests on the seafloor at a depth of [...] Tom D. Crouch, Senior Curator of the National Air and Space Museum, has said the Earhart/Noonan Electra is [...] "18,000 ft. down" [...] and may even yield a range of artifacts that could rival the finds of the Titanic, adding that [...] "the mystery is part of what keeps us interested. In part, we remember her because she's our favorite missing person." ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Interference of satellite communications {{is a frequent}} and ongoing concern for both DoD and civilian enterprises. Geolocation of the interfering source is an essential step in mitigating or eliminating the interference and restoring operation of the communications service. Existing techniques to locate sources of such interference are not applicable to newer satellite communications systems. This thesis offers an innovative method for locating interference that takes advantage of modern multi-antenna satellites. The location of a source of radio frequency interference can be determined by comparing the received signal strength across multiple antennas on the same satellite. The difference between signal strength'as received by the satellite antennas'can be computed and plotted as <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> {{on the surface of}} the Earth. The intersection of two or more <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position</b> represents the location of the interfering transmitter. An advantage of this method is that it is completely passive and can be done in real time. The size and accuracy of the resultant geolocation area are a function of a number of different factors, including terrestrial latitude of the interfering transmitter, the accuracy of the signal strength measurement, and the geometry <b>of</b> the intersecting <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>position.</b> Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
