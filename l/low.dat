5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} western coast of Africa on September26, quickly spawning {{an area of}} <b>low</b> pressure. Upon {{the formation of the}} <b>low,</b> the wave split into two pieces and a second area of <b>low</b> pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west. The northern <b>low</b> quickly developed, spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September28. The southern <b>low</b> attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression. It continued through the Atlantic, entering the Pacific Ocean, after crossing Central America, on October8. A broad area of <b>low</b> pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275miles (440kilometres) south of Acapulco, Mexico. However, the <b>low</b> remained disorganized because of strong upper-level winds. On October13, the <b>low</b> became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear. The <b>low</b> developed enough convection late on October14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen-E while located about 435mi (705km) southwest of Colima, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of <b>low</b> {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) {{to the east of}} Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level <b>low.</b> The surface <b>low</b> and the upper-level <b>low</b> turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface <b>low</b> developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level <b>low,</b> preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level <b>low</b> building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|E
5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute <b>low</b> back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute <b>low</b> back pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic <b>low</b> back pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was <b>low</b> and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for <b>low</b> back pain.|$|E

On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all <b>low</b> speed devices, to allow the host to send a single <b>low</b> speed packet to <b>low</b> speed devices. After the <b>low</b> speed packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to <b>low</b> speed devices again.|$|E
5|$|A <b>low</b> {{pressure}} area {{moved to}} the west off the Burmese coast on July 5 and developed into a depression {{the next day in}} the north central Bay of Bengal. The depression intensified as it {{moved to the}} northwest, becoming a deep depression on July 7. The system made landfall on the Orissa coast during the morning of July 8 and rapidly degenerated into a broad area of <b>low</b> pressure overland. The remnant <b>low</b> moved north over western Bihar and it persisted there until July 12 when it was absorbed by the monsoon trough.|$|E

Conversely, the <b>lowest</b> yield was obtained at highest methanol/oil molar ratio (6.0) and <b>lowest</b> catalyst amount (0.70).

5|$|A non-tropical area of <b>low</b> pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level <b>low</b> imparted high wind shear and dry air entrainment, and the depression degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the <b>low</b> moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} strong <b>low</b> {{pressure}} systems formed across the southern Great Plains on February 4, contributing to record warmth on February 4 and 5 {{in the southern}} Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley. High temperatures across many areas reached the 70s°F (21–26°C), and in Alabama temperatures reached the <b>low</b> 80s°F (27°C) with dew points in the middle 60s° (17–20°C). Dewpoints in the mid 60s°F were recorded {{as far north as}} Memphis. A strong cold front trailing the <b>low</b> pressure area approached the region from the west.|$|E
5|$|A wake <b>low,</b> or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake <b>low.</b> Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake <b>low</b> when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake <b>low</b> is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake <b>low.</b> Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake <b>low</b> associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E

5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. <b>Low</b> purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is <b>low,</b> although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were <b>low,</b> the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a <b>low</b> purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is <b>low.</b> Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

5|$|An active trough of <b>low</b> {{pressure}} {{exited the}} East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed <b>low</b> pressure area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the <b>low</b> in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the <b>low</b> organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
