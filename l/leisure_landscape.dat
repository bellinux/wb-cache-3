These leisurescapes are increasingly becoming significant sites for the construction of individual and shared frameworks in which people orient themselves and act in wider society. Drawing on international contributions by leading researchers in the field this book aims to map out the complex relationship that leisure has with place. A key signature of the text will be to illustrate the transdisciplinarity of this key feature of leisure studies, and by doing so offer, for the first time, a more rounded and inclusive approach to the study of leisure and place. It also aims to explore and elucidate the extent in which leisure places and spaces form, affect and influence personal, social and collective identitie...|$|E

40|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is {{the birthplace}} of Islam and has a {{religious}} role and obligation in the Islamic world. Since the discovery of oil in 1936, Saudi Arabia has undergone rapid modernisation. The rise in oil prices in 2004 has made the country enjoy unprecedented revenue, {{which has led to}} increasing governmental spending and an increase in per capita income. This has encouraged {{the public and private sectors}} to create leisure spaces for domestic tourists. However, the development of new leisure spaces has faced strong opposition and criticism from the religious establishment, which views the new modern leisure spaces as a threat to the local culture that could encourage non-Islamic forms of social activities, and undermine the traditions of segregation between the two genders that currently shape the traditional Saudi society. This research is focused upon a better understanding of how globalisation and modernisation have shaped leisure spaces in a country where gender segregation is fundamental to the culture. It aims to understand how gender relationships are expressed in the new modern leisure spaces in Saudi Arabia. Determining the different characteristics of gender segregation in <b>leisure</b> spaces and <b>landscapes</b> will contribute to the development of more culturally sensitive and sustainable leisure strategies, and will enhance and improve the management of <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The study uses a qualitative research approach in different settings within two case study regions in Saudi Arabia. It identifies the different types and characteristics of gender segregation in <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The findings revealed that the domestic sphere of gendered relationships is being reinvented and re-expressed as family-based, quasi-public <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The study also indicates that the new leisure spaces are liminal enclaves that are re-embedding new practices from the global society into a conservative society...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{contemporary}} urban waterfronts rarely looks {{below the surface}} to question the importance, role and condition of water in these settings, or the physical experiences these landscapes enable. Academics are often guilty of the same distant, spectacularised viewpoint for which they criticise waterfronts&# 039; designers and clients. This paper examines public perceptions and uses of urban waterfront <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes,</b> focusing on the careful shaping of the land/water interface. It explores how designers control geographic, climatological, hydrological and urbanistic dimensions of the waterscape to create idealised urban settings that optimise consumptive leisure and place promotion. The international case studies include artificial beaches, lagoons, rivers and indoor waterscapes. The analysis foregrounds four aspects of the artificiality of urban waterfronts: taming the landscape to provide comfort and safety; augmenting the landscape to provide varied sensory stimulation; carefully positioning the waterfront within a wider climatic, thematic and functional context; and managing the temporal dimension of visitor experience...|$|R
40|$|Artists Sarah Cole and Anne Eggebert {{present their}} works Chigwell Row Wood, Nest, and Folly to {{critically}} reassess {{the interface between}} reproduction and reception {{in the construction of}} the contemporary landscape. Ancient managed woodland, a Basildon primary school, and Valentines Mansion historic house and gardens were their starting points; reflecting on these works the artists considered how their engagement with suburban landscape negotiates issues of participation in, and production of, socio-aesthetic landscape through dialogic processes and the capturing of performative responses to community, place and space. A man reflects upon his feral childhood whilst sitting amongst recently lopped forest trees, a mother writes words with soil upon the gymnasium floor, and a young man flies across the photographic plane, a freerunner challenging the surfaces of the historic folly. Taking the example of Flatford Mill, they consider how the landscape image (Constable’s paintings) mediates and reproduces the ‘real’ worked environment – requiring of the visitor a certain complicity of performance and visualisation of place. These reflections form the basis of their presentation; on how the recently restored historic <b>leisure</b> <b>landscape</b> of Valentines Mansion might be understood through the emergence of new modes of spectatorship, performed in response to contemporary ways of seeing...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since its}} founding, Rome has been {{vulnerable}} to the swelling waters of its Tiber River. This river {{was so important to}} the city that it was a defining character in Rome’s history for over two thousand years. However, this river-city relationship would be suddenly severed in the late 19 th century as Rome was declared the Italian capital. And, with the creation of the capital, came the creation of the river walls. While this new infrastructure safeguarded the city from future flooding, it razed the relationship between the city and its river. It lost its use as a commercial trade route, transportation system and <b>leisure</b> <b>landscape,</b> and before long the Tiber was forgotten. This thesis proposes a design intervention at Rome’s historic river-city site, the Porto di Ripetta. Once the physical and symbolic gateway to the city, the Ripetta is presently the most disconnected site along the Tiber River. Not only does the proposed project aim to synergistically unite a series of complex archaeological layers from antiquity to present-day, it also aspires to reconnect the city to its historical relationship with its river, introduce another layer within Rome’s transportation network, and expand the city’s cultural agenda along its underutilized continuous corridor. The introduction of river-based programme is logical when created within a series of design solutions that both recognize and address the temporal nature of the riverscape. Through in-depth historical analysis, this thesis examines the complexities of the Tiber River’s existence and analyzes its sociological, physical and political importance to the Eternal City. This understanding of the Tiber River’s unique qualities reveals tangible opportunities for new public spaces connected the potential of the Tiber as part of an expanded network of new public transportation, leisure landscapes, and cultural institutions...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} an {{environmental}} and cultural {{history of the}} sandhills region of North Carolina as it was transformed after the Civil War. It brings together agricultural science {{and the creation of}} a leisure industry in the sandhills to argue that they were interdependent in the transformation of the region. Chapter One narrates the gradual emergence and transformation of agricultural science in North Carolina from a venture of learned planters to a state-run institution, located in universities and government buildings, but still heavily influenced by the heirs of planters. Chapter Two examines the trajectory of resort creation in the sandhills after the region had been tapped out and cutover by naval stores producers and loggers. Its remained an agricultural problem area, while its acres of sandy land were available to be remade by developers. Importantly these new investors, like Pinehurst’s James and Leonard Tufts, reconstructed the sandhills to reflect a fantasy of yeoman agriculture—while deploying scientific findings and commercial fertilizers as advocated by state agricultural experts. Chapter Three analyzes a community that developed in the vicinity of Pinehurst after 1910, when a generation of idealistic Northern progressives turned to the sandhills, both to uplift the region and to escape the nervous problems they had experienced in the industrial North. Just as Pinehurst used agricultural science to create a <b>leisure</b> <b>landscape,</b> this group of Ivy Leaguers was inspired by visions of using agricultural technologies to turn the “sand barrens” into a state-of-the-art farmscape. Chapter Four turns to a literary account of the sandhills in the work of Charles Chesnutt, taking Chesnutt’s motif of gift-giving as a lens for understanding the author’s short stories set in the sandhills. This chapter focuses especially on Chesnutt’s conception of usufruct and an economy based in local social connections as an alternative to the version of commodity agriculture that had animated so many other projects in the sandhills. This dissertation reveals how the conceptual and material tools of an industrializing culture reconfigured this region, long seen as barren, from a cutover turpentine district into a tourist paradise...|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands {{the ideal}} of an ‘exotic holiday-destination’ is without any doubt {{strongly}} influenced by {{the image of the}} Mediterranean landscape. It is incorporated in the designing of holiday villages and the enormous increase of these facilities in the last decades has transformed parts of the Netherlands into real <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The encroachment of brick and concrete over the landscape is visible in favourable tourist regions such as the coastal zones and the Veluwe region. The high quality holiday villages sell a subtropical illusion in a country with a temperate maritime climate. The Mediterranean concept became predominant in the design, the range of services and the names of resorts such as Porte Zelande or Porte Grève in the province of Zeeland. The inspiration for the design of Porte Zelande on the Brouwersdam was drawn from Port Grimaud in southern France. Port Grimaud can be considered {{as one of the most}} well-known examples of a radical landscape transformation. In 1962, the architect Spoerry acquired a stretch of marshy land near Saint Tropez.

This spine spans from Mons to Liege and it can be described as a territorial artifact of great diversity, where urbanization has followed the vicissitudes of the machine-age. The region not only represent many challenges in a post-industrial realty, but as well an opportunity to inscribe a series of architectural projects into this territory and in its splendid tradition of man-made modification of the landscape. Framing the problem statement of architecturally reconsider a postindustrial city-region: the aim of the thesis is, to go beyond a project of preservation, <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes</b> and brown-field reclamation. In order to achieve that, the thesis intention has been to bridge a possible economical re-development and social rehabilitation by means of a strategic decentralization of the interventions, which are three large scale and typologically diverse projects situated along the Ring R 3 of Charleroi. The three interventions are a critical attempt to establish new attractor sites in Charleroi, being aware that the downtown is no longer able to provide a public domain that can satisfy the unstable, variegate and complex social condition of the city. Each one of the three interventions embeds three themes (program, site specificities, itinerary); these articulate and characterize the project as a whole.

40|$|The leisure economy, {{consisting}} of the industry cluster of tourism, recreation and leisure, transforms the spatial and socio-economic landscapes of many regions. As a result, regions are ‘leisuring’, experiencing on-going transformative processes {{that are designed to}} foster touristic, recreational and residential demands. This thesis focuses on socio-spatial patterns that emerge, examines directions in which places evolve, distinguishes transitions, and discusses adaptive planning strategies to guide places in their evolution in a meaningful way. The thesis <b>Leisuring</b> <b>Landscapes</b> presents the results of a multiple case study research. The case of the Wadden Sea Region includes how the leisure economy is emerging locally mainly in spite of and not because of a strong restrictive planning regime. The case of the Greater Hague Region examines the influence of planning on peri-urban areas gradually becoming part of the urban fabric and transitioning in the direction of metropolitan parks. The case studies on the Frisian Lake District and Geopark Hondsrug examine whether the planning approach of strategic storytelling is a catalyst for the leisuring of regions. The final case study examines the policy approach of the province of Friesland to stimulate spatial quality – a fundamental pillar of the development of the leisure economy. The thesis draws attention to a nonlinear perspective on how region evolve. It argues that spatial planners should therefore focus on the adaptive capacity of places so to navigate (themselves) through a contextual environment that is changing continually. Moreover, it identifies a set of conditions that help planners to do so that include diversity, experimenting, interaction, networking and creating institutional frameworks that stimulate robustness and flexibility at the same time...|$|R
40|$|This thesis deals, as its {{subtitle}} indicates, with tourism on {{the neighborhood}} level. In it, I provide a comparative {{account of the}} recent history of tourism development in Berlin-Kreuzberg and Harlem, New York. Grounded in a discussion of the forces reconfiguring urban development as well as tourism in the advanced capitalist world, it examines how, by whom, and with what effects the two neighborhoods are re-imagined, re-constructed, and re-experienced as places to visit and explore; unburies the frequently omitted historicity of "slumming" and other niche tourism practices impacting so-called marginalized neighborhoods; elaborates upon the potential of tourism for socially equitable forms of neighborhood development and explores how the old face of tourism is being challenged by the increasingly complex and diverse realities of contemporary travel and leisure. Understanding tourism as a complex, dynamic system rather than simply an industry or process, the thesis pays particular emphasis to the need to rethink the way the demand side of tourism in cities is conceived and made sense of. Whereas tourism consumption in urban research has traditionally been framed as an altogether distinct activity, my research posits that distinctions between tourism and other forms of migration on the one hand as well as tourism and other forms of leisure and place consumption on the other hand have become increasingly blurred. This, I argue, not only brings about significant changes with regard to cities' tourism and <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes.</b> Rather, I also find evidence that the increasing pervasiveness of mobility and tourism as well as its increased dedifferentiation, i. e. the blurred boundaries between tourism and non-tourism activities, also transforms meanings of place and space and raises important questions concerning several critical concepts in urban studies such as the notions of 'citizenship', 'community', and 'belonging' in the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} its {{foundation}} in a distinctively relational analysis of spaces, the term ‘urban political ecology’ (see Heynen, Kaika & Swyngedouw, 2006; Loftus, 2012) {{has always been}} much too simplistic to fully cover what this strands optimally points towards. Despite emphasising ‘urban’ as signifier, cities conceptualized as “dense networks of interwoven sociospatial processes that are simultaneously local and global, human and physical, cultural and organic” (Swyngedouw & Heynen, 2003 : 899) suggests the necessity of abandoning the city-as-such as unit of analysis - or even as taken for granted {{point of departure for}} inquiries. It suggests the possibility for complex analyses able to target an urban bias inherent to so much critical theory (cf. Barraclough, 2013). In this paper I utilize inspiration drawn from urban political ecology to analyse the dynamics of upscale golf landscapes, thus simultaneously building on and ‘reversing’ urban political ecology by discussing green spaces outside cities’ administrative boundaries. I work with a relational ontology where spaces are regarded as constituted by a myriad of various flows and forces, I work with an emphasis on landscapes as simultaneously discursive and material, and I work with an approach emphasising the exertions of power and the struggles that constitute spaces (cf. Mitchell, 2008; Swyngedouw & Heynen, 2003). Built on preferences for scenic vistas and undisturbed nature, and often built on the appropriation and selective transformation of manorial landscapes, upscale golf landscapes are intimately tied to popular conceptualisations of attractive rural milieus. But simultaneously attracting tourists travelling from far away urban centres, and providing lush green meeting-spaces for firms where offices otherwise often occupy central places in metropolitan areas these landscapes defy any neat distinction between urban and rural (cf. Woods, 2007, 2013). Topographically removed from the concrete and high-rises these high-end <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes</b> nonetheless exist in symbiosis with these spaces. They thrive from the established road and rail networks connecting suburbs and city centres, and the networks of planes and airports connecting continents with each other. Thus these landscapes aptly illuminate how, just like cities, ‘peri-urban’ or ‘rural’ spaces are dense network of interwoven sociospatial processes tying together many places (cities and countrysides) and many actors (human, and non-human) ...|$|R

Urban parks and open spaces are major places for residents nearby to enjoy physical exercises and <b>leisure</b> activities. <b>Landscape</b> planners nowadays confront a prominent task as how to create quality activity spaces in urban parks neighboring residential areas. In this paper, part of the Yuan Dynasty City Wall Relics Park next to Guodian Huayuan, a typical residential area in Beijing, is chosen as the object of study for on-spot survey based on theories and methods of environment-behavior studies. Users, periods, behaviors are categorized and activities of such users during different periods are recorded in details by means of counting, photographing and dotting. With such data, in-depth analysis is conducted as how the place is used and what are the spatial identities so as to render reference material for designing activity spaces in urban parks neighboring residential areas. Background and objectives A huge population in China gives rise to restricted spaces for residence, particularly limited places for outdoor activities in residential areas in cities with a high population density.

Holistic study findings on the importance, performance and cost-effectiveness of such facility management (FM) services, especially those between like estates, {{have yet to be}} seen. For bridging this knowledge gap, a study was conducted, under which the main aspects of the typical services namely security, cleaning, repair & maintenance, <b>leisure</b> & <b>landscape,</b> and general management were identified in the first stage. In the second stage, the costs of FM services in two comparable estates and the users' perceived importance and performance of the services were collected. The responses drawn from their consistent judgments, after processing by an analytical hierarchy process, were examined against a performance-importance evaluation matrix. Statistical tests were applied to identify the services with different qualities, and a set of weighted performance indicators was computed for representing the cost-effectiveness of the services. Comparisons made between these indicators informed which service or aspect was provided in a more, or less, cost-effective way. Wider adoption of this evaluation approach would facilitate performance benchmarking across estates, which is conducive to attaining quality and cost-effective services.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the manifestation of}} New Urbanism in the South African environment and applies the themes, characteristics and principles of New Urbanism to the landscape of Melrose Arch in Johannesburg. This precinct has been developed according to New Urban principles, {{and it is the}} aim of the author to assess whether these principles have been applied successfully, keeping in mind that since New Urbanism is an American design movement, some of its principles may be impractical to apply in a South African environment. In order to conceptualise the environment in which the analysis takes place, the author sketches a background of the origin and history of Johannesburg, including the development of the city centre and rise of the suburbs. Trends such as decentralisation and gentrification are also recognised and examined. A correlation is drawn between the Johannesburg of a few decades ago and the contemporary city to see how events and tendencies created the city of today. The current initiatives that are being undertaken to reinvent the CBD and other areas of the city are considered as well, in order to provide a context for Melrose Arch. The author also briefly examines the origin and history of <b>leisure</b> <b>landscapes</b> such as arcades, world fairs and expositions, shopping malls and themed landscapes. The purpose is not to give exact timelines and histories of these phenomena, but rather to provide a historic foundation to work from in order to sketch the context wherein developments such as Melrose Arch can be situated. The author examines the predecessors of and influences on New Urbanism in an attempt to understand this movement. Starting with the Classical Reformers and the concept of the Ideal City, a common theme runs through several other development theories, such as Garden Cities, Pedestrian Cities, as well as the more recent Edge Cities. The influence of Sprawl on cities is noted, and measures to reduce the occurrence of sprawling land by implementing solutions that are connected to New Urbanism are discussed. The author discusses the inception of New Urbanism, taking into account all the previous discussed development theories that influenced it in one way or another. Additionally, some variations on New Urbanism, such as Traditional Neighbourhood development (TND) and the Pedestrian Pocket (PP) are discussed. New Urbanism is thus placed in a contemporary context by regarding its history and influences. The application to Melrose Arch includes a brief history of this landscape, as well as its architecture and the articulation of space within the precinct. Some themes evident in Melrose Arch are discussed; many of these are based on popular myths and ideologies and how they are represented in this particular space. Issues such as Security and control, Class and status, Consumption and Utopianism are discussed and applied to Melrose Arch. Finally, the principles and characteristics of New Urbanism are applied to Melrose Arch in order to assess how successful the implementation of New Urbanism is in this precinct.

40|$|Purpose-The aim of {{this study}} is to explore the {{influence}} of personal attributes, namely, gender, age, education and income, on the perception of facilities management (FM) services for residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach-Collected through an interview survey, the personal particulars of the users of a typical residential estate in Hong Kong and their perceived importance and performance levels of five main aspects of FM services were analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process and statistical analyses. Findings-The weighted performance ratings of the services, which are products of interaction between perceived importance and perceived performance, showed perfect rank correlations across user groups with different personal attributes. As for the shares contributed to the services’ overall weighted performance, the largest differences were associated with the security and <b>leisure</b> and <b>landscape</b> aspects rated between the users with tertiary education and those without. Research limitations/implications-The findings that male adults, users with tertiary education and those with earning capacity tended to give more consistent responses can serve as a reference for determining the target amount of samples in similar surveys in future. Further work is needed to research into how the method of this study may be adapted for use in investigating FM services for other types of buildings or the same type of buildings in other places. Practical implications-The approach taken in scrutinizing the performance contributions of the services, which helps to identify any improvements needed, can be used to evaluate FM services for similar residential buildings. Originality/value-The study results provide an understanding of the influence of personal attributes on perception of FM services. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

The way in which city neighborhoods become popular over time has been a fundamental area of study in traditional urban studies literature as it is critical to city governance [1, 2]. The rise of mobile technologies and collective sensing in the last decade has contributed to the generation of large datasets that describe activity dynamics in cities and has created new opportunities for research in the area; for example, a number of works have proposed the use of cellular data to understand collective mobility dynamics and inform planning decisions [3 – 7]. Beyond cellular data, the increasing popularity of services like Twitter and Foursquare has yielded new inputs for capturing the heartbeat of a city [8 – 10]. Further, trends in credit card transactions have also been used to study human patterns across space and time [11].|$|R
40|$|The third Training School of the Action {{took place}} in Vitoria-Gasteiz (Basque country, Spain) from 24 th to 26 th September 2014. Vitoria-Gateiz has experimented an {{important}} urban outgrowth in the last decade, mainly through the planning and development of two new neighborhoods, Zabalgana and Salburúa, situated at the eastern and western border of the city, by the Greenbelt. These new development are well-equipped and designed according to sustainability principles. Nevertheless, among the main problems they present is their over-dimensioned public space, which creates some areas lacking enough density and mix of uses. On the other hand it is very expensive for the municipality to maintain these public space with the high Vitorian urban standards for public space. The proposed solution for this problem is a strategy of "re-densification" through the insertion of new uses The debate has arisen about which are the most adequate uses to insert {{in order to get}} an increasing of urban vitality, specially considering that housing has reached its peak and that Vitoria-Gasteiz is well served with social and sport amenities. The main goal of the TS was to offer an opportunity for the reflection about how urban agriculture might be an optimal alternative for the re-qualifying of this over-dimensioned public space in the new neighbourhoods, especially considering it synergic potential as a tool for production, <b>leisure</b> and <b>landscaping,</b> including the possibility of energy crops within the limits of urban space. Continuity with rural and natural surrounding area through alternatives for urban fringe at the small scale is a relevant issue to be considered as well within the reflection. Taking Zabalgana neighbourhood as a practical field for experiment, the Training School is conceived as a practical and intensive design charrette to be held during a whole day after two days of local knowledge-deepening through field visits and presentations...|$|R
40|$|Social science {{research}} into darkness (and light) has largely focused on public spaces. In particular {{it has been}} interested in night-time cityscapes, but also spaces of <b>leisure</b> and rural <b>landscapes.</b> This paper instead turns its eye towards the more private experiences of darkness in the home. In this paper I look to explore the active role that darkness plays in constituting our relation to the home, arguing that it takes on a central role. Drawing on phenomenological arguments about experience of dark, I argue that in darkness the self is rendered more open to the other. The ability to choose {{the conditions in which}} this openness to the other is experienced becomes important: where power over this choice exists, openness can be experienced as conviviality or intimacy; where power is absent, this openness {{is more likely to be}} experienced as vulnerability. As such, controlling darkness in the home is an act of power. This argument is then explored through a study of various trends in geography and social {{science research}} into the home, focusing on how the home can slide between poles of security and protection, and insecurity and danger. Though speculative, this paper seeks to set out new ground for research, and new understandings for existing knowledge about darkness and the home...|$|R
40|$|The paper, {{starting}} from the consideration of the main literature on sustainable tourism, is focalized on the analysis of sustainable tourism demand in developed countries. In previous studies, the research group has identified the framework of " 4 L Tourism", an emerging form of tourism that synthesizes the main tourist motivations in four assets (<b>Landscape,</b> <b>Leisure,</b> Learning, Limit), which require specific tourist offer and products. The paper {{is based on a}} field research carried out in Italy on CTS travellers. The research, deliberately aimed to a tourist population with specific behavioural and motivational features, allowed to study in deep the importance of the " 4 L Tourism" dimensions, highlighting the possibility to graduate the sensibility of tourists in respect with the single dimensions. Coherently with a significant stream of literature on sustainable tourism demand, the analysis enabled to identify two profiles (" 4 L Tourist hard-path" and " 4 L Tourist soft-path") in relation to the intensity of the motivation and to the importance of the single component of the trip. The results of the research permitted, from a managerial point of view, to assess the expectations and the behaviours of " 4 L Tourists", in order to set up the tourist offer of tourist destinations and organisations, allowing them to follow an emerging global trend in the market with appropriate strategies...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{development}} orientations of rural area of the Upper Gorenjska region covers {{the development}} of equestrian tourism as a tourism product. The underlying purpose of the project called »Equestrian trails of the Upper Gorenjska region« lies in fostering {{the development of a}} sports-recreational activity closely intertwined with the development of a comprehensive tourism offer of rural area. The project involves the setting up of a shared equestrian infrastructure that will deliver successful marketing to individual service providers, thus stimulating them for further development. The first step of horse trail planning should involve determining the needs as regards holiday-making, recreation and <b>leisure,</b> evaluating the <b>landscape</b> in terms of existing tourism and recreational activities, identifying the areas to qualify as acceptable for such tourism and designing an optimal spatial arrangement by observing certain specific requirements. The network of horse trails could upgrade and enrich the existing tourism offer and provide new development potentials of this rural area to be exploited insofar as the project concept is properly devised, organisation and management are efficiently undertaken, spatial and environmental requirements are respected and close cooperation between the involved actors and various activities is ensured. The present thesis provides a brief overview of certain theoretical bases of recreation planning in rural space, depicts practical experience gained through management of the project »Equestrian trails of the Upper Gorenjska region« and identifies the guidelines for an efficient implementation of similar projects in the future...|$|R
40|$|The vibrant {{school of}} printmaking which emerged and flourished in New Zealand between 1900 and 1950 forms {{the subject of}} this thesis. It {{examines}} the attitudes of the printmakers, many of whom regarded the print as the most democratic of art forms and one that should reflect the realities of everyday life. Their subject matter, contemporary city scenes, people at work and <b>leisure,</b> local <b>landscapes,</b> Maori and indigenous flora and fauna, is analysed and revealed as anticipating by over a decade that of regionalist painters. They are also identified as the first New Zealand artists to draw attention to social and environmental issues. Trained under the British South Kensington art education system, New Zealand printmakers placed great importance on craftsmanship. Although some worked in a realist style others experimented with abstraction and surrealism, placing them among the forefront of New Zealand artists receptive to modern art. Expatriate New Zealand printmakers played significant roles in three major printmaking movements abroad, the Artists' International Alliance, Atelier 17 and the Claude Flight Linocut Movement. The thesis redresses the failure of existing histories of New Zealand art to recognise the existence of a major twentieth-century art movement. It identifies the main factors contributing to the low status of printmaking in New Zealand. Commercial artists rather than those with a fine arts background led the Quoin Club, which initiated a New Zealand school of printmaking in 1916; Gordon Tovey's overthrow of the South Kensington system in 1945 devalued the craftsmanship so important to printmakers; and the rise of modernism, which gave priority to formal values and abstraction, further exacerbated institutional indifference to the print. The adoption of Maori imagery by printmakers resulted in recent art historians retrospectively accusing them of cultural appropriation. Even the few printmakers who attained some recognition were criticised for their involvement in textile and bookplate design and book-illustration. Key artists discussed in the thesis include James Boswell, Stephen Champ, Frederick Coventry, Rona Dyer, Arnold Goodwin, Thomas Gulliver, Trevor Lloyd, Stewart Maclennan, Gilbert Meadows, John L. Moore, E. Mervyn Taylor, Arthur Thompson, Herbert Tornquist, Frank Weitzel, Hilda Wiseman, George Woods, John Buckland Wright and Adele Younghusband. Details of the approximately 3, 000 prints created during this period are recorded in a database, and summarised in the Printmakers' Survey included in Volume Two. In addition reproductions of 156 prints are illustrated and documented; while a further 43 prints are reproduced within the text of Volume One...|$|R
40|$|In Flanders (Belgium), as {{throughout}} {{other parts}} of Europe, {{a decrease in the}} total number of full-time farms and a concentration of production in fewer and larger full-time farms can be recorded. Meanwhile, developments in other sectors in the economy, such as higher incomes, more free time and greater mobility, have increased demand for wildlife, <b>landscape,</b> <b>leisure</b> and outdoor recreation {{as an integral part of}} the countryside. These trends have major impacts on the countryside in general. These profound changes within both the agricultural sector and society are not simple and distinct processes, but are often complex and reciprocal. In this research we try to unravel this complex and reciprocal relationship by focussing on the production factor land and the bond that the individual farmer as well as the farming community has with it. More specifically, we want to provide insight in the way changes in land use and transformations of the countryside are acknowledged and evaluated among the farming community. In order to do this we propose a methodology which combines in-depth interviews with focus group discussions centred around visualized spatial data. This method allows us to get a better understanding of the perception farmers have of land and the value they attach to it. It also provides us with a better insight into the less visible changes in the social fabric of the countryside (such as the apparent tensions between retired and active farmers, tensions between part-time and fulltime farmers and the suspicion of traditional farmers towards multifunctional farmers) ...|$|R
40|$|In Australia {{participation}} in informal, individual-focussed forms of leisure activities is increasing. This {{can be understood}} {{in the context of}} changing social landscapes. It is argued that new forms of social capital may be emerging through these ‘looser’ affiliations and activities. This suggests that funding contexts, for example spaces and activity programs like festivals, rather than directly funding networks such as organisations might be an alternate approach toward fostering the growth of social capital. These conditions call for a rethink of how to better leverage informal leisure contexts, especially by governments. This research focusses on how leisure contexts of a more informal nature can stimulate productive social capital. The research thus sits at the intersection of the literature on leisure and various theoretical perspectives linked to ideas about social capital. To illuminate insight the research explores perspectives on leisure as these perspectives can alter over time due to such factors as generational change, work/life balance and emerging leisure activities. The research also examines the theories of third place, social capital and the strength of weak ties to construct a framework to explore the interplay between leisure activities, space and place characteristics and social connectivity in a changing social and <b>leisure</b> participatory <b>landscape.</b> The framework draws from these literatures to better understand the productive potential of informal leisure contexts. The research is conducted through the application of the framework within a constructivist-interpretive paradigm utilising a mixed method, case study approach. The research investigates the social interactions created through leisure activities of attendees at an annual, three-day, camping-based, entertainment festival in Marion Bay, Tasmania, Australia known as the Falls Music and Arts Festival (the Falls). In an Australian context of camping-based events, this is a large festival of approximately 16, 000 attendees. Over 900 survey responses were obtained and thirty qualitative interviews to add further insight were conducted over two separate events in 2010 and 2011. The research demonstrates a level of self-initiated community and weak social ties that can be developed and strengthened through leisure pursuits of a more informal, and even temporary, nature. This thesis argues that the understanding of social capital can be enhanced by more focus on how people meet and form friendships and acquaintances in informal settings. This research, through the application of a social capital tool developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, finds that social capital can be formed without the need for formal groups. Analysis through the lens of third place elucidates place-based factors that can also stimulate social capital. An interrelationship between three distinct ‘vibes’ within spaces – the social vibe, the leisure activity vibe and the vibe that place characteristics assist to create – uncovers the importance of place-based factors in shaping social capital. As a key finding within this research, identification of these three vibes has led to the configuring of a social leisure places platform. The research illustrates the notion of a place-based friend where frequency of engagement with people in spaces and places is integral to its identification. Social media has an evident role to play in continuing social bonds formed within physical spaces and is important for social capital development. The findings from this research are important to scholars researching leisure and social capital as well as those researching emerging trends in and the social and place dimensions of festivals and events. They are also of importance to practitioners and policy makers/workers within community planning, design and policy development for public spaces, programs and events...|$|R
40|$|The {{established}} (digital) leisure game {{industry is}} historically one dominated by large international hardware vendors (e. g. Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo), major publishers {{and supported by}} a complex network of development studios, distributors and retailers. New modes of digital distribution and development practice are challenging this business model and the <b>leisure</b> games industry <b>landscape</b> is one experiencing rapid change. The established (digital) leisure games industry, at least anecdotally, appears reluctant to participate actively in the applied games sector (Stewart et al., 2013). There {{are a number of}} potential explanations as to why this may indeed be the case including; A concentration on large scale consolidation of their (proprietary) platforms, content, entertainment brand and credibility which arguably could be weakened by association with the conflicting notion of purposefulness (in applied games) in market niches without clear business models or quantifiable returns on investment. In contrast, the applied games industry exhibits the characteristics of an emerging, immature industry namely: weak interconnectedness, limited knowledge exchange, an absence of harmonising standards, limited specialisations, limited division of labour and arguably insufficient evidence of the products efficacies (Stewart et al., 2013; Garcia Sanchez, 2013) and could, arguably, be characterised as a dysfunctional market. To test these assertions the Realising an Applied Gaming Ecosystem (RAGE) project will develop a number of self contained gaming assets to be actively employed {{in the creation of a}} number of applied games to be implemented and evaluated as regional pilots across a variety of European educational, training and vocational contexts. RAGE is a European Commission Horizon 2020 project with twenty (pan European) partners from industry, research and education with the aim of developing, transforming and enriching advanced technologies from the leisure games industry into self-contained gaming assets (i. e. solutions showing economic value potential) that could support a variety of stakeholders including teachers, students, and, significantly, game studios interested in developing applied games. RAGE will provide these assets together with a large quantity of high-quality knowledge resources through a self-sustainable Ecosystem, a social space that connects research, the gaming industries, intermediaries, education providers, policy makers and end-users in order to stimulate the development and application of applied games in educational, training and vocational contexts. The authors identify barriers (real and perceived) and opportunities facing stakeholders in engaging, exploring new emergent business models,developing, establishing and sustaining an applied gaming eco system in Europe...|$|R
