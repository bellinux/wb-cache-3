30|$|All these {{properties}} {{could be}} useful for glass glitter used for decoration purposes as well. Also the decrease of viscosity of the melt caused by PbO, “which makes it most tender as a candle” [31], was probably an advantage in processing the glass. All high <b>lead</b> glass <b>flakes</b> (I/ 18, I/ 34, I/ 59; Fig.  4) are significantly more brittle than those with a mixed alkali content (I/ 3, I/ 39, I/ 60, I/ 62; Figs.  2, 3). Probably, the glass producers tried to achieve a low viscous and brilliant lead crystal without the need to reduce brittleness and macroscopic stability.|$|R

25|$|Regulations {{introduced}} in 1911 concerning the smelting of materials containing lead and {{the manufacture of}} red or orange <b>lead</b> and <b>flaked</b> litharge prohibited the employment of women and young persons in these processes and ordered monthly medical examinations of all employees. The Factory Workshop (Cotton Cloth Factories) Act of 1911 provided the Secretary of State {{with the power to}} make regulations to improve conditions in cotton cloth factories in relation to ventilation and humidity, while The Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1911 applied the dormant portion of the Irish Suitors’ Fund to the purposes of the Labourer’s Cottages’ Fund, while bestowing authority upon the Irish Land Commission “to extend the limit of advances which may be made” for the provision of allotments and houses from £4.5million to £5.5million, while also providing further powers for the demolition of unhealthy cottages. The Public Health (Ireland) Act empowered Irish local authorities to set up regulations for the seizure of unsound meat and for inspecting slaughterhouses, while the Public Health (Scotland) Act of 1897 was amended in 1911, extending the powers of local authorities under the Public Health (Scotland) Act to any body of commissioners or trustees authorised to supply water.|$|R

30|$|Not surprisingly, the {{composition}} of the different coloured glass flakes does not match {{the composition}} of English glass objects like drinking vessels or bottles of late seventeenth and eighteenth century, which are reported to be mostly high potassium-lead glasses [14, 16]. Mixed alkali glasses with a compositions similar to that found in this investigation for the flakes I/ 3, I/ 39, I/ 60 and I/ 62 (Figs.  2, 3; Table  2) are reported for a late seventeenth century glass manufacture in Silkstone, however not containing lead [19]. [3], who investigated a wide range of glass particles from paintings from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century occasionally found lead glass (made with wood ash) or mixed alkali glass without lead. The Italian glasses investigated by these authors date from the sixteenth century, when lead glass was known but not common in Italy. Similar considerations may be true for North European and English glass production, where lead glass is reported occasionally for the Middle Ages [12, 13]. These medieval lead glasses, on the other hand, show very similar compositions to the high <b>lead</b> glass <b>flakes</b> with only traces of alkali and calcium oxides investigated here (I/ 18, I/ 34, I/ 59; Fig.  4; Table  3) [12]. In contrary, eighteenth century glass flakes used in plaster decorations from Germany were mainly mixed alkali glass without lead (Weissenstein Castle 1722) or high lead with low potassium and calcium content (Grotto hall Dresden 1714) [10, 11].|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmong {{prevalent}} tribological {{failures in}} rolling element bearings, a peculiar rolling contact fatigue mode {{has been defined}} as white etching cracks, which correspond to broad subsurface three-dimensional branching crack networks bordered by white etching microstructure. White etching cracks tend to appear before other conventional rolling contact fatigue microstructural alterations and eventually <b>lead</b> to premature <b>flaking</b> or radial cracking that remains unpredictable using fatigue life estimations. Even though they have been reported for several decades, occurrences present no common evident denominator and are delicate to reproduce on laboratory test rigs without artificial hydrogen charging. In this study, white etching crack reproductions on two different standard endurance test rigs are compared and analyzed in order to, firstly, propose, an update of the understanding of white etching crack surface affected tribochemical formation mechanisms, and secondly, to identify influent tribochemical and mechanical drivers. If white etching cracks are associated to different combinations of specific non-self-sufficient macroscopic drivers depending on the application or the test rig, evidences demonstrate that they often come down to similar phenomena at a microscopic tribological scale that should all be mastered for efficient white etching crack reproduction and countermeasure design...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{interventions to}} reduce lead exposures {{over the past}} several decades, lead poisoning remains a major environmental health threat to children in the United States. In Cleveland and Cuyahoga County, the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels far exceeds that of the United States; among children 0 to 72 months of age who were screened in 2009, 21 % and 16 % respectively, had blood lead levels ≥ 5 µg/dL 1. Older housing stock is a significant risk factor for lead poisoning among children as the use of lead-based paint in houses was not banned in the United States until 1978. Children living in older homes within low-income neighborhoods are affected disproportionately as their residences are more likely to contain chipping, peeling, or water damaged paint that has not been properly addressed. These conditions combined with the normal hand-to-mouth behaviors of small children can result in ingestion and inhalation of <b>lead</b> dust, <b>flakes,</b> and contaminated soil. Despite being an established and well-studied public health problem, the majority of lead poisoning intervention occurs at the level of secondary, rather than primary prevention; that is, efforts are aimed at screening children for lead poisoning between 1 and 6 years of age. We therefore designed a primary lead prevention study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} low cost, minor lead repairs and caregiver education in homes of newborn infants to prevent lead poisoning in these children. The lead repairs performed as part of this study were not meant to remove lead completely from the home, nor were the repairs meant to be permanent; however, they were meant to reduce the risk of elevated blood lead levels among young children when they are at the greatest risk. If low cost repairs are effective in preventing elevated blood lead levels in young children, more homes can be addressed in the near-term thereby decreasing the incidence of lead poisoning in children...|$|R
40|$|Flax fibre {{composites}} are {{now widely}} used in various industries, such as automotive, in replacement of less sustainable materials. One of the remaining challenges is to define the most environment-friendly end-of-life options for the flax fibre reinforced plastics based on an environmental evaluation and comparison of the available techniques. In this work, three end-of-life possibilities for flax fibre reinforced thermoplastics were investigated: chemical recycling, mechanical recycling and incineration. It {{was found that the}} chemical recycling technique is feasible as their properties do not change compared to the initial composite. However, its processing time, chemicals needed and equipment have negative effects on the environment. The second method, the mechanically recycled composite with discontinuous short fibres (<b>flakes)</b> <b>leads</b> to a decrease in properties of about 75 % compared to the initial cross-ply composite. When this recycled material is compared to random mat composites (also short and randomly oriented fibres), the properties also decrease by 6 – 46 %. The main advantage of the mechanical recycling technique is the speed of the process as very large quantities of waste can be shredded and processed into new components while reducing the environmental burden of producing fresh MAPP and flax fibre. The last EOL method studied was incineration with energy recovery and it {{has been found to be}} a good alternative as well since all the material can be fully combusted and embodies a relatively high calorific value. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{bond coat}} adheres the {{thermal barrier coating}} to the {{superalloy}} substrate. Additionally, the bond coat provides oxidation protection and functions as a diffusion barrier against the motion of substrate atoms towards the environment.There are five major types of bond coats, the aluminides, the platinum-aluminides, MCrAlY, cobalt-cermets, and nickel-chromium.For the aluminide bond coatings, the final composition {{and structure of the}} coating depends on the composition of the substrate. Aluminides also lack ductility below 750 °C, and exhibit a limited by thermomechanical fatigue strength. The Pt-aluminides are very similar to the aluminide bond coats except for a layer of Pt (5—10 μm) deposited on the blade. The Pt is believed to aid in oxide adhesion and contributes to hot corrosion. The cost of Pt plating is justified by the increased blade life span. The MCrAlY is the latest generation of bond coat and does not strongly interact with the substrate. Normally applied by plasma spraying, MCrAlY coatings are secondary aluminum oxide formers. This means that the coatings form an outer layer of chromium oxide (chromia), and a secondary aluminum oxide (alumina) layer underneath. These oxide formations occur at high temperatures in the range of those that superalloys usually encounter. The chromia provides oxidation and hot-corrosion resistance. The alumina controls oxidation mechanisms by limiting oxide growth by self-passivating. The yttrium enhances the oxide adherence to the substrate, and limits the growth of grain boundaries (which can <b>lead</b> to <b>flaking</b> of the coating). Investigation indicates that addition of rhenium and tantalum increases oxidation resistance. Cobalt-cermet based coatings consisting of materials such as tungsten carbide/cobalt can be used due to excellent resistance to abrasion, corrosion, erosion, and heat. These cermet coatings perform well in situations where temperature and oxidation damage are significant concerns, such as boilers. One of the unique advantages of cobalt cermet coatings is a minimal loss of coating mass over time, due to the strength of carbides within the mixture. Overall, cermet coatings are useful in situations where mechanical demands are equal to chemical demands for superalloys. Nickel-chromium coatings are used most frequently in boilers fed by fossil fuels, electric furnaces, and waste incineration furnaces, where the danger of oxidizing agents and corrosive compounds in the vapor must be dealt with. The specific method of spray-coating depends on the composition of the coatings. Nickel-chromium coatings that also contain iron or aluminum perform much better (in terms of corrosion resistance) when they are sprayed and laser glazed, while pure nickel-chromium coatings perform better when thermally sprayed exclusively.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{different}} functionalizing {{agents were}} used to graft them onto graphene sheets. By EDX and elemental analysis, elemental compositions of the samples are confirmed. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the grafting of amines and imines on graphene sheets increased their thermal stability. Raman investigations showed that functionalization <b>leads</b> to multilayer <b>flakes</b> formation. TFC mixed matrix membranes containing PIM- 1 as a matrix polymer and three different graphene based fillers synthesized {{in the course of}} the current work have demonstrated difference of filler materials properties. The pristine GO acts as an effective barrier material for single gas transport through the PIM- 1 /GO selective layer with both permeance and ideal selectivity decreasing with an increase of the GO loading. The PIM- 1 /GO TFC membranes with the filler loading 76 and 84  wt.% have shown low gas permeance indicating that GO can be aligned along the membrane surface under the influence of forces available during the casting solution penetration into the porous support. Gas transport properties of the GO embedded into the PIM- 1 matrix are much different from properties of the GO-AEDPPF and GO-DClBAO, which have good compatibility to the PIM- 1 at 9 and 33  wt.% loading the MMMs show ideal selectivities overpassing those of the pure PIM- 1 TFC membrane. When the loading of these two GO fillers is above 50  wt.% the TFC membranes show significant increase of the permeance compared to GO-PIM- 1 MMM, indicating that the matrix PIM- 1 polymer and forces available during the membrane formation are not able to effectively align these particles along the membrane surface. The observation of high membrane permeance, which is similar to the permeance of the porous PAN membrane, has lead us to the conclusion that introduction of large amounts of bulky functional groups onto the surface of graphene sheet is leading to increase of the graphene rigidity; this effect is to be studied further with methods able to investigate mechanical properties of nanometer-sized objects.|$|R
40|$|Lead is a toxic {{environmental}} pollutant {{and exposure}} to it can produce serious adverse health effects in adults and children. There is no safe exposure to lead, however the CDC recommends adult blood lead level (BLL) of < 20 Î¼g/dl {{to be safe and}} < 5 Î¼g/dl for children.

In Harare, people are exposed to lead from exhaust fumes from leaded petrol, old leaching <b>lead</b> plumbing and <b>flaking</b> leaded paint. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the level of lead exposure of ordinary residents in Harare. The secondary objective was to determine if lead levels were affected by serum protein levels. Three urban areas were chosen for their potential of increased risk of environmental exposure. One rural area was chosen to act as a control. Water lead levels were also measured from the different study areas. The lead levels were measured using the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Protein levels were determined using the Lowry method. The mean blood lead levels that were obtained for the urban areas were 0. 80 Â± 0. 69 Î¼g/dl and 0. 96 Â± 0. 98 Î¼g/dl for the rural clinic. The urine lead levels for the urban areas were 0. 57 Â± 0. 67 Î¼g/dl and 0. 51 Â± 0. 13 Î¼g/dl for the rural clinic. The water lead levels from the different study populations were 1. 1 Î¼g/dl for Mbare, 1. 6 Î¼g/dl for Highfield, 0 Î¼g/dl for Goromonzi and 0. 4 Î¼g/dl, for Mabvuku/Tafara respectively. The mean serum protein levels were 24. 45 Â± 3. 76 g/l for the study population. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the serum protein levels and blood lead levels was 0. 225 at a p-value of 0. 124.

40|$|Over 300, 000 young {{children}} in America—disproportionately poor and children of color—suffer from childhood lead poisoning. This disease ordinarily {{is caused by the}} deterioration of <b>lead</b> paint into <b>flakes,</b> chips, and dust that children ingest or inhale. Victims of childhood lead poisoning have tried to sue manufacturers of lead paint or lead pigment, but they face a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. Traditional tort law requires a plaintiff to prove that a specific tortfeasor caused the harm. This is almost impossible in the lead paint context because the paint that caused the harm usually consists of many layers, applied over the course of as long as a century, now covered up by non-leaded paint. To overcome this obstacle, victims of childhood lead poisoning have invoked the theory of “market share liability. ” Market share liability originally was devised in the 1980 s to allow recovery by the victims of the generic miscarriage preventative diethylstilbestrol (DES). DES was taken by women whose daughters later developed certain cancers. But the DES daughters could not identify the specific manufacturer whose drug their mothers consumed. The California Supreme Court, in Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories, granted them relief by apportioning liability among DES manufacturers according to each one’s share of the market. Victims of other defective products then urged courts to extend market share liability beyond the DES context. With a few exceptions, such efforts failed because the other products were not “fungible,” i. e., they were not as interchangeable as the generic drug DES. Additionally, DES was taken during a nine-month period, making it relatively easy for courts to determine the market shares of each manufacturer with a reasonable degree of accuracy—not so with other products. Thus, for some twenty years, market share liability lay dormant. In 2004, Allen Rostron published an article that challenged the implicit assumption in market share liability that fungibility meant chemical identity. Indeed, he identified three definitions of fungibility: (1) functional interchangeability, (2) physical indistinguishability, and (3) uniformity of risk. Almost immediately thereafter, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, in Thomas v. Mallett, employed portions of Rostron’s analysis to allow a victim of childhood lead poisoning to proceed to trial under Wisconsin’s variant of market share liability. The extension of market share liability to the lead paint context is problematic. Lead paints, or paints with lead pigment, do not pose a uniform risk of harm because paints with higher concentrations of lead are more harmful than those with less. Additionally, it is impossible, as a practical matter, to determine the market shares of the manufacturers of lead paint and lead pigment given the hundred-year period in which manufacturers have entered, exited, and re-entered the market to be segmented. If market share liability is to apply beyond the DES context, this expansion must be consistent with the policies that gave rise to the theory. We thus propose that application of market share liability be predicated on three requirements: (1) uniform products must pose risk in a uniform manner and to a uniform degree; (2) it must be impossible, as a practical matter, for a victim to trace the harm-causing product back to its specific manufacturer; and (3) courts must be able to ascertain each manufacturer’s market share with a reasonable degree of accuracy...|$|R
