25|$|Utility {{bicycles}} {{have many}} standard features {{to enhance their}} usefulness and comfort. Chain guards and mudguards, or fenders, protect clothes and moving parts from oil and spray. Kick stands help with parking. Front-mounted wicker or steel baskets for carrying goods are often used. Rear <b>luggage</b> <b>carriers</b> {{can be used to}} carry items such as school satchels.|$|E
25|$|Panniers {{or special}} <b>luggage</b> <b>carriers</b> (including {{waterproof}} packing bags) enable {{the transport of}} goods and are useful for shopping. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats and/or an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar to transport children.

In many jurisdictions bicycles must be fitted with a bell; reflectors; and, after dark, front and rear lights.|$|E
25|$|Some components, {{which are}} often {{optional}} accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. Mudguards, or fenders, protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas and chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and crankset teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked, and bike locks deter theft. Front-mounted baskets, front or rear <b>luggage</b> <b>carriers</b> or racks, and panniers mounted above either or both wheels {{can be used to}} carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest. Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Roland Meinl Musikinstrumente" [...] {{was founded}} in 1951 by Roland Meinl. Initially the company {{produced}} wind instruments, beginning the production of cymbals only in 1952. The first Meinl cymbals were cut out of large metal sheets, hammered, lathed and drilled by hand by Roland Meinl himself, who subsequently transported them to the Neustadt an der Aisch railstation on the <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier</b> of his bike.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} baskets may be {{mounted on a}} <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier</b> near the rear wheel of the bicycle. These baskets are usually {{narrower}} and deeper than the average handlebar basket. Rear baskets function as a hard-sided pannier, carrying the cargo lower on the bicycle, which keeps {{the center of gravity}} low and thereby improves handling and control. This placement also cannot obstruct the forward vision of the rider.|$|R
5000|$|Low riders are {{specifically}} designed to be mounted on a specific kind of fork.Touring bicycles usually have a front fork {{with one or two}} threaded eyelets for M5 bolts on the front dropout on each side. These are for mounting fenders and/or <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier.</b> Another mid-fork eyelet [...] "braze-on" [...] is positioned 160 to 175 mm above it for mounting a low rider front <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier.</b> [...] There is no established standard for the position of the mid-fork eyelet. Most low riders are adjustable to compensate for this.Some forks have mid-fork eyelets on the inside as well as outside to provide mounting of some specialized carriers such as the Tubus Duo.For bicycles that do not have these eyelets or [...] "braze-ons", various alternatives exist. Some of these {{come in the form of}} [...] "U-Bolts", clamps, or some sort of clamp-on eyelet (see Tubus Aluminum Alloy Fork Mounting Kit) When installing carriers, a drop of thread locking compound is advised to ensure that the screws do not loosened from vibrations under load.|$|R

50|$|BMW {{motorcycles}} of the 1960s {{were noted}} as long-distance touring motorcycles. However, none came standard with fairings or luggage, {{these items were}} provided by aftermarket vendors.Fairings included the Wixom Ranger handlebar-mounted fairing made in Illinois, and Avon.There were numerous manufacturers of saddle bags and top cases for BMW twins in the 1960s including Wixom, British-made Craven, and leather saddlebags imported by Butler and Smith, who also offered several styles of <b>luggage</b> <b>carriers</b> for mounting behinds the passenger saddle.

40|$|In {{this report}} the eight steps in systems {{engineering}} process have been followed {{in order to}} develop a student bicycle. To successfully make a student bicycle needs and preferences had to be retrieved from the students. This has been done with an online survey. The chosen concept, the Z-frame bicycle includes a unique frame, side kickstand, separate <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier,</b> integrated front light, back light mounted on the <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier,</b> an integrated chain lock, steer lock and a visible serial code on the frame. From a reliability allocation table it is estimated that the first failure that needs maintenance will occur after 226, 2 hours of usage. The price of the bicycle is estimated on â‚¬ 189, 54 (about 1600 SEK), which is within the requirements. Simulating forces on the frames in SolidWorks showed that the frames are capable of handling the weight and forces that the student produces on the bicycle. Finally the steps that need to be fulfilled to make a working prototype are displayed in a Gantt-chart. The resulted conceptual student bicycle is a good representation of what a student needs and prefers in a bicycle...|$|R
50|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{was designed}} specifically with touring {{in mind and}} features an up-right seating position, with a seat height of 800 mm, allowing the rider to be seated relatively low compared to the overall height of the motorcycle. The motorcycle also features mounts on either sides of the tank, which can serve as holders for jerrycans, as well as tank guards. The rear includes a <b>luggage</b> <b>carrier,</b> and mounts are also provided as well to install aluminium panniers, both provided by Royal Enfield as accessories.|$|R
