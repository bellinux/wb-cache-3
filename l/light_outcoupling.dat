40|$|Organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) have made tremendous technological {{progress in the}} past two decades and have emerged as a top competitor for next generation light-emitting displays and lighting. State-of-the-art OLEDs have been reported in literature to approach, and even surpass, white fluorescent tube efficiency. However, despite rapid technological progress, efficiency metrics must be improved to compete with traditional inorganic light-emitting diode (LED) technology. Organic materials possess specialized traits that permit manipulations to the light-emitting cavity. Overall, as demonstrated within, these modifications can be used to improve electrical and optical device efficiencies. This work is focused at analyzing the effects that nanopatterned geometric modifications to the organic active layers play on device efficiency. In general, OLED efficiency is complicated by the complex, coupled processes which contribute to spontaneous dipole emission. A composite of three sub-systems (electrical, exciton and optical) ultimately dictate the OLED device efficiency. OLED electrical operation is believed to take place via a low-mobility-modified Schottky injection process. In the injection-limited regime, geometric effects are expected to modify the local electric field leading to device current enhancement. It is shown that the patterning effect can be used to enhance charge carrier parity, thereby enhancing overall recombination. Current density and luminance characteristics are shown to be improved by OLED nanopatterning from both the model developed within and experimental techniques. Next, the optical enhancement effects produced by the nanopatterned array are considered. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations are used to determine positional, spectral optical enhancement for the nanopatterned device. The results show beneficial effects to the device performance. The optical enhancements are related to the reduction in internal radiative quenching (improved internal quantum efficiency) and improvement in <b>light</b> extraction (improved <b>outcoupling</b> efficiency). Furthermore, the electrical model is used to construct a positional radiative efficiency map that when combined with the optical enhancement reveals the overall external quantum efficiency enhancement...|$|R

The fundamentally different properties of the materials and principles of device operation offer great new possibilities in terms of energy-savings, color gamut, ease and cost of manufacturing, and novel form factors. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we review the operation and optics of OLEDs, focusing on the problem of extracting light trapped in the high refractive index regions of the device.

The presented ASID is based oil the lateral emitting thin film electroluminescence (LETFEL) technology whereby {{the shape of}} the display elements is defined by a metal layer. The design is support by theoretical models. Different Electrical models have been developed for the transient characteristics of TFEL devices and are compared with measured characteristics. Tile single interface state model, which is based oil the assumption that all interface electrons are located oil a defined energy level, leads to two equivalent differential equations. The simulated characteristics are in good agreement with measured characteristics, especially for non annealed TFEL devices. The model with distributed interface electrons over the the bandgap leads to a system of differential equations. With this model, the agreement between measured and simulated characteristic could be improved for annealed devices. Furthermore, the case that the interface distribution conserves the equilibrium distribution during the emission process is discussed. Problems in measuring the interface electron distribution are pointed out. Based on the physical electrical models of TFEL devices, equivalent RC-models with single interface states and distributed interface states are deduced ill a theoretical way. The models consists of nonlinear resistors, modeling tile tunneling behaviour, and nonlinear capacities, modeling behaviour of the interface electrons. Simulation results are in good agreement with measured results and thus, the RC-models are suitable for embedded simulation of driver electronics and TFEL device. A novel analytic model of the optical behaviour of LETFEL structures is developed and employed for calculating the <b>outcoupled</b> <b>light</b> of a pixel used in light emitting dot matrix displays. The presented solutions are based on a ray optics approximation whereby the absorption of the light within the light generating medium (phosphor material) and the transmission behaviour of tile phosphor-air interface is taken into account, as well as the micro-mirror width. The model is applied to the circular, square and hexagonal pixels. Furthermore, the influence of MIS-effects on the TFEL characteristic and the electrostatic field distribution in TFELs are studied.

The epitaxial {{growth has been}} verified in-situ by Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED). As first test structures channel waveguides with widths ranging from 2 to 5 �?�m and heights from 400 to 700 nm have been fabricated by Reactive Ion Etching and finally covered by about 1. 5 �?�m thick a-Al 2 O 3 top claddings to reduce scattering losses at the surface. Due to the refractive index difference between film and substrate (0. 03 at 1. 55 �?�m) rib waveguiding could be demonstrated. The fluorescence spectra of the films are comparable with those of Er:Y 2 O 3 bulk crystals. Therefore, a theoretical gain spectrum could be calculated from the absorption and emission spectra of Er:Y 2 O 3. Bleaching at the pump wavelength of 1480 nm results in an inversion ratio 0. 75 between the 4 I 13 / 2 and 4 I 15 / 2 multiplet of Er 3 + and thus to a theoretical gain of 260 % at 1535 nm for a 7 mm long waveguide. Gain measurements using a tunable diode laser (1530 nm to 1583 nm) as signal and a pump diode at 1480 nm have been performed. Both sources have been combined in a single mode fiber and then coupled into the waveguide. Using the lock-in technique and a monochromator, the signal intensity I of the <b>outcoupled</b> <b>light</b> could be measured in dependance of the pump power (up to 100 mW before coupling into the waveguide) and the gain determined as (Ipumped – Iunpumped) / Iunpumped. Calculations show that the small waveguide dimensions allow bleaching with absorbed powers well below 1 mW. It has been experimentally verified that the incident signal of 0. 5 mW was sufficient to already bleach the waveguide in the unpumped case. Therefore, the reduction of signal absorption in the pumped case can be neglected and does not falsify our measured gain. At 1535 nm a maximum gain of 150 % (4 dB) could be measured for the 7 mm long sample, resulting in a gain of 5. 7 dB/cm. The measured gain {{is lower than the}} theoretically expected, because the intensity distribution of the guided mode {{is not limited to the}} doped regions. Taking this into account by normalizing the theoretical gain spectrum to the maximum measured gain of 150 % results in a good accordance of the experimentally determined gain at various wavelengths with the theoretical spectrum (see Fig. 1 c).

40|$|International audienceHorizontal {{orientation}} of light-emitting chromophores plays {{a critical role}} in the <b>light</b> <b>outcoupling</b> efficiency and the overall performances of organic light-emitting diodes. Here, we demonstrate that such a horizontal {{orientation of}} light-emitting molecules can be achieved in solution-processed blends containing highly fluorescent oligofluorenes dispersed into various small molecule host materials. The influences of the host material, the solvent used for the spin-coating, the doping concentration of the oligofluorenes and the oligofluorene chemical structure on these orientational processes are investigated using variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and angle-dependent photoluminescence measurements. By clarifying the roles played by these parameters in the horizontal orientation of the emitters, the results provide crucial insights into these molecular orientational processes in spin-coated glassy organic thin films, which should be relevant for the development of high-efficiency solution-processed organic light-emitting diodes in the near future...|$|E
