6000|$|When we {{go and see}} him, that Irish Jew courier, whom I {{have before}} had the honor to describe, <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> novel which he is reading in the ante-room, and says, [...] "Mon maitre est au divan," [...] or, [...] "Monsieur trouvera Monsieur dans son serail," [...] and relapses into the Comte de Montecristo again.|$|E
60|$|The tall white yachts in {{a throng}} were {{lounging}} off the roads of Ryde. It {{was near the}} regatta time, so these proud creatures had flown loftily together, and now flitted hither and thither among themselves, like a concourse of tall women, footing the waves with superb touch. To Siegmund they were very beautiful, but removed from him, as dancers crossing the window-lights are removed {{from the man who}} <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street. He saw the Solent and the world of glamour flying gay as snow outside, where inside was only Siegmund, tired, dispirited, without any joy.|$|E
60|$|Why {{should the}} proud stomach of American travel, much tossed in the transatlantic voyage, so {{instantly}} have itself carried from Liverpool to any point where trains will convey it? Liverpool is most worthy {{to be seen}} and known, and no one who <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bacon and eggs of his first hotel breakfast after landing, and finds himself confronted by the coal-smoked Greek architecture of St. George's Hall, can deny that it is of a singularly noble presence. The city has moments of failing in the promise of this classic edifice, but every now and then it reverts to it, and reminds the traveller that he is in a great modern metropolis of commerce by many other noble edifices.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a famous}} {{portrait}} by Goya, the duke is clad in elegant riding clothes. With {{an air of}} melancholy he <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> music book he is holding in his hands, including the [...] "Four songs/with piano accompaniment/by Mr. Haydn". The duke commissioned several works from Joseph Haydn and was a gifted musician himself. In his painting, Goya subtly combines the symbols of his model's passion for music and equestrian skills (viola or violin, riding boots and riding hat) with the neoclassical interior of the ducal residence.|$|E
5000|$|He {{finds himself}} broke {{and in a}} gunfight with the mobsters, who have been deceived by a gang member with a grudge against him into {{thinking}} {{that they need to}} kill him. Wounded in the gunfight, he is about to make an escape from his mobster pursuers when his jilted girlfriend tries to kill him by hitting him with her car. He is knocked down by a glancing blow, and she flees the scene. At that point, Lady Willens and Forster's butler arrive on the scene and come to his aid. Forster <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gutter and says, [...] "Susan" [...] with relief and gratitude. Susan tells the butler, [...] "Let's bring him home." ...|$|E

50|$|The Doctor and Mags venture {{deeper into}} the Circus, and {{suddenly}} find a strange stone archway, which wasn't there before. Mags acts strangely when she sees the moon sign carved on the archway, but the Doctor manages to calm her down. At {{the end of a}} tunnel, they find a vast well shaft, with a pulse of energy at its core. A curious eye symbol <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the well, which is also depicted on the kites that the Chief Clown uses to spy on the circus workers. Morgana also sees the eye at the heart of her crystal ball, which inspires her to pledge her loyalty to the forces that control the Circus and the planet. The Captain then corners the Doctor and Mags with a group of the robotic clowns, and tells the Doctor that he is next in the ring.|$|E
40|$|Workflow, loosely defined, is {{the set of}} tasks—grouped {{chronologically}} into processes—and the set {{of people}} or resources needed for those tasks, {{that are necessary to}} accomplish a given goal. An organization’s workflow is comprised of the set of processes it needs to accomplish, the set of people or other resources available to perform those processes, and the interactions among them. Consider the following scenario: On a slow Friday afternoon in the emergency room, as one nurse prepares to go off shift, the clerk <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> desk and asks, “By the way, since you’re passing by housekeeping on your way out, would you remind them that room 12 still needs to be cleaned?” “No problem, ” replies the nurse, and indeed, on a slow Friday afternoon, it is no problem. The informal methods and processes that the hospital has developed over the years to keep the enterprise humming work well, in general, and can work very well in optimal times. It’s no trouble to remind housekeeping to come up; it’s no trouble to run a special specimen down to the lab, and certainly no trouble to catch the attending physician during rounds to get a quick signature...|$|E
