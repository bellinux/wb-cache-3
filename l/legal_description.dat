25|$|In the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom {{and most}} Commonwealth {{countries}} land surveying {{is considered to}} be a separate and distinct profession. Land surveyors are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its <b>legal</b> <b>description)</b> and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as Cadastral surveying.|$|E

To incorporate, a petition for incorporation {{can be made to}} the board of county commissioners, who consider numerous geographic, demographic, and economic factors. Cities are categorized by population for the purpose of determining the number of wards [...] and council election structure as well as the number of city clerks: cities with 50,000 or more inhabitants are in population category one, cities with 5,000 or more but fewer than 50,000 inhabitants are in population category two, and cities having fewer than 5,000 inhabitants are in population category three.

500|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, controversies have arisen {{regarding}} {{the accuracy of}} the monument's placement. After the initial surveys, {{it was found that the}} borders did not always follow the lines of meridian and parallel (as they had been intended to) due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time of construction. This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel (and if new, more accurate, surveys needed to be done), or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border. The issue was resolved when New Mexico sued Colorado in 1919, and in 1925 the Supreme Court ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders, even if the markers were off in some locations (this includes the Four Corners Monument). Today's <b>legal</b> <b>description</b> of these border lines is based on the original markers, and not the written description of the borders created when the territories were formed. Because of this, the borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag. One example is the border between Colorado and Utah, where in one area the border jogs west about [...] from where it was intended to be placed (...) [...] Because this error occurred in the original survey—which superseded the written description (being simply the 32nd meridian west of Washington), the border set out by the markers remains the border between the two states.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exact age}} of the Swedish flag is not known, but the oldest {{recorded}} pictures of a blue cloth with a yellow cross date from the early 16th century, {{during the reign of}} King Gustav I.

As stipulated in a royal warrant of 1569, the yellow cross was always to be borne on Swedish battle standards and banners. Prior to this, a similar flag appeared in the coat of arms of King John III's duchy, which is today Southwest Finland. The same coat of arms is still used by the province.|$|E

In Edinburgh, the duty has been very long commuted; but in Dumfries, the finisher of the law still exercises, or did lately exercise, his privilege, the quantity taken being regulated by a small iron ladle, which he uses as the measure of his perquisite.
