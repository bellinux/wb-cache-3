5|$|The {{other major}} {{subfamily}} of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae, which includes Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller skulls and longer {{bones of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the thigh veins back into the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E

5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (<b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> bone) of Majungasaurus was even stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend to hop with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E

5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or <b>lower</b> <b>leg)</b> are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus is {{classified}} in the theropod subfamily Albertosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. It is most {{closely related to the}} slightly younger Albertosaurus. These are the only two definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. Appalachiosaurus was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 which indicated it was an albertosaurine. More recent, unpublished work by Holtz agrees with the original assessment. All other tyrannosaurid genera, including Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, are {{classified in the}} subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Compared to the tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller, lower skulls and longer bones of the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E
5|$|In general, Megalosaurus had {{the typical}} build {{of a large}} theropod. It was bipedal, the {{horizontal}} torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a carnivore, its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey. The skeleton of Megalosaurus is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> was not as heavily built as that of Torvosaurus, a close relative.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Clydesdale blood {{was added to}} the Irish draught breed in an attempt to improve and reinvigorate that declining breed. However, these efforts were not seen as successful, as Irish Draught breeders thought the Clydesdale blood made their horses coarser and prone to <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> defaults. The Clydesdale was {{instrumental}} {{in the creation of the}} Gypsy Vanner horse, developed in Great Britain. The Clydesdale, along with other draught breeds, was also used to create the Australian Draught Horse. In the early 20th century, they were often crossed with Dales ponies, creating mid-sized draught horses useful for pulling commercial wagons and military artillery.|$|E
5|$|Plateosaurus shows {{a number}} of cursorial adaptations, {{including}} an erect hind limb posture, a relatively long <b>lower</b> <b>leg,</b> an elongated metatarsus and a digitigrade foot posture. However, in contrast to mammalian cursors, the moment arms of the limb extending muscles are short, especially in the ankle, where a distinct, moment arm-increasing tuber on the calcaneum is missing. This means that in contrast to running mammals, Plateosaurus probably did not use gaits with aerial, unsupported phases. Instead, Plateosaurus must have increased speed by using higher stride frequencies, created by rapid and powerful limb retraction. Reliance on limb retraction instead of extension is typical for non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (<b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> joints). Adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. Adults are usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays eggs in a gelatinous mass, attaching them above or below the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch in a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} size of {{the hands}} and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25%–30% {{the length of the}} <b>lower</b> <b>leg.</b> This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E
5|$|During the 2002 season, Air Force {{allowed an}} average of 360.7yards per game, fourth in the Mountain West and 57th nationally. This was an {{improvement}} over the 2001 season, when the Falcons allowed 452.7yards per game on average. Air Force also was allowing far fewer points per game. In 2002, the Falcons allowed {{an average of}} 23.6points per game, down from more than 32per game in 2001. Air Force was successful in its kicking defense as well. Between 1990 and 2002, Air Force ranked second in terms of blocked kicks with 79. Virginia Tech was first, with 85. Air Force strong safety Mark Marsh was pronounced doubtful for the game due to a <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> injury he suffered {{in the days leading}} up to the San Francisco Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Equine hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E

5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the <b>lower</b> <b>leg.</b> As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{apparatus}} in {{the limbs}} {{of the horse}} - the suspensory apparatus and the stay apparatus. The fetlock joint is supported by group of <b>lower</b> <b>leg</b> ligaments, tendons and bones known as the suspensory apparatus. This apparatus carries much {{of the weight of}} the horse, both when standing and while moving, and prevents the fetlock joint from hyperextending, especially when the joint is bearing weight. During movement, the apparatus stores and releases energy {{in the manner of a}} spring: stretching while the joint is extended and contracting (and thus releasing energy) when the joint flexes. This provides a rebound effect, assisting the foot in leaving the ground. This ability to use stored energy makes horses' gaits more efficient than other large animals, including cattle. The suspensory apparatus consists of the suspensory ligament, the check ligament, the deep digital flexor tendon, the superficial flexor tendon, the common digital extensor tendon and the sesamoid bones.|$|E
