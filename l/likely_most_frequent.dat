40|$|A. When {{asked about}} the nature of mathematics, {{probably}} the simplest (and, <b>likely,</b> <b>most</b> <b>frequent)</b> answer we would give is that mathematics is a deductive science. One can (or, perhaps, one should?) agree with that. But we also ought to notice, that the development of mathematics is purely inductive. Whenever we consider a theory, with well-founded axioms and primitive notions, we never develop such a theory by listing all correct sentences within this theory and then verifying whether they are correct or not (that is, we never consider all correctly stated conjectures and check whether they are theorems). “Candidates for theorems ” are picked according to an “informal” key (i. e. trying to generalize some already known theorems, capture analo-gies between results from other theories, seek answers to questions posed by physics, biology, social sciences etc. by first formulating appropriate math-ematical models, and then – within such models – considering conceivable theorems that would provide answers to the original questions) ...|$|E

In tasawwuf (Islamic mysticism or Sufism) dhikr is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> the <b>most</b> <b>frequent</b> form of prayer. Among the orders of Muslims that practice dhikr, there are some who advocate silent, individual prayer, while others join together in an outward, group expression of their love for God. There are also a number of hadiths that give emphasis to remembrance of God.|$|R

40|$|Among {{bacteria}} that reach {{the central nervous}} system (CNS), Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is one of deadliest, in human and ruminant. This facultative intracellular bacterium has the particularity to induce meningitis, meningoencephalitis and rhombencephalitis. Mechanisms by which Lm accesses the CNS remain poorly understood, but two major routes of infection have been proposed, based on clinical, in vitro and in vivo observations. A retrograde neural route is likely to occur in ruminants upon crossing of the oral epithelium, and this probably accounts for the observation that Lm induces almost exclusively rhombencephalitis in these animals. In contrast, the hematogenous route is <b>likely</b> the <b>most</b> <b>frequent</b> in human, in whom bacteria circulating in the blood, either free or associated with leukocytes are thought to breach the blood-brain barrier. New animal models that faithfully reproduce the hallmarks of human neurolisterisosis will allow addressing the molecular mechanisms underlying Lm ability to induce CNS disease, and improve our understanding of the patho-physiology of this deadly infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is a Corpus-based {{research}} which analyzes the translation of Body-Related Metaphors in the Holy Koran by Yusuf Ali, Marmaduke Pickthal and Thomas Irving, {{within the framework of}} Peter Newmark’s procedures of metaphor translation. The data analyzed consists of a sample of 107 words and phrases which are categorized as: metaphors of ear, eye, face, and hand. Out of the seven procedures proposed by Newmark for translating metaphors, the translators applied five procedures. None of the translators applied Newmark’s fourth or sixth procedure and no new procedure was observed. The results reveal that among 107 metaphors examined, there is a general tendency (57. 94 %) towards reproducing the same image in the TL, and the three translators translated 68 metaphors (63. 55 %) using similar procedures. This study concludes that the <b>likely</b> and the <b>most</b> <b>frequent</b> metaphor translation procedures in the Holy Koran are: (1), to reproduce the same image in the TL, Newmark’s first procedure; and (2), to convert metaphor to sense (literal meaning), Newmark’s fifth procedure...|$|R
50|$|During the {{following}} years, the Portuguese tried several more times to conquer Aden and gain {{the mastery of}} the Red Sea, harassing shipping and battling the Egyptian Mamluk, then Ottoman navies, which gradually gained the upper hand. These actions {{as well as the}} sending of an annual fleet to blockade the Bab-el-Mandeb and prevent Indian merchant ships from entering the Red Sea <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> involved <b>frequent</b> use of Perim’s natural harbour. By the time the Ottomans captured Aden from its local ruler in 1538, the Red Sea was fast becoming a Turkish lake. The Ottoman fleet remained in firm control of the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb and Aden until the 1630s when the Turks were expelled from Yemen and the south half of the Red Sea.|$|R
30|$|Season of {{fire on the}} DRY plots {{may have}} been {{influenced}} by continuity of fuels and proximity to the Sacramento Valley, as well as the burning practices of the Nomlaki in the woodlands and grasslands. A common practice in these environments in California was to burn grasslands after seeds were collected, which normally took place in the summer (Lewis 1993, Stewart 2002, Anderson 2005). It is likely that the grasses would grow and set seed earlier in the year in the warmer, drier, lower elevations of the Sacramento Valley compared to our sample plots, as the perennial grasses of the time appear to have followed similar patterns of growth and drying as do the annuals of today (Biswell 1956). Thus, fires that spread from the grasslands into our DRY plots could then potentially be represented as growing season scars. Earlywood scars would <b>likely</b> have been <b>most</b> <b>frequent</b> in dry years, which also would potentially contribute to early seed set in grasses. This is similar to the finding of Norman and Taylor (2003) in northeastern California where early season fire scars were associated with unusually dry years.|$|R
