A single glass fibre was successfully mounted into TMA fibre configuration and several thermomechanical programmes were carried out over a wide temperature range from 20 °C to 900 °C. It was found that measured coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE) of boron-free E-glass fibre remained constant below 300 °C and the values had an excellent agreement with that found in the literature. At higher temperatures an abrupt length change in glass transition region allowed for the determination of glass transition temperature (Tg).

Higher temperatures during the previous winter (prior to the moult determining current wing length) explained 23 % of wing length decrease within our population, but changes may also be correlated with non-climatic environmental variation such as changes in farming mechanisms linked to food availability.

This trend was weaker, although not significantly so, among adults, suggesting that the decline in the sizes of recruits was offset by higher subsequent survival of larger birds post-recruitment.

Don (radiata pine) thinning and fertiliser trial in Tasman Forest, 11 years after the initial treatments were applied to 14 -year-old natural regeneration. Analyses {{of a number of}} wood properties were carried out on wood from the butt, 6 -m, and 12 -m levels in the stem. At the time of measurement, volume responses of up to 20 % were recorded. Densitometric analyses showed that there was an immediate decrease in wood density after the 1969 fertiliser treatment and thereafter a recovery to pre-treatment levels over about 5 years. The maximum decrease in mean density was 20 % in the 1969 - 70 growth period at the butt level and 12 % at 12 m. Differences in whole-tree density, however, were only about 20 kg/m 3, i. e., well under 5 %. It was concluded that the effects of fertiliser treatment on wood density were of little technological significance. Analyses of tracheid <b>length,</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> spiral grain, and resin content showed that treatments had no significant influence on these characteristics. The one property which showed a marked response to accelerated growth was the incidence of mild compression wood, which closely followed the pattern for basal area increment response.

40|$|Commercially {{available}} extractors and dryers {{are equipped}} with spreading and overfeeding devices to regain width and return the stretched loops to a more normal state. Spreading must be accompanied with overfeed {{in order to be}} effective ’ Relaxation drying allows those excessive tensions to be released since the fabric is dried under little or no restraints. Most relaxation dryers are based on the belt principle, where the fabric is placed between two belts and then passed through the drying zone. The bottom belt supports the fabric but allows for shrinkage, while the top belt prevents any stretching. In some cases, the bottom belt can be vibrated for additional mechanical action. Air flow is normally directed down and up through the fabric to give a ripple/wave effect. Once the drying is completed under relaxed condtions, those excessive tensions which have occurred during prior processing, have been released. If the fabric has been spread with overfeed prior to relax drying, width shrinkage occurs first. This may prevent the length from shrinking initially, but as the drying progresses, both width and <b>length</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurs.

The test train was shipped to the Materials and Fuels Complex in March 2010 for post-irradiation examination. The first PIE activities included non-destructive examination of the test train, followed by disassembly of the test train and individual capsules and detailed inspection of the capsule contents, including the fuel compacts and the graphite fuel holders. Dimensional measurements of the compacts, graphite holders, and steel capsules shells were performed using a custom vision measurement system (for outer diameters and lengths) and conventional bore gauges (for inner diameters). Gamma spectrometry of the intact test train gave a preliminary look at {{the condition of the}} interior components. No evidence of damage to compacts or graphite components was evident from the isotopic and gross gamma scans. Neutron radiography of the intact Capsule 2 showed a high degree of detail of interior components and confirmed the observation that there was no major damage to the capsule. Disassembly of the capsules was initiated using procedures qualified during out-of-cell mockup testing. Difficulties were encountered during capsule disassembly due to irradiation-induced changes in some of the capsule components’ properties, including embrittled niobium and molybdenum parts that were susceptible to fracture and swelling of the graphite fuel holders that affected their removal from the capsule shells. This required various improvised modifications to the disassembly procedure to avoid damage to the fuel compacts. Ultimately the capsule disassembly was successful and only one compact from Capsule 4 (out of 72 total in the test train) sustained damage during the disassembly process, along with the associated graphite holder. The compacts were generally in very good condition upon removal. Only relatively minor damage or markings were visible using high resolution photographic inspection. Compact dimensional measurements indicated diametrical shrinkage of 0. 9 to 1. 4 %, and <b>length</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of 0. 2 to 1. 1 %. The shrinkage was somewhat dependent on compact location within each capsule and within the test train.

If the measurements are not accurate (i. e., do not reflect real fish length), results of subsequent analyses may be affected considerably (McGurk, 1985; Fey, 1999; Porter et al., 2001).

Fission tracks in fluorapatite, enlarged by chemical etching, are widely used in geologic age-dating and {{the reconstruction of the}} thermal history of Earth’s crust. However, despite this wide spread application, there have been no systematic studies of the internal structure of unetched fission tracks or the atomic-scale process of track annealing. In this research, fission tracks in fluorapatite are demonstrated to be nano-channels instead of amorphous cores as had been assumed. The formation of hollow tracks is ascribed to the highly ionizing energy deposition of fission fragments inducing radiolytic decomposition of fluorapatite accompanied by the loss of volatile elements. The mechanism for thermal annealing of hollow tracks in fluorapatite is shown to be entirely different from that of amorphous tracks in zircon. The discontinuity of fission tracks, in addition to the shrinkage, prevents chemicals from entering into the hollow tracks for further etching, and then significantly reduces the etched <b>length.</b> The <b>shrinkage</b> of hollow fission tracks results from thermo-emission of vacancies or gaseous species from the cavities to surrounding solids instead of atomic-scale recovery of the amorphous core. The high diffusivity of atoms on the surface of hollow tracks causes the discontinuity of tracks either by Rayleigh instability, by Brownian motion, or by preferential motion of track segments. The preferential motion of atoms along c-axis causes more rapid annealing of fission tracks perpendicular to the c-axis. Under the electron beam, the hollow tracks segment into droplets and the track segments randomly move at room temperature or preferentially move along c-axis at high temperatures. The radiolytic annealing results from beam-enhanced diffusion, which is similar to thermally enhanced diffusion. The similarity in the morphology of fission tracks and electron beam-induced bubbles and their preferential elongation along c-axis at high temperatures further confirm that the tracks are actually hollow channels. The radius profile of fission track along its trajectory has been calculated. These data will be critical to developing an atomic-scale model of track fading as it applied to geologic age-dating...|$|R

During all the 20 th century, the progressive recession of the glacier revealed in a dramatic decrease in the thickness of its lower part, with a small reduction of its area and <b>length.</b> However, further <b>shrinkage</b> produced significant shortening and reduction in area which resulted in final decline of the Goësvatnet glacial dammed lake in 2002.

Extensive historical data was collected from two precasting plants and MN counties and it was found that, on average, the measured cambers at release and erection were only 74 % and 83. 5 %, respectively, of the design values. Through data collection, analysis, and material testing, {{it was found that the}} primary causes of the low camber at release were concrete release strengths that exceeded the design values, the use of an equation for concrete elastic modulus that greatly under-predicted the measured values, and thermal prestress losses not accounted for in design.

40|$|The {{composite}} resins {{are used}} as filling material to restore tooth cavities. The polymerization shrinkage of dental resin composites bonded to cavity walls leads to shrinkage force having {{negative effect on the}} restoration-tooth interface. The cavity must resist this tensile force. In a filling the bonded resin composite is deformed by the shrinkage and causes tensile stress on the tooth. Particularly, the light-cured composites harden very fast and at the beginning cause high tensile stress. The objective of the present study is to investigate the forces arising during polymerization shrinkage of several light-cured resin composites by proving different materials and sample lengths. After preliminary tests with nine series and 80 trials no influence can be determined by the application of a supporting polyethylene sleeve as well as different irradiation times or humidity appearing. The measurements of the principal trails have been affected at a universal test machine (Instron, model 6025) between two silan-coated steel disks (diameter d = 6 mm) during a period of 360 seconds. The irradiation time of the polymerization amounts to 60 seconds. Seven light-cured composites resins Dyract (Dentsply), Spectrum TPH (Dentsply), Visio-Dispers (Espe), Visio-Molar (Espe), Charisma (Kulzer), Charisma F (Kulzer) and Durafill VS (Kulzer), with three different sample lengths (2, 4, 8 mm, 10 trials each), in total 210 measurements, are investigated. Larger sample lengths cause a significantly larger shrinkage force (u-test after MANN and WHITNEY, p < 0. 0001). This force increase is not proportional to the sample <b>length.</b> The lowest <b>shrinkage</b> force is caused by Dyract (2 mm with 14. 6 N, 4 mm with 18. 2 N, 8 mm with 24. 6 N), the highest Visio-Dispers (2 mm with 29. 9 N, 4 mm with 38. 2 N, 8 mm with 53. 2 N). The minimum tensile stress is 0. 5 MPa and the maximum tensile stress is 1. 9 MPa. The forces arising from the seven materials differ significantly. No obvious correlation of inorganic filler volume, type of fillers, Young´s modulus and consistency could be found during the polymerization.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. December 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Catherine French. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 225 pages, appendices A-H. The camber, or total net upward deflection, of prestressed concrete bridge girders {{is the result}} of the eccentric axial compression force provided by prestressing strands which counteract the deflections due to gravity loads. At the time of strand release, the deflection behavior of prestressed concrete girders is considered to be elastic, and it is common for bridge designers to use elastic camber calculations to predict the camber at release. To estimate the girder camber at bridge erection, a multiplier method is typically used which amplifies the camber at release to roughly account for the time-dependent effects (e. g., creep and shrinkage) that occur between release and erection. Additionally, there are numerous factors which affect the camber at erection and are not known at the time of design, including the girder storage condition in the precasting yard (i. e., bunking) and the age of the girder at erection, that further lead to potential errors in the estimates of the girder camber at erection. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) uses the release camber calculations, based on gross section properties and elastic shortening losses, and a multiplier method to predict the camber at release and erection, respectively. An accurate estimate of camber at erection is important, because if the girders that arrive at a bridge site have cambers that are much lower or much higher than the expected design erection camber, it causes significant problems related to the formation of the bridge deck profile, the composite behavior of the girders and bridge deck, negative or very high stool height requirements, delays in construction and increased costs. It was recently observed that girders were being erected at bridge sites in Minnesota with cambers that were often much lower than predicted. The main side effect of this problem is required stool heights that are too high, especially at midspan. If the required stool heights approach the height of the protruding top flange shear reinforcement, the composite action needed between the girders and the bridge deck cannot be achieved, thus requiring the use of additional reinforcement or changing the entire bridge deck profile, which adds cost and creates delays. To account for this issue, MnDOT switched in late 2007 from the multiplier method recommended by Leslie A. Martin (1977) and PCI (2010), to a universal multiplier of 1. 5. However, the problem persisted and added costs and delays continued to occur. The primary objective of this study was to investigate and determine the cause of low girder camber at both release and bridge erection, which was observed by MnDOT, and to create an improved method for camber prediction, through modified calculations (if necessary) and a new set of multipliers. This objective was achieved through examination of extensive camber records from precasting plants and from in-situ measurements during erection of Minnesota I-girders, instrumentation and camber monitoring of fourteen girders from release to erection, concrete material testing, an analysis of prestress losses due to thermal effects, and PBEAM time-dependent camber modeling to investigate various effects including creep and shrinkage, girder support conditions during storage and age at erection. Extensive historical fabrication data was collected from two precasting plants (referred to as Plant A and B) for 1067 girders produced between 2006 and 2010. Camber at erection data was collected from the counties for 768 of those girders. On average, it was found that the measured camber at release for those 1067 girders was only 74 % of the design value. Furthermore, it was found that the measured camber at erection for the 768 girders was only 83. 5 %, on average, of the design value; and that girders erected at early ages almost always had cambers that were significantly lower than the design value. Because the predicted camber at erection is obtained by amplifying the elastic camber at release, inaccurate estimates of the camber at release can compound the problems of estimating the camber at erection. Various factors that affect the release camber were investigated, including concrete strength and modulus of elasticity, and variation in the strand prestress force. It was found that the increased concrete strengths achieved at the precasting plants (15. 5 % over the specified design value, on average) decrease camber due to the increased elastic modulus. Multiple concrete cylinder samples from both precasting plants were tested to investigate the concrete strength and elastic modulus over time. It was found that the ACI 363 R- 10 expression used by MnDOT to estimate the concrete modulus of elasticity from the specified concrete compressive strength greatly underestimates the elastic modulus of concrete produced at both precasting plants. The Pauw (ACI 318 - 08, AASHTO LRFD 2010) equation was determined to be the best predictor of the concrete elastic modulus, and when used to recalculate the release camber predictions for the 1067 historical girders, yielded significantly more accurate results. A thermal effects analysis was conducted to determine the effect of concrete and ambient temperatures on the strand stress at release. It was found that the combined thermal effects (and strand relaxation) cause a reduction in strand stress at release of approximately 3 %, on average. The position of each girder in the bed was also found to cause variations in prestress force through the redistribution of draped strand stress due to the harping sequence (at Plant A) and friction losses (at Plant B). Finally, it was found that high strand density, though often found in long MN-shape girders which had slightly lower release cambers, was not a major cause of reduced release camber. Thus, it was determined that the major causes for the discrepancy in release camber predictions and observed cambers were the increased concrete release strengths, the fact that the ACI 363 equation for concrete elastic modulus underestimated the measured elastic moduli, and strand prestress losses due to thermal effects. The effects of these primary factors were considered in re-predicting the cambers of a select data set for which detailed fabrication data, including curing and temperature records, were known. The girders included in this data set were those from which the concrete material samples were obtained, the instrumented girders, and selected girders from the historical data set. It was found that the accuracy of the re-predicted cambers was much greater than the original design cambers, and that the amount of variability in the results was reduced. Recommendations for modified camber calculations were made based on average effects (i. e., 15. 5 % release concrete strength increase, the Pauw equation for estimating concrete elastic modulus, and thermal prestress losses of 3 %). These recommendations were then tested against the entire historical girder database, and it was found that the discrepancy between measured and design camber values improved from approximately 74 % to 99 %, on average. This result confirmed that the revised release camber calculations provided much more accurate camber predictions than the original design equations. It should be noted that the overall scatter was not reduced because the recommendations were implemented in an average sense to all 1067 girders in the historical database. Once the discrepancy between measured and design release camber values was determined, various factors that affect long-term and erection camber were investigated, including solar radiation, relative humidity, concrete creep and <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>length</b> of cure and bunking/storage conditions. The program PBEAM was also validated for use in release and long-term camber modeling. It was found that solar radiation affects the measurement of camber by as much as 15 % during the course of a day, emphasizing that camber is a constantly fluctuating value. Relative humidity was found to cause changes in concrete creep and shrinkage and induce camber variability. High relative humidity during the winter months was also observed to cause slight increases in camber. Through PBEAM validation, it was found that the ACI 209 R- 92 concrete creep and shrinkage models provided the best results for long-term camber predictions and that the Mokhtarzadeh ACI 209 variation models provided a consistent lower bound. As such, the ACI 209 R- 92 creep and shrinkage models were used in the time-dependent camber modeling predictions. Weekend curing was found to cause lower erection cambers than weekday-cured girders, even though the camber discrepancy at release was less evident, due to additional stress recovery from cooler curing conditions. Finally, it was found that bunking/storage conditions led to increased cambers, additional camber variability, and possible exceedance of codified stress limits. Bunking limitations were recommended in order to limit these undesirable effects. These observations and results were used to create PBEAM inputs and ensuing long-term camber predictions for girders of varying depth and length. From these results, four “sets” of multipliers were created by comparing the long-term camber predictions to the current MnDOT and improved release camber predictions. Two of the sets of multipliers were developed to be applied to the MnDOT approach to predict release camber, and the other two were developed to be applied to the improved release camber predictions. For each approach, one set was based on a single multiplier to best predict erection camber and the other set recommended four different multipliers that reflected approximate age ranges for the girders at erection. These four different sets of multipliers were then applied to the historical girder data set and compared to the measured erection camber data. It was found that all four sets of multipliers greatly improved the erection camber predictions, with average measured vs. adjusted design erection camber percent values of 95. 6 %- 97. 1 %. However, only the “time-dependent” multipliers, which accounted for four potential ranges in girder age at erection, reduced the amount of scatter in the results. In particular, these multipliers alleviated the problem of over-predicted erection cambers for girders erected at early ages. Both the improved release camber predictions and the “Improved Time-Dependent” multipliers are recommended to be used by MnDOT for future camber predictions. In addition to the recommendations for the modified camber calculations at release and the new set of multipliers, recommendations for girder fabrication were also created to reduce camber variability and improve girder production at the precasting plants. Included in these recommendations are limitations for bunking/storage conditions and a spreadsheet created to produce more accurate temperature corrections (for Plants A and B). It was found that the amount of camber variability that can be expected using the recommended calculations and multipliers is approximately ± 15 %, or even lower if the girder fabrication recommendations are put into practice...|$|R
