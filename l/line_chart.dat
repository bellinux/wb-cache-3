40|$|We {{investigate}} {{techniques for}} visualizing time series data and evaluate their effect in value comparison tasks. We compare <b>line</b> <b>charts</b> with horizon graphs — a space-efficient time series visualization technique — across {{a range of}} chart sizes, measuring the speed and accuracy of subjects’ estimates of value differences between charts. We identify transition points at which reducing the chart height results in significantly differing drops in estimation accuracy across the compared chart types, and we find optimal positions in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve at which viewers performed quickly without attendant drops in accuracy. Based on these results, we propose approaches for increasing data density that optimize graphical perception.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of schooling on the performance of Youth and Adults (EJA) students in solving activities of construction and interpretation of bar and <b>line</b> <b>charts.</b> The participants were 30 students divided into three groups: 10 students in the early years of elementary school, 10 students in the final years of elementary school and 10 high school students. The results indicated no significant differences in the performance presented by participants according to the segments of education to which they belonged. There were significant differences in performance on the basis of the activities of interpretation of the bar charts, but not between the bar and <b>line</b> <b>charts...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this series}} of two papers is to propose an {{original}} and low-cost tool dedicated to industrial applications {{and based on the}} reflection ellipsometry technique for in situ characterization of dielectric materials at microwave frequencies. In this first paper, different theoretical developments are presented that concern first a specific numerical method for calculating the complex permittivity of a single-layer sample from the measured parameters. Based on contour <b>line</b> <b>charts,</b> this method allows obtaining simultaneously the relative uncertainties on the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity. Secondly, for experimental comparisons with the classical Fresnel method, a numerical data processing method based on contour <b>line</b> <b>charts</b> has also been developed, which aims at the determination of the reflection coefficients in both parallel and perpendicular polarizations of the material...|$|R
