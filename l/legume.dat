5|$|Insects are a {{major factor}} in the low yields of African cowpea crops, and they affect each tissue {{component}} and developmental stage of the plant. In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The <b>legume</b> pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>legume</b> vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).|$|E

40|$|Many Missouri {{pastures}} {{have adequate}} grass stands, {{but they need}} <b>legumes.</b> If the soil is capable of growing them, <b>legumes</b> should be established in grass sods.

5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the <b>legume</b> roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs {{benefit from}} feeding on fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in {{addition}} to food pellets which are often based from timothy. Alfalfa is also a popular food choice; most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over the feeding of alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a <b>legume</b> rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones due to excess calcium, in any but pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa {{as a source for}} replenishment of protein, amino acids, and fiber.|$|E
5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. <b>Legume</b> hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard work, but the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
40|$|<b>Legumes</b> are dried {{to improve}} their conservation. The paper proposes a new {{alternative}} re-hydration method for dried <b>legumes.</b> The use of the rapid solid liquid dynamic extraction with the Naviglio extractor technology is proposed and used.

50|$|Pairing Brachiaria ruziziensis with <b>legumes</b> can {{significantly}} affect the production {{levels of the}} crop. Studies have shown that plots planted with <b>legumes</b> showed a boost in total dry matter production of 524%. Not only does it increase production but the nitrogen fixing capacities of <b>legumes</b> offers a much cheaper alternative to expensive fertilizers.|$|R
50|$|Nodulation (Nod) {{factors are}} {{signaling}} molecules produced by bacteria known as rhizobia during {{the initiation of}} nodules on the root of <b>legumes.</b> A symbiosis is formed when <b>legumes</b> take up the bacteria. The rhizobia produce nitrogen for the plant, and the <b>legumes</b> produce leghemoglobin to carry away any oxygen that would inhibit nitrogenase activity.|$|R
5|$|Most cowpeas {{are grown}} on the African continent, {{particularly}} in Nigeria and Niger {{which account for}} 66% of world production. A 1997 estimate suggests that cowpeas are cultivated on , have a worldwide production of 3 million tonnes and are consumed by 200 million people on a daily basis. Insect infestation is a major constraint {{to the production of}} cowpea, sometimes causing losses of over 90% loss in yield. The <b>legume</b> pod borer Maruca vitrata is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus maculatus the main post-harvest pest.|$|E
5|$|Some {{non-standard}} {{amino acids}} {{are used as}} defenses against herbivores in plants. For example, canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes, and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia gladiata (sword bean). This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing. The non-protein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of <b>legume,</b> in particular Leucaena leucocephala. This compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants.|$|E
5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} <b>legume</b> from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely responsible for its name.|$|E
40|$|Vegetational {{sampling}} of the <b>legumes</b> of Arapaho Prairie, located in the southwest portion of the Sand Hills of Nebraska, was conducted in June 1980. Lathyrus polymorphus, Petalostemon purpureum, Psoralea digitata and Amorpha canescens were the leading dominants. The overall density of <b>legumes</b> was 0. 309 plants m- 2. Of eight examined, only Petalostemon villosum and Glycyrrhiza lepidota supported large numbers of nodules. The others including the dominant <b>legumes</b> were unnodulated or had only a few, usually degenerate nodules. It appears that the <b>legumes</b> are of minor importance in the overall N economy of Arapaho Prairie. Nevertheless {{since many of the}} <b>legumes</b> tend to occupy disturbed areas (blowouts and gullies) dinilfogen fixation may be important during early stages of establishment...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work which}} genotypically characterised rhizobia of native, crop and weed <b>legumes</b> in New Zealand and {{examined}} their cross-nodulation ability is reviewed {{and related to}} earlier work with focus on New Zealand pasture systems. The New Zealand native <b>legumes</b> were exclusively effectively nodulated by novel strains of Mesorhizobium which did not nodulate crop or weed <b>legumes.</b> Clovers, lucerne, Lotus and grain <b>legumes</b> were effectively nodulated by different genera, species and biovars of rhizobia primarily originating from inoculum. Rhizobial symbionts of white clover have established over wide areas in New Zealand. Weed <b>legumes</b> are effectively nodulated by different genera/species of rhizobia depending on species.

40|$|Grain <b>legumes</b> {{are very}} {{important}} in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (1 GP) countries for their contribution to human and animal nutrition, as components of indigenous cropping systems, and as restorers of soil fertility. Yields of grain <b>legumes</b> have remained low due to several production constraints. There is a undening gap between the growing demand and production of grain <b>legumes</b> in the IGP. Rice and wheat production has increased significantly over the previous decades but the area and production of grain <b>legumes</b> has gradually declined. Various abiotic, biotic, and socioeconomic constraints can explain the poor performance of these <b>legumes,</b> relative to that of major cereals and cash crops. Previous research on improving grain <b>legumes</b> production in the IGP has been relatively limited and lacking in focus. Efforts to develop, assemble, and evaluate improved production technologies have only been recent. Previous research concentrated mainly on varietal improvement. Factors such as inherently limited yield potential, susceptibility to various pests and diseases, and sensitivity to edaphic and microclimatic changes contribute to large variations in the output of grain <b>legumes</b> from year to year. The problem is therefore highly complex, {{making it difficult to}} halt the declining trend of grain <b>legumes</b> (in terms of area and production) unless improved cultural practices ensuring sustainable high yields are developed together with promising cropping patterns. It is concluded that substantial increases in the production of grain <b>legumes</b> in the IGP can be achieved by fine tuning management aspects and thereby increasing total system productivity and sustainability...|$|R
5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, tomatoes are less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and <b>legume</b> pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a <b>legume</b> that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
25|$|A {{classic example}} of {{mutualism}} is the interaction between rhizobia soil bacteria and legumes (Fabaceae). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in <b>legume</b> plants via an exchange of molecular signals. Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme. The <b>legume</b> benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant {{as well as the}} protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the <b>legume,</b> {{this is an example of}} endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.|$|E
