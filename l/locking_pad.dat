40|$|Hyperthreaded (HT) and {{simultaneous}} multithreaded (SMT) processors are {{now available}} in commodity workstations and servers. This technology is designed to increase throughput by executing multiple concurrent threads on a single physical processor. These multiple threads share the processor’s functional units and on-chip memory hierarchy {{in an attempt to}} make better use of idle resources. Most OpenMP applications and runtime libraries have been written assuming an Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP), not an SMT, model. Threads executing on the same physical SMT processor have interactions on data locality and resource sharing that do not occur on traditional SMPs. This work focuses on tuning the behavior of an OpenMP runtime library to improve the performance of applications executing on SMPs with SMT processors. First we implement and evaluate three techniques that have been asserted as important on HT processors: the use of pause instructions in spin loops, incorporation of per-thread stack offsets in slave threads, and <b>lock</b> <b>padding.</b> After implementing these techniques in the Omni OpenMP runtime library, we discover that both pause instructiosn and <b>lock</b> <b>padding</b> show noticible improvements, while stack offsets show negligible gains. We then propose three adaptive loop schedulers: a region-based scheduler, a loop-based scheduler and hardware counter based scheduler. These novel schedulers determine effective hierarchical schedules for individual parallel regions or loops to exploit the unique nature of SMPs with HT processors. We compare the performance of our three proposed schedulers against several standard schedulers using the SPEC and NAS OpenMP benchmark suites. We show that schedule selection must be done at the granularity of loops not regions, and that our loop-based adaptive schedulers outperform all other approaches on average, increasing speedup on average by over 25 % when all thread contexts are used.

50|$|A gruesome tale is told of his sufferings in hospital. He {{had such}} pain and fever {{that he could}} not keep still to allow his bones to knit together. The {{solution}} was to place his leg in a <b>locked</b> and <b>padded</b> box, however he complained of pains and discomfort that was not seemingly connected with his wounds. The box was opened and a spectacle presented itself to the view of the medical officers present unparalleled in the history of their experience. Hundreds of maggots an inch long were stuck into the calf with only the tips of their tails to be seen, the remainder of their bodies being embedded in the flesh. With some difficulty they removed them, not realising that the maggots had cleaned out his wounds and were probably the reason for his ultimate recovery.He was 17 weeks in hospital in Gibraltar recovering and returned to England to take command of a signal station in Teignmouth between 1806 and 1813. At this time he invented the homograph, an early form of semaphore, for which he was presented with the Society of Arts silver medal by the Duke of Norfolk in May 1809. He served a year on the Albion with Captain John Ferris Devonshire until invalided home due to the terrible pains in his leg caused by the cold. After this he commanded the prison ship Ganges at Plymouth, before being pensioned off in 1838 at £91 5s. per year as a commander retired and with awards of £50 and later £30 from the Patriotic Society for his wound.|$|R

5000|$|However, this {{conclusion}} raised another {{question as to}} how Saulin {{managed to get the}} train moving again. A fail-safe mechanism on the cars locks the brakes in the on position if the valve is closed. The only way to start the train again is to re-open the valve or manually unlock each brake pad. SNCF policy requires to call for an engineer to examine the train (who would have probably found the closed valve). However, Saulin, anxious to continue the trip, enlisted the help of Boveé to work along opposite sides of the train unlocking each brake. Saulin believed the cause of the problem to be a common condition known as an [...] "air lock". When the emergency brake is activated, an [...] "air lock" [...] {{is the result of the}} compressed air filling up the brake pipes, clogging them and preventing the brakes from working. The brake <b>pads</b> <b>lock</b> as part of the fail-safe mechanism when an air lock occurs. To fix this problem, the trapped air must be bled out of the pipe to release the brakes. Nevertheless, Saulin had no idea of what he had done, and stated that the pressure gauge in his cab was marking the correct measure, which is why he thought all the braking systems were in working order. Unbeknownst to him, he had closed the main valve, isolating the front carriage from the rest of the train. Thus the gauge only showed the pressure of the first carriage's brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The Gibson Victory was an {{electric}} guitar produced by Gibson Guitars from 1981 until 1983 (although some sources say production lasted until 1984). [...] During the late 1970s and early 1980s, musicians watched Eddie Van Halen play his Frankenstrat and questioned and rethought everything about their instruments. They insisted on engineering advances allowing more speed and playability of skyscraping leads and rock crushing shred. The master luthiers in Kalamazoo responded to these demanding guitarists by designing the Victory. The Victory, a superstrat, was {{radical departure from}} Gibson's image as an old-fashioned guitar maker. MV stood for Multi-Voice. X stood for ten They were created by the Gibson research and development team in Kalamazoo, MI, with the body work by Chuck Burge, and the multi-voice electronics by Tim Shaw. The Victory MV's were available with an optional / special order Kahler Tremolo System. The Victory MV's had a three-point top-adjust [...] "tune-o-matic" [...] bridge designed by  Rendal Wall and patent granted in June 1982. The three post holes in the underside allow {{either side of the}} bridge unit to be moved forwards or backwards for intonation of ultra light to extremely heavy string gauges, and twelve interchangeable individually-adjustable saddles, six standard nylon saddles and 6 optional brass saddles to set the fine intonation and affect tone. The Victory MV's came with a series of specially designed Humbucker Pickups carefully made one at a time on the “center focused” KZ/LP115 PAF Pickup Winder, with high sensitivity and unique tonal signature with fewer turns of wire compared to high production winding machines that produce more scatter and a wider magnetic aperture, Each pickup across the range was different, and specifically designed for the role it was assigned. The location of the Pickups were carefully calculated to provide full frequency response and minimize dead spots by avoidance of string nodal points. Humbucker pickups are inherently low noise because the interference is significantly reduced via phase cancellation, however the Victory MV’s had additional shielding connected to ground with the use of special electrically conductive black paint in the routed out area under the pickguard. Truly silent when it should be. The coil tap switch in the up position is humbucker; in the down position is single coil. Gibson had well established business agreements for over 100 years with the best wood suppliers in the world and Gibson Luthiers had first pick to craft the Victory MV's. The availability of premium old growth wood with tight grain was better in the 1980s than it is today because of new laws and limited natural resources. The Victory MV's body and tri-laminated quartersawn neck was crafted from solid eastern hard rock maple, with a Janka Hardness ranking of 1450 pound-force, a crushing strength of 7,830 pound-force per square inch , and a tensile elasticity modulus of 1,830,000 pound-force per square inch, eastern hard rock maple is extremely hard, dense, and stiff, producing earthquaking sustain. [...] The tri-laminate opposing wood grain neck design strengthened the overall neck and gave more tuning stabilization. Evidence shows that wood improves with age, the polymerization of sap over decades, once the wood is removed from the living tree crystalizes. Aged wood also loses its ability to absorb moisture, causing the wood to become more stiff and stable as it ages… the perfect recipe for a straight, high quality guitar neck, level fret board, and great sound. The Victory MV's Set-in neck [...] and silky smooth rock-hard quartersawn Madagascan ebony fret board required better tools, more time, accuracy, attention to detail, and skill to craft, but produces a warmer fuller tone and transfers resonant energy freely and immediately due to the tight permanent coupling, and facilitates ripples of vibrational energy that round out and thicken the sound, in comparison to buzzy guitars with removable screw-on necks having a metal plate and adjustment shims. The chamfered cutaway offers musicians with large hands better access to play in the top frets. The fourteen degree pitch headstock shape and tuning machine alignment allows for a perfectly straight pull on the strings and optimum string down pressure. The Gibson Victory MV's are not recommended for the weak, these sledge axes weigh a solid nine pounds but are perfectly balanced both on the strap or on the knee, Luthiers know guitars with more mass and density have more brilliance and sustain. in fact some older Gibson models weighed as much as twelve pounds. According to Gibson, Victory MV’s were only produced in Candy Apple Red, Antique Cherry Sunburst, & Twilight Blue. However sometimes a retailer who did a lot of business with Gibson would be able to ask for a small number of guitars with a special finish. Mention has been made of Roy Orbison's special order black Victory MVX. [...] The Victory MV's came standard with a rugged black Gibson branded [...] "8170" [...] dual <b>lock</b> and key <b>padded</b> hard case with internal storage box. Decode the serial number {{on the back of the}} headstock to determine where your Victory was made and the date of it's manufacture.|$|R
