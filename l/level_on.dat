Liverpool were three points behind, but had a game in hand, so could still win the title if both City and United faltered. City faced tenth-placed Newcastle United at St James' Park; United were at home to bottom-half Sunderland. Bookmakers made United slight favourites for the title.|$|E

5|$|A CO-oximeter {{can be used}} to {{determine}} carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters estimate carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip similar to a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of the different types of hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation <b>level</b> <b>on</b> a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{start to}} their league campaign, with one defeat {{in their first}} 12 matches saw Arsenal begin November in first spot. Although the club were winless during the Christmas period, their chances of winning the title {{remained}} intact. A run of two draws and losses in February was more severe, as it moved Arsenal down to fourth spot. Draws in April prompted Wenger to rule his team out of the title race and make priority to second spot, which came with a qualifying spot for the Champions League. Defeat to Newcastle United in the penultimate {{game of the season}} all but ended Arsenal's chances of finishing second, given Newcastle's superior goal difference. A win on the final day against Derby County meant the club finished third, <b>level</b> <b>on</b> points with Newcastle and Liverpool.|$|E

Although based in his home country, like all Liechtenstein clubs Vaduz played league {{football}} in Switzerlandat the time in the third tierbut also competed in the Liechtenstein Football Cup. In Burgmeier's first season the team won promotion to the Challenge League and won the Liechtenstein Cup with a 9–0 defeat against Ruggell in the final. He scored his first goal at the higher <b>level</b> <b>on</b> 31 July 2001, in a postponed game from {{the first round of the}} season, which finished in a 4–1 victory against Thun. However, Vaduz finished in 11thplace in the Fall Season, before results improved and they finished in second place in the Final Table, avoiding being relegated. The team also successfully defended their Liechtenstein Cup defeating USV Eschen/Mauren 6–1 in the final.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disappointment}} {{of the previous}} season, Arsenal won their seventh League title in 1952–53; {{in one of the}} closest title races, they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing <b>level</b> <b>on</b> points. The title looked to be Preston's after Arsenal lost to them 2–0 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season, but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 3–2, to take the title on 0.099 of a goal. That proved to be Arsenal's last trophy for seventeen years, as Arsenal's fortunes began to wane, particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956.|$|E

Above the tank top <b>level,</b> <b>on</b> the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated.
