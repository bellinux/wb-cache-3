Three Virginia Indian <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> they are not {{offended}} by the name Redskins but {{are more concerned about}} other issues such as the lack of Federal recognition for any Virginia tribe.

500|$|Army <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> {{having a}} large ground army is still {{necessary}} for deterrence and [...] "regime change" [...] operations. They also {{realize that their}} equipment will be mostly modernized versions of current equipment {{for the rest of}} the decade. Technologies from the GCV program are being explored, although development and procurement of a vehicle is not. By mid-November 2013, both BAE and General Dynamics designs had passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR), but neither company had commenced building prototypes. The Army was increasingly willing to slow down the GCV program or push it back from EMD to research and development. While the Army had said previously that it was their highest priority acquisition program, they had since shifted their main modernization priority to an integrated electronic command network. Short-term incremental upgrades will be applied to existing weapons systems to keep them from becoming obsolete, and advanced technologies available in the future will be used to build entirely new systems when funding is restored.|$|E
2500|$|Union <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> that {{unions and}} OWS can offer mutual support, with OWS gaining from the union's money, stature, and large membership, and the {{weakened}} labor movement absorbing the protesters vitality. The Industrial Workers of the World announced on September 28, 2011, that its General Executive Board (GEB), and the General Defense Committee (GDC) had issued statements {{of support for}} Occupy Wall Street. After numerous arrests of protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge, police commandeered city buses to pick up detained protesters and union drivers later sued the New York Police Department. Union President John Samuelsen said, [...] "We're down with these protesters. We {{support the notion that}} rich folk are not paying their fair share. Our bus operators {{are not going to be}} pressed into service to arrest protesters anywhere". On October 4, representatives from more than 14 of the country's largest labor unions joined the protesters for a mass rally and march. In early November, National Nurses United (NNU), the largest union of registered nurses in the nation, expressed support for OWS and rallied in front of the White House and Department of Treasury. Karen Higgins, co-president of NNU, said, [...] "A real finance tax would generate $350 billion a year in the U.S. alone and bring relief to families out of homes, friends out of work, patients out of care, communities running out of time. The tax starts a revenue flow back to the 99 percent." ...|$|E

60|$|Is that true? Our <b>leaders</b> <b>say</b> so, and {{we believe}} them. We would not support them if we did not. And if it is true, have the statesmen of the Allies made it as transparently and convincingly clear to the German people as possible? That {{is one of the}} supreme {{questions}} of the present time. We cannot too earnestly examine it. Because in the answer to it lies the reason why so many men were killed yesterday on the eastern and western front, so many ships sunk, so much property destroyed, so much human energy wasted for ever upon mere destruction, and why to-morrow and the next day and the day after--through many months yet, perhaps--the same killing and destroying must still go on.|$|E
