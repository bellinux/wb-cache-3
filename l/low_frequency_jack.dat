In the present work, the mental performance of students exposed to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises at low and high levels (45 & 65 dB) were studied. Additionally, other factors such as annoyance, sensitivity to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise and hearing status of participants were considered. Materials and Methods: After generating <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises required for the study, a pilot study was conducted. Then, 54 students participated in the main study after preliminary tests. Their mental performances were evaluated with standard psychological tests while they were exposed to <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and reference noises at 45 and 65 dBA. Results: The results showed that noise annoyance and <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise sensitivity do not have a significant correlation with age and sex. The results also revealed that, <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise at 65 dB can decrease concentration (P= 0. 003) and increase response time (P= 0. 039) of performance in comparison with <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> noise at 45 dB. On the other hand, reference noise at 65 dB can increase speed (P< 0. 001) of performance in comparison with reference noise at 45 dB.
