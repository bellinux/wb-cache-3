5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that had developed over the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into a depression early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast. After landfall the storm continued {{to move to the}} northwest, weakening to a depression again on July 2 over northeast Madhya Pradesh. It degenerated into a remnant <b>low</b> <b>over</b> central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} prevailing wind that lasts {{for several months}} within tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and neighboring countries {{to refer to the}} big seasonal winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat <b>low</b> <b>over</b> the Asian, African, and North American continents during May through July, and over Australia in December.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ilona caused {{moderate}} damage across the Pilbara region of Western Australia in mid-December1988. The system originated from a monsoon trough that coalesced into a tropical <b>low</b> <b>over</b> the Timor Sea on 12December. The system initially moved southwest, {{before moving on}} a more westerly course. Steady intensification occurred and Ilona reached its peak strength on 17December as a low-end severe tropical cyclone. A southward turn directed the cyclone toward Western Australia, and it made landfall near Mardie Station. The system subsequently degraded over land and dissipated on 19December.|$|E

5|$|The mid-level African easterly jet {{occurs during}} the Northern Hemisphere summer between 10°N and 20°N above West Africa, and the nocturnal poleward {{low-level}} jet {{occurs in the}} Great Plains of east and South Africa. The low-level easterly African jet stream is considered to {{play a crucial role}} in the southwest monsoon of Africa, and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season. The formation of the thermal <b>low</b> <b>over</b> northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the complex {{interaction}} between an upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and {{the tail end}} of a cold front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level <b>low</b> <b>over</b> the Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Amy {{originated}} from a weak trough on June24 accompanied by scattered showers and thunderstorms over Florida. The system tracked westward {{in response to}} an upper-tropospheric <b>low</b> <b>over</b> Georgia. By June26, a surface circulation developed north of the Bahamas and satellite imagery showed a significant increase in convective activity and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as a tropical depression early on June27. On June28, the system attained tropical storm-status while tracking north-northeast off the coast of North Carolina.|$|E
40|$|Polar lows are intense meso- a -scale {{cyclones}} {{that develop}} over the oceans poleward {{of the main}} baroclinic zone. A number of previous studies have reported polar <b>low</b> formation <b>over</b> the Sea of Japan within the East Asian winter monsoon. To understand the climatology of polar <b>lows</b> <b>over</b> the Sea of Japan, a tracking al- gorithm for polar lows {{is applied to the}} recent JRA- 55 reanalysis. The polar low tracking is applied to 36 cold seasons (October–March) from October 1979 to March 2015. The polar <b>lows</b> <b>over</b> the Sea of Japan reach their maximum intensity on the southeastern side of the midline between the Japanese islands and the Asian continent. Consistent with previous case studies, composite analysis demonstrates that the polar low devel- opment is associated with the enhanced northerly flow on the western side of a synoptic-scale extratropical cyclone, with the cold trough in the midtroposphere and with increased heat fluxes from the sea surface. Furthermore, the present climatological study has revealed two dominant directions of motion of the polar lows: southward and eastward. Southward-moving polar lows are steered by a strong northerly flow in the lower troposphere, which is enhanced on the western side of synoptic-scale extratropical cyclones, while the eastward-moving polar lows occur within a planetary-scale westerly flow in the midlatitudes. Thus, the di- rection of polar low motion reflects the difference in planetary- and synoptic-scale conditions...|$|R

5|$|Tropical Storm Julio quickly {{weakened}} over land, {{although it}} initially maintained strong convection near its center. By early on August 26, however, the low-level and upper-level circulations separated, with the upper-circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low-level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, {{after having been}} separated from its deep convection. Later in the day, the NHC discontinued advisories after the storm failed to maintain enough organized convection {{to be considered a}} tropical cyclone.The remnants of Julio were absorbed by a thermal <b>low</b> <b>over</b> the Mojave Desert on August 27.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} {{existed in the}} central Caribbean Sea in late October. It steadily organized, and was classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen on October 31. It moved northwestward, and entered a high-shear environment due to an upper level low situated toward the end of a high pressure system. By November 1, little convection remained as the weak depression turned to the north and crossed Cuba. A burst of convection organized over the depression, and brought strong wind gusts to the Florida Keys as it passed through the area on November 2. It continued to the north-northwest, paralleling the Florida west coast, and lost all of its convection on November 3. The system turned to the northeast, and merged with a weak extratropical <b>low</b> <b>over</b> northern Florida on November 4.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying <b>low</b> <b>over</b> the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

5|$|A weak surface trough of low {{pressure}} emerged into the northeast Gulf of Mexico on August 1. Under weak steering currents, the trough drifted westward, and slowly became better defined with {{the formation of}} a circulation in the mid- through upper-levels of the atmosphere. An upper-level low developed over Texas, providing unfavorable amounts of vertical wind shear. A surface circulation was first evident on satellite imagery on August 4 just off the coast of Mississippi, and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the Mississippi Sound. As the upper-level <b>low</b> <b>over</b> Texas drifted southwestward, an anticyclone developed over the system, with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned. On August 7, the system drifted into southeastern Louisiana. It continued to become better organized, and on August 8 it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of Lake Pontchartrain. This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters. However, increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry air from the Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the country since 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant <b>low</b> <b>over</b> Iran through June 8.|$|E
5|$|At Monte Cassino the {{historic}} abbey overlooked Allied positions below. Ground commanders were sure the monastery {{was being used}} by the Germans as an observation post. Lieutenant-General Bernard C. Freyberg, commander of the New Zealand Corps preparing for a new assault on the mountain, had repeatedly requested that the abbey be bombed. Taking advantage of the German practice of not giving away their positions by firing on small planes, Devers and Eaker flew <b>low</b> <b>over</b> the monastery, and saw what they believed to be a radio aerial and enemy soldiers moving in and out. Wilson reluctantly agreed to its bombing. On 15 February Devers watched waves of American bombers level the monastery with Alexander, Clark, Freyberg and Eaker. But follow-up attacks that day, and over the next eight days, failed to take the position, much less break the Gustav Line. Devers visited Anzio on 16 February, and agreed with Alexander that Lucas should be relieved. Clark did so on 22 February.|$|E
