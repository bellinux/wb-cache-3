Miniature queens have been observed in six species of stingless bees including P. remota, Cephalotrigona femorata, Plebeia juliani, Schwarziana quadripunctata, Plebeia emerina and Nannotrigona testaceicornis. In most of these species, the production of miniature queens is very rare. However, both large and miniature queens have been observed in some nests of P. remota. Studies, done by M.F.

50|$|It was the egg <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> of Australorps that {{attracted}} world attention when in 1922-23 {{a team of}} six hens set a world record by laying 1,857 eggs {{for an average of}} 309.5 eggs per hen during a 365 consecutive day trial. It must be remembered that these figures were achieved without the lighting regimens of the modernintensive shed. Such performances had importation orders flooding in from England, United States of America, South Africa, Canada and Mexico.

Methods A total of 432 32 -wk-old laying hens were randomly divided into 6 treatments with 6 replicates of 12 birds each. The birds were fed diets containing SBM, LCSM 100, or DRM 100 individually or in combination with an equal amount of crude protein (CP) (LCSM 50, DRM 50, and LCSM 50 -DRM 50). The experimental diets, which were isocaloric (metabolizable energy, 11. 11 MJ/kg) and isonitrogenous (CP, 16. 5 %), had similar digestible amino acid profile. The feeding trial lasted 12 weeks.

The original data were transformed using the well-established power transformation to approach normality. The genetic evaluation was carried out with a multipletrait animal model, based on transformed and untransformed data, respectively. Two traits of <b>laying</b> <b>performance,</b> of egg weight and body weight were analysed simultaneously. To compare the efficiency of breeding values the method of simulated selection with biological data (dam-daughter pairs) was used.

40|$|In {{domestic}} poultry, {{a strong}} negative relationship exists between body weight and reproductive effectiveness. In Taiwan, Hakka people like large chicken lead to Hakka chickens {{were selected for}} large body size which decreases the reproduction performance of breeding stock. The purpose of this experiment was the study of growth and <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> of Hakka chicken (synthetic line). This study used 499 and 361 birds in generation one and two (G 1 and G 2). Their records include live body weight from hatch to 32 wks of age (every 4 wks), egg weight (at first egg and 35 wks) and individual egg production from age at first egg to 40 weeks of age. Growth parameters, heritabilities, genetic correlation between traits and phenotypic and genetic trends were estimated. The results found ranges of body weight at 32 weeks of age were 3 - 4 kg and 2 - 3 kg {{for males and females}} respectively. Growth parameters, the first one is age at inflection (TI) of Generation 1 were 67 and 60 days, generation 2 were 63 and 69 days for male and female respectively, asymptotic body weights at an infinite (A) of generation 1 were 4964 g, 2966 g, generation 2 were 4858 g and 3093 g for male and female respectively. Egg production to 40 weeks of age in generation two (egg number = 82. 7 eggs) was higher than generation one (egg number = 63. 3 eggs). Heritabilities were high in body weight and growth parameter (most over 0. 5 except for body weight at 4 weeks = 0. 01 because chicken in Generation 1 got coccidiosis and growth rate = 0. 03 because maternal effect), middle heritability founded in egg weight (0. 14 - 0. 16) and low to middle in egg production (0. 04 - 0. 25). High mortality rate was found in both generations. Genetic trends of egg productions were increase trends in Generation 2 but selected egg number occurred only one generation. Generation 1 got disease, hot wave and typhoon during experiment. In conclusion Hakka chickens (synthetic line) increased body size and egg production just by one generation of selection. However, the rapid increase of egg production might be affected by environmental variation as indicated by a low estimated heritability. Furthermore, two disadvantages need to overcome are the high mortality rate and the low egg production due to heavy body weights.

Also, the naked neck (Na) gene has received great attention for poultry production, because of their association with heat tolerance. From this view, An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of sex-linked dwarf (dw), autosomal naked neck (Na) and double segregation genes on <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> and some hematological parameters of egg-type chicken under prevailing condition of Egypt. Three hundred brown Dahlem (Germany strain) hens from four genotypes {normal body size-normally feathered (Dw-nana), dwarf size-normally feathered (dw-nana), normal body size-naked neck (Dw-Nana) and dwarf size-naked neck (dw-Nana) } were reared under the same environmental, managerial and hygienic conditions from 20 to 40 weeks of age. The results obtained showed that the sex-linked dwarf (dw) gene significantly reduced body weight, egg mass and egg number compared to normal body size sibs. On the other hand, the dwarf birds had significantly consumed less feed and better feed conversion ratio. With respect to internal and eggshell quality, it could speculate {{that the presence of}} dw gene associated with higher yolk percentage, higher haugh units and thicker eggshell thickness than that of normal body size counterparts. Concerning hematological parameters, the presence of dw gene significantly reduced plasma T 3, plasma cholesterol and liver enzymes compared to normal body size hens. The opposite trend was noticed for both total lipids and triglycerides. In contrary to dw gene, the Na gene had a better effect on <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> parameters of egg-type chicken. With respect to double segregation genes, it could be noted that the introducing Na gene could compensate the reducing effect associated with dwarfing (dw) gene on <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> measurements and some hematological parameters. In conclusion, the loss of revenue due to reduction in egg production associated with sex-linked dwarf gene may be exceeded by revenue saved from lower feed intake and better feed efficiency.

Parameters measured were bodyweight, body length, breast girth and keel length. Body weight and other body dimensions were significantly (P< 0. 05) influenced by strain of chickens. Nera black layers consistently had the highest body parameters at all ages. Generally, body parameters increased with increasing age of the birds. The correlation coefficients amongst the body parameters revealed positively high and significant (P< 0. 05) relationship. Traits considered for egg <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> were egg number and egg weight. Strains significantly (P< 0. 05) affected mean egg number and egg weight at weeks 4, 7 and 8; and 12, 13 and 15 respectively. BRS laid more eggs per bird than other genotypes, followed by NB and BLS, the least. Egg weight was highest in BRS, NB and BLS in that order. Estimates of correlation coefficient showed that the traits being considered are mostly positive but with low correlation of egg number to egg weight for BRS and BLS. Phenotypic correlations of egg traits {{were found to be}} negative between egg number and egg weights in NB...|$|E
40|$|Commercial layers {{start laying}} at 18 - 20 weeks {{of age and}} {{continues}} until 72 weeks under cost-effective operation. Age of the hens, mortality rate, feed and environmental conditions determine the persistency of production {{as reflected in the}} laying curve. In this experiment <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> of 10000 hen-housed Babcock- 380 brown commercial layers housed in Kelantan, Malaysia was assessed in mathematical model using hen-house and hen-day measurements. It revealed that hens reached at peak lay at 21 weeks of age and maintained a stability until 44 weeks. Birds egg <b>laying</b> <b>performance</b> gradually declined with progress in age till 80 weeks. Y= 35176. 99 – 397. 374 A + 5. 065 F gave the best fitted regression line (adj R² = 0. 905) for hen-housed egg production per week (A=age of hens in week and F= Kg feed consumed/day). A 87. 5 % of the total variation in hen-housed egg production could be explained only by age of hens but when feed consumption was added in the model age and feed consumption together explained 90. 5 % variability. For every week advancement in hen’s age (week) a decrease of 0. 039 eggs/hen/day was predicted (adj R² = 83. 8 %). In this 10000 hen-housed flock mortality/culling averaged at 14. 82 /week...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} effects of various {{inclusion}} levels of full-fat soybeans (FFSB) on <b>laying</b> hen <b>performance</b> and eggshell quality during peak production, 288 Bovans White strain laying hens, 33 to 42 wk of age, were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatments. The diets were prepared with the inclusion of 0, 10, 16, and 22 % FFSB. Egg production was not significantly affected by any of the dietary treatments, whereas feed intake, egg weight, egg mass, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly affected. Overall, laying hens receiving the FFSB diets consumed significantly less feed than those on the control diet. Egg mass (gram per hen per day) tended to increase with increasing FFSB from 10 to 16 or 22 % relative to the control diet. The FCR was significantly improved by all diets containing FFSB (1. 79, 1. 80, and 1. 80 feed:egg ratio for the diets containing 10, 16, and 22 % FFSB, respectively) compared with the control diet (1. 87). However, none of the inclusion levels of FFSB in layer diets significantly affected shell weight, shell thickness, albumen height, or checked and cracked egg percentages. It was concluded that FFSB can be used in layer diets to an inclusion level of 22 %. Key words: full-fat soybean, <b>laying</b> hen <b>performance,</b> egg quality 2005 J. Appl. Poult.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of vitamin C on <b>laying</b> hen <b>performance,</b> egg quality and some blood parameters under thermal neutrality condition. A total of 192 laying hens (20 -week-old) were used by completely randomize design. The treatments, from 20 to 35 weeks of age, included four levels of vitamin C: 0 (control), 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg diet. Bird’s performance, egg characteristics, plasma glucose, calcium and uric acid were assayed at 28 and 35 weeks of age. <b>Laying</b> hen <b>performance</b> was similar among treatments (P> 0. 05). Greater albumen index and Haugh unit were obtained by fed 750 mg vitamin C/kg diet compared to other treatments at 28 weeks of age (P< 0. 05). Increased yolk height was attained by diet supplemented with 500 mg vitamin C/kg diet at this age (P< 0. 05). Shape index was improved (P< 0. 05) by 250 and 500 mg vitamin C/kg diet at 35 weeks of age. Higher yolk index was achieved by 500 mg vitamin C/kg diet at 28 and 35 weeks of age (P< 0. 05). Plasma uric acid was decreased by 250 mg vitamin C/kg diet compared with control diet (P< 0. 05). The results of the current study have shown that diets supplemented with vitamin C can improve some egg characteristics and decrease plasma uric acid, but have similar effects on performance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Conflicting reports {{exist in}} the {{literature}} about the effects of cage level (tier) on <b>laying</b> hen <b>performance.</b> Results clearly indicate, under conditions of this study, that performance as measured by egg production, egg weight, and mortality significantly deteriorated in a linear fashion progressing from the bottom to the top in three and four tier cages. Causes may be related to fear associated with differences in light intensity or differences in exposure to visual stimuli between the tiers.
