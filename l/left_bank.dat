50|$|At rest one of {{the escape}} wheel teeth will be locked against a pallet.

The impulse pin is located within the lever fork and the balance wheel is near its center position. To get started, the lever fork must receive a small impulse from the anti-clockwise rotation of the balance wheel via the impulse pin (say by being shaken) which rotates the lever slightly clockwise off the <b>left</b> <b>banking</b> pin. This unlocks the entrance pallet allowing the wheel to rotate clockwise.|$|R

The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the <b>left</b> <b>bank</b> of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|At {{first two}} groups {{established}} themselves on fertile grounds in Silesia: One on the <b>left</b> <b>bank</b> of the Oder River south of Wrocław, {{in the area}} that included Mount Ślęża, and one around the Głubczyce highlands; both stayed in their respective regions during the 400–120 BC period.
