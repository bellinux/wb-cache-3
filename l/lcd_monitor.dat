40|$|Leakage current (<b>LC)</b> <b>monitoring</b> is {{a widely}} {{employed}} tool for monitoring the performance of high voltage insulators. <b>LC</b> waveform <b>monitoring</b> is required to acquire {{a view of the}} phenomena experienced since the type of LC waveform’s shape is correlated with different types of electrical activity. In case of field monitoring, specially designed measuring systems, capable of operating under field conditions, have to be installed. The Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) has issued a large project for monitoring the performance of outdoor insulators. A commercially available LC measuring system, was purchased and installed by PPC. The system was able to monitor various outdoor insulators, record several statistical values and intermittently record a LC waveform. The provided software lacked some capabilities that were required for certain research areas and a custom made software had to be developed. In this paper, two stand-alone MATLAB based softwares, “Leakage Current Waveform File Converter” and “Leakage Current Waveform Viewer”, both equipped with a user friendly GUI, are presented. The first software was developed in order to automatically convert multiple files from the CSV format (as extracted from the measuring system) to the MAT format in order to allow data compactness and further processing. The latter software was developed in order to offer a tool for collective viewing, printing and extraction to JPEG format, of LC waveforms in groups of user-defined numbers. The latter function gives the opportunity for easy and fast creation of waveform archives...|$|R
40|$|Arterial {{blockages}} are {{the root}} cause of heart attack. These blockages cut the oxygen rich supply of the heart making a permanent damage to heart muscles. This paper presents a preliminary work for a novel helical capacitive stent model forming a telemetric material sensor. The sensor is basically a passive LC resonator tank which has a resonant frequency depending on the values of its inductance and capacitance. The capacitor layer was built over the inductor layer and both were isolated by an insulation coat between them. The theory was initially tested on substitute models preceded with the fabrication of actual stent base. This base was fabricated out of a planer sheet of 304 stainless-steel using electrical discharge machining (EDM) and was patterned to be a high inductance helical structure, upon expansion. The substitute stent models, when tested on a network analyzer, showed a resonance frequency dip at 242. 65 MHz for fully coated and at 227. 9 MHz for partially coated substitute stent model while measuring its S 11 parameter. These readings reflect the capabilities of helical capacitive stent structures to be used as <b>LC</b> <b>monitoring</b> platforms for arterial blockages...|$|R
40|$|Although {{autophagy}} maintains normal neural function by degrading misfolded proteins, {{little is}} known about how neurons activate this integral response. Furthermore, classical methods of autophagy induction used with nonneural cells, such as starvation, simply result in neuron death. To study neuronal autophagy, we cultured primary cortical neurons from transgenic mice that ubiquitously express green fluorescent protein-tagged <b>LC</b> 3 and <b>monitored</b> <b>LC</b> 3 -I to LC 3 -II conversion by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. Evaluation of different culture media led us to discover that culturing primary neurons in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without B 27 supplementation robustly activates autophagy. We validated this nutrient-limited media approach for inducing autophagy by showing that 3 -methyl-adenine treatment and Atg 5 RNA interference knockdown each inhibits LC 3 -I to LC 3 -II conversion. Evaluation of B 27 supplement components yielded insulin as the factor whose absence induced autophagy in primary neurons, and this activation was mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent. When we tested if nutrient-limited media could protect neurons expressing polyglutamine-expanded proteins against cell death, we observed a strong protective effect, probably due to autophagy activation. Our results indicate that nutrient deprivation can be used to understand the regulatory basis of neuronal autophagy and implicate diminished insulin signaling in the activation of neuronal autophagy...|$|R

The second major revision, iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an <b>LCD</b> <b>monitor</b> on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only {{up and down on}} a simple metal base. The fifth major revision (mid-2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup, and includes solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid state and hard disk drives. This version of iMac was announced in October 2012, with the [...] version released in November and the [...] version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards.|$|E

40|$|Electric {{field driven}} {{anchoring}} breakage in poly(triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) /nematic E 7 composites was studied using dielectric spectroscopy and transmittance measurements. The transmittance hysteresis observed on increasing and decreasing an applied electric field, associated with different alignment {{states of the}} liquid crystal (<b>LC),</b> was <b>monitored</b> through dielectric loss. Essential changes are felt mainly in the δ-peak, i. e. the dielectric response of the nematic when the director lies parallel to the applied electric field. An irreversible effect persists after the field had exceeded a critical value, which was manifest in a higher transmittance and a higher dielectric strength of the δ-peak in the OFF state. The initial scattering/opaque state of the sample can only be recovered by heating to the clearing temperature of the nematic LC. The effect referred, commonly called memory effect, is rationalized in terms of anchoring breakage of the LC at the polymer-LC interfaces.

They are generated either enzymatically or non-enzymatically and 100 s of structures exist of which {{only a small}} fraction have been analyzed to date. Pleiotropic activities, including regulation of adhesion molecule expression, pro-coagulant activity and inhibition of Toll-like receptor signaling have been observed and some are detected in models of human and animal disease, including atherosclerosis and infection. More recently, the acute generation of specific oxidized phospholipids by cellular enzymes in immune cells was reported. Assays for analysis and quantification of OxPLs were first developed approx 15 years ago, primarily for hydro(pero) xy-species. Many were based on monitoring a single precursor ion with/without LC separation, based on the PL headgroup. Others combined <b>LC</b> with <b>monitoring</b> precursor to product transitions, but were unable to provide information regarding position of oxidation on unsaturated sn- 2 fatty acid due to sensitivity issues. More recently, LC/MS/MS methods for specific OxPLs have been reported that enable high sensitivity quantitation in biological samples. In this review, widely used methods for detecting and quantifying various classes of OxPL will be summarized, along with practical advice for their use. In particular, the focus will be on LC/MS/MS, which today is almost universally the method of choice...|$|R

40|$|As a skin-resident {{member of}} the {{dendritic}} cell family, Langerhans cells (LCs) are generally regarded to function as professional antigen-presenting cells. Here we report a simple method to visualize the endocytotic activity of LCs in living animals. BALB/c mice received subcutaneous injection of FITC-conjugated dextran (DX) probes into the ear skin and were then examined under confocal microscopy. Large numbers of FITC+ epidermal cells became detectable 12 – 24 hours after injection as background fluorescence signals began to disappear. Most (> 90 %) of the FITC+ epidermal cells expressed Langerin, and > 95 % of Langerin+ epidermal cells exhibited significant FITC signals. To assess intracellular localization, Alexa Fluor 546 -conjugated DX probes were locally injected into IAβ-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) knock-in mice and Langerin-EGFP-diphtheria toxin receptor mice—three dimensional rotation images showed close association {{of most of the}} internalized DX probes with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, but not with Langerin molecules. These observations support the current view that LCs constantly sample surrounding materials, including harmful and innocuous antigens, at the environmental interface.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{critical}} to safety systems is usually approached through {{the observation of}} specific standards which are applicable {{in the field of}} interest of the considered application itself. Even if, most of time this kind of design orientation can be satisfactory to address the majority of problems, sometimes it may lead to tricky situations where some crucial aspects can be neglected.

Second, the ACP spherules were dispersed and aged in Milli-Qwater, where they crystallized into poorly crystalline apatite (PCA). The addition of heparin during aging was explored, which was shown to retard the ACP - PCA conversion. The particle formation within the <b>LC</b> phase was <b>monitored</b> using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering, and the formed materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, thermogravimetry with infrared-coupled analysis, and Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{landscape}} of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is undergoing rapid changes {{as a result of}} natural and anthropogenic activities. This necessitates the development of a rapid, cost effective and efficient land cover (LC) classification technique to monitor the biophysical dynamics in the region. Due to the intricate land cover patterns prominent in the study area and the irregularly indistinguishable relationship between land cover and spectral signals, this paper introduces a combined use of unsupervised and supervised image classification for detecting LC classes. The technique utilizes the spectral recognition of the unsupervised classification in the performance mode and the selection of sampling sites from a principal component analyzed image of the supervised classification in the training mode. The unsupervised and supervised classification algorithms used are the generalized form of Heckbert quantization and Maximum Likelihood (ML) respectively. With the continuous conflict over the impact of oil activities in the area, this work provides an initial basis of <b>monitoring</b> <b>LC</b> change, which is an important factor to consider in the design of an environmental decision-making framework.

40|$|Analysis of {{cellular}} 7, 8 -dihydro- 8 -oxo- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxo-dGuo) as a biomarker of oxidative DNA {{damage has been}} fraught with numerous methodological problems. This is primarily due to artifactual oxidation of dGuo that occurs during DNA isolation and hydrolysis. Therefore, it has become necessary to rely on using the comet assay, which is not necessarily specific for 8 -oxo-dGuo. A highly specific and sensitive method based on immunoaffinity purification and stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography (<b>LC)</b> -multiple reaction <b>monitoring</b> (MRM) /mass spectrometry (MS) that avoids artifact formation has now been developed. Cellular DNA was isolated using cold DNAzol (a proprietary product that contains guanidine thiocyanate) instead of chaotropic- or phenol-based methodology. Chelex-treated buffers were used to prevent Fenton chemistry-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and artifactual oxidation of DNA bases.

40|$|The {{activity}} of all major ascending neuromodulatory arousal systems is greatly reduced during the periods of cortical synchronization that {{are reflected in}} EEG as high-amplitude low-frequency waves. Despite the relative silence, neuromodulatory neurons typically switch their firing pattern from a tonic mode during the alert, desynchronized cortical state to a bursting mode during cortical synchronization that is characteristic for slow wave sleep (SWS) or anesthesia. The bursting activity is particularly efficient for a corresponding release of neuromodulators in the target regions. The {{activity of}} brainstem cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons correlates with cortical slow oscillations, while activity of the noradrenergic system in this context remains unexplored. We recorded unit activity of the noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (<b>LC)</b> with simultaneous <b>monitoring</b> of the cortical state by EEG in behaving rats. Here we report that the activity of LC neurons is phase-locked to cortical slow oscillations indicative of up-down states. In addition, we show that LC neurons lock best to slow oscillations advanced by approximately 100 ms, suggesting a possible noradrenergic contribution to generation of cortical up state. These results provide the first strong evidence for a cortico-coerulear interaction during SWS and challenge a conventional dogma about a quiescent state of the LC-noradrenergic system during sleep. The phase-locking of noradrenergic neurons to cortical slow oscillations may have a strong impact on the coordinated activity of neuronal assemblies during up states, which might be relevant for off-line information processing, synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation...|$|R
30|$|Autophagy is {{a dynamic}} process which {{includes}} initiation, nucleation, elongation and maturation. It is tightly regulated {{by a number of}} autophagy-related genes (ATG) and other multiple protein complexes (Kroemer and Levine, 2008). The ULK 1 -Atg 13 -FIP 2000 and class III PI 3 K complex, which contain Beclin 1 and vps 34, among other key components, regulate the initiation and nucleation of phagophore, the precursor of autophagic membranes. In the stage of elongation and complete closure of autophagosome membranes, two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems come into play. The first one is the Atg 12 -Atg 5 -Atg 16 L complex conjugation system and the second involves Atg 4 B, Atg 3 and Atg 7. The net outcome of the ubiquitin-like reactions catalyzed by these two systems is the conversion of microtubule associated protein 1 B light chain 3 (LC 3) from its cytosolic form (LC 3 -I) to the membrane bound, phosphatidylethanolamine conjugated form (LC 3 -II), a process known as LC 3 lipidation. The conversion of LC 3 -I to LC 3 -II is a hallmark of autophagy and is indicative of autophagic activity, which can be <b>monitored</b> by <b>LC</b> 3 immunoblotting or immunofluorescence (to <b>monitor</b> <b>LC</b> 3 puncta formation) (Barth et al., 2010; Choi et al., 2013; Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima et al., 2010).

Age-adjusted incidence trends of five major histological types by gender and race were evaluated using joinpoint regression.

Squamous, large and small cell carcinoma rates continue to decrease for all gender/race combinations, whereas adenocarcinoma rates remain relatively constant in males and increasing in females. An apparent recent increase in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma since 2005 can be explained by a concomitant {{decrease in the number of}} cases classified as other non-small cell carcinoma.
