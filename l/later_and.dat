5|$|Although IFA {{can be used}} {{to confirm}} {{infection}} in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used.

Mustafa died a short while <b>later</b> <b>and</b> his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha.
