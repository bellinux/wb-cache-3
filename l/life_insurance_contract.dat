40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine equity-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> in a {{stochastic}} interest rate economy via quantile hedging whose {{purpose is to}} look for the optimal probability of a successful hedge under initial budget constraint. Most of the existing studies have focused on valuing equity-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> by quantile hedging or in a framework of stochastic interest rates. However, a few have taken into account simultaneously the two techniques, which make valuing equity-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> more difficult. We model the term structure of interest rates by classical HJM model that imbeds stochastic interest rate economy into one containing an arbitrary number of additional risky assets. By means of the change of measure approach, we give explicit formulas for the fair values of the following four products: deterministic payoff contract, pure equity-linked life contract, equity-linked life contract with guarantee, equity-linked life contract with minimum guarantees and capped benefits. We find that the explicit formulas are mainly composed of normal distribution functions and two-dimensional normal distribution functions. We also investigate sensibility of the survival probability using data of interest rates, stock prices and life table from China.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{valuation}} and hedging of unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> {{in a setting}} where mortality intensity is governed by a stochastic process. We focus on model risk arising from different specifications for the mortality intensity. To do so {{we assume that the}} mortality intensity is almost surely bounded under the statistical measure. Further, we restrict the equivalent martingale measures and apply the same bounds to the mortality intensity under these measures. For this setting we derive upper and lower price bounds for unit-linked <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> using stochastic control techniques. We also show that the induced hedging strategies indeed produce a dynamic superhedge and subhedge under the statistical measure in the limit when the number of contracts increases. This justifies the bounds for the mortality intensity under the pricing measures. We provide numerical examples investigating fixed-term, endowment <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> and their combinations including various guarantee features. The pricing partial differential equation for the upper and lower price bounds is solved by finite difference methods. For our contracts and choice of parameters the pricing and hedging is fairly robust with respect to misspecification of the mortality intensity.

50|$|A {{modified}} endowment {{contract is}} a cash value <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> in the United States where the premiums paid have exceeded the amount {{allowed to keep}} the full tax treatment of a cash value life insurance policy. In a modified endowment contract, distributions of cash value are taken from taxable gains first as compared to distributions taken from non taxable contributions.

5000|$|Whole life {{insurance}} typically {{requires that the}} owner pay premiums {{for the life of}} the policy. There are some arrangements that let the policy be [...] "paid up", which means that no further payments are ever required, in as few as 5 years, or with even a single large premium. Typically if the payor doesn't make a large premium payment at the outset of the <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract,</b> then he is not allowed to begin making them later in the contract life. However, some whole life contracts offer a rider to the policy which allows for a one time, or occasional, large additional premium payment to be made as long as a minimal extra payment is made on a regular schedule.

50|$|The {{conflict}} {{within the}} case involved {{the payment of}} a life insurance claim made by Riggs for the estate of Eber B. Roloson against Northwestern National Life Insurance Company which Northwestern refused to pay saying that the deceased had made false statements concerning his medical history. The state of Missouri had in place a series of legislative acts {{in the period of}} 1874 and 1889 that basically created a condition on any <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> in which though medical history information may be inaccurate, if the inaccurate information had no bearing on the manner of the deceased's death then any claim must still be paid. If the inaccurate information did bear on the manner of the deceased's death or if there was a dispute concerning whether the information provided bore on the manner of the deceased's death then the matter was for a jury to decide whether the claim should be paid.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} set was twofold: {{to define}} a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and {{to define a}} maximum premium for a given death benefit. If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies {{for all of the}} benefits of a <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free death benefit, but withdrawals of cash value in a MEC are on a 'LIFO' basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit, the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.|$|E
5000|$|The Hillmon lawsuit {{concerned}} {{the enforcement of}} a <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> and {{the identity of a}} man who died of a gunshot wound near Medicine Lodge, Kansas. Sallie Hillmon - a young woman from Lawrence, Kansas - claimed that in late 1879, her husband John had been killed by a firearm accident at a desolate Kansas campsite called Crooked Creek. The three insurance companies issuing a $25,000 policy on John Hillmons life maintained that he was still alive. In support of their contention that Hillmon was still alive, the insurance companies offered a letter purportedly written on March 1, 1879 by Frederick Walters, a young cigarmaker. In his letter written to his sweetheart, Walters describes meeting [...] "a man named Hillmon" [...] who invited him to travel with him out west to start a sheep ranch. Upon the insurance companies refusal to issue the $25,000 policy to Ms. Hillmon, she sued the companies for the policy proceeds. The first two Hillmon trials, in 1882 and 1885, produced hung juries. However, the third resulted in a victory for Sallie Hillmon. It was this 1888 verdict that led to the famous Supreme Court decision of 1892 reversing the judgment in her favor. Nevertheless, three more trials ensued, two ending with hung juries and the last in another verdict for Sallie Hillmon, which was once again overturned by the Supreme Court. The ultimate contested factual issue in all of the trials was the identity of a man whose death far predated the availability of twentieth-century methods of identification. After repeated hung juries in the first two trials, the Supreme Court found that Walters letter should have been admitted into evidence. With this ruling, the Court created an entirely new exception to the hearsay rule for out-of-court statements describing the intentions of a declarant and remanded the decision to the trial court. More than a decade later, the trial court produced a verdict for Ms. Hillmon.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} years the {{valuation}} of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> using concepts from financial mathematics has become a popular research area for actuaries as well as financial economists. In particular, several methods have been proposed of how to model and price participating policies, which are characterized by an annual interest rate guarantee and some bonus distribution rules. However, despite the long terms of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products, most valuation models allowing for sophisticated bonus distribution rules and the inclusion of frequently offered options assume a simple Black-Scholes setup and, in particular, deterministic or even constant interest rates. We present a framework in which participating <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> including predominant kinds of guarantees and options can be valuated and analyzed in a stochastic interest rate environment. In particular, the different option elements can be priced and analyzed separately. We use Monte Carlo and discretization methods to derive the respective values. The sensitivity of the contract and guarantee values with respect to multiple parameters is studied using the bonus distribution schemes as introduced in Bauer et al. (2006). Surprisingly, even though {{the value of the}} contract as a whole is only moderately affected by the stochasticity of the short rate of interest, the value of the different embedded options is altered considerably in comparison to the value under constant interest rates. Furthermore, using a simplified asset portfolio and empirical parameter estimations, we show that the proportion of stock within the insurer’s asset portfolio substantially affects the value of the contract.
