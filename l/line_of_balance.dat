Activities can be presented as geometrical shapes showing the occupation of the work site over time such that conflicting access can be detected visually.

Therefore, at the conceptual stage, scheduling these operations can take a linear form, known as linear schedule or <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> (LOB). In such type of work, generating a preliminary <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> for variable sequencing of activities is crucial. In this paper, an integrated expert system for determining preliminary linear schedules for heavy earthmoving operations at the conceptual stage is presented. The proposed system incorporates numerous factors that influence the analysis of earthmoving operations, which include geological and topographical parameters used to determine productivity rates at the conceptual stage. Also, the proposed system is capable of automatically generating a <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> based on a stochastic scheduling technique via the metaheuristic simulated annealing intelligent approach to incorporate randomness and uncertainties in performing the associated activities.

50|$|Ongoing advancements in {{technology}} allowed OHAUS to introduce its first <b>line</b> <b>of</b> precision electronic <b>balances</b> in 1979, incorporating easily read digital displays and electronic weight measuring mechanisms for quicker results. In 1982, OHAUS introduced the Port-O-Gram balance, the first laboratory-quality portable balance with 1:20,000 resolution. The first electronic moisture determination balance soon followed in 1984.|$|R
25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> a <b>balanced</b> audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|R
