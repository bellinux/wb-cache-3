25|$|Dumbledore {{appears in}} {{an episode of}} Icons of Teen from the YouTube channel, Shut Up Cartoons voiced by Justin Roiland. As a teenager, Dumbledore <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> magic and make robotic copies of himself. One day, he went scuba diving to earn his scuba diving badge for scouts. Dumbledore gets scared and stays on the boat while his crush Charlene and the scoutmaster go diving. They run into a giant sea monster and Charlene {{closes her eyes and}} says Dumbledore, a trick he taught her. Dumbledore {{receives}} her distress signal and dives in after them. He meets a talking dolphin who agrees to help Dumbledore if he can eat him in the end. Dumbledore suggests he eat the scoutmaster and the dolphin takes him to his friends. Dumbledore makes a robotic copy and sends it into the creature's stomach, distracting the creature long enough for Dumbledore, Charlene and the scoutmaster to escape. Charlene thanks Dumbledore for saving them. Dumbledore makes a sexual comment but plays it off like she said it. Charlene asks where the scoutmaster is; Dumbledore says he's gone somewhere, when really the dolphin ate him. Dumbledore then decides to build a robot copy of the scoutmaster to prevent anyone from finding out what happened to him.|$|E

[...] In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, [...] "When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised."

Of his exit, Lapinskas said [...] "I'm having a fantastic time working on EastEnders and {{playing the role of}} Anthony Moon. Working with David Essex, Tony Discipline and the EastEnders cast has been an absolute pleasure.

[...] Lapinskas revealed that Anthony's exit plot sees him make a [...] "big mistake". Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively.

I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with. He also added [...] "I was quite disappointed when I found out Anthony {{would be leaving}}, I'd have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a lot more stuff with him.

[...] They had All-Americans at linebacker (Shane Conlan), defensive tackle (Tim Johnson), running back (D.J. Dozier) and offensive tackle (Chris Conlin). [...] "We were a team that couldn't be intimidated, and that's what Miami <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to other players," [...] linebacker Pete Giftopoulos later observed.

2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla. It has also been reported that Presley [...] "adored to fondle and suck women's toes, and those in his entourage who were given the job of choosing companions for him would often be asked to check the girls' feet." [...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended some of the young girls who used to cluster adoringly in his driveway, or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would all sit cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay." [...] Therefore, Guralnick writes that for [...] "the more experienced girls it wasn't like with other Hollywood stars or even with other more sophisticated boys they knew."
