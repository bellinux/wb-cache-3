500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological {{underwater}} work, preparations began for raising the ship. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge Tog Mor was then used to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of [...] 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the Mary Rose broke the surface {{in the presence of the}} team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with [...] "an unforgettable crunch", slipped more than a metre (3feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.|$|E
50|$|The Throttlebot toys {{had limited}} poseability and simple {{transform}}ations. Not even the arms move. To transform {{the car to}} a robot, {{what is needed is}} to <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of the car to an upright position, flip out the side panels to reveal the arms and hands, flip back the rear of the car body to reveal heads, and optionally push the chassis in.|$|E

50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or lowering <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> One hand tap selected direction to either raise or lower <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from its vertical position.|$|R
50|$|B-Stoff: Ethyl alcohol {{equipment}} {{consists of}} a pipe which runs along {{the full length of}} the starboard beam of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> pipe is slung from the underside on straps, and closed at each end by threaded seals.|$|R
50|$|A-Stoff: Liquid oxygen {{equipment}} {{consists of a}} pipe, which follows a circuitous route along the centreline of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame’s</b> lower half. <b>The</b> pipe is fixed on <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> by brackets, and closed at each end by cast ramp-and-claw seals.|$|R
50|$|Acting as gantry, <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} {{a number of}} work platforms from which crewmen serviced the rocket. Three (later two) platforms folded flat against <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and could be folded out from <b>the</b> elevated <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> use of a hand winch. Each folding platform {{included a}} safety rail of folding posts and chains.|$|R
50|$|A {{sliding door}} that is <b>lifted</b> from <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> during {{opening and closing}} is called a lift-and-slide door. This allows for a better seal, with less draught and better soundproving.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its launch table. The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts running up <b>the</b> port <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> beam. <b>The</b> drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were {{operated by a}} crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> one running half the length of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> while <b>the</b> other ran the full length.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with tubular and box transverse braces. <b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was fitted with plumbing for fuelling the rocket; wiring for powering and monitoring the rocket and for field telephones; accommodations for carrying and dismounting the rocket; and folding platforms {{to service the}} rocket with rungs to access them.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{was fitted}} with outlet sockets and wiring for field telephones. A main {{connection}} from the armoured launch vehicle switchboard to inlet sockets on <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> provided circuits for four field phone stations at the Meillerwagen - one each {{at the upper}} and lower folding work platforms and two at the launch table.|$|R
50|$|The rocket was {{provided}} with ejecting umbilical connectors, although their precise deployment evolved. Initially these 'Stotz plugs' travelled as Meillerwagen accessories, stowed on <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{along with their}} cables. Later, the Stotz plugs were stowed in the cable box, and a ten metre cable mast was stowed on <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> for ultimate erection on the launch table at the launch site.|$|R
5000|$|P-Stoff: Compressed {{nitrogen}} (or compressed air) {{equipment to}} service the rocket consists of several batteries of compressed air tanks carried on <b>the</b> chassis <b>frame,</b> and a pipe fixed to {{the full length of}} the starboard beam of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> P-stoff batteries consist of one bank of six fixed tanks, and two banks of two removable tanks. (compressed air for the Meillerwagen pneumatic brakes was sourced from a separate set of two tanks across the front of <b>the</b> chassis <b>frame)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{construction}} design of elevator for pallets with car seats weighing 200 kg. This device is proposed for vertical transport of the load between two working positions which are separated by 6 m. Part of the pallet hoist is a roller conveyor attached on a <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> roller conveyor allows loading and unloading pallets from the fixed roller conveyors in the lower and upper station. There are the functional calculations of important parts, strength control of traction belt and shaft of driving pulley drum. By FEM (Finite Element Method) is detected stress distribution of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> Parts of <b>the</b> annex are the manufacturing drawings of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> shaft of driving drum, the driving station and drawing of the whole assembly vertical conveyor.

50|$|An early {{configuration}} of the Meillerwagen included hard-wiring of two electrical power circuits and two FLAK-plug circuits for the power and control needs of the rocket. The system included four sockets at the upper and {{at the lower end}} of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> and <b>the</b> connective wiring fixed along the starboard beam. The four circuits were connected to two Stotz ejecting plugs, stowed with their cables along the side of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> All of this wiring had become redundant by the time the rocket attacks began, but was not removed from the Meillerwagen.|$|R
50|$|The port beam of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{was fitted}} with around 40 rungs along its full length, with which crewmen {{climbed to the}} working platforms.|$|R
50|$|If the derailed {{vehicle is}} {{further from the}} track, or its {{configuration}} (such as a high centre of gravity or a very short wheelbase) make the use of ramps impossible, jacks may be used. In its crudest form, <b>the</b> process involves <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> vehicle <b>frame</b> and then allowing it to fall off the jack towards the track. This {{may need to be}} repeated.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> erected <b>the</b> rocket from {{horizontal}} to vertical, using hydraulic power. <b>The</b> hydraulic <b>lifting</b> equipment {{consisted of}} a hydraulic pump and its drive motor, a hydraulic fluid tank, a control valve group with manometers, and <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> pistons themselves.|$|R
500|$|The gondola, {{constructed}} of nickel-steel tubing, was suspended some [...] below an elliptical steel frame (or keel) {{attached to the}} bottom of the gas-bag, under <b>the</b> centre of <b>lift.</b> Between <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> envelope and linking the two was a small hemp net. The net was attached by wooden toggles to a canvas band sewn directly onto the envelope, and <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> was attached to the net by further toggles. This permitted the easy removal of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> from <b>the</b> envelope. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> itself could also be dismantled for ease of transport.|$|R

50|$|Locomotives 22,24,25 and 30 {{have been}} at the Richmond Vale Railway Museum since the closure of the Richmond Vale railway line. Locomotives 24 and 25 were {{restored}} to steam at the RVRM where they worked until the late 1990s. No 24 and 25 were withdrawn because their boilers must be <b>lifted</b> from <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> and <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> inspected. Locomotive No. 30 was returned to steam in April 2000 and worked until 2009.No 30 was withdrawn because it is in bad mechanical condition. The RVRM's current plan is to put No. 30's boiler into No. 24's frame to accelerate its return it to steam.|$|R
50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one on each side of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R

40|$|We present <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> L(T) of <b>the</b> unit circle by {{generators}} and relations in two alternative ways. The {{first is the}} localic counterpart of the Alexandroff compactification of the real line while the other {{can be understood as}} a localic analogue of the quotient space R/Z. With an eye towards a prospective point-free description of Pontryagin duality, we then show how the usual group operations of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of reals can be <b>lifted</b> to <b>the</b> new <b>frame</b> L(T), endowing it with a canonical localic group structure...|$|R
50|$|Two side {{platforms}} or catwalks were {{inserted into}} holders for deployment {{on each side}} of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> otherwise stowed together on brackets near the turntable. A rotating platform could be suspended from the rocket nose, to provide access to the rocket control compartments {{on the far side of}} the rocket.|$|R
50|$|The bridge had a {{total length}} of 360 metres; the length of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> is 51.7 metres and its height 35 metres. The centre pier of the old swing bridge was left in place as an {{additional}} abutment for <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> section; that and a lightweight design of <b>the</b> actual <b>lifting</b> section resulted in considerable savings in {{the weight of the}} moving part of the bridge.|$|R

They gave him all the light the flickering candles afforded as he adjusted the machinery, and all were bending over the press when a low, distant growl was heard, rising slowly to a frenzied shout. A revolver popped--another--followed by wild cries from the street.|$|R
50|$|As a consequence, {{swap bodies}} {{do not have}} upper corner fittings, are not stackable, and must be <b>lifted</b> by <b>the</b> bottom <b>frame,</b> unlike <b>the</b> more {{widespread}} shipping containers (ISO containers). This makes them unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation. Because they are not stackable and are <b>lifted</b> by <b>the</b> bottom corners, they require special handling when transported by rail. Due to security concerns, {{an increasing number of}} swap bodies have a hard surface instead of curtains and tarpaulins.|$|R
5000|$|Perhan {{lives with}} his devoted {{grandmother}} Khaditza, his lame sister Danira and his dissolute uncle Merdzan. He wants to marry a girl named Azra, but her mother won't allow it, as Perhan is the illegitimate son of a Slovenian soldier who {{had an affair with}} Perhan's late mother. Ahmed, the [...] "Gypsy sheik," [...] comes to the village with his brothers. Merdzan loses his clothes playing cards with Ahmed's brothers, and comes home desperate for money so that he can repay. It is raining and not finding any money, he accuses the grandmother of hiding the money from him and <b>lifts</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of <b>the</b> house up (using a rope and a truck), so that it is suspended in mid-air as the rain comes down on Perhan, his grandmother and Danira. Very soon after, Khaditza is summoned to use her powers to save Ahmed's sick son, Roberto, which Khaditza does. For repayment, she proposes a deal with Ahmed - to pay for Danira's leg to be healed at a hospital in Ljubljana. Perhan goes with Danira, promising his grandmother not to leave her, but Ahmed asks where will he stay and convinces him to go to Milan. At first Perhan wants to make money honestly, but after being dragged through the mud, Perhan begins stealing and squirreling money away in a shack.|$|R
50|$|In the UK the {{specified}} maximum interval between full overhauls is ten years. To enable a full inspection <b>the</b> boiler is <b>lifted</b> from <b>the</b> locomotive <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> lagging removed. All firetubes are removed for checking or replacement. All fittings are removed for overhaul. Before returning {{to use a}} qualified examiner will check the boiler’s fitness for service and issue a safety certificate valid for ten years.|$|R
50|$|After the Meillerwagen {{was close}} to the launch point, the Firing Platoon Truck Section took charge and removed the rockets {{camouflage}} cover and rudder protection. The control compartment batteries, alcohol-filling connection, tools, and other equipment were loaded into a box on a strut at the top of <b>the</b> Meillerwagens <b>lift</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> Meillerwagen was moved via hand winches to the firing stand and then levelled via the two extendable outriggers with end-jacks.|$|R
50|$|Now rarely used, but {{for many}} years {{the only way to}} move a {{disabled}} vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> casualty. This <b>frame</b> was lifted by means of a pulley until the casualty’s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.|$|R
50|$|Each {{front corner}} of the chassis was fitted with a swing-out A-frame boom {{equipped}} with a screw jack and foot plate. The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it during erection of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> trunnion axis to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|R
