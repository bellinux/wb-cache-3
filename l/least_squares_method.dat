2500|$|Another {{drawback}} of {{the least}} squares estimator {{is the fact that}} the norm of the residuals, [...] is minimized, whereas in some cases one is truly interested in obtaining small error in the parameter , e.g., a small value of [...] However, since the true parameter [...] is necessarily unknown, this quantity cannot be directly minimized. If a prior probability on [...] is known, then a Bayes estimator can be used to minimize the mean squared error, [...] The <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> is often applied when no prior is known. Surprisingly, when several parameters are being estimated jointly, better estimators can be constructed, an effect known as Stein's phenomenon. For example, if the measurement error is Gaussian, several estimators are known which dominate, or outperform, the least squares technique; the best known of these is the James–Stein estimator. This is an example of more general shrinkage estimators that have been applied to regression problems.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{statistical}} methods seek {{to minimize the}} residual sum of squares, and these are called [...] "methods of least squares" [...] in contrast to Least absolute deviations. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also differentiable, which provides a handy property for doing regression. Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary <b>least</b> <b>squares</b> <b>method</b> and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non-linear least squares. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares, which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) {{as a function of}} the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.|$|E

40|$|Various phase unwrapping {{algorithms}} {{have been}} developed for extraction of topographic digital terrain model (DTM) and displacement detection in SAR Interferometry since 1988. However, problems such as accuracy and speed of phase unwrapping process still remain a challenge for SAR Interferometry applications. In this thesis, both path following and <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>methods</b> for phase unwrapping are analysed. Path following method includes branch-cut, guality-guided, mask-cut and minimum discontinuity <b>methods</b> while <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method</b> covers both weighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> and unweighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method.</b> Quality-guided and mask-cut methods need quality information, whereas minimum discontinuity and <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>methods</b> can be implemented either with or without quality information. Quality information applied in this project are correlation map, phase derivative variance map and maximum phase gradient map. The disadvantages associated with weighted minimum discontinuity <b>method</b> and weighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method</b> using quality maps are low accuracy and long execution time. Therefore in this project, the use of mask maps in weighted minimum discountinuity <b>method</b> and weighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method</b> is studied to subtitute quality maps. This will increase the accuracy of the unwrapped results and reduce the execution time. In addition, we study the possibilities of mask maps to replace quality maps in mask-cut method. We also introduce residue-based quality maps for quality-guided method and residue-based mask maps for mask-cut method, weighted minimum discontinuity <b>method</b> and weighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method.</b> The motivition of studying residue-based quality maps and residue-based mask maps {{is that most of the}} errors in the unwrapped results propagate from the residue pixels, i. e. phase inconsistencies. Residue-based quality maps and residue-based mask maps deal with the residues directly by masking out them in the maps and this will reduce error propagation. The implementations of residue-based quality maps in quality -guided method, residue-based mask maps and conventional mask maps in mask-cut method, weighted minimum discontinuity <b>method</b> and weighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method</b> are applied on two simulated SAR images, I. e. Long's Peak image and Isolation Peak image. The unwrapped solutions are analysed based on the their accuracy percentages, average execution time and memory requirements. The evaluations and comparisons between unwrapped solution of our proposed method and those of existing method are carried out in this project. The application of mask maps in weighted minimum discontinuity <b>method</b> and weighted <b>least</b> <b>square</b> <b>method</b> give satisfactory results with higher accuracy and shorter execution time as compared to those using quality maps. In general, residue-based quality maps and residue-based mask maps are found to be more suitable in phase unwrapping algorithms than quality maps and mask maps respectively, because they mask out all residue pixels and thus the possibilities of errors propagating from residue pixels to other pixels are reduced significantly...|$|R
