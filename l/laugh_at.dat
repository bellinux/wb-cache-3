5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E
5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York. As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which made him want to make people <b>laugh.</b> <b>At</b> age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings would put on plays.|$|E
5|$|While at {{the food}} court in the mall, Phineas accidentally drops his ice cream cone on bully Buford's pants, causing the whole food court to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> Buford. Enraged, he {{challenges}} Phineas to a fight right there, but boxing champion Evander Holyfield arrives and convinces them to instead fight in an organized thumb wrestling match later that day, which Buford accepts. Despite being cautioned by Phineas's friends Baljeet and Isabella, Holyfield trains Phineas through simple tasks, including punching a chain of sausages and playing Dance Dance Revolution.|$|E
40|$|The List of Derisible Situations (LDS; Proyer, Hempelmann and Ruch, List of Derisible Situations (LDS), University of Zurich, 2008) {{consists}} of 102 different occasions for being <b>laughed</b> <b>at.</b> They were retrieved in a corpus study and compiled into the LDS. Based on this list, {{information on the}} frequency and the intensity with which people recall being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> during a given time-span (12 months in this study) can be collected. An empirical study (N = 114) examined {{the relations between the}} LDS and the fear of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (gelotophobia), the joy of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (gelotophilia), and the joy of <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others (katagelasticism; Ruch and Proyer this issue). More than 92 % of the participants recalled having been <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> at least once over the past 12 months. Highest scores were found for experiencing an embarrassing situation, chauvinism of others or being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> for doing something awkward or clumsy. Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism were related about equally to the recalled frequency of events of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (with the lowest relation to katagelasticism). Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism yielded a distinct and plausible pattern of correlations to the frequency of events of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at.</b> Gelotophobes recalled the situations of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> with a higher intensity than others. Thus, the fear of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> exists to a large degree independently from actual experiences of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> but is related to a higher intensity with which these events are experience...|$|R
50|$|Gelotophobia, gelotophilia, and katagelasticism {{describe}} {{three different}} stances towards laughter and <b>laughing</b> <b>at.</b> Empirical studies with the PhoPhiKat-45 show that, of course, {{people can not}} {{at the same time}} fear and like being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (i.e., be gelotophobes and gelotophiles at the same time). However, there is at least a subgroup of gelotophobes that enjoys <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others, despite knowing how harmful this can be. Finally, gelotophilia and katagelasticism are positively related; i.e., those who enjoy being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> might also enjoy <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others.|$|R
50|$|If John is {{the only}} person <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> the comedian (low consensus), he <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> the comedian at other comedy clubs (high consistency), and he <b>laughs</b> <b>at</b> other comedians (low distinctiveness), then the effect is seen as caused by {{something}} in the person (John).|$|R
5|$|At school, Peter is {{attacked}} {{with water}} balloons by Flash Thompson and his sidekick Kenny Kong, which he dodges until he realizes it might reveal his secret identity as Spider-Man. Gwen steps in and gets everyone to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> Flash instead. Gwen and Peter {{go to the}} Connors lab and help Eddie clean up from a previous battle with Electro. Martha announces that Curt's arm had grown back and they celebrate until they realize scales are growing on his arm, determining that the reptilian half of his brain his taking over. Peter tries to comfort the Connors's son, Billy, but gets interrupted when Curt transforms into a hulking, humanoid lizard and runs off.|$|E
5|$|Medium Alison {{writes a}} letter to her parents but does not mention Joan or her recent {{realization}} she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison {{to put on a}} dress, but she would rather wear a jean jacket. Bruce tells her that she would be the only girl without a dress and that the other children would <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> her; she leaves on the dress ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning to wonder if she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to wear their respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve her now. Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E
5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> Hoax's expense while the two boys are punished.|$|E

5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend {{when she saw him}} browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except for a pair of boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of some 2000 examples, one {{commentator}} has argued that “Gray’s Elegy has probably inspired more adaptations than any other poem in the language”. It has also been suggested that parody acts {{as a kind of}} translation into the same tongue as the original, something that the printing history of some examples seems to confirm. One of the earliest, John Duncombe’s “An evening contemplation in a college” (1753), frequently reprinted {{to the end of the}} 18th century, was included alongside translations of the Elegy into Latin and Italian in the 1768 and 1775 Dublin editions and 1768 Cork edition of Gray’s works. In the case of the American The Political Passing Bell: An Elegy. Written in a Country Meeting House, April 1789; Parodized from Gray for the Entertainment of Those Who <b>Laugh</b> <b>at</b> All Parties by George Richards (d.1804) and published from Boston MA, the parody was printed opposite Gray's original page by page, making the translation to the political context more obvious.|$|E
5|$|Starting in November, {{the twins}} {{developed}} an on-screen relationship with The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), appearing in numerous backstage segments with them, and accompanying {{them to the}} ring. In February 2009, the storyline expanded to include John Morrison and The Miz, who flirted with the Bellas and took them on a date for Valentine's Day. The date provoked a rivalry between the teams of The Miz and Morrison and Primo and Carlito, with the four competing for the affection of the twins, who were seemingly unable to choose between them. On March 17 on ECW, Carlito and Primo, aiming for Morrison and The Miz, accidentally spat apples {{in the face of}} Brie. Nikki began to <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> Brie's misfortune, and a fight broke out between the two, which led to Nikki leaving with The Miz and Morrison, while Brie stayed with Primo and Carlito. Brie won her first match over Nikki in a six-person intergender tag team match on SmackDown the following week. On ECW on March 31, Nikki pinned Brie in their first singles match against each other, after a distraction from Morrison and The Miz.|$|E

50|$|Gelotophobia is a fear {{of being}} <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> a type of social phobia. While {{most people do not}} like being <b>laughed</b> <b>at,</b> there is a {{sub-group}} of people that exceedingly fear being <b>laughed</b> <b>at.</b> Without obvious reasons, they relate laughter they hear to be directed at themselves. Since 2008, this phenomenon has attracted attention from scholars in psychology, sociology, and psychiatry, and has been studied intensively.|$|R

5|$|Despite his {{tendency}} to kill subordinates on a whim, the Joker has no difficulty attracting henchmen with a seemingly infinite cash supply and intimidation: {{they are too}} afraid of their employer to refuse his demands that they wear red clown noses or <b>laugh</b> <b>at</b> macabre jokes. Even with his unpredictability and lack of superhuman powers, the 2007 limited series Salvation Run sees hundreds of villains fall under his spell {{because they are more}} afraid of him than the alternative: Luthor. Batman #186 (1966) introduced the Joker's first sidekick: the one-shot character, Gaggy Gagsworth, who is short, and dressed like a clown; the character was later resurrected as an enemy of his replacement, Harley Quinn. Introduced in the 1992 animated series, Quinn is the Joker's former Arkham psychiatrist who develops an obsessive infatuation with him and dons a red-and-black harlequin costume to join him in the 1999 graphic novel Batman: Harley Quinn. Although Quinn loves the Joker, he is obsessed with Batman and uses her to achieve his goals at her expense. Despite violent abuse, she returns to him. The Joker is sometimes shown to keep hyenas as pets; this trait was introduced in the 1977 animated series The New Adventures of Batman. A 1976 issue of Batman Family introduced Duela Dent as the Joker's daughter, though her parentage claim was later proven to be false.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The study {{describes}} {{the development and}} initial assessment of a questionnaire {{for the assessment of}} the fear of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (gelotophobia), the joy in being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> (gelotophilia), and the joy in <b>laughing</b> <b>at</b> others (katagelasticism) in a sample of 386 six to 9 year olds. The 30 -item measure (PhoPhiKat- 30 c) demonstrated a robust three-factor structure and satisfactory internal consistency (all ≥. 68). An evaluation of the answering pattern of the children revealed that for between one third and half of the children fear of being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> seemed to be a concern for them. In self and teacher-reports, gelotophobia was related to victim-status and katagelasticism to bully-status. This initial study enables research in three dispositions towards ridicule and being <b>laughed</b> <b>at</b> in younger children. This closes a gap in the literature and should provide a better understanding on the role of laughter and ridicule in children...|$|R
