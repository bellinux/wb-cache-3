5|$|While Hamilton was in Congress, discontented {{soldiers}} {{began to}} pose {{a danger to the}} young United States. Most of the army was then posted at Newburgh, New York. Those in the army were paying for much of their own supplies, and they had not been paid in eight months. Furthermore, the Continental officers had been promised, in May 1778, after Valley Forge, a pension of half their pay when they were discharged. By the early 1780s, due to the structure of the government under the Articles of Confederation, it had no power to tax to either raise revenue or pay its soldiers. In 1782 after several months without pay, a group of officers organized to send a delegation to lobby Congress, led by Capt. Alexander McDougall. The officers had three demands: the Army's pay, their own pensions, and commutation of those pensions into a <b>lump-sum</b> payment if Congress were unable to afford the half-salary pensions for life. Congress rejected the proposal.|$|E

25|$|A <b>lump-sum</b> tax is a {{tax that}} is a fixed amount, no matter the change in {{circumstance}} of the taxed entity.

25|$|These {{equations}} {{are frequently}} combined for particular uses. For example, bonds {{can be readily}} priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a <b>lump-sum</b> return of capital {{at the end of}} the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine the present value of the bond.|$|E
25|$|Bieber oversaw {{a fourth}} round of {{collective}} bargaining talks in 1987. Ford {{was chosen as}} the strike target this time, and after a slight contract extension the union reached a tentative contract with the company on September 17. Bieber agreed to establish joint committees at the national and local levels to explore the use of work teams, changing inefficient work rules, and reducing the number of job classifications. In exchange, the company agreed to a 3 percent annual wage increase in the first year with <b>lump-sum</b> payments equal to 3 percent of wages {{in the second and third}} years, no layoffs (except through attrition), an increase in the layoff income security fund to $500 (although it was capped at that amount), pension contribution increases, improvements in health benefits, and increased profit sharing. Twenty-one days later, GM agreed to a very similar contract. GM agreed to close no more plants, institute no more layoffs (so long as sales volumes did not decrease), the same wage and <b>lump-sum</b> package, the same profit sharing arrangement, similar work team and job classification study committees, and establish quality improvement committees in all plants. Both contracts were easily approved by the membership.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{after the}} first Muslim conquests in the 7th century, kharaj usually denoted a <b>lump-sum</b> duty levied upon the conquered provinces and {{collected}} by the officials of the former Byzantine and Sasanian empires, or, more broadly, any kind of tax levied by Muslim conquerors on their non-Muslim subjects, dhimmis. At that time, kharaj was synonymous with jizyah, which later emerged as a poll tax paid by dhimmis. Muslim landowners, on the other hand, paid only ushr, a religious tithe, which carried a much lower rate of taxation.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{responded to}} the early signs of {{economic}} problems with <b>lump-sum</b> tax rebates and other stimulative measures in the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. In March 2008, Bear Stearns, a major US investment bank heavily invested in subprime mortgage derivatives, began to go under. Rumors of low cash reserves dragged Bear's stock price down while lenders to Bear began to withdraw their cash. The Federal Reserve funneled an emergency loan to Bear through JP Morgan Chase.

25|$|From 1982 onwards, all {{self-employed}} {{women in}} France {{were provided with}} a <b>lump-sum</b> maternity grant which may be supplemented by an income-replacement allowance. In 1983, the unemployment compensation programme was expanded to include workers who had resigned from their jobs. A law of July 1984 introduced a new benefit called the Insertion Allowance, providing short-term support for those in periods of transition into the labour market. Another law passed that same month introduced a Special Solidarity Allowance for long-term unemployed persons with no insurance entitlements remaining. In addition, an Act of October 1982 fully extended the right to join a union {{to people who were}} retired, and a law of February 1984 increased state support for the development and training activities of companies.|$|E
25|$|The United States and Germany {{signed an}} {{agreement}} on September 19, 1995, providing for reparations for certain U.S.-citizen survivors of the Holocaust, with compensation to be paid in two stages. The first stage provided for compensation for Hugo Princz and {{a small group of}} other known concentration camp survivors, through a <b>lump-sum</b> payment to the United States of 3 million Deutsche Mark (about $2.1 million). The second stage was to provide for compensation for additional, similarly-situated claimants. Legislation passed in early 1996 authorized the Commission to receive and adjudicate cases of additional claimants, a process which it completed in March 1998. Following further negotiations, the German Government paid to the United States in June 1999 an additional lump sum of 34.5 million Deutsche Mark (about $18 million) in final settlement of any and all claims of United States citizens against Germany for Nazi persecution in concentration camps, {{whether or not they were}} adjudicated by the Commission. In the ensuing months, the Department of the Treasury completed the process of distributing the settlement fund to the claimants previously found eligible for awards.|$|E

Furthermore, Baird had not paid Social Security taxes for the couple, until making a <b>lump-sum</b> payment earlier in January 1993.

500|$|The queen was deposed on January 17, and the {{provisional}} government established under pro-annexation leader Sanford B. Dole was officially recognized by Stevens as {{the de facto}} government. She temporarily relinquished her throne to the United States, rather than the Dole-led government, in hopes that the United States would restore Hawaii's sovereignty to the rightful holder. The government under Dole began using ʻIolani Palace as its executive building. A delegation departed for Washington D.C. on January 19, to ask for immediate annexation by the United States. At the request of {{the provisional}} government, Stevens proclaimed Hawaii a protectorate of the United States on February 1, to temporarily provide a buffer against domestic upheaval and interference by foreign governments. The US flag was raised over the palace, and martial law was enforced. The annexation treaty presented to the US Senate contained a provision to grant Liliʻuokalani a $20,000 per annum lifetime pension, and Kaʻiulani a <b>lump-sum</b> payment of $150,000. The queen protested the proposed annexation in a January 19 letter to President Benjamin Harrison. She sent Prince David Kawānanakoa and Paul Neumann to represent her.|$|E

2500|$|Non-working foreigners {{resident}} in Switzerland {{may choose to}} pay a [...] "lump-sum tax" [...] instead of the normal income tax. The tax, which is generally {{much lower than the}} normal income tax, is nominally levied on the taxpayer's living expenses, but in practice (which varies from canton to canton), it is common to use the quintuple of the rent paid by the taxpayer as a basis for the <b>lump-sum</b> taxation.

2500|$|After the event, the Israeli Defense Ministry {{ruled that}} the four Arab {{citizens}} shot dead were not victims of terror because their killer {{was not part of}} a terrorist organization, and are thus not entitled to the usual compensation for life lost due to terror attacks.

Instead, they received payment [...] "beyond the letter of the law," [...] as a <b>lump-sum</b> payment, as opposed to the lifelong monthly annuity given to the families of terror victims. Representatives of the Arab community in Israel condemned the decision, with Mohammed Barakeh, an Arab member of the Israeli parliament, saying that the [...] "…decision raises a strong scent of racism, which distinguishes between a Jewish terrorist and an Arab terrorist." [...] On 19 July 2006, the Israeli government changed the [...] "Compensation Law for Victims of Hostile Acts" [...] to include anyone victimized by violence stemming from the Israeli-Arab conflict.

2500|$|New Keynesian Macreconomics. Dixon {{was one of}} {{the first}} economists to examine the effect of {{imperfect}} competition on the effectiveness of fiscal policy in his paper A simple model of imperfect competition with Walrasian features. This is an idea that was much explored in many other papers by him [...] and more recently. This paper was the first to demonstrate in a simple general equilibrium model that the fiscal multiplier could be increasing with the degree of imperfect competition in the output market. The reason for this is that imperfect competition in the output market tends to reduce the real wage, leading to the household substituting away from consumption towards leisure. When government spending is increased, the corresponding increase in <b>lump-sum</b> taxation causes both leisure and consumption decrease (assuming that they are both a normal good). The greater the degree of imperfect competition in the output market, the lower the real wage and hence the more the reduction falls on leisure (i.e. households work more) and less on consumption. Hence the fiscal multiplier is less than one, but increasing in the degree of imperfect competition in the output market.|$|E
