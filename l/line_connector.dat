The Connecticut Walk Book West (2006, 19th ed.) includes a Connecticut 400 Club hiking log and instructions on submitting the log for the award.|$|E
25|$|The Florida Department of Transportation {{was created}} in July 1969, with the Florida State Turnpike Authority {{becoming}} {{a part of the}} new FDOT. Soon after, FDOT and Orange and Dade County officials agreed the Bee <b>Line</b> <b>Connector</b> and Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike would be financed by revenue bond issues as extensions of Florida's Turnpike. The Beeline Expressway opened in 1973 and the Homestead Extension opened in 1974 {{as a part of the}} Turnpike mainline.|$|E
25|$|With Florida {{still growing}} in {{population}} in the 1960s, preliminary studies began for expanding portions of the Turnpike to six lanes in South Florida and additional north–south highways in that area. Dade County and the State Road Department developed {{a plan for the}} West Dade Expressway (now known as the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike), beginning at the Turnpike near the Dade County/Broward County line, turning westward and southward, terminating at Florida City in southern Dade County. In 1967, the Florida State Turnpike Authority was authorized to perform engineering and feasibility studies on the West Dade Expressway, and the Bee <b>Line</b> <b>Connector</b> extension, now known as the Martin Andersen Beachline Expressway. The results of the studies came in December 1968, but due to an uncertain bond market and an unknown future for the toll authority, decisions on the roads were delayed.|$|E

5000|$|A Speakon {{connector}} {{is designed}} with a locking system {{that may be}} designed for soldered or screw-type connections. <b>Line</b> <b>connectors</b> (female) mate with (male) panel connectors and typically a cable will have identical connectors at both ends. If it is needed to join cables, a coupler can be used (which essentially consists of two panel connectors mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube). Recently the manufacturer has introduced a new series called STX which includes also male <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> and female panel Speakon connectors are designed to be unambiguous in their use in speaker cables. With 1/4" [...] speaker jacks and XLR connections, it is possible for users to erroneously use low-current shielded microphone or instrument cables in a high-current speaker application. Speakon cables are intended solely for use in high current audio applications.|$|R
50|$|Modules {{designed}} {{according to}} the ETX 3.0 specification integrate two SATA ports via two slim <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> designed onto the top side of the CPU Module {{in the vicinity of}} X4. The module or carrier board ETX connectors do not require any changes to use the faster SATA hard drives.|$|R
25|$|In 1984, the MTA {{planned to}} {{construct}} a transfer passageway between the Queens Boulevard and Crosstown Line stations {{as part of a}} planned connector between the Queens Boulevard Line and the IND 63rd Street Line. Around 1986, Citigroup (then Citicorp) agreed to fund the passageway, at the cost of $8.5 million, as part of a zoning requirement for the construction of the adjacent One Court Square tower; the tower was built as {{part of the process of}} Citicorp splitting up its operations between its different buildings. The company selected the site due to the proximity to the stations. The building opened in 1989, with the passageway completed later on. In 2000, the MTA began designing a second in-system passageway between the Flushing and Crosstown line stations. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street <b>Line</b> <b>connector</b> was opened and service on the Queens Boulevard Line was increased, requiring G trains to terminate at Court Square on weekdays. To compensate Crosstown riders going into Queens, a free out-of-system transfer to the Flushing Line station was created.|$|E
2500|$|The first Blue Line six-car trains began {{service on}} September 15, 2008. Passengers can {{disembark}} from all six cars at the outbound platform of Bowdoin Station, {{but due to}} the shape of the platform (which is inside a balloon loop), passengers can only board four cars at the inbound side. The MBTA uses [...] "POP buttons" [...] on the outside of six-car trains to allow passengers to open only the doors they need to board. The station may eventually be closed or reconfigured as part of the Red Line Blue <b>Line</b> <b>Connector</b> project, as discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|This was a PCC {{trolley line}} that led commuters either {{northbound}} (via Overbrook line) or southbound (via South Hills Junction, Drake or Library lines) to Castle Shannon station. [...] The line's turnaround point, the Shannon Loop, was located {{just past the}} station at Mt. Lebanon Blvd. [...] This loop no longer exists. [...] Also removed from the Shannon route were the tracks surrounding the old Castle Shannon Municipal Building (which is also gone) {{at the intersection of}} Castle Shannon Blvd. and Willow Ave. [...] At this Overbrook <b>line</b> <b>connector,</b> incoming trolleys ran {{in front of the building}} and outgoing trolleys ran behind the building and through the narrow passage between the building and Castle Shannon Blvd.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of professional audio equipment uses TS jacks {{as the standard}} unbalanced input or output line-level connector. TRS jacks are sometimes used for balanced connections, the latter often alongside (or sometimes in the middle of) and {{as an alternative to}} an XLR balanced <b>line</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
50|$|The powerCON is an {{electrical}} connector manufactured by Neutrik for connecting mains power to equipment {{in a small}} space. It looks and works similarly to the Speakon with the <b>line</b> <b>connector</b> inserted in the chassis connector and twisted to make contact and lock. Both line and chassis connectors are fully insulated even when disconnected.|$|E

50|$|Hybrid {{connectors}} have housings with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being pneumatic <b>line</b> <b>connectors,</b> and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual cable and connector assemblies.|$|R

50|$|On the 1988 and 1989 {{model year}} Buick Reatta and 1986-1989 model year Buick Riviera {{touchscreen}} CRT equipped vehicles, an 8,192 bit/s data bus was implemented between the body computer module and the assembly <b>line</b> <b>connector,</b> climate control module, and CRT controller. This was GM's first multi-drop data bus. All GM vehicles adopted this bus as new engine control modules were developed. This bus remained the standard GM vehicle bus until 1996 when the J1850 VPW bus replaced it.|$|E
50|$|Alton station {{serves the}} town of Alton, a {{terminus}} of the regular timetabled network and the railhead of the heritage Watercress line. From 1901 until 1933 the terminus was the railhead or junction of three (inter-main <b>line)</b> <b>connector</b> lines. The branch leaves the main line at Pirbright Junction near Brookwood, Surrey and was electrified (750 V DC third rail) during the late interwar years by Southern Railway. The line alternates between Surrey and Hampshire, terminating toward the centre of north-east Hampshire.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1985 model year, Cadillac FWD [...] "C" [...] vehicle had an {{electronic}} system that had {{point to point}} data links between 5 electronic modules and a dedicated assembly <b>line</b> diagnostic <b>connector.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} in the ATX power supply standard, which {{includes}} a remote sense wire connected to the 3.3 V supply <b>line</b> at <b>connector</b> pin 13, but no sense connection for the ground wires.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{widely known}} device {{to make use}} of the GeoPort was Apple's own [...] "GeoPort Telecom Adapter". Initially {{released}} as the [...] "pod" [...] with the AV Macs in 1993, it later became its own separate product in early 1995 when it was released for PowerPC-based Macintosh machines that did not include AV-related hardware out of the box. Apple later incorporated GeoPort lines into an edge connector on the motherboard of certain Mac models known as the Communication Slot, preserving them on the later Communication Slot II. Three adaptors would eventually be sold: the original pod, the internal version, and an updated pod known as the GeoPort Telecom Adapter II. All used standard RJ-11 phone <b>line</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{use for the}} four-pole {{cable is}} to carry two {{channels}} of amplified signal from an amplifier {{to a pair of}} loudspeakers using a 'combiner' Y-lead connected to the two output channels, and a 'splitter' Y-lead to feed the loudspeakers. The 'combiner' and 'splitter' Y-leads are the same: two two-pole connectors on one end, connected to the ±1 and ±2 pins, respectively, of a four-pole <b>line</b> <b>connector</b> at the other end. [...] Some amplifiers and mixer-amplifiers are configured to do this without the need for a 'combiner'.|$|E
50|$|For example, a dial-up {{computer}} modem {{is generally}} provided with two line connectors, often labelled line and phone. The outside line {{is connected to}} the <b>line</b> <b>connector,</b> and handsets may be connected to the phone connector. When the modem is not in use, the line {{is connected to the}} handsets, but when the modem is in use, the phone connector is disconnected from the outside line. This prevents accidental interruption of the data service by raising the handset, which could occur if the two devices were simply connected in parallel.|$|E

5000|$|Early 1000s and 1000Ds were battery-only with no {{provision}} for external power. This was considered acceptable because the battery life was {{much better than the}} tube-type models. 8 ordinary D cells would operate the radio for >500 hours, as opposed to ~150 hours for the tube models and their massive A/B battery. The 3000 was also introduced as battery-only. Later the 1000-1 and 3000-1 models were introduced with provision for an external power using what {{was one of the first}} [...] "wall wart" [...] type power supplies - a transformer, rectifier, and filter capacitor in a box with AC <b>line</b> <b>connector</b> that plugged into and hung from the wall socket.|$|E

50|$|Speakon {{connectors}} {{are made}} in two, four and eight-pole configurations. The two-pole <b>line</b> <b>connector</b> will mate with the four-pole panel connector, connecting to +1 and −1; but the reverse combination will not work. The eight-pole connector is physically larger to accommodate the extra poles. The four-pole connector {{is the most common}} at least from the availability of ready-made leads, as it allows for things like bi-amping (two of the four connections for the higher-frequency signal, with the other two for the lower-frequency signal) without two separate cables. Similarly, the eight-pole connector could be used for tri-amping (two poles each for low, mid and high frequencies with two unused), or quad-amping (two poles each for high, mid, low and sub).|$|E
50|$|Electrical Vehicle (EV) {{high voltage}} Battery is {{constructed}} from serially connected battery power-packs consisting of rechargeable battery cells such as Lithium-Ion. Each cell {{has to be}} monitored for proper operation within specified temperature and voltage range. Each power-pack gathers its cell's status and transfers it to the vehicle’s battery management system (BMS). Each power-pack is connected at a different voltage reference level. In traditional solution, in order to transfer data, the EV power-packs {{are connected to the}} BMS via high voltage data <b>lines,</b> <b>connectors</b> and voltage level shifters. The use of DC-BUS eliminates the need for extra wires, using the powerline as a micro-grid between the power-packs and the BMS. The Powerline communication is coupled to the BMS via capacitors that provide galvanic separation between the high voltage Powerline and the vehicle's 12/24 V Powerline.|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms for {{engaging}} and disengaging electrical and fluid <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> are required to be operated repeatedly in hazardous or remote locations on space station, nuclear reactors, toxic chemical and undersea environments. Such mechanisms may require shields to protect the mating faces of the connectors when connectors are not engaged and move these shields {{out of the way}} during connector engagement. It is desirable to provide a force-transmitting structure to react the force required to engage or disengage the connectors. It is also desirable that the mechanism for moving the connectors and shields is reliable, simple, and the structure as lightweight as possible. With these basic requirements, an Umbilical Mechanism Assembly (UMA) was originally designed for the Space Station Freedom and now being utilized for the International Space Station...|$|R
5000|$|PowerPoint {{can also}} {{function}} as a movie maker program. The animator using PowerPoint works similarly to an animator using cels, using a succession of slides {{to create the illusion}} of movement. Many tools within the PowerPoint program can be easily used for maximum effect. Drawing tools such as AutoShapes, contains <b>lines,</b> <b>connectors,</b> basic shapes, block arrows, flowchart components, 'freeforms' (AutoShapes drawn by the mouse on pen tool) and banners, callouts and action buttons, help draw out a slide. Custom Animations and sound tools {{can also be used to}} help add excitement to the project and create interest in what might have been an otherwise dull presentation. The process of drawing out multiple slides takes time, but, again, it is considered to be less expensive and easier to use than buying and using professional graphics animation software.|$|R
