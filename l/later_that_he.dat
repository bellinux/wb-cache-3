5|$|He was {{selected}} for the North-Eastern League eleven to face the Central League in February 1914. In March, Scottish club St Mirren were without the services of the injured George Elmore for their Scottish Cup quarter-final, and had hoped to use Healey in his place; he had previously played in the area with the Northern Nomads travelling team. Sunderland made no objection, but it was reported first that business prevented Healey obliging, and <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had an injured knee.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Duke, Nixon {{initially}} hoped {{to join the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled {{at the last minute}} due to budget cuts. Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937. He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier, working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills. In later years, Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women. In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California, and became a full partner in the firm the following year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October {{the army}} stopped at Curuzú Cuatiá, where Belgrano solved an old border {{conflict}} between Corrientes and Yapeyu. He set which territories would belong to Curuzu Cuatiá and Mandisoví, and organised their urban layout around the chapel and school. By November the army arrived at the coast of Paraná near Apipé island, and there Belgrano took measures to benefit the natives that were living in missions. With his authority as speaker of the Junta he gave them full civil and political rights, granted lands, authorised commerce with the United Provinces, and lifted their restriction on taking public or religious office. However, the Junta requested <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should seek authorization for such changes in the future.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1942 Cardus {{rented a}} small flat in the Kings Cross {{district}} of Sydney, where {{he wrote his}} Ten Composers (1945) and Autobiography (1947). He said <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. When later in 1942 his wife announced her intention of sailing from England to join him, Cardus declined {{to move to a}} larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.|$|E
5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. Iginla {{struggled}} offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling {{to the bottom of}} the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{when another}} fan tried {{to climb the}} stage, Blythe {{thought that it was}} Pořádek again. Blythe testified that he {{approached}} the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him, which it did not. Jiří Choroš, author of video which caught the previous incidents with Pořádek, testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him. Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him. It was not until the arrest two years <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> found out about Nosek's death.|$|E

He traveled to Europe before officially assuming his teaching duties in 1856, and married Frances Dunlap shortly thereafter in 1857. That year, Lowell also became editor of The Atlantic Monthly. It was not until 20 years <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received his first political appointment, the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain.

5|$|Mimi and Smith {{were finally}} married on 15 September 1939. They bought a semi-detached house called Mendips—named after {{the range of}} hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} extensive damage during World War II, {{and she said that}} she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, working in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of the}} war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money.|$|E

5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the hope of finding out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E
5|$|Vrba's {{marriage}} ended {{around this}} time. In 1958 {{he received an}} invitation to an international conference in Israel, and while there he defected. He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He said <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a British subject by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|A {{surge in}} {{offensive}} production from Giordano and fellow defencemen T. J. Brodie and Dennis Wideman {{resulted in the}} Flames {{being one of the}} NHL's biggest surprises early in the 2014–15 season. Predicted to finish {{near the bottom of the}} standings before the season, the Flames instead began December with one of the best records in the league, in large part due to the play of Giordano, who led all NHL defencemen with 25 points, four better than Brodie. His plus-minus of +14 ranked him second in the league. The NHL recognized Giordano's early season play by naming him its First Star of the month of November. He was subsequently named as the Flames' representative at the 60th National Hockey League All-Star Game. Giordano played his 500th career game on February 2, 2015, in a victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He set a personal best by scoring his 48th point of the season in a 3–1 win over the New Jersey Devils on February 25, but also suffered an injury in the game. The Flames announced one week <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> required surgery for a completely torn biceps tendon; the estimated recovery time of four to five months meant that his season was over.|$|E

5|$|Following {{news of his}} father's {{premature}} death in 1864, Riel lost interest in the priesthood and he withdrew from the college in March 1865. For a time he continued his studies as a day student in the convent of the Grey Nuns, but was soon asked to leave following breaches of discipline. He remained in Montreal over a year, living {{at the home of}} his aunt, Lucie Riel. Impoverished by the death of his father, Riel took employment as a law clerk in the Montreal office of Rodolphe Laflamme. During this time he was involved in a failed romance with a young woman named Marie–Julie Guernon. This progressed to the point of Riel having signed a contract of marriage, but his fiancée's family opposed her involvement with a Métis, and the engagement was soon broken. Compounding this disappointment, Riel found legal work unpleasant, and by early 1866 he had resolved to leave Canada East. Some of his friends said <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> worked odd jobs in Chicago, Illinois, while staying with poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette, and wrote poems himself in the manner of Lamartine; also that he was then for a time employed as a clerk in Saint Paul, Minnesota, before returning to the Red River Settlement on 26 July 1868.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Moreno speculated <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{poisoned}} by the captain. Manuel Moreno was unsure {{of whether the}} captain really given him that substance, or if he substituted something else, or gave an even higher dose. Circumstances did not allow an autopsy to be performed. Further points used to sustain {{the idea of a}} murder are the captain's refusal to land elsewhere, his slow sailing, his administration of the emetic in secrecy, and that he didn't return to Buenos Aires with the ship. Enrique de Gandía pointed to an irregular ruling of the Junta that appointed a British person named Curtis as Moreno's replacement for the diplomatic mission in the case of Moreno's death. The son of Mariano Moreno commented to the historian Adolfo Saldías that his mother, Guadalupe Cuenca, received an anonymous gift of a mourning hand fan and handkerchief, with instructions to use them soon. By that time, the murder of Moreno was a common assumption, and it was mentioned during the trial of residence {{of the members of the}} Junta. Juan Madera stated at the trial that Moreno may have requested to go to Britain because he was afraid of being murdered, and that he may have stated this during the meeting when the Junta discussed his resignation. Modern author Manuel Luis Martín studied the health of both Moreno and his family, and concluded that he died of natural causes.|$|E
5|$|Punk {{was traded}} {{back to the}} Raw brand on October 11, 2010, after being swapped with Edge. He {{took part in the}} interbrand tag team match at Bragging Rights after {{injuring}} Evan Bourne to win a place, but the team lost. It was reported <b>later</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suffering with a hip injury that would stop him from competing. To keep a presence on television, he began commentating on Raw from November 22, having already commentated one NXT. During his commentary, he criticized John Cena for his actions against The Nexus. Sometimes he favored heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. At the end of December, Punk left the commentary team after assaulting John Cena on Raw and SmackDown with a chair. Punk later revealed that his motives for the attacks were that he had joined and assumed control of The Nexus. Punk then made each member of the group prove themselves worthy of a spot, with some choosing to join The Corre, which had been started by former Nexus leader Wade Barrett on SmackDown, instead.|$|E
