The dialogue and the interpenetration of interior and exterior, walking {{in the park and}} inside the building, the play of light and vistas are the subject of this work, which produces organic architecture, not as a mere form, but {{as a result of a}} thorough analysis of the Site. Park becomes part of the building, creating green bays, thanks to which all the rooms gain the same qualities. Architecture defined by the flow of air and <b>light,</b> <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> spa water. Visitation of the spa as an irreducible complex of impressions that stimulate our senses...|$|E
60|$|A huge fire blazed in {{the opening}} of their rocky shelter that the prowling {{carnivora}} might be kept at bay; and always one man stood on guard, watchfully alert against a sudden rush by some maddened beast of the jungle. Beyond the fire, yellow-green spots of flame appeared, moved restlessly about, disappeared and reappeared, accompanied by a hideous chorus of screams and growls and roars as the hungry meat-eaters hunting through the night were attracted by the <b>light</b> or the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> possible prey.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{fall into}} {{pollination}} syndromes {{that reflect the}} type of pollinator being attracted. These are characteristics such as: overall flower size, the depth and width of the corolla, the color (including patterns called nectar guides that are visible only in ultraviolet <b>light),</b> the <b>scent,</b> amount <b>of</b> nectar, composition of nectar, etc. For example, birds visit red flowers with long, narrow tubes and lots of nectar, but are not as strongly attracted to wide flowers with little nectar and copious pollen, which are more attractive to beetles. When these characteristics are experimentally modified (altering colour, size, orientation), pollinator visitation may decline.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examined}} customers’ perceived {{importance and}} performance of shopping center ambience on the examples of the Mercator shopping center and Sad Novi Bazaar shopping center in Novi Sad, Serbia. The shopping center ambience was examined through exterior and interior attributes. It was found {{that a number of}} them are very important to customers and their shopping behavior. According to the present research, the most important exterior attributes are: address and location, parking availability, congestion and traffic, exterior display windows and entrances. The most important interior attributes are: cleanliness, temperature, merchandise, <b>lighting,</b> music, <b>scents,</b> absence <b>of</b> tobacco smoke, width of aisles and P. A. usage. The paper also provided information for two studied shopping centers with ambience attributes that performed well or not and everything was presented on the importance-performance grids, which can serve managers as guidelines for further development...|$|R

50|$|Double-blind {{studies found}} that women prefer the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men who are rated as {{facially}} attractive. For example, {{both males and females}} were more attracted to the natural <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> individuals who had been rated by consensus as facially attractive. Additionally, it has also been shown that women have a preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men with more symmetrical faces, and that women's preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> more symmetrical men is strongest during the most fertile period of their menstrual cycle. Within the set of normally cycling women, individual women's preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men with high facial symmetry correlated with their probability of conception.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> developmental stability (low fluctuating asymmetry, FA) is attractive to women who are fertile (at high-conception risk points in their menstrual cycles), but not to other women or men. Prior research also indicates that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> dissimilarity in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes {{may play a role}} in human mate choice. We studied the scent attractiveness to the opposite sex of t-shirts worn for 2 nights 2 ̆ 7 sleep. Our results indicate that the two olfactory systems are independent. We repeated previous results from studies <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry. We repeated previous results from MHC research in part; men, but not women, showed a preference for t-shirts with the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> MHC dissimilarity. Women 2 ̆ 7 s <b>scent</b> ratings <b>of</b> t-shirts were uncorrelated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC dissimilarity and allele frequency, but positively correlated with the wearer 2 ̆ 7 s MHC heterozygosity. Fertile women did not exhibit any MHC trait preferences. Women 2 ̆ 7 s preference for the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men who were heterozygous for MHC alleles may be stronger in women who are at infertile cycle points. Men preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> common MHC alleles, which may function to avoid mates with rare alleles that exhibit gestational drive. Men also preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> women at fertile cycle points. The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> facially attractive women, but not men, was preferred. Neither FA nor facial attractiveness in either sex correlated with MHC dissimilarity to others, MHC heterozygosity, or MHC allelic rarity...|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{provided}} additional confirmatory evidence showing MHC influences mate preference. It {{was found that}} females not using non hormonal contraceptives were more attracted to the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> males with dissimilar MHCs. Additionally, females currently using hormonal contraceptives preferred the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> men with MHCs similar to their own. Research has also shown that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> an individual with low fluctuating asymmetry is universally more attractive.|$|R

50|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that men prefer the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> {{women in her}} most fertile period. For example, in one study, men rated the body odours of T-shirts worn by women during their most fertile phase as more sexy and pleasant than T-shirts worn during their least fertile phase. Despite this, {{much of the research}} in the area concludes that the effect <b>of</b> the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetry appears to be sex specific such that men do not find the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> symmetrical women more attractive than the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> asymmetrical women. It therefore appears that attraction to symmetric body odour of the opposite sex appears to apply exclusively to women, and specifically fertile women, as non-fertile women and men do not display this preference.|$|R
40|$|Many snakes {{are able}} to use their chemosensory system to detect <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> conspecifics, which is {{important}} in many social contexts. Age discrimination based on chemical cues may be especially important to ensure access to sexually mature potential partners. In this study, we used 24 individual Boa constrictor snakes (12 adults mature and 12 non-mature individuals) that had been captured in different areas of Ecuador, and were maintained in captivity at the Vivarium of Quito. We used tongue-flick experiments to examine whether these snakes were able to discriminate between scents from mature and non-mature individuals. Results showed that B. constrictor snakes used chemical cues to recognize conspecifics and that the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> individuals of different ages elicited chemosensory responses of different magnitudes. The scents from adult conspecifics elicited the quickest and highest chemosensory responses (i. e., short latency times and high tongue-flick rates), although {{we did not find}} differential responses to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> males and females. The magnitude of the responses was lower to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> sub adult individuals, and then even lower to <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> juvenile snakes, but in all cases the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> snakes was discriminated from a blank control. We discuss the potential chemical mechanisms that may allow age recognition and its implications for social and sexual behavior of this snake species...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} an {{organism}} {{to detect a}} predator and then to take the appropriate vigilance actions is paramount for survival of the species. Lab-reared snails (> 250 generations) maintain their ability to detect predators and alter both aerial and cutaneous respiration. However, only the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> a sympatric predator altered aerial respiration in freshly collected ‘wild’ snails. Here we test {{the hypothesis that the}} detection of a sympatric predator but not an allopatric predator will alter cutaneous respiration in freshly collected ‘wild’ snails. We find that Alberta snails while altering their cutaneous respiration to the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> a sympatric predator (tiger salamander) do not alter respiration to the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> a crayfish (an allopatric predator). In Dutch snails there is a greater alteration to the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> crayfish (sympatric predator) than to an allopatric predator (tiger salamander) ...|$|R
25|$|The <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> amber was {{originally}} derived from emulating the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> ambergris and/or labdanum {{but due to}} the endangered species status of the sperm whale the <b>scent</b> <b>of</b> amber is now largely derived from labdanum. The term “amber” is loosely used to describe a scent that is warm, musky, rich and honey-like, and also somewhat oriental and earthy. It can be synthetically created or derived from natural resins. When derived from natural resins it is most often created out of labdanum. Benzoin is usually part of the recipe. Vanilla and cloves are sometimes used to enhance the aroma.|$|R
