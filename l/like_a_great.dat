In other words, those who benefited from the preparatory teaching gained more time than they had lost in preparation.|$|E
25|$|The {{coloration}} of mosasaurs {{was unknown}} until 2014, when {{the findings of}} Johan Lindgren of Lund University and colleagues revealed the pigment melanin in the fossilized scales of a mosasaur. Mosasaurs were likely countershaded, with dark backs and light underbellies, much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> white shark or leatherback sea turtle, the latter of which had fossilized ancestors for which color was also determined. The findings were described in the journal Nature.|$|E
25|$|The shutdown, however, {{was not for}} long. Tourism to Alaska {{began to}} increase, with many cruise ships {{stopping}} at Skagway. The scenery of the White Pass route sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> tourist draw; and the rails of the White Pass & Yukon Route were laid {{right down to the}} docks, even along them, for the former freight and cruise ship traffic. Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad ride through the mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not even have to walk far.|$|E

25|$|Tonga {{is notable}} for its high obesity rates with over 90% of the {{population}} being overweight. Consequently, many Tongan islanders have {{an increased risk of}} heart disease, diabetes and other obesity related diseases which place the nation's health service under considerable strain. Much of this is related to the nation's cultural love of food and eating as well as the modern influx of cheap and high-fat content meat, with corned beef and lamb belly remaining firm favourites in Tongan cuisine. Despite being a highly obese population, there is little stigma attached to being overweight as one might find in many Western civilizations. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> number of South Pacific cultures, large bodies are often revered, though there is growing acknowledgment of the health risks involved.|$|E
25|$|Many other figures, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> part {{of those}} who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars, Menelaus, and the {{historical}} pugilist Cleomedes of Astupalaea, were also {{believed to have been}} made physically immortal, but without having died in the first place. Indeed, in Greek religion, immortality originally always included an eternal union of body and soul. The philosophical idea of an immortal soul was a later invention, which, although influential, never had a breakthrough in the Greek world. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, traditional Greek believers maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that for the rest of us, we could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead souls.|$|E
25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what {{there is to know about}} it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

25|$|Ricky Ponting {{chose to}} bat {{when he won}} the toss for the visiting Australian cricket team in an {{extremely}} tense and see-sawing match at The County Ground, Bristol. It looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> decision when Jon Lewis and Darren Gough were smashed about early on, as Australia made their way to 57 for 0 after 11 overs with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden taking sixes off Lewis over midwicket. However, with the entrance of Steve Harmison, everything changed. In his third over – the 12th of the game, he removed Gilchrist with a bouncy ball that the batsman edged behind, then Ponting with a yorker that he didn't play at – resulting in lbw – then a dot ball, and then Martyn with a slog shot to Pietersen at third man. Australia tried to consolidate, but when Hayden tried to hit out off Harmison four overs later, Paul Collingwood jumped up to pick the ball out of the air with his right hand – a magnificent catch, and Australia had lost four wickets for six runs, reminiscent of their collapse in the Twenty20 match earlier on in the week.|$|E

500|$|Countess Palatine Ingrid von Marburg {{is portrayed}} by New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless. Lawless {{does not make}} a {{physical}} appearance during the third season, only providing voice-overs for the character. Janet Montgomery, who plays Mary Sibley, fills in for the role after Ingrid possesses Mary's body. On being asked to join Salem, and hearing the description of her role, Lawless said that she thought [...] "that sounds <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of fun" [...] and connected it to her childhood listening to horror stories and watching horror films. She agreed to be in the series in part because of her appreciation of its writing. The New York Times Neil Genzlinger felt that the decision to hire Lawless was based on her status as [...] "one of television’s most cult-inspiring actresses" [...] and the plan to expand on the series' over-the-top horror elements.|$|E

As Oliver cries, his tears cause his doll, a gift from his mother, to come to life and reveal itself as a fairy named Shizuku, who tells Oliver that he is from another world where an evil wizard named Jabou took control. He also tells Oliver that each person from his world has a [...] "soulmate", a person that shares a link with someone in Oliver's world, and that his mother looks very much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> sage, Alicia, who was captured by Jabou.

500|$|Pliny the Elder {{discusses}} beetles in his Natural History, {{describing the}} stag beetle: [...] "Some insects, {{for the preservation}} of their wings, are covered with a erust (elytra) – the beetle, for instance, the wing of which is peculiarly fine and frail. To these insects a sting has been denied by Nature; but in one large kind we find horns of a remarkable length, two-pronged at the extremities, and forming pincers, which the animal closes when it is its intention to bite." [...] The stag beetle is recorded in a Greek myth by Nicander and recalled by Antoninus Liberalis in which Cerambus is turned into a beetle: [...] "He can be seen on trunks and has hook-teeth, ever moving his jaws together. He is black, long and has hard wings <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> dung beetle". The story concludes with the comment that the beetles were used as toys by young boys, and that the head was removed and worn as a pendant.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{thought the}} moral {{message of the}} {{original}} tale was inappropriate, and decided to [...] "put a spin on it" [...] by making the fulfillment of wishes seem <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to be what the person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. [...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure, and trying to make her own way, unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Mysteries of Westgate were mixed. 1UP.com's Jason Wilson {{said that}} the game's plot is [...] "an {{intriguing}} tale, and even after finishing the game, a number of encounters and plot points ring in my head ... but the story's poor stitching distracts from its arc—I felt <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> hand ... was pushing me through the plot, and the tale felt a bit muddled toward the end." [...] Brett Todd of GameSpot called the plot [...] "rough around the edges", while GameZone reviewer Michael Lafferty said, [...] "The game may have a disjointed storyline, but there are moments where humor shines through, and the game does take a few interesting plot twists. And {{the exploration of the}} city zones, the underground areas where the trolls abound, hold that sense of joyful discovery that make an RPG worth playing." [...] Numerous reviewers mentioned that the impact of the mask which drives the story is minimal, having little effect on the actual gameplay. Lafferty said the side quests were not necessarily optional, as they were often a source of additional gold, and a certain point in the game's plot required a substantial sum of it to proceed. GamesRadar's Rich McCormick praised the game's storyline and main quest as some of its best points. In a review for GameStar, Christian Schmidt thought that the game's appearance and humor were poor, but recommended it because of its strong storyline.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "sneak peek screening" [...] of The Amazing Spider-Man {{was held}} on February 6, 2012 in 13 cities internationally: Berlin, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Mexico City, Moscow, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo. On January 8, 2012, the Spider-Man logo {{appeared}} {{on some of the}} world's most iconic buildings, such as the Sydney Opera House, the Colosseum of Rome, the Kremlin in Moscow and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The screening revealed a second trailer in 3D, which thereafter appeared online. Glen Levy of Time magazine felt that the trailer's [...] "dialogue {{goes hand in hand with}} the action, rather than be dominated by it" [...] and that the action scenes from the film looked [...] "polished and slick". The special screening included an eight and a half minute extended trailer. Scott Mantz of Access Hollywood felt that the extended footage seemed is edgier and more character-driven and that [...] "the Lizard looks <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> villain". Peter Sciretta of /Film said that the trailers had left him [...] "impressed" [...] and had captured a feeling of dark naturalism alongside Spider-Man's trademark wisecracking. With the second official trailer and the sizzle reel, Webb felt that it was important to provide a more specific idea of the film, such as showcasing Peter and Gwen's relationship and the visual effects, just to display the attitude of the film that he and the crew were trying to create. On February 7, 2012 it was reported that the latest official trailer revealed a link to the viral marketing internet site for the film.|$|E
500|$|In his {{original}} appearance, Jason was scripted as a mentally disabled young boy. Since Friday the 13th, Jason Voorhees has been {{depicted as a}} non-verbal, indestructible, machete-wielding mass murderer. Jason is primarily portrayed as being completely silent throughout the film series. Exceptions to this include flashbacks of Jason as a child, and a brief scene in Jason Takes Manhattan where the character cries out [...] "Mommy, please don't let me drown!" [...] in a child's voice before being submerged in toxic waste, and in Jason Goes To Hell where his spirit possesses other individuals. Online magazine Salon's Andrew O'Hehir describes Jason as a [...] "silent, expressionless...blank slate." [...] When discussing Jason psychologically, Sean S. Cunningham said, [...] "...he doesn't have any personality. He's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> white shark. You can't really defeat him. All you {{can hope for is}} to survive." [...] Since Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Jason has been a [...] "virtually indestructible" [...] being. Tom McLoughlin, the film's director, felt it was silly that Jason had previously been just another guy in a mask, who would kill people left and right, but get [...] "beaten up and knocked down by the heroine at the end". McLoughlin wanted Jason {{to be more of a}} [...] "formidable, unstoppable monster". In resurrecting Jason from the dead, McLoughlin also gave him the weakness of being rendered helpless if trapped beneath the waters of Crystal Lake; inspired by vampire lore, McLoughlin decided that Jason had in fact drowned as a child, and that returning him to {{his original}} resting place would immobilize him. This weakness would be presented again in The New Blood, and the idea that Jason had drowned as a child was taken up by director Rob Hedden as a plot element in Jason Takes Manhattan.|$|E

Fortunately, such degradation {{has been found to be}} minimal and well-contrasted images were obtained with the instrument. The reason for such healthy survival may be due to extremely quiet solar activity in the last 5  years.

Such dark spots may be noticed in the flat image (e.g., Figs.  9, 10) as several negative spikes.|$|R
