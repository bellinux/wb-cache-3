2500|$|The candela ( [...] or symbol: cd) is {{the base}} unit of {{luminous}} intensity in the International System of Units (SI); that is, <b>luminous</b> <b>power</b> per unit solid angle emitted by a point light source {{in a particular}} direction. Luminous intensity is analogous to radiant intensity, but instead of simply adding up the contributions of every wavelength {{of light in the}} source's spectrum, the contribution of each wavelength is weighted by the standard luminosity function (a model of the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths). A common wax candle emits light with a luminous intensity of roughly one candela. If emission in some directions is blocked by an opaque barrier, the emission would still be approximately one candela in the directions that are not obscured.|$|E
2500|$|Lambert {{demonstrated}} {{these principles}} {{in the only}} way available at the time: by contriving often ingenious optical arrangements that could make two immediately adjacent luminous fields appear equally bright (something {{that could only be}} determined by visual observation), when two physical quantities that produced the two fields were unequal by some specific amount (things that could be directly measured, such as angle or distance). In this way, Lambert quantified purely visual properties (such as <b>luminous</b> <b>power,</b> illumination, transparency, reflectivity) by relating them to physical parameters (such as distance, angle, radiant power, and color). Today, this is known as [...] "visual photometry." [...] Lambert {{was among the first to}} accompany experimental measurements with estimates of uncertainties based on a theory of errors and what he experimentally determined as the limits of visual assessment.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} research on organic light emitting devices (OLED) due to their great potential for flat panel displays. Generally, their research mainly focuses on three aspects: the color, <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency and lifetime of the OLED. To compete the performance of conventional LEDs, the power luminance efficiency {{is the most important}} issue. The calculation of the efficiency of OLED is under direct current (DC) driving. However, for flat panel display applications such as a passive matrix OLED, the pixels are driven by pulse voltage and under a time division multiplexing driving scheme. Under this condition, it is reported that the <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency will be drop dramatically when increasing the number of scanning lines. The relationship between the drop of <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency and number of scanning line will be discussed. Also, a convert from the <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency which measured under DC driving to the <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency which measured under time division multiplexing driving. In general, the surface emission angular pattern of OLED is assumed as a Lambertian radiation pattern. That is a surface emission angular pattern of cosθ. For calculating the <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency η (η = L/P) with this assumption, the normal direction luminous of OLED can be converted to the total luminous flux L in the half space. However, it is reported that the surface emission angular pattern of the OLED is thickness dependent. The relationship between the thickness of OLED Alq layer and the surface emission angular pattern of the OLED will be discussed. Also, the modification of <b>power</b> <b>luminous</b> efficiency as a function of Alq thickness has been proposed...|$|R

5000|$|... 3rd {{generation}} of Retro-Fit LED tubesThe so-called 3rd generation LED tubes {{currently on the}} market resolve the insufficient luminosity problem characteristic to their 1st and 2nd generation counterparts. Since the light emitted by LED tubes is beam-like, the performance (measured in lx) of LED tubes as compared to fluorescent lamps of comparable size has also significantly depended on luminaire placement and optics. Some luminaire frames reflect the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides quite well, while others waste almost all but the light emitted downwards. Especially 1st and 2nd generation LED tubes of lesser <b>luminous</b> <b>power</b> failed to match the performance of fluorescent lamps if the luminaire included wide optics with good reflecting characteristics and only accommodated a single fluorescent/LED tube. Such luminaires are capable of maximizing redirection of the light emitted from a fluorescent lamp upwards and to the sides back into the room. In case of 3rd generation LED tubes, efforts {{have been made to}} solve this problem by increasing their <b>luminous</b> <b>power,</b> so that it would be sufficient under any circumstances, regardless of the luminaire. As a result, however, the tube surface brightness surpasses that of fluorescent lamps, and in some cases, individual bright LED components can have a disturbing effect. Today, several manufacturers offer 3rd generation LED tubes, but the excessive <b>luminous</b> <b>power</b> is generally accompanied by increased electricity consumption.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the effect of}} {{thickness}} variation of hole injection and hole blocking layers {{on the performance of}} fluorescent green organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). A number of OLED devices have been fabricated with combinations of hole injecting and hole blocking layers of varying thicknesses. Even though hole blocking and hole injection layers have opposite functions, yet there is a particular combination of their thicknesses when they function in conjunction and <b>luminous</b> efficiency and <b>power</b> efficiency are maximized. The optimum thickness of CuPc (Copper(II) phthalocyanine) layer, used as hole injection layer and BCP (2, 9 dimethyl- 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) used as hole blocking layer were found to be 18 nm and 10 nm respectively.
