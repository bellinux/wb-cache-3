5|$|Hump it (or Humping it): During a yell, {{the crowd}} <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> and places {{their hands on}} their knees to {{maximize}} the amount of air displaced during the scream. The stance forces the diaphragm to assist the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{the rider}} sits upright or <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> slightly. The feet are below the rider. These are {{motorcycles}} {{that are not}} specialised to one task, so they do not excel in any particular area. The standard posture is used with touring and commuting as well as dirt and dual-sport bikes, and may offer advantages for beginners.|$|E
25|$|Sport bikes {{have high}} footpegs that {{position}} the legs {{closer to the}} body to improve ground clearance when cornering, and a long reach to the hand controls, which positions the body and center of gravity forward, above the fuel tank. The rider <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> into the wind, the force of which can comfortably support the rider's weight at speeds near , but at lower speeds leaves too much weight on the arms and wrists, causing fatigue.|$|E
60|$|Thomas Rooper now <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{with his}} elbows on his knees without smoking, and Asaph Scantle <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> with {{his elbows on}} his knees without smoking. And thus they remained, saying nothing to each other, for the space of some ten minutes.|$|R

500|$|Extension is the {{opposite}} of flexion, describing a straightening movement that increases the angle between body parts. When a joint can move forward and backward, such as the neck and trunk, extension refers to movement in the posterior direction. For example, when standing up, the knees are extended. Extension of the hip or shoulder moves the arm or leg backward. When the chin is against the chest, the head is flexed, and the trunk is flexed when a person <b>leans</b> <b>forward.</b>|$|E
500|$|MacNeil {{submitted}} two {{designs for}} the obverse, the one which was successful and another, showing a standing Liberty facing right, which he would later resubmit in modified form in the Peace dollar design competition of 1921, again unsuccessfully. [...] In the rejected design, MacNeil's Liberty <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> an olive branch extended in her left hand, but her right hand holding the hilt of a broadsword. [...] According to Burdette, the design was intended {{to send a message}} to the belligerents in World War I that America wanted peace, but was ready to fight.|$|E
500|$|As with van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, {{the panel}} creates an {{intimate}} setting between the donor and Virgin. This is emphasised by the donor's physical {{proximity to the}} Virgin which, according to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, [...] "mentally and pictorially [...] the barriers between heaven and earth" [...] and implies the [...] "patrons are visually immortalized as meriting the Virgin and Child's personal attention." [...] The intimacy is further enhanced by small details such as the overlap between the donor and Saint George, who casts a shadow on van der Paele and seems to have accidentally stepped on his surplice as he <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to introduce the canon to the Virgin.|$|E
60|$|Bateman <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and fixed}} Edward with his searching eyes.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Cray <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{a little}} and {{clutched}} the tablecloth.|$|R
60|$|Laverick hesitating, she <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> {{and looked}} into his face.|$|R
500|$|Its {{influence}} {{can be seen in}} the dismissive {{stare and}} overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, [...] "Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her [...] "massive, monumental presence". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, [...] "That's Madame Bertin!" ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{painting}} Virgin and Child with St. Anne the composition again {{picks up the}} theme of figures in a landscape, which Wasserman describes as [...] "breathtakingly beautiful" [...] and harkens back to the St Jerome picture with the figure set at an oblique angle. What makes this painting unusual {{is that there are}} two obliquely set figures superimposed. Mary is seated on the knee of her mother, St Anne. She <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to restrain the Christ Child as he plays roughly with a lamb, the sign of his own impending sacrifice. This painting, which was copied many times, influenced Michelangelo, Raphael, and Andrea del Sarto, and through them Pontormo and Correggio. The trends in composition were adopted in particular by the Venetian painters Tintoretto and Veronese.|$|E
500|$|Unlike many schools, {{which have}} {{a large group of}} cheerleaders to rally their fans during {{sporting}} events, Texas A has five student Yell Leaders. [...] Consisting of three seniors and two juniors, historically all male, the Yell Leaders are elected to their positions annually by the student body. [...] These students do not perform gymnastic feats, but instead use hand signals, known as [...] "pass backs", to direct and intensify crowds. [...] After the signals are passed through the crowd, the Yell Leaders give the signal to [...] "hump it", where the crowd <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> and places their hands on their knees to maximize the noise. [...] The Yell Leaders have a dozen yells that they can choose from depending on the situation. [...] While some yells are designed to praise and motivate the team, others exist solely to make fun of the opposing side.|$|E
60|$|Aaron <b>leaned</b> <b>forward,</b> aghast. His monosyllable {{was charged}} with terrified reproach.|$|R
60|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> now, looking {{deep into}} the eyes of Sakr-el-Bahr.|$|R
60|$|He {{stopped with}} an exclamation, {{and the others}} <b>leaned</b> <b>forward</b> eagerly.|$|R
500|$|In the 19-minute {{music video}} for [...] "Bad"—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not {{previously}} {{seen in his}} work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, [...] "I think it happens subliminally" [...] and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. [...] "Bad" [...] garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as [...] "infamous". The video also featured Wesley Snipes; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles. For the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted [...] for the device. Although the music video for [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was not officially released in the US, in 1989 it was nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award {{for the quality of}} the special effects used in its production. In 1990, [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.|$|E
2500|$|Sport {{the rider}} <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> {{into the wind}} and the weight of the upper torso is {{supported}} by the rider's core at low speed and air pressure at high speed (e.g., above [...] ). The footpegs are below the rider or to the rear. The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance and allows higher speeds. At low-speed this position throws the weight of the rider onto the arms, which can tire the rider's wrists.|$|E
2500|$|George Frazier of Life {{magazine}} found Berlin to be [...] "intensely nervous," [...] with a {{habit of}} tapping his listener with his index finger to emphasize a point, and continually pressing his hair down in back" [...] and [...] "picking up any stray crumbs left on a table after a meal." [...] While listening, [...] "he <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> tensely, with his hands clasped below his knees like a prizefighter waiting in his corner for the bell.... For {{a man who has}} known so much glory," [...] writes Frazier, [...] "Berlin has somehow managed to retain the enthusiasm of a novice." ...|$|E

2500|$|The missionary {{position}} has potential for clitoral stimulation in several ways. Christakos assures, [...] "This position {{can give the}} woman plenty of clitoral stimulation if the man <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> thus rubbing his pelvic bone against her clitoris." [...] Emily Queenie Chung notes, [...] "Also, this position is the easiest {{for a woman to}} stimulate her clitoris manually." [...] Sexual Health Resource notes that also [...] "the man can reach under and stimulate his partner using his fingers on her clitoris" [...] although [...] "the man has limited use of his hands" [...] (presumably this would depend on the variant of the position used and whether the man's hands are occupied holding himself up).|$|E
2500|$|To block balls that {{a pitcher}} throws on a bounce toward home plate (pitches that {{are said to}} be [...] "in the dirt"), the catcher will slide his body to the left or right, as necessary, to place himself {{directly}} {{in the path of the}} ball. Once in position, he drops to his knees, places his mitt between his legs to prevent the ball from passing through, and <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to deaden the rebound when, and if, the ball bounces off his thigh or torso. Although inexperienced catchers may try to catch the errant pitch with his mitt, coaches often prioritize the catcher's ability to [...] "keep the ball in front of him" [...] than to make a catch with his mitt. Ideally, the catcher will be able to knock the ball to the ground where it will stop within arm's reach. To perform this properly, without the ball being deflected in an undesirable direction, the catcher must angle his body so that his chest is always leaning forward, toward home plate. This maneuver is often difficult, and its difficulty depends largely on how fast the ball is traveling, the angle at which the ball is thrown into the ground, where it first hits the ground, the firmness of the ground it hits, and the manner in which it is spinning.|$|E
2500|$|The skiff is {{designed}} for optimum performance and so the technique applied is important. The two fundamental reference points in the stroke are the catch where the blade {{is placed in the}} water, and the 'finish' where the blade is removed from the water. The skiffer <b>leans</b> <b>forward,</b> and bends the legs slightly. After placing the blade vertically in the water at the catch, he or she applies pressure to stretcher, levering the blade in the water on the thole and leans back. This is called the drive phase of the stroke. Once the skiffer has pushed the blade as far forward in the water as possible, he or she extracts the oar from the water, and the recovery phase begins, setting up the skiffer's body for the next stroke. On the recovery, it is normal to tip the blade flat (known as [...] "feathering"). There are some differences from the rowing stroke. The hands must never pass one above the other - one hand must always lead, or one of the blades will [...] "dig" [...] in the water. The seat does not slide and the unbending of the legs follows from the leaning back of the body. Finally skiffs are more stable so {{that it is possible to}} lean back further and keep the blade in the water for longer. The last extra distance provides considerable motive power to the boat, leading to the encouragement to [...] "squeeze the finish".|$|E

2500|$|Flutes (Captivity): The stage {{returns to}} the Archer's Den, where the Twin Brother is imprisoned in a small cage. The Chief Archer's Daughter watches from a distance, holding the flutes that the twins played before their lives were changed forever. All seems lost for the Twin Brother until he finds {{a friend in the}} kind-natured Chief Archer's Daughter, who dares to {{approach}} him. She passes the flutes to the Twin Brother, he begins to play and when she leans towards the cage for a closer look at him, he <b>leans</b> <b>forward</b> to steal a brief kiss. Although the Chief Archer's Daughter is taken aback, as she turns away from the Twin Brother it is obvious that she has also become smitten by him. After their tender moment and after great hesitation, the Chief Archer's Daughter sets the Twin Brother free from his cage, begging him to flee. Before he does, the Twin Brother makes a decision [...] he returns to her his flutes, the precious ceremonial gifts that were treasured by their kingdom. The Twin Brother then escapes, leaving the Chief Archer's Daughter in hope they will meet again. She cannot hide her joy [...] she expresses her love through a touching performance of dance using the twins' flutes. All of this is secretly witnessed by the Counselor's Son, who has desired the Chief Archer's Daughter for years. Engulfed by rage and jelousy of his unrequited love, he prepares for war.|$|E
