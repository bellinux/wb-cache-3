5|$|In 1751, Francis Blomefield, in his Collectanea Cantabrigiensia, {{recorded}} StJames' {{as having}} a square tower, with four bells and a clock. The north aisle was <b>leaded</b> {{and there was a}} chantry chapel at the east end with a screen. He concludes this to be the Chancel of the Resurrection. At this time, the south aisle, nave and chancel were also recorded as <b>leaded.</b>|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have found}} a weak link between lead from <b>leaded</b> {{gasoline}} and crime rates.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{has been}} {{evaluated}} {{as a replacement}} for lead in free-machining brasses for plumbing applications, although it does not equal the performance of <b>leaded</b> steels.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw an {{increase}} in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal. Beginning in the 1920s, lead was added to gasoline to improve its combustion; lead from this exhaust persists today in soil and dust in buildings. Blood lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when <b>leaded</b> gasoline began to be phased out. In those countries that have banned lead in solder for food and drink cans and have banned <b>leaded</b> gasoline additives, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The nave inner {{porch in}} oak with long narrow <b>leaded</b> lights {{was made by}} George Pace in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of <b>leaded</b> gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of <b>leaded</b> gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although <b>leaded</b> soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have <b>leaded</b> gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned <b>leaded</b> gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow <b>leaded</b> gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. <b>Leaded</b> gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between <b>leaded</b> gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or lead-based paint. Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from <b>leaded</b> gasoline.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three <b>leaded</b> trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular <b>leaded</b> glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its <b>leaded</b> glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The Turkish Baths on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the windows}} contain clear <b>leaded</b> glass, but some have stained glass. In 2010, a two-panel stained glass window {{depicting}} {{the work of the}} RAF Search and Rescue units at RAF Valley was dedicated by the RAF's Chaplain-in-Chief, Ray Pentland. The window, which also commemorates the work of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute and the RAF Mountain Rescue Service, was created by Karen Newby– wife of a former RAF Valley station commander– and Lindsey Abbott. Karen Newby also designed a window dedicated in 2001 to mark the work of 208 Squadron at RAF Valley. Another stained glass window was added in 2012 to mark the 100th anniversary of 4Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Since lead {{has been}} used widely for centuries, the effects of {{exposure}} are worldwide. Environmental lead is ubiquitous, and everyone has some measurable blood lead level. Atmospheric lead pollution increased dramatically beginning in the 1950s {{as a result of}} the widespread use of <b>leaded</b> gasoline. Lead is one of the largest environmental medicine problems in terms of numbers of people exposed and the public health toll it takes. Lead exposure accounts for about 0.2% of all deaths and 0.6% of disability adjusted life years globally.|$|E
5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. <b>Leaded</b> panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a beehive representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. Lead production declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, <b>leaded</b> gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 2,000fragments of lead were found, 940of {{which were}} {{droplets}} of melted metal, {{some of these}} being {{a consequence of the}} fire in 1236. One of the earliest artefacts was a papal bulla dating from the rule of Pope Clement III (1187–91). Two other possible seals were discovered. A total of 15lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artefacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in <b>leaded</b> windows), ventilator grills, and water pipes. Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17thcentury. Another find was a small gemstone, a cabochon (polished) sardonyx.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric {{disorders such as}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} and anti-social behaviour. Elevated lead levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures. A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood lead exposure and violent crime in adulthood. Countries with the highest air lead levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates, after adjusting for confounding factors. A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that lead exposure explains 65% to 90% of the variation in violent crime rates in the US. A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood lead and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries. Lead {{exposure in}} childhood appears to increase school suspensions and juvenile detention among boys. It is believed that the U.S. ban on lead paint in buildings in the late 1970s, as well as the phaseout of <b>leaded</b> gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s, partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{countries}} in the world have phased out automotive <b>leaded</b> fuel. In 2011 six countries were still using <b>leaded</b> gasoline: Afghanistan, Myanmar, North Korea, Algeria, Iraq and Yemen. It was expected {{that by the end of}} 2013 those countries would ban <b>leaded</b> gasoline, but it has not occurred. Algeria will replace <b>leaded</b> with unleaded automotive fuel only in 2015.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leaded</b> petrol was {{withdrawn}} from sale in Britain after 31 December 1999, {{seven years after}} EEC regulations signalled the end of production for cars using <b>leaded</b> petrol in member states. At this stage, {{a large percentage of}} cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on <b>leaded</b> petrol were still in use, along with cars which could run on unleaded fuel. However, the declining number of such cars on British roads saw many petrol stations withdrawing LRP from sale by 2003.|$|E
25|$|For {{technical}} reasons {{the use of}} <b>leaded</b> additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100LL, because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach {{without the use of}} <b>leaded</b> additives.|$|E
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles {{depending on the type}} of fuel required. The filler pipe of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take <b>leaded</b> fuel. The tank filler opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using <b>leaded</b> fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries <b>leaded</b> fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|E
25|$|Older {{color and}} {{monochrome}} CRTs may contain toxic substances, such as cadmium, in the phosphors. The rear glass tube of modern CRTs {{may be made}} from <b>leaded</b> glass, which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly. By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead, though {{the rear of the}} CRT was still produced from <b>leaded</b> glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough <b>leaded</b> glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leache (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to <b>leaded</b> glass crystalware).|$|E
25|$|<b>Leaded</b> solder for gas mains, lead piping, coal ashes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leaded</b> {{gasoline}} was {{the predominant}} type {{available in the}} first years of the Wankel engine's development. Lead is a solid lubricant, and <b>leaded</b> gasoline is designed to reduced the wearing of seal and housings. The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of gasoline's lubricating qualities. As <b>leaded</b> gasoline was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the gasoline to provide lubrication to critical engine parts. Experienced users advise, even in engines with electronic fuel injection, adding at least 1% of oil directly to gasoline as a safety measure in case the pump supplying oil to combustion chamber related parts failed or sucked in air. A SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton's choices of materials and cooling fins.|$|E
25|$|<b>Leaded</b> CRT {{glass is}} sold to be {{remelted}} into other CRTs, or even broken down {{and used in}} road construction.|$|E
25|$|Because {{it is not}} {{possible}} to build multilayer capacitors with this material, only <b>leaded</b> single layer types are offered in the market.|$|E
25|$|Internally, the {{pavilion}} has a concrete floor with two timber and iron park benches in the centre. <b>Leaded</b> marble plaques are {{located at the}} top of the interior walls. The first is an honour roll which lists the names of the local nursing sisters who served in the First and Second World Wars. The names of the two who died on service are identified with a <b>leaded</b> cross. The second marble plaque records the details of the commissioning and unveiling of {{the pavilion}}.|$|E
25|$|Hollyhock House at Barnsdall Art Park and Ennis House—Judson Studios {{provided}} <b>leaded</b> {{and stained}} glass and tiles for Frank Lloyd Wright's {{work on the}} Hollyhock and Ennis Houses.|$|E
25|$|First European {{countries}} started replacing lead {{by the end}} of the 1980s and {{by the end of}} the 1990s <b>leaded</b> gasoline {{was banned}} within the entire European Union. Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the United States and South Africa. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of <b>leaded</b> gasoline and violent crime: taking into account a 22-year time lag, the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve.|$|E
25|$|The present Tiffany-style, {{stained glass}} windows, despite local {{tradition}} to the contrary, do not replicate the original material that was diamond-paned, <b>leaded</b> glass. No Virginia colonial church had stained glass windows.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{the most}} common {{gasoline}} grade (and lowest octane generally available) is 'Premium' 95 RON unleaded. 'Super' is widely available at 97 RON (for example Shell V-Power, BP Ultimate). <b>Leaded</b> fuel is no longer available.|$|E
25|$|Styrofoam cups release styrene as {{the food}} or drink is consumed. <b>Leaded</b> fuel is another {{hazardous}} chemical. Although {{it has been}} outlawed in the United States, its use in developing countries impacts the health of local people and the global environment.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, petrol is unleaded, and {{available}} in 91 (normally {{with up to}} 10% ethanol), 95, 98 and 100 octane (names of various petrols differ from brand to brand). Fuel additives for use in cars designed for <b>leaded</b> fuel are available at most servos.|$|E
25|$|Hooker's Georgian design {{featured}} graceful pediments and grouped columns. He {{may have}} based it on Charles Bulfinch's Hollis Street Church in Boston. When built {{it was just}} the main block, and a simpler front entrance. The windows were set with plain <b>leaded</b> glass.|$|E
25|$|Viollet le Duc dated {{the stained}} glass in the church to around 1295, but the {{ornament}} in its borders and grisaille is from an earlier tradition. It has a cross-hatched ground, as in Merton College, Oxford, but has a very simple <b>leaded</b> pattern and includes much natural foliage.|$|E
