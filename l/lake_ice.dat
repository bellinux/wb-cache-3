5|$|New England {{businessmen}} {{also tried}} to establish a market for ice in England during the 1840s. An abortive first attempt to export ice to England had occurred in 1822 under William Leftwich; he had imported ice from Norway, but his cargo had melted before reaching London. Fresh attempts were made by Jacob Hittinger who owned supplies at Fresh Pond, and Eric Landor, with assets at Wenham Lake, in 1842 and 1844 respectively. Of the two, Landor's venture was more successful and he formed the Wenham <b>Lake</b> <b>Ice</b> Company to export to Britain, building an ice depot on the Strand. Wenham ice was marketed as being unusually pure, possessed of special cooling properties, successfully convincing British customers to avoid local British ice, which was condemned as polluted and unhealthy. After some initial success, the venture eventually failed, {{in part because the}} English chose not to adopt chilled drinks {{in the same way as}} North Americans, but also because of the long distances involved in the trade and the consequent costs of ice wastage through melting. Nonetheless, the trade allowed for some refrigerated goods to arrive in England from America along with ice cargos during the 1840s.|$|E

2500|$|A glacier ( [...] or [...] ) is a {{persistent}} body of dense ice that is constantly moving {{under its own}} weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and <b>lake</b> <b>ice</b> that form {{on the surface of}} bodies of water.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cryosphere}} (from the Greek [...] kryos, [...] "cold", [...] "frost" [...] or [...] "ice" [...] and [...] sphaira, [...] "globe, ball") {{is those}} portions of Earth's surface where water is in solid form, including sea ice, <b>lake</b> <b>ice,</b> river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost). Thus, {{there is a}} wide overlap with the hydrosphere. The cryosphere {{is an integral part of}} the global climate system with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, atmospheric and oceanic circulation. Through these feedback processes, the cryosphere plays a significant role in the global climate and in climate model response to global changes. The term deglaciation describes the retreat of cryospheric features. Cryology is the study of cryospheres.|$|E
2500|$|The lake effect ends or {{its effect}} is reduced, however, when the lake freezes over. In January 2011, for example, {{residents}} of Cleveland were glad when Lake Erie was [...] "90 percent frozen" [...] since {{it meant that}} the area had [...] "made it over the hump" [...] in terms of enduring repeated snowfalls which required much shoveling. Being the shallowest of the Great Lakes, {{it is the most}} likely to freeze and frequently does. On February 16, 2010, meteorologists reported that the lake had frozen over marking the first time the lake had completely frozen over since the winter of 1995–1996. In contrast, Lake Michigan has never completely frozen over since the warmer and deeper portion is in the south, although it came close to being totally frozen during three harsh winters over the past century. When the lake freezes over, this usually shuts down the lake effect snowfall.

His was a case of Handy- Andyism, as that intellectual disease may be named, after Mr. Lover's hero; like that of the Obeah-woman, when she tried to bribe the white gentleman with half a dozen of bottled beer; a case of muddle-headed craft and elaborate silliness, which keeps no proportion between the means and the end; so common in insane persons; frequent, too, among the lower Irish, such as Handy Andy; and very frequent, I am afraid, among the Negroes. But--as might have been expected--the poor boy's moral sense had proved as shaky as his intellectual powers. He had just taken a fancy to some goods of his master's; and had retreated, to enjoy them the more securely, into the southern forests, with a couple of brown policemen on his track. So he was likely to undergo a more simple investigation than that which was submitted to my analysis, viz. how he proposed to wash the salt out of the sugar.|$|E
