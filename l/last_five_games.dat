5|$|With the win, the Bears officially {{improved}} {{upon their}} 5–11 record from 2014. The three turnovers forced {{in the game}} was a best for the defense, while also tying the total in the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gary Pinkel's Missouri {{team was}} the {{surprise}} of the conference in 2006, having already matched their win total from the previous year. They shared the lead for the Big12 North division with Nebraska (who they lost to November 4 in Lincoln). The Tigers won their homecoming game against Kansas State 41–21. The Sooners also won their homecoming game against Colorado by a score of 24–3. This {{was the beginning of}} a long road stretch for Oklahoma; they played four of their <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> on the road. This was the 91st meeting between the schools with the Sooners holding the advantage 63235.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2006 Gator Bowl following a 10–2 regular season that included wins over 15th-ranked Georgia Tech and traditional rivals Virginia. A loss to Florida State in the inaugural ACC Championship Game had given Tech a bid to the Gator Bowl instead of the more prestigious Bowl Championship Series-run Orange Bowl game. Facing the 12th-ranked Hokies were the 15th-ranked Louisville Cardinals, who had gone 9–2 during their first season in the Big East Conference. Louisville had won its <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> before the Gator Bowl and had participated in the Liberty Bowl during the previous season.|$|E
5000|$|Knostman was {{selected}} by the Syracuse Nationals in the 1953 NBA Draft. [...] His career <b>lasted</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> and he scored a total of 13 points.|$|R
50|$|The {{series was}} {{influenced}} strongly {{by the play}} of Mike Richards, who had four multi-point games in the series that <b>lasted</b> <b>five</b> <b>games.</b> However, the series was also marred with a large amount of obstruction penalties called. In <b>five</b> <b>games,</b> there were 72 minor penalties and three game misconducts handed out for a total of 174 penalty minutes between both teams.|$|R
50|$|Nevada's <b>last</b> <b>five</b> bowl <b>games</b> {{before this}} one were decided by three points or fewer.|$|R
5|$|Ferguson had a {{defensive}} selection dilemma {{ahead of the}} final, with both of his starting full-backs, Gabriel Heinze (ankle) and Gary Neville (groin), having suffered injuries. Neville eventually recovered {{enough to make the}} substitutes' bench, despite only playing in one of the team's <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games,</b> but Heinze missed the game entirely, Mikaël Silvestre taking his place at left-back. Neville's absence meant that John O'Shea started at right-back. Neville was joined on the bench by winger Ryan Giggs and goalkeeper Tim Howard; Giggs' omission was a surprise, and it meant that Darren Fletcher started on the right wing, while Ronaldo played on the left. Howard, on the other hand, had been competing for the number 1 jersey with Roy Carroll all season, and it was ultimately the Northern Irishman who was picked.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} 2006 Gator Bowl following a 10–2 regular season that included wins over 15th-ranked Georgia Tech and traditional rivals Virginia and West Virginia. A loss to Florida State in the inaugural ACC Championship Game gave Tech a position in the Gator Bowl instead of the more prestigious Bowl Championship Series-run Orange Bowl game. Facing the 12th-ranked Hokies were the 15th-ranked Louisville Cardinals, who finished 9–2 during the regular season of their first year in the Big East Conference. Louisville won its <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> before the Gator Bowl and participated in the Liberty Bowl {{at the end of the}} previous season. Pre-game media coverage of the game focused on Virginia Tech's fall from being a contender for the national championship, Louisville's loss of star quarterback Brian Brohm to injury, the fact that both teams were playing under new conference affiliations, and the rise of Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick, younger brother of NFL star Michael Vick.|$|E
5|$|The Lobos also {{relied heavily}} on their rushing offense. Running back DonTrell Moore had gained 3,667 career yards and {{averaged}} 106 rushing yards per game coming into the contest. When both Moore and quarterback Kole McKamey played for the Lobos, the team had a record of 6–1, averaging 21.4 offensive points per game; however, when either player was sidelined with an injury, the team's record dropped to 1–3 and the offense averaged 10.3 points per game. The Lobos' passing offense also ranked {{near the bottom of}} the FBS, at 115th. Wide receiver Hank Baskett led the team with 49 receptions for 793 yards during the season. The Lobos entered the bowl game with the eighth best rushing defense in the country, allowing an average of 93.6 rushing yards per game. The team had allowed 107 yards of rushing offense in its previous four games combined; it ranked first in the Mountain West Conference in fewest points allowed and most sacks, and had not allowed a rushing touchdown in its <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games.</b> With a win, Lobos head coach Rocky Long would set a team record for most wins as a head coach.|$|E
50|$|Cruz was {{replaced}} by José Luis Romero after eight games in charge, which included only one win. He was subsequently in charge of Getafe CF, Toledo, Levante UD, CD Ourense and Cádiz CF, never being able to complete a season; his reign with the Valencians only <b>lasted</b> <b>five</b> <b>games,</b> with his side failing to obtain a single point.|$|R

50|$|But Razov did {{not last}} long in Columbus. Even though he scored in the 2005 season opener, his tenure with the club <b>lasted</b> <b>five</b> <b>games.</b> Disagreement with head coach Greg Andrulis led to Razov's reuniting with his ex-coach with the Fire, Bob Bradley, at the MetroStars. He was {{acquired}} in exchange for John Wolyniec and a partial allocation. After the season, Bradley acquired Razov again, for Thiago Martins and another partial allocation. Razov's 104 league goals stand third in MLS history through July 2007.|$|R
5|$|In 1956 {{he started}} his third All-Star Game, but was charged with the loss despite {{allowing}} only one run in three innings. Buoyed {{by the arrival of}} rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio, who sparked the team in leading the league in stolen bases, the White Sox enjoyed a two-month offensive surge from June 4 to August 3 in which they averaged eight runs in Pierce's 13 starts; he won 11 of the games, losing only those immediately before and after the All-Star break, the latter being a 2–1 loss to Ford and the Yankees. He became the first White Sox pitcher since 1941 to win 20 games, was second in the AL with a career-high 192 strikeouts (a team record for left-handers until Gary Peters had 205 in 1964), and was named AL Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News, outpolling Ford (who had edged him in a close 1955 vote) by a margin of 117 to 52; he also finished fifth in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1957 Pierce became the first White Sox pitcher since Red Faber (1920–1922) to earn 20 victories in consecutive seasons; he tied Jim Bunning for the league lead, and bested him in voting for AL Pitcher of the Year. He had six consecutive complete game victories from May 16 to June 8 in which his total ERA was 0.64, with two 1–0 victories in ten innings including his sixth career two-hitter on June 4 against the Red Sox; the White Sox scored just nine total runs over the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> in that stretch. Despite the presence of such popular players as Miñoso, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox, Pierce was chosen as the player most popular with White Sox fans in a 1957 spring training poll of sportswriters. A separate poll of managers, coaches, writers and broadcasters named him Chicago's best fielding pitcher, best pitcher at holding runners to first base, and best pitcher for crucial games, as well as the team's most nervous player on the field.|$|E
25|$|In 1985 and 1986, the Cavaliers {{did not go}} to bowl games. In 1987, {{they started}} 3–4 but would win the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> to finish 8–4 with an All-American Bowl win over BYU. In 1988, the Cavaliers started 2–4 but would win their <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> to finish 7–4 with no bowl game. The 1989 season was the {{greatest}} season in school history, with a record of 10–3 overall, and the winning of the program's first ACC co-championship. Virginia would go on to lose the Florida Citrus Bowl, the first New Year's Day bowl in school history.|$|E
25|$|By winning four {{of their}} <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games,</b> Blackpool stayed up, {{but it had been}} a close call. There was little {{interest}} in the cups, apart from a two-legged victory over First Division Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the time}} {{leading up to}} Gretzky's announcement, several {{prominent}} free agents signed with Phoenix citing {{the chance to play}} for Gretzky, including Brett Hull. Hull, who was briefly Gretzky's right winger, only <b>lasted</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> and only scored one assist before retiring. Ironically, [...] "The Golden Brett" [...] would have had the record for the most goals over any given three seasons [...] - [...] he scored 228 goals between 1989-90 and 1991-92 [...] - [...] if it weren't for The Great One. From 1981-82 to 1983-84, Gretzky scored 254 goals.|$|R
50|$|Tucker {{is one of}} the few Giants to {{play for}} the team in four {{different}} home stadiums: Yankee Stadium (1970 through the first two home games of 1973); the Yale Bowl (<b>last</b> <b>five</b> home <b>games</b> of 1973 and all of 1974); Shea Stadium (1975) and Giants Stadium (1976-77).|$|R

25|$|In the Giants {{first home}} playoff game since 1962, {{despite the fact}} that the 49ers {{recorded}} 362 yards of total offense, with receiver Dwight Clark catching eight passes for 120 yards, the Giants defense limited San Francisco to only one field goal the entire game. It was a very satisfying win for New York, who had lost their <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> played against the 49ers, including playoff losses in 1981 and 1984.|$|E
50|$|On 19 July 2014, Richards {{signed with}} Zepter Vienna, {{returning}} to the club for a second stint.

25|$|The Browns {{continued}} {{to roll in}} the first half of the 1977 season, but an injury to Sipe by Steelers linebacker Jack Lambert on November 13 proved to be disastrous. Cleveland won only one of their <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> to finish at 6–8, a collapse that led to Forrest Gregg's dismissal before the final game of the season. Dick Modzelewski served as interim coach in the team's 20–19 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{has played}} a major role in the {{development}} of disability sport. The Paralympic Games originated in the Stoke Mandeville Games, which were held at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire in 1948. The Great Britain team does much better in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics than at the Summer Olympics. It has never finished outside the top five and has been second several times, including the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016. The BBC is an enthusiastic promoter of disability sport. International Paralympic Committee president Sir Philip Craven is British. London's successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics also meant that it hosted the 2012 Summer Paralympics.|$|E
25|$|The Wild Card Jaguars, who {{had barely}} {{made the playoffs}} with a 9–7 record by winning their <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> of the season (including their final one when Atlanta Falcons kicker Morten Andersen missed a last second {{potential}} game winning 30-yard field goal), overcame a 12-point deficit by racking up 443 yards (including 202 on the ground) and scoring on six consecutive possessions to upset the Broncos, who had finished the season with an NFL best 13–3 record (and had rested most of their starters {{over the last three}} games after clinching the #1 AFC seed at 12-1) and were favored to win by over 14 points. Their loss meant that for the second consecutive year the AFC's top seed was eliminated in the divisional round.|$|E
25|$|At the US Open, Dementieva {{was one of}} {{six players}} with the {{opportunity}} to be ranked world No. 1 upon completion of the tournament.

Dementieva was up a break in each set but committed 42 unforced errors and lost each of her <b>last</b> <b>five</b> service <b>games.</b> Nevertheless, her ranking improved to world No. 4 {{for the first time since}} 2004.|$|R
50|$|Gould {{was first}} capped for Wales against Ireland on 28 January 1882. He would play for Wales a further 10 times, captaining the team against Scotland on February 26, 1887.

25|$|The 2002–03 {{season was}} a disappointing one for Valencia, as they failed in {{their attempt to}} retain the Liga title and ended up outside of the Champions League spots in fifth, behind Celta de Vigo. They were also knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Internazionale on away goals. The 2003–04 season saw Los Che {{trailing}} long-time leaders Real Madrid. In February, after 26 matches played, Real Madrid were eight points clear. However, the latter's form declined late in the season and they lost their <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games</b> of the campaign, allowing Valencia to overtake them and win the title. The club added the UEFA Cup to this success. Valencia had now been La Liga champions twice in three seasons.|$|E

25|$|Stewart {{started her}} {{freshman}} year in strong fashion, scoring at least 20 points in three of her first four games. She scored a total of 169 points in her first ten games, {{which is more than}} any other Connecticut Husky freshman.

In March, she started early morning session with Chris Daily, associate head coach, to concentrate on shooting and post moves. She came back strong in the Big East tournament, with a total of 51 points, matching the number scored by Diana Taurasi in her tournament debut. Her strong performance continued in the NCAA tournament. She did not play in the first round, due to a calf injury, but scored 105 points in the <b>last</b> <b>five</b> <b>games,</b> earning her the award of the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, the first freshman to win the award since 1987.|$|E
