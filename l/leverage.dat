Angle eliminated Van Dam after a roll-up using the ropes for <b>leverage.</b> Guerrero eliminated Jindrak after a roll-up, also using the ropes for <b>leverage.</b> Big Show eliminated Reigns after a chokeslam. Big Show eliminated Angle after an FU by Cena and a frog splash by Guerrero, meaning Team Guerrero won the match.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{analyze the}} effect of {{financing}} announcements of highly <b>leveraged</b> transactions on the stock prices of the banks that lead highly <b>leveraged</b> transaction lending syndicates. For their sample of forty-one highly <b>leveraged</b> transactions, the authors document that the first highly <b>leveraged</b> transaction and bank financing announcements result in positive wealth effects for the lending banks. They also find that these wealth effects are lower in 1985, for smaller highly <b>leveraged</b> transactions, and for banks with a high loan loss reserve to total asset ratio. Finally, they report that <b>leveraged</b> buyout targets gain about 2 percent, whereas <b>leveraged</b> recap targets lose about 2 percent, when the first bank financing agreement is announced.

In addition, firms with high expected costs of financial distress (e. g, those with high research and development expenditures) are less likely to do <b>leveraged</b> buyouts.

40|$|<b>Leveraged</b> and Inverse ETFs {{replicate}} the <b>leveraged</b> or the inverse {{of the daily}} returns of an index. Several papers have established that investors who hold these investments for periods longer than a day expose themselves to substantial risk as the holding period returns will deviate from the returns to a <b>leveraged</b> or inverse investment in the index. It is possible for an investor in a <b>leveraged</b> ETF to experience negative returns even when the underlying index has positive returns. In this paper, we estimate distributions of holding periods for investors in <b>leveraged</b> and inverse ETFs. Using standard models, we show that a substantial percentage of investors may hold these short-term investments for periods longer {{than one or two}} days, even longer than a quarter. We estimate the investment shortfall incurred by investing in <b>leveraged</b> and inverse ETFs compared to investing in a simple margin account to generate the same <b>leveraged</b> or short-selling investment strategy. We find that investors in <b>leveraged</b> and inverse ETFs can lose 3 % of their investment in less than 3 weeks, an annualized cost of 50 %. We also discuss the viability of <b>leveraged</b> and inverse <b>leveraged</b> ETFs that rebalance less often than daily and calculate their costs to investors. I...|$|R

25|$|<b>Leveraged</b> {{exchange-traded}} funds (LETFs or <b>leveraged</b> ETFs) are {{a type of}} ETF {{that attempt}} to achieve returns that are more sensitive to market movements than non-leveraged ETFs. <b>Leveraged</b> index ETFs are often marketed as bull or bear funds. A <b>leveraged</b> bull ETF fund might for example attempt to achieve daily returns that are 2x or 3x more pronounced than the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S 500. A <b>leveraged</b> inverse (bear) ETF fund {{on the other hand}} may attempt to achieve returns that are -2x or -3x the daily index return, meaning that it will gain double or triple the loss of the market. <b>Leveraged</b> ETFs require the use of financial engineering techniques, including the use of equity swaps, derivatives and rebalancing, and re-indexing to achieve the desired return. The most common way to construct <b>leveraged</b> ETFs is by trading futures contracts.|$|R
40|$|The {{credit market}} turmoil since mid- 2007 has {{substantially}} affected {{the terms and}} conditions of funding in <b>leveraged</b> finance markets. Rising investor risk aversion, growing pressure on bank balance sheets {{and a loss of}} confidence in structured credit products have sharply reduced demand for <b>leveraged</b> loans. The materialisation of warehouse risks from failed <b>leveraged</b> loan syndications contributed to unwanted expansion of bank balance sheets and has affected credit supply. The knock-on effects from deteriorating conditions in <b>leveraged</b> loan markets have also affected private equity financing. Against the background of these developments, the working group report on private equity and <b>leveraged</b> finance markets under the chairmanship of Henk Brouwer of the Netherlands Bank addresses two broad questions.

5|$|In 1268/69, Baybars took hostage {{some of the}} Bedouin chieftains' sons as <b>leverage</b> {{to ensure}} that their fathers did not defect to the Ilkhanids. That same year, he halved Isa's annual grant of 130,000 silver dirhams. Baybars' actions backfired when Isa made it {{apparent}} that he would defect to the Ilkhanids; the Bedouin tribes' defection to the Ilkhanids was a constant possibility and gave Isa considerable <b>leverage</b> with Baybars. News of this turn of events prompted Baybars to secretly rush to Syria from Egypt on 15 September 1270 and secure Isa's commitment to the Mamluks. He arrived in Hama on 4 October and summoned Isa. During the meeting, Baybars asked Isa whether rumors of his planned defection were true and Isa answered in the affirmative. Afterward, Baybars honored him and agreed to free the hostages, restore Isa's grant, and distribute to the Bedouin tribes large amounts of wheat. As a result, Isa swore an oath of loyalty to Baybars and afterward participated in every Mamluk campaign against the Ilkhanids. The first of these campaigns occurred soon after Isa's meeting with Baybars, when he led raids against the Ilkhanids in Edessa and Harran in southern Anatolia.|$|E
