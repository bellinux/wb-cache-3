Soon {{after the death of}} her father while on vacation in Rome, Martha meets a wealthy civil engineer who sweeps her off her feet. They encounter again at a wedding in her hometown of Constance and marry. However their married life becomes an exercise for her husband to express his sadism and for Martha to endure her masochism. Her husband shows his desire for her violently <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> on her body. He obsessively controls her life, her diet, her taste in music and her interest until she is confined to their house. Martha's initially positive wish to be liked by her oppressive and abusive husband push her to such an extreme that she becomes deranged leading to her own permanent physical paralysis.|$|E

It had for some distance been narrowing rapidly, being only fed by little rills from the surrounding swamp land. Harold had so far looked in vain for some spot where they could land without <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> of their feet. Presently they came to a place where a great tree had fallen across the stream.|$|E
60|$|They {{were riding}} on the margin of turf, {{bordering}} the road on either side, {{so as to avoid}} the dust that lay thick and white upon it; and they held on at an easy canter, till they reached the trees. Then, at Philip's order, they scattered and went at a walk; so as to avoid <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> that could be seen, at once, by anyone following them. A couple of hundred yards farther, they came upon a stream running through a wood. It was but a few inches deep.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability to}} <b>leave</b> <b>marks</b> {{on paper and}} other objects gave {{graphite}} its name, given in 1789 by German mineralogist Abraham Gottlob Werner. It stems from graphein, meaning to write/draw in Ancient Greek.|$|R

If the Indians take it into their heads to search the shore both ways, as likely enough they may do, they will be sure to see them. In the first place let us gather a stock of berries, {{and then we will}} get into the boat again and paddle along under this arcade of boughs till we get to some place where we can land without <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> of our feet. If the Indians find the place where we landed here, they will suppose that we went off again before daylight." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{said little}} else as they followed. He went on before {{them as an}} ugly Fate might have done, and they kept him in view, {{and would have been}} glad enough to lose sight of him. But on he went before them, always at the same distance, and the same rate. Aslant against the hard implacable weather and the rough wind, he was no more to be driven back than hurried forward, but held on like an {{advancing}} Destiny. There came, when they were about midway on their journey, a heavy rush of hail, which in a few minutes pelted the streets clear, and whitened them. It made no difference to him. A man's life being to be taken and the price of it got, the hailstones to arrest the purpose must lie larger and deeper than those. He crashed through them, <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> in the fast-melting slush that were mere shapeless holes; one might have fancied, following, that the very fashion of humanity had departed from his feet.|$|E
60|$|My Lords, the {{prisoner}} {{at the bar}} in the year 1780 sent a petition to the House of Commons complaining of that very chief-justice, Sir Elijah Impey. The House of Commons, who then had some trust in me, as they have some trust still, did order me, along with persons more wise and judicious than myself, several of whom stand near me, to make an inquiry into {{the state of the}} justice of that country. The consequence of that inquiry was, that we began to conceive a very bad opinion both of the complainant and defendant in that business,--that we found the English justice to be, as we thought it, and reported it to the House, a grievance, instead of a redress, to the people of India. I could bring before your Lordships, if I did not spare your patience, whole volumes of reports, whole bodies of evidence, which, in the progress we have made in the course of eight or nine years, brought to my mind such a conviction as will never be torn from my heart but with my life; and I should have no heart that was fit to lodge any honest sentiment, if I departed from my opinion upon that occasion. But when I declare my own firm opinion upon it,--when I declare the reasons that led me to it,--when I mention the long meditation that preceded my founding a judgment upon it, the strict inquiry, the many hours and days spent in consideration, collation, and comparison,--I trust that infirmity which could be actuated by no malice to one party or the other may be excused; I trust that I shall meet with this indulgence, when your Lordships consider, that, {{as far as you know}} me, as far as my public services for many years account for me, I am a man of a slow, laborious, inquisitive temper, that I do seldom leave a pursuit without <b>leaving</b> <b>marks,</b> perhaps of my weakness, but <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> of that labor, and that, in consequence of that labor, I made that affirmation, and thought the nature of the cause obliged me to support and substantiate it. It is true that those who sent me here have sagacity to decide upon the subject in a week; they can in one week discover the errors of my labors for nine years.|$|E
50|$|Overprinting {{refers to}} a {{geological}} process that <b>leaves</b> <b>marks</b> altering the marks of an earlier process. Examples include various phases of deformation of rocks {{in such a way}} that the initial structures are modified, sometimes even beyond recognition.|$|R
50|$|Although kneaded erasers do {{not wear}} away like other erasers, {{they can become}} {{saturated}} and unable to absorb any more graphite or charcoal. In that case a kneaded eraser will actually <b>leave</b> <b>marks</b> on the paper instead of erasing them.|$|R

50|$|Another reason shellac {{fell from}} favour is its {{tendency}} to melt under low heat; for example, hot cups can <b>leave</b> <b>marks</b> on it. However, French polish {{is far more}} forgiving than any other finish in the sense that, unlike lacquers, it can be easily repaired.|$|R
50|$|It {{is grown}} in {{temperate}} climates as an ornamental plant, particularly by alpine gardeners. Some cultivars are available, including 'Nana' (which {{may just be}} a smaller high altitude form), 'Variegata' which has <b>leaves</b> <b>marked</b> with white, and 'Tissington White', which has very pale flowers.|$|R
50|$|During the Middle Ages, scribes {{manually}} copied {{each individual}} page of manuscripts {{to maintain their}} sacred teachings. The scribes would <b>leave</b> <b>marked</b> sections of the page available for artists to insert drawings and decorations.

50|$|A pencil is {{a writing}} {{implement}} or art medium constructed of a narrow, solid pigment core inside a protective casing which prevents the core from being broken and/or from <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> on the user’s hand during use.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{most modern}} [...] "lead pencils" [...] have a nonpoisonous core of greyish-black {{graphite}} mixed with various proportions of clay for consistency, enclosed within an outer wooden casing {{to protect the}} fragile graphite from being snapped apart or from <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> on the user's hand.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Beshty {{exhibited}} large Copper Surrogate works {{made from}} 10 x 5 foot standard industrial sheets of polished copper folded equally in half in various angles.

50|$|Reef {{triggers}} {{are fairly}} aggressive and will generally not tolerate conspecific individuals in their general vicinity; thus {{the fish is}} often found solitary. This is particularly true in captivity. Triggers {{have the ability to}} rapidly alter their coloration. They can fade into a relatively drab appearance when sleeping or demonstrating submission, while their coloration is often the most vivid when the fish are healthy and unthreatened by their surroundings. They have also been known to bite and attack swimmers in their area, sometimes <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> often on the ankle area.|$|E
50|$|The {{cutting of}} grooves in {{the sole of}} the Top-Sider was an {{implementation}} of a process of splitting or siping a shoe sole invented and patented in the 1920s by John Sipe. This process was instrumental in maximizing the traction of the Authentic Original Sperry Top-Sider boat shoe, which was first introduced in 1935. Sperry's first shoe featured a white outsole, which prevented the shoe from <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> on a boat's deck. The Commonwealth Shoe and Leather Co. later partnered with Paul A. Sperry to design a new leather shoe design made with specially tanned leather which later became the Sperry Authentic Original boat shoe.|$|E

5000|$|Whiteboards became commercially {{available}} in the early 1960s, but did not become widely used until 40 years later.

50|$|In India, {{entrance}} examinations are chiefly confined to medicine, engineering, and management. These {{range from the}} BITS Pilani admission test and IIT-JEE where only one in a hundreds can hope to get admission to state level entrances which are many and varied. The stiff competition {{has led to a}} situation where many students neglect their school studies and focus solely on 'entrance coaching' which is time-consuming and expensive. This has led many states to scrap the entrances and base admissions on the school <b>leaving</b> <b>marks</b> which, unfortunately are none too reliable. Experts point out that in a country where many different boards are present common entrances are essential, but application skills rather than cramming should be stressed on. Frequent changes in the pattern of examination are essential since sticking to a 'standard text' or 'standard pattern' alone will favour the coaching industry and the rote-learners.|$|E
50|$|Marks then {{connected}} Ernie Combs, {{member of}} The Brotherhood of Eternal Love, with John Denbigh, {{a man with}} connections in the hashish-producing nation of Nepal. With {{the help of the}} Yakuza, large quantities of the drug would be exported to John F. Kennedy International Airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment, where Don Brown's mob (headed by Carmine Galante) would then take possession of the drugs. A 500-kilo deal was set up and executed on 4 July 1975, <b>leaving</b> <b>Marks</b> a wealthy man. Other deals up to 750 kilos followed, and Marks continued to live under assumed names in the United Kingdom. In 1976 he travelled to America, and set up a 1,000-kilo deal between Combs and 'Lebanese Sam' - making himself £300,000 in the process; he continued to regularly set up deals between his various American and Far East connections. In need of a new identity after his alias of Anthony Tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting, in 1978 he bought Donald Nice's passport.|$|E
50|$|Some parasites <b>leave</b> <b>marks</b> or traces (ichnofossils) on host remains, which {{persist in}} the fossil record {{in the absence of}} {{structural}} remains of the parasite. Parasitic ichnofossils include plant remains which exhibit characteristic signs of parasitic insect infestation, such as galls or leaf mines and certain anomalies seen in invertebrate endoskeletal remains.|$|R
50|$|The Fa'ataupati {{is rarely}} {{performed}} alone. This dance {{requires a lot}} of coconut oil rubbed on the skin, as the slapping can sometimes <b>leave</b> <b>marks</b> on one's body.
