5000|$|A wet <b>liner</b> <b>cylinder</b> block {{features}} cylinder {{walls that}} are entirely removable, which {{fit into the}} block by means of special gaskets. They {{are referred to as}} [...] "wet liners" [...] because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a sleeve. Wet liner designs are popular with European manufacturers, most notably Renault and Peugeot, who continue to use them to the present. Dry liner designs use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain [...] "dry" [...] on their outside, surrounded by the block's material. With either wet or dry liner designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself; but in reality, they are difficult to remove and install, and for many applications (such as most late-model cars and trucks), an engine will never undergo such a procedure in its working lifespan. It is likelier to be scrapped, with new equipment—engine or entire vehicle—replacing it. This is sometimes rightfully disparaged as a symptom of a throw-away society, but on the other hand, it is actually sometimes more cost-efficient and even environmentally protective to recycle machinery and build new instances with efficient manufacturing processes (and superior machine performance and emission control) than it is to overvalue old machinery and craft production.|$|E

40|$|Previous work {{of authors}} {{indicated}} the wear of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> in marine engines of RNLI lifeboats {{due to the}} intense lubricant degradation identified by inductively coupled plasma and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy techniques. In this paper, further analysis carried out to evaluate the effects of lubricant degradation on the actual <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> installed in the Trent Class Lifeboat engines is presented. Surface characterisation of actual <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner’s</b> bore surface showed maximum wear near the top dead centre region compared to rest of the piston stroke. Wear in this region of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> surface is controlled primarily by the protective film forming anti-wear additives in the lubricant which limit the direct surface contact between the piston rings and <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner.</b> The condition of zinc dialkyldithiophosphates anti-wear additives was analysed using the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Tribology analysis was conducted to evaluate the tribological and boundary film forming performance of zinc dialkyldithiophosphates additives by simulating cylinder liner–piston ring contact near the top dead centre. To further understand the wear mechanisms of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner,</b> wear debris analysis (Analytical Ferrography) of lubricant samples was performed. Results revealed the depletion of phosphorus containing zinc dialkyldithiophosphates anti-wear additives {{as a function of}} the lubricant’s duty cycle within the marine engines and its effect on the tribological and boundary film forming performance of lubricants. Wear debris analysis showed the generation of ferrous debris potentially from the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners</b> as a result of reduced anti-wear protection from the depleted zinc dialkyldithiophosphates additives during the tribological contact with piston rings and piston skirt region. These findings are useful to understand the lubricant degradation mechanisms which affect the functionality of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liners,</b> therefore allowing to plan the engine maintenance strategies...|$|R
