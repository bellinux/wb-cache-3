40|$|AbstractObjectiveProviding {{sufficient}} {{posterior palatal seal}} (PPS) of a {{maxillary denture}} is necessary for retention. This research was designed to estimate the arbitrary <b>scraping</b> <b>method</b> used for establishing the PPS. Methods and materialEight complete edentulous patients were selected. They received conventional complete dentures by using a <b>scraping</b> <b>method</b> for establishing the PPS. The posterior retention of the maxillary dentures was measured, the postpalatal area for each patient was visually estimated, and smears were made from the postpalatal areas at insertion appointment, 7, 30, and 90 days after denture placement. ResultThe study revealed that the posterior retention of the maxillary dentures did not change during the stages of the study, and the epithelium of the postpalatal area converted gradually to a keratinized one. ConclusionIt is concluded that the <b>scraping</b> <b>method</b> used for establishing the PPS is an effective and safe technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} and analytical investigation conducted into {{efficacy of the}} <b>scraping</b> shear-test <b>method</b> in estimating the shearing adhesive strength of a thermally sprayed coating. It {{was found that the}} critical average shear stress, the apparent failure strength of WC-Co thermal spray coating, depends on both the dimensions of the test piece and the loading position around the interface between the coating and the substrate. More specifically, the apparent critical shear stress decreased as the height and width of the test piece increased. In addition, the apparent critical shear stress increased with increasing coating thickness and with decreasing loading point distance measured from the interface. Consequently, the real adhesive strength of thermally sprayed coating could not be ascertained from these experimental results. Furthermore, most of the failure initiation points were inside the coating, as opposed to at the interface. This fact means that the results of the tests do not indicate the interfacial adhesive strength, but rather the shear strength of the coating. Three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analysis showed that the distributions of the shearing stress at the loading points were virtually the same at failure, regardless of the dimensions of the test piece. These results suggest that the <b>scraping</b> test <b>method</b> needs a corresponding numerical analysis of the failure mode in order to produce reliable results and is not necessarily able to estimate the interfacial adhesive strength of thermally sprayed coating...|$|R

To better understand such diversity, an ecomorphological approach {{was investigated in}} the trophic morphology of eight species of Pomacentridae (Chromis acares, C. margaritifer, Dascyllus aruanus, D. flavicaudus, Pomacentrus pavo, Plectroglyphidodon johnstonianus, Pl. lacrymatus and Stegastes nigricans) belonging to different trophic guilds (zooplankton, algal, coral polyp feeders and omnivores). Geometric morphometrics were used to quantify size and shape variations in four skeletal units: (1) neurocranium, (2) suspensorium and opercle, (3) mandible and (4) premaxilla. This method allowed us to reveal shape and size differences correlated to functional diversity both within and between trophic guilds. Among zooplanktivores, C. margaritifer, D. aruanus and D. flavicaudus have a high and long supraoccipital crest, short mandibles forming a small mouth and high suspensoria and opercles. These three species can {{be considered to be}} suction feeders. In the same guild, C. acares shows opposite characteristics (long and thin mandibles, lengthened neurocranium and suspensorium) and can be considered as a ram feeder. Among herbivores and corallivores, the two species of Plectroglyphidodon and S. nigricans can be considered as grazers. Differences in skeletal shape are mainly related to improving the robustness of some skeletal parts (broad hyomandibular, short and high mandibles). The shapes of P. pavo, which feeds largely on algae, strongly differ from that of the other three grazers exhibiting similar morphological characteristics to C. acares (e. g., long and shallow suspensorium, lengthened neurocranium). This highlights likely differences concerning cutting or <b>scraping</b> <b>method.</b> Finally, no strong correlations exist between size and shapes in the eight studied species.

40|$|Thesis (M. S. F. S.) There is {{need for}} further {{development}} of cellular collection techniques {{in the field of}} forensic science. Currently, forensic analysts are limited to the use of swabs, taping, cutting, and <b>scraping</b> <b>methods</b> to collect cellular material. Each of these methods has its own benefits and drawbacks, however, none of them result in 100 % recovery of the cells. The Microbial Vacuum system (M-Vac®), developed by MSI, is a liquid based cellular collection system that was originally developed to collect microbes in the food-processing industry from various surfaces. This research represents a detailed study into the feasibility of utilizing the M-Vac® system for forensic purposes. Specifically, the phosphate buffer used with the M-Vac® was tested to confirm that it does not have a detrimental effect on cellular retrieval. Further, the ability of the M-Vac® to collect cellular material from a variety of substrates was tested. It was determined the M-Vac® can successfully collect both blood and semen from tile, denim, carpet, and brick materials in sufficient quantity for downstream PCR analysis. Additionally, examination into whether DNA was dispersed during collection due to the significant force of impact of the liquid striking the surface was conducted. Specifically, areas surrounding the sample collection region were swabbed after collection with the M-Vac® and tested. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that DNA was retrieved up to 4 inches away from the collection area. This indicates that the M-Vac® system is a viable cell collection technique for forensic purposes, but only for samples which are isolated (i. e. where there is not another probative sample adjacent to it). If there are two probative samples within the same vicinity, then swabbing or taping is the recommended method of collection...|$|R

Results: From the 1020 cases suspected of {{cutaneous leishmaniasis}} (450 males and 570 females, comprising 44. 1 % and 55. 9 % of them, respectively), in 615 patients (60. 3 %) the amastigote form of parasites were found, of them 290 patients (47. 2 %) were males and 325 patients (52. 8 %) were females, showing no significant difference (P value= 0. 22). The most common location of the lesion was hand (In 148 patients or 24 % of cases), followed by face, forearm, foot, arm, and trunk. In 394 patients (64 %) there was a single ulcer, and 221 cases (36 %) had more than one lesion, including a patient with 16 lesions. The most commonly affected age groups were 10 - 19 years (23. 5 %) and 20 - 29 years (21. 5 %). Also it was shown that the most common areas of residence in patients (in 155 cases, or 25. 2 %) was in the Imam Khomeini street (Hazira and Ghale Asadan areas) of Yazd city, where there are many ancient houses located on destroyed water channels and the resident people are in a low socioeconomic status. Conclusion: Considering the high (60. 3 %) positivity rate of leishmaniasis in referred cases from the physicians, it seems necessary to raise the clinical index of suspicion in cutaneous ulcers. It can also be suggested that health system officials pay more attention to detection of vectors and reservoirs of leishmania, in addition to educating the people at risk, for recognition of cutaneous leishmaniasis and its ways of control...|$|R
40|$|The {{conversion}} of geothermal energy into usable electrical power {{has become increasingly}} important to the overall national energy needs. A major area of technical interest which has resulted from the initial development of geothermal power plants is the scale formation developed in the facility pipes and related components. This scale formation {{is due to the}} concentration of minerals in the geothermal water and steam. The current state-of-technology utilized for descaling consists of a combination of sandblasting, water blasting, acid soaking and <b>scraping.</b> These cleaning <b>methods,</b> used individually or collectively, do not provide an acceptable descaling operation due to excessive facility downtime and cost...|$|R
40|$|Expression of {{the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus tat-encoded protein (Tat) is required for virus replication. A genetic approach was used to facilitate the purification of biologically active Tat. A recombinant Tat protein containing a stretch of six histidine residues and a protease cleavage site was engineered and purified to greater than 95 % homogeneity in a single step by immobilized metal-ion chromatography with a special affinity resin that has selectivity for proteins with neighboring histidine residues. A modified <b>scrape</b> loading <b>method</b> for introduction of protein into cell monolayers was used {{to demonstrate that the}} purified Tat retained biological activity. Tat function was completely blocked in the presence of transcription inhibitors, which demonstrates the requirement of ongoing mRNA synthesis for trans-activation. These studies indicate that the mechanism of trans-activation is unlikely to involve a direct action of Tat on mRNA stability, transport, or translation and provides the basis for a rapid assay {{that can be used to}} identify inhibitors of trans-activation. The methods described herein should be useful for the functional analysis of other proteins that do not confer activity through a receptor-mediated pathway...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{demonstrate}} that {{determination of the}} depth of cure of resin-based composites needs {{to take into account}} the depth at which the transition between glassy and rubbery states of the resin matrix occurs. METHODS: A commercially available nano-hybrid composite (Grandio) in a thick layer was light cured from one side for 10 or 40 s. Samples were analyzed by Vickers indentation, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, electron paramagnetic imaging and differential scanning calorimetry to measure the evolution of the following properties with depth: microhardness, degree of conversion, elastic modulus of the resin matrix, trapped free radical concentration and glass transition temperature. These measurements were compared to the composite thickness remaining after scraping off the uncured, soft composite. RESULTS: There was a progressive decrease in the degree of conversion and microhardness with depth as both properties still exhibited 80 % of their upper surface values at 4 and 3. 8 mm, respectively, for 10 s samples, and 5. 6 and 4. 8 mm, respectively, for 40 s samples. In contrast, there was a rapid decrease in elastic modulus at around 2. 4 mm for the 10 s samples and 3. 0 mm for the 40 s samples. A similar decrease was observed for concentrations of propagating radicals at 2 mm, but not for concentrations of allylic radicals, which decreased progressively. Whereas the upper composite layers presented a glass transition temperature - for 10 s, 55 °C (± 4) at 1 mm, 56. 3 °C (± 2. 3) at 2 mm; for 40 s, 62. 3 °C (± 0. 6) at 1 mm, 62 °C (± 1) at 2 mm, 62 °C (± 1. 7) at 3 mm - the deeper layers did not display any glass transition. The thickness remaining after scraping off the soft composite was 7. 01 (± 0. 07 mm) for 10 s samples and 9. 48 (± 0. 22 mm) for 40 s samples. SIGNIFICANCE: Appropriate methods show that the organic matrix of resin-based composite shifts from a glassy to a gel state at a certain depth. Hence, we propose a new definition for the "depth of cure" as the depth at which the resin matrix switches from a glassy to a rubbery state. Properties currently used to evaluate depth of cure (microhardness, degree of conversion or <b>scraping</b> <b>methods)</b> fail to detect this transition, which results in overestimation of the depth of cure...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple method for loading exogenous macromolecules into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells adherent to tissue culture dishes. Culture medium {{was replaced with}} {{a thin layer of}} fluorescently labeled macromolecules, the cells were harvested from the substrate by scraping with a rubber policeman, transferred immediately to ice cold media, washed, and then replated for culture. We refer to the method as "scrape-loading. " Viability of cells was 50 - 60 % immediately after scrape-loading and was 90 % for those cells remaining after 24 h of culture. About 40 % of adherent, well-spread fibroblasts contained fluorescent molecules 18 h after scrape-loading of labeled dextrans, ovalbumin, or immunoglobulin-G. On average, 10 (7) dextran molecules (70, 000 -mol wt) were incorporated into each fibroblast by scrape- loading in 10 mg/ml dextran. The extent of loading depended on the concentration and molecular weight of the dextrans used. A fluorescent analog of actin could also be loaded into fibroblasts where it labeled stress fibers. HeLa cells, a macrophage-like cell line, 1774 A. 1, and human neutrophils were all successfully loaded with dextran by <b>scraping.</b> The <b>method</b> of scrape-loading should be applicable to a broad range of adherent cell types, and useful for loading of diverse kinds of macromolecules...|$|R
