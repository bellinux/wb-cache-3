50|$|Moving {{the front}} {{standard}} {{left or right}} from its normal position is called <b>lens</b> <b>shift,</b> or simply shift. This movement is similar to rise and fall, but moves the image horizontally rather than vertically. One use for shift is to remove {{the image of the}} camera from the final image when photographing a reflective surface.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{projectors}} {{keystone correction}} technology is performed digitally (rather than optically) via the internal (LCD) panels or (DLP) mirrors of the projector, {{depending on the}} technology used. Thus, when applying keystone correction to an image, the number of individual pixels used is reduced, lowering the resolution and thus degrading {{the quality of the}} image projected. Home theater enthusiasts would argue that keystoning should not be used because of the impact it has on image quality. However, it is a useful technology in cases where the projector cannot be mounted {{directly in front of the}} screen, or on projectors utilizing <b>lens</b> <b>shift</b> technology where the projector must be mounted outside the frame of the screen.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an electromechanical {{model for the}} operation of a voice coil motor in a mobile phone camera, {{with the aim of}} optimizing how a lens can be moved to a desired focusing motion. Although a methodology is developed for optimizing <b>lens</b> <b>shift,</b> there is some concern about the experimentally-determined model parameters that are at our disposal. Central to the model is the value of the estimated magnetic force constant, Kf: its value determines how far it is actually possible to move lens, but it appears that, from the value given, it would not be possible to shift the lens through the displacements desired. Furthermore, earlier experiments have also estimated the value of the back EMF constant, Kg, to be roughly five times greater than Kf, even though we present two theoretical arguments that show that Kf = Kg: a conclusion supported by readily-available manufacturers’ data...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} efficacy of Artisan iris-clip intraocular lens(IOL) implantation on cataract {{with a wide}} range of lens dislocation. METHODS: Twenty-four hospital patients(28 eyes) of cataract with lens subluxation by trauma(20 patients, 20 eyes) and Marfan's syndrome(4 patients, 8 eyes) during May 2007 to December 2011 were selected. All of them underwent phacoemulsification or an anterior vitrectomy and Artisan iris-clip IOL implantation at stage Ⅰ. Postoperative visual acuity, corneal endothelial cell count, intraocular lens position and postoperative complications were observed. Follow-up time was 6 mo. RESULTS:Compared with the preoperative, postoperative best corrected visual acuity improved to varying degrees, visual acuity of 0. 1 - 0. 5 was in 20 eyes, 0. 5 - 1. 0 in 8 eyes. After followed up 1 - 6 mo, no artificial <b>lens</b> <b>shift,</b> iris inflammation, iris atrophy and corneal decompensation and other complications were observed. CONCLUSION: Cataract surgery {{with a wide range}} of lens dislocation is difficult, but as long as surgeons who have a wealth of clinical experience and superb skills, still can carry out phacoemulsification surgery or anterior vitrectomy and Artisan iris-clip IOL implantation and obtain a better outcome...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the predictability of <b>lens</b> <b>shift</b> induced by pilocarpine (LSPilo) on {{the outcomes of}} accommodating intraocular lens (Acc-IOL) implantation. Methods. Twenty-four eyes of 24 senile cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification and Acc-IOL implantation were enrolled. LSPilo was evaluated with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). At 3 months postoperatively, the best corrected distance visual acuities (BCDVA), distance-corrected near visual acuities (DCNVA), and subjective and objective accommodations were measured. IOL shifts under accommodation stimulus (IOLSAcc) were evaluated with AS-OCT. Results. The mean LSPilo was 112. 29 ± 30. 72 [*]µm. LSPilo {{was not associated with}} any preoperative parameters. The mean IOLSAcc was 130. 46 ± 42. 71 [*]µm. The mean subjective and objective accommodation were 1. 54 ± 0. 39 [*]D and 1. 27 ± 0. 41 [*]D, respectively. The mean postoperative BCDVA and DCNVA (log MAR value) were 0. 22 ± 0. 11 and 0. 24 ± 0. 12, respectively. LSPilo positively correlated with IOLSAcc (r= 0. 541; P= 0. 006), subjective accommodation (r= 0. 412; P= 0. 022), and objective accommodation (r= 0. 466; P= 0. 045), respectively. Conclusion. LSPilo is an independent preoperative parameter associated with the postoperative Acc-IOL mobility and pseudophakic accommodation. It may offer valuable information for ophthalmologists in determining the suitable candidates for Acc-IOL implantation...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{explore the}} {{cataract}} suspensory ligament rupture and artificial lens implantation suture fixation into capsular bag without capsular tension ring(CTR). METHODS: We reviewed 20 cases of 20 cataract suspensory ligament rupture without CTR intraocular lens(IOL) implantation fixation in our department from Jan. 2012 to Dec. 2016. The needle crossed into ocular ciliary sulcus, in the equator {{of the eye}} ball which suspensory ligament rupture from, then the needle crossed out 1. 5 mm away from the angle of sclera. Sutures fixed on the IOL, then the artificial lens implantation in the pouch, carried out {{in accordance with the}} “Z” type suture, or to the beforehand prepared triangle scleral flap. The visual acuity, intraocular pressure, the anterior chamber and the IOL position were measured after operations. RESULTS: All of the postoperative visual acuity improved different level. The postoperative best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) was ≥ 0. 8 in 4 eyes(20 %), 0. 5 - 0. 6 in 7 eyes(35 %), 0. 3 - 0. 4 in 8 eyes(40 %), 0. 1 in 1 eye(5 %) because of the glaucoma optic atrophy. There were 12 cases with mild corneal endothelium edema, 4 cases exudation membrane in the pupil area, 2 cases hyphema, all of which recovered after treatment. There were 2 eyes with vitreous prolapse in the pupil, 1 case appeared mild IOL center deviation and no special treatment for the vision did not be involved. Followed up for 6 mo, displaced stitches or artificial <b>lens</b> <b>shift</b> did not occur. CONCLUSION: Without CTR, the IOL implantation and suture fixation in capsular bag during cataract surgery is a surgical method for basic-level hospitals...|$|E

50|$|In Marfan syndrome, {{the health}} of the eye can be {{affected}} in many ways but the principal change is partial lens dislocation, where the <b>lens</b> is <b>shifted</b> out of its normal position. This occurs because of weakness in the ciliary zonules, the connective tissue strands which suspend the lens within the eye. The mutations responsible for Marfan syndrome weaken the zonules and cause them to stretch. The inferior zonules are most frequently stretched resulting in the <b>lens</b> <b>shifting</b> upwards and outwards but it can shift in other directions as well. Nearsightedness and blurred vision are common, but farsightedness can also result particularly if the lens is highly subluxated. Subluxation (partial dislocation) of the lens can be detected clinically in 80% of patients by the use of a slit-lamp biomicroscope. If the lens subluxation is subtle then imaging with high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy might be used.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{visual system}} {{continuously}} adapts to the environment, {{allowing it to}} perform optimally in a changing visual world. One large change occurs every time one takes off or puts {{on a pair of}} spectacles. It would be advantageous for the visual system to learn to adapt particularly rapidly to such large, commonly occurring events, but whether it can do so remains unknown. Here, we tested whether people who routinely wear spectacles with colored lenses increase how rapidly they adapt to the color <b>shifts</b> their <b>lenses</b> produce. Adaptation to a global color shift causes the appearance of a test color to change. We measured changes in the color that appeared “unique yellow”, that is neither reddish nor greenish, as subjects donned and removed their spectacles. Nine habitual wearers and nine age-matched control subjects judged the color of a small monochromatic test light presented with a large, uniform, whitish surround every 5 s. Red <b>lenses</b> <b>shifted</b> unique yellow to more reddish colors (longer wavelengths), and greenish <b>lenses</b> <b>shifted</b> it to more greenish colors (shorter wavelengths), consistent with adaptation “normalizing” the appearance of the world. In controls, the time course of this adaptation contained a large, rapid component and a smaller gradual one, in agreement with prior results. Critically, in habitual wearers the rapid component was significantly larger, and the gradual component significantly smaller than in controls. The total amount of adaptation was also larger in habitual wearers than in controls. These data suggest strongly that the visual system adapts with increasing rapidity and strength as environments are encountered repeatedly over time. An additional unexpected finding was that baseline unique yellow shifted in a direction opposite to that produced by the habitually worn lenses. Overall, our results represent one of the first formal reports that adjusting to putting on or taking off spectacles becomes easier over time, and may have important implications for clinical management...|$|R

40|$|In the United States, {{family law}} norms and {{childcare}} policy have long reflected {{the view that}} childcare is a private, family matter. But childcare has crossed the private-public divide. In the absence of parents at home providing care, a substantial childcare market has emerged. And that market is failing.

This Article confronts the problem on its own terms, using economic analysis to diagnose our childcare crisis as a market failure, and makes the case for more active and explicit government intervention in the childcare market.

40|$|It {{would be}} {{valuable}} to consumer research to increase understanding of marginalized communities and their consumption experiences. This paper advances postcolonial analysis as useful in this respect. A review of postcolonialism shows {{a perspective that}} encompasses {{the experience of the}} subordinated and marginalized. Hybridity, an alternative version, the self/other divide and power of both the colonizing and colonized positions are key concepts in this <b>lens.</b> <b>Shifting</b> from the dominating view of imperialism, a postcolonial oeuvre offers a nuanced stance that gives voice to the history of the Other and recognition to their stories. Variations within this stream of theory are drawn out and the key aim {{of this paper is to}} explicate the value of the postcolonial view to consumer research. To this end two illustrative case studies of postcolonial African experience are offered: one French and one American. Sneaker consumption in African‐American street culture traces themes of social alienation, self‐identity, criminality and fanatical consumption through the acquisition of sneakers. This experience is contrasted with the experience of postcolonial African communities in France who use other forms of consumption to define their street identity. We conclude that a more nuanced reading of sneaker consumption is available through postcolonialism shedding new light on interpreting symbolic consumption, meaning making and identity expression in traditionally marginalized groups...|$|R
40|$|The Burden of Gravity, {{a poetry}} collection, explores the fraught history of Woodlands School, a former {{institution}} in New Westminster, British Columbia.

40|$|Purpose – This article aims {{to add to}} {{the growing}} number of {{critical}} empirical studies and to reflect on the process of conducting this type of research, thereby addressing the lack of exemplars for those engaged with critical empirical information systems research. Design/methodology/approach – Applies the critical lens to a multi-year examination of variation in the career narratives of women in the American IT labor force. While an interpretive epistemology was initially chosen for this research project, over time, analysis of interview data took on an increasingly critical orientation. This, in turn, influenced subsequent fieldwork to become critical in nature. Findings – One theoretical contribution is highlighting the role of power dynamics in understanding what sits beneath the surface of observations about these women’s experiences in the IT workforce. The second theoretical contribution is helping to shift the focus away from predominantly essentialist theories that dichotomize men and women and toward a recognition of the diversity among women in the IT field. Research limitations/implications – Future research should include additional critical empirical studies of women in the IT field in other countries. Practical implications – This research project can serve as a useful example for other critical IS researchers about to embark on empirical fieldwork. Originality/value – This paper provides a concrete illustration {{of the way in which}} empirical research is altered as the epistemological <b>lens</b> <b>shifts</b> from interpretivist to critical...|$|R
