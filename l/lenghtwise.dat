40|$|In {{order to}} define a global hydrogeological model of the Friuli {{alluvial}} plain, the present work investigates {{the relationships between the}} regional unconfined and multilayered aquifer systems integrating geological, hydrogeological, geochemical and isotope data. The Neogenic and Quaternary mostly clastic sediments of both continental and marine origin, locally more than 1000 meters thick, gave rise to a sequence of megafan-shaped progradated sedimentary bodies, both <b>lenghtwise</b> and crosswise granulometrically differentiated. The geometry of the relating saturated zone has been reconstructed by both deterministic and stochastic methods. By means of the isophreatic map of the High Plain (APF), the active recharge to the confined system of the Low Plain (BPF) has been calculated. The groundwater flow conditioning by means of the regional tecto-dynamics is showed. The hydrogeological model, integrated with hydrogeochemical and isotope data collected from wells, springs and rivers, allowed some considerations about recharge provenience and hydraulic connection within the confined aquifer system...|$|E
40|$|This {{blueprint}} respects and derives {{benefit from}} the steep land, smoothly dividing two different worlds – {{the city and the}} landscape. The <b>lenghtwise</b> mass, presenting terraced estate, closes the gardens of current houses on Pastviny street. It creates imaginary entry into a free landscape. There are detached houses ascending freely towards the woods. They are rotated in the line with centerlines, which are made by current build-up area. The whole concept of terraced houses is based on the motif of bay, which also appears in apartment blocks. It is inserted in the space between houses, therefore there is a view from the first floors into the garden through a glassed-in dining room. The contact among the street, house and garden is made. The complex consists of six detached apartment blocks with fifty five flats and shared underground parking lot. Apartment blocks are divided into two hives, counting three blocks each. Almost every flat has at least one private outdoor space – front garden, loggia or terrace. The main idea behind this blueprint is the turning of the entry doors towards the common outdoor area, where people could meet. All the blocks could interact with each other thanks to this area. Loggias, bow-windows and terraces placed vertically on exterior of the blocks allow the view of surrounding landscape. These components appear couple of times in this complex and they make the whole mass more plastic. They enliven it. The surrounding of the apartment blocks is filled with green vegetation. The green vegetation and front gardens concur...|$|E
40|$|Foi estudada a taxa de lixiviação dos herbicidas trifluralin. {{atrazine}} e bromacil em três la. tossolos de texturas diferentes, utilizando-se as doses normais de uso de cada um. Foram utilizadas colunas não deformadas de cada solo e, após a percolação de precipitação simulada de 110 ou 220 mm, semearam-se capim-arroz (Echinochloa cruz-galli (L.) Beauv.) e alface (Lactuca sativa L. var. La Chaume) longitudinalmente nas metades de cada uma. A lixiviação dos herbicidas foi avaliada aos 21 e 33 dias após a semeação. Com indicação dada pelo capim-arroz verificou-se que o trifluralin apresentou lixiviação pequena em quantidade e extensão no perfil, sendo semelhante nos três solos. No solo argiloso e areno-argiloso, com 110 ou 220 mm de chuva, o bromacil apresentou lixiviação bem maior que o atrazine. O bioensaio indicou que as concentrações de bromacil e de atrazine decresciam com a profundidade do perfil. As taxas de lixiviação dos herbicidas foram, de modo geral, proporcionais à sua solubilidade. The {{leaching rate}} of trifluralin, atrazine and bromacil in three latossols, with different textures, applying normal dosages of each. was studied. Intact columns of each soil were used and simula ted precip itations of 110 or 220 mm of water, Echinochloa cruz-galli L. Beauv. and Lactuca sativa cv. La Chaume were sown <b>lenghtwise</b> {{in the two}} halves of each colum. The leaching rate of the herbic ides was evaluated 21 and 23 days after seedling. With the indication given by E. cruz_galli it was verified that trifluralin showed very little leaching in the soil prof ile, and was similar in the three soils. In the clay and sandy-clay soils with 110 or 220 mm of rain, bromacil showed higher leaching rate than atrazine. In the loamy soil both herbicides showed simila r leaching due to the presence of caulinite, with has a low adsorbing capacity for atrazine. The bio-assay indicated that the bromacil and atrazine concentrations diminished with the profile depth. In general the leaching rates of the hebicides were proporcional to their solubilities...|$|E
40|$|Avaliou-se o comportamento de dezesseis introduções, consideradas resistentes à broca no Sul dos E. U. A., e quatro clones 'IAC' de cana-de-açúcar em relação ao ataque de Diatraea saccharalis (Fabr., 1794) (Lepidoptera:Pyralidae) em ensaio delineado em blocos ao acaso, com dez repetições, instalado na Estação Experimental de Ribeirão Preto, do Instituto Agronômico. As introduções utilizadas foram CP 57 - 614, CP 62 - 258, CP 66 - 491, CP 70 - 321, CP 70 - 330, CP 71 - 321, Tainan 2 n = 96, US 74 - 103, TJS 76 - 9, US- 76 - 14, US 76 - 15, US 76 - 20, US 76 - 22, TJS 76 - 25, US 76 - 26 e US 76 - 34 e, os clones, 'IAC 50 - 134 ', 'IAC 52 - 150 ', 'IAC 71 - 1001 ' e 'IAC 1006 '. Decorrido um ano do plantio, efetuado em setembro de 1979, procedeu-se à avaliação. Vinte colmos por parcela foram cortados e, individualmente, mediu-se o diâmetro e contaram-se os internódios sadios e broqueados. A partir desses dados, calcularam-se a infestação e a sua intensidade. Os dois índices evidenciaram o mais baixo ataque de D. saccharalis na introdução Tainan 2 n = 96, cujo diâmetro médio foi l, 03 cm, e o ataque mais alto no {{cultivar}} IAC 52 - 150, de diâmetro médio 2, 83 cm. Correlacionando-se o diâmetro com os índices de infestação nos vinte clones, verificou-se que a infestação é diretamente proporcional ao diâmetro (r² = 0, 91) e, a intensidade, ao quadrado do diâmetro (r² 0, 82). No Brasil, a possibilidade de utilização desse germo-plasma introduzido dos E. U. A. como fonte de resistência a D. saccharalis é incerta, em face da associação observada entre infestação e diâmetro das plantas. Sixteen clones of sugarcane {{resistant to}} the sugarcane borer, D. saccharalis in Houma, Louisiana, USA, were introduced and tested in Brazil against the same insect species. The sixteen introduced germplasm were CP 57 - 614, CP 62 - 258, CP 66 - 491, CP 70 - 321, CP 70 - 330, CP 71 - 321, Tainan 2 n = 96, US 74 - 103, US 76 - 9, US 76 - 14, US 76 - 15, US 76 - 20, US 76 - 22, US 76 - 25, US 76 - 26 e US 76 - 34. These sixteen introductions plus 4 IAC clones, namely 'IAC 50 - 134 ', 'IAC 52 - 150 ', 'IAC 71 - 1001 ' and 'IAC 1006 ', were planted on September 26, 1979, in Ribeirão Preto, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The experimental design used was a complete randomized block with 20 treatments and 10 replications. Evaluation was made on September 9, 1980. Twenty culms per plot were split <b>lenghtwise</b> and the numbers of internodes bored and not bored were registered. The variation of infestation among the clones was highly correlated with {{the diameter of the}} plants. The least infested germplasm was Tainan 2 n = 96 with a culm diameter of 1. 03 cm. The most infested, IAC 52 - 150 had a diameter of 2. 83 cm. The infestation (percentage of culms infested) was linearly correlated with the diameter (r² = 0. 91) and the intensity of infestation (percentage of internodes infested) was linearly correlated with the square of the diameter (r² = 0. 82). These results show the possibility of the use of thinner less infested clones introduced from USA as source of resistance to the sugarcane borer in Brazilian breeding programs...|$|E
