50|$|<b>Local</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> a total {{acceptance}} of French law arose {{because some of}} Bismarck's reforms included strong protections for civil and social rights.

40|$|Nickel-rich Ni-Ti alloys are {{emerging}} candidate materials for aerospace bearing applications. These alloys exhibit a unique combination of physical, chemical, and tribological properties {{that are highly}} relevant to challenging aerospace bearings and other mechanical components. Despite being made solely from metals, Ni-Ti alloys are classified as intermetallics with properties akin to both metals and ceramics. For instance, like metals, they are electrically conductive {{but they tend to}} be brittle like ceramics. When properly processed, they have high hardness, low elastic modulus and an extensive elastic deformation range that imparts extraordinarily high resilience and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>denting.</b> New alloy compositions enable simpler thermal processing and machining and intensive microstructural analyses have helped elucidate the materials science mechanisms governing hardness. In this paper, the application of state-of-art in NiTi alloys for aerospace bearings and mechanical components is explored. In addition to reviewing future trends and remaining challenges, the unique approaches and methods of tailoring bearing design to accommodate NiTis unique properties is discussed...|$|R
