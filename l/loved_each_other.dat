5|$|Eleanor of Castile {{had died}} on 28November 1290. Uncommon for such marriages of the period, the couple <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Moreover, like his father, Edward was very {{devoted to his}} wife and was {{faithful}} to her throughout their married lives — a rarity among monarchs of the time. He was deeply affected by her death. He displayed his grief by erecting twelve so-called Eleanor crosses, one at each place where her funeral cortège stopped for the night. As part of the peace accord between England and France in 1294, it was agreed that Edward should marry Philip IV's half-sister Margaret, but the marriage was delayed by the outbreak of war.|$|E

25|$|In {{his five}} decades of research, he {{practices}} a Franciscan philosophy {{of knowledge in}} action. He was not content to speculate about these new peoples, but met with, interviewed and interpreted them and their worldview {{as an expression of}} his faith. While others – in Europe and New Spain – were debating whether or not the indigenous peoples were human and had souls, Sahagún was interviewing them, seeking to understand who they were, how they <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> what they believed, and how they made sense of the world. He fell in love with their culture. Even as he expressed disgust at their continuing practice of human sacrifice and their idolatries, he spent five decades investigating Aztec culture.|$|E

500|$|Burton biographer Ken Hanke {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of Dolores Fuller. [...] "The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman," [...] Hanke said, [...] "while Parker's performance presents her {{as a kind of}} sitcom moron for {{the first part of the}} film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes." [...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. I wished they could have made it a deeper love story, because we really <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> We strove to find investors together, I worked so hard to support Ed and I." ...|$|E
500|$|A Journey covers Blair's time {{as leader}} of the Labour Party and then British Prime Minister {{following}} his party's victory at the 1997 general election. His tenure as Labour leader begins in 1994 following the death of his predecessor, John Smith, an event Blair claims to have had a premonition about a month before Smith died. Blair believes he will succeed Smith as Labour leader rather than Gordon Brown, who is a strong contender for the job. Blair and Brown subsequently reach an agreement whereby Brown will not run against Blair for the position, and will succeed him later. But it leads to a difficult working relationship, which is discussed at length. He likens them both to [...] "a couple who <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> arguing over whose career should come first." [...] To him, Brown is a [...] "strange guy" [...] with [...] "zero" [...] emotional intelligence.|$|E
500|$|On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a {{modestly}} successful {{cloth and}} silk merchant, becoming {{his third wife}} at age15. Lisa's dowry was 170florins and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, {{a sign that the}} Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer than her own. Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an [...] "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until 5March 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.|$|E

Donovan added that Scott was [...] "devastated" [...] when he saw Charlene had been injured. At the hospital, Scott gave Charlene the {{friendship}} ring and declared that they would live together. Minogue told Bourne that Charlene was flattered by the gift, while Donovan stated that it proved that they <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and {{were not going to}} break up again.

[...] After learning about the couple's plans to move in together, their friends and neighbours expressed their shock at how serious the couple had become.

Bourne noted that Daphne's shock at the couple's plans was [...] "the start of a major controversy, splitting apart the inhabitants of Ramsay Street." ...|$|E
500|$|Accompanied by her adviser, Neto, Manasa {{descended to}} earth to see human devotees.

She managed to convert people from different walks of life, including the Muslim ruler Hasan, but failed to convert Chand Sadagar [...] Manasa {{wanted to become a}} goddess like Lakshmi or Saraswati. To get there she had to achieve the worship of Chand Sadagar who was extremely adamant and took oath not to worship Manasa. Thus to gain his fear and insecurity, Manasa one by one killed his six sons [...] At last Manasa conspired against two dancers of Indras Court who <b>loved</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> Anirudha and Usha [...] Anirudh had to take birth as Lakhinder, Chand and Sanaka's seventh son. Usha took birth as behula and married him. Manasa killed him but Behula floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand. At last, he yielded by offering a flower to the goddess with his left hand without even looking at her. This gesture made Manasa so happy that she resurrected all of Chand's sons and restored his fame and fortunes. The Mangal kavyas say that after this, the worship of Manasa was popular forever.|$|E
