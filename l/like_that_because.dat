All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name and depicted Leone's own intense {{vision of the}} mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> he wanted the music {{to be an important}} part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.|$|E

When Keating's run-in with the SEC resurfaced in press reports, however, he was dropped from consideration. This dismayed Keating, who subsequently said, [...] "To keep {{people like me}} out of positions <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of yellow journalism, I don't know what good it does." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I see that they are <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E

My eyeteeth were so bad, that even when I closed my mouth they stuck out. I was about a head smaller than the other kids, and they <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it played off Herman's height." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> <b>Because</b> of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|Lupe Fiasco {{has stated}} on MTV's Rap Fix {{as well as}} in various other media that he is a Muslim, and that Islam [...] "plays a part in my life and {{everything}} I do, to a certain extent... I don't like putting my religion out there, I don't like wearing it <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> I don't want people to look at me as the poster child for Islam. I'm not. I don't want them to look at my flaws and be like, 'oh, that's the flaws of Islam'." [...] His mixtape series Fahrenheit 1/15 featured a remix of Kanye West's [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] entitled [...] "Muhammad Walks", which went on to become very popular in the Muslim community. He can be heard using Islamic recitals in [...] "Hurt Me Soul", [...] "Little Weapon", [...] "Hi-Definition" [...] as well as the intro and outro tracks to Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. Most recently, Lupe Fiasco claimed to believe Islam will one day take over the world.|$|E

My teeth were so bad, that even when I closed my mouth they stuck out. I was about a head smaller than the other kids, and they <b>liked</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it played off Herman's height." [...] Living on the East Coast at the time, Patrick commuted to Los Angeles every week during filming of the series, appearing in 70 episodes during The Munsters two-season run from 1964 to 1966.|$|R
500|$|The vocals, handled {{jointly by}} Shields and Butcher, are kept {{relatively}} {{low in the}} mix, and {{are for the most}} part highly pitched. On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album's vocals, he [...] "couldn't tolerate really clear vocals, where you just hear one voice", thus [...] "it had to be more like a sound." [...] Butcher explained her [...] "dreamy, sensual" [...] style vocals, saying, [...] "Often when we do vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing." [...] To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher's voice and reused it as instrumentation. The layered vocals on [...] "When You Sleep" [...] were born out of frustration with trying to get the right take. Shields commented that [...] "The vocals sound <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it became boring and too destructive trying to get the right vocal. So I decided to put all the vocals in. (It had been sung 12 or 13 times)." [...] He explained: ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{many believe}} it was created because of the Silver Jubilee, the band denies it, Paul Cook saying that [...] "It wasn't written {{specifically}} for the Queen's Jubilee. We weren't aware {{of it at the}} time. It wasn't a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone." [...] Johnny Rotten has explained the lyrics as follows: [...] "You don't write 'God Save The Queen' because you hate the English race. You write a song <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> you love them, and you're fed up with them being mistreated." [...] He intended to evoke sympathy for the English working class, and a general resentment towards the monarchy.|$|E

In France you get freedom of action: you can do what you like and nobody bothers, but you must think like {{everybody}} else. In Germany you must do what everybody else does, but you may think as you choose. They're both very good things. I personally prefer freedom of thought.

That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship." [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country, Hitler, in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted.

2500|$|In 2013, Clarkson {{released}} her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red, which to her represented a beginning {{for a second}} phase for her career. In the midst of recording it, she also collaborated with recording artists Robbie Williams, Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood in their respective albums Swings Both Ways (2013), Everlasting (2014) and [...] (2014). In an interview with Billboard magazine, she announced intentions to release a set of pop and country records, {{as well as a}} potential Broadway album, as a follow-up to Wrapped in Red. RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge also revealed in their 2014 mid-year assessment that they were in a process of finding new music and directions for some of their established acts — primarily with Clarkson. Early stages of development for a follow-up studio album began as early as June 2012, with Clarkson commissioning Rodney Jerkins in recording a potential track. She remarked: [...] "We're already working. I'm constantly <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> you never know when you're going to find a song and so we're always working on the next thing." [...] The follow-up album would complete the terms of her recording contract with RCA Records and 19 Recordings, which was signed following her win on the first season of the television competition American Idol in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} design, {{presented to}} the public in 1994, consisted of unadorned glass cases over the theatres, and initially elicited criticisms from the public, including calling it [...] "two copulating aardvarks". Critics also accused that the design is insensitive to Singapore's location and climate as it would have created a greenhouse in the tropical climate of Singapore, but according to DPA director Vikas Gore some form of shading was always intended, and a cladding of aluminium sunshades was added to the final design. [...] The unique architectural design has been said to have an appearance similar to either a durian (a tropical fruit) or the eyes of a fly. Hence, the building is colloquially known to locals as [...] "the big durians".. More than 7,000 triangular aluminium sunshades that cover its two circular glass shell structures looked somewhat like spikes on two halves of the fruit. The structure wasn’t meant to be a durian; it ended up being <b>like</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it seemed to the architects the most interesting way of doing sunshades. They wanted to use glass because the views from Esplanade are beautiful in all directions, but since Singapore is so close to the equator, the structure also had to be protected from the sunshine and heat radiation.|$|E

His wife Deborah and Twins general manager Terry Ryan remained at the hospital with him throughout the stay where he remained unconscious until September 26. During that time, Gardenhire struggled to keep his team focused while all dealt with their feelings for Newman. Minnesota Twins center fielder Torii Hunter said of Newman, [...] "For me, I think it hurt me more than anybody to see him go down <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> this is the guy who pretty much taught me the game, and how to play the game hard." [...] While Newman was away from the team, his jersey, number 62, was hung in the dugout for each game as a salute. On October 4, 2003, after being released from the hospital, Newman threw out the first pitch prior to Game 3 of the Twins American League Divisional Series versus the New York Yankees. Gardenhire waved Newman's jersey to fans and was visibly emotional to have him back on the field with him after his long hospital stay.|$|E
