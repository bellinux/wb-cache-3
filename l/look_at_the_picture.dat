Field Marshal William Slim argued that special forces in general had an overall {{negative}} effect on the prosecution of war by separating the best-trained and most committed troops from the main army. [...] However Sir Robert Thompson, a Chindit who went on to become one of [...] "world's leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency", wrote in his autobiography that [...] "Every time I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of General Slim and his Corps Commanders being knighted by Lord Wavell as Viceroy on the field of battle after Imphal, I see the ghost of Wingate present. He was unquestionably one of the great men of [...] century".|$|E

6000|$|... "That 's true!" [...] cried Fan, as Polly {{paused to}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> which {{appeared}} to regard her with a grave, steady look, which seemed rather to belie her assertions.|$|E
60|$|Her {{father had}} his empty glass in his hand. I saw him set it down, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> {{she was so}} like, put {{his hand to his}} forehead, and shrink back in his elbow-chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pleasanter for you, I am afraid," [...] murmured Hallward, regretfully. [...] "And now good-bye. I {{am sorry}} you won't let me <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> once again. But that can't be helped. I quite {{understand}} what you feel about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Bert <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over Anson's shoulder, but did {{not seem}} to pay much {{attention}} to it.|$|R

60|$|But {{for all he}} said, his eager eye scanned Mr Dombey's downcast face {{none the}} less closely; and then it shot a strange triumphant <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> as {{appealing}} to it to bear witness how he led him on again, and what was coming.|$|E
60|$|Not caring {{to go back}} to the train, I {{entered the}} waiting-room and took in all there was to be seen. At one end of the place was a news stand, and I walked up to this to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> papers that were displayed.|$|E
60|$|Matt profited by the musing {{fit that}} came upon his father, {{to go and}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over the mantel. It was not a new picture; {{but he did not}} feel that he was using his father quite frankly; and he kept looking at it for that reason.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Mapplethorpe: <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures,</b> <b>the</b> first definitive, feature length {{portrait}} of the controversial American artist Robert Mapplethorpe, produced by Otto-Bernstein, premiered at Sundance Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival to rave reviews.

6000|$|She idly <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> Beautiful, <b>the</b> pure women, {{with their}} clear-dropping gowns. Her heart became colder. What did they mean to him? ...|$|R
60|$|Sabatini lit his cigarette, and, leaning {{slightly}} {{against the}} back of a chair, stood with folded arms <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> over <b>the</b> fireplace.|$|R
6000|$|... "This sherry is too potent a {{wine for}} me; it has {{affected}} my brain already," [...] he observed, after a somewhat startled <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> [...] "On returning to Europe, I shall confine {{myself to the}} more delicate vintages of Italy and France, the best of which will not bear transportation." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{two girls}} were {{not wishing to}} see anyone in particular, on this occasion, but merely enjoyed {{watching}} the shifting scenes, {{some of which were}} exceedingly curious and remarkable. Suddenly Dorothy exclaimed: [...] "Why, there's Button-Bright!" [...] and this drew Ozma also to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> for she and Dorothy knew the boy well.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she decided}} to go and <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> The trip would help to relieve her {{loneliness}} and she was eager to see what Jason Jones had really accomplished. The Institute was not far from her hotel; she could walk the distance in a few minutes; so she put on her hat and set out for the exhibition.|$|E
60|$|Corky and I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> then <b>at</b> {{each other}} in an awed way. Jeeves was right. There could be no other title.|$|R
60|$|Taking {{due care}} to dismiss all ideas of Nature from my mind, to begin with, I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> which {{represented}} <b>the</b> Passions first.|$|R
50|$|Mapplethorpe: <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures,</b> {{produced}} by Otto-Bernstein for FMI, received its premiere at Sundance Film Festival in January 2016, followed by <b>the</b> International Premiere <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Film Festival in February, {{and a world}} television premiere on HBO in April.

6000|$|... "Well, yes, I don't {{know but}} I am. I didn't {{think it was}} going to look just that way. Mr. Congdon says blue shadows are under anybody's ears in the light, but I can't see 'em on the Captain, and I do see 'em in the picture; that's what gets me twisted. When I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> I can't see nothin' else." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{simple truth}} is, {{that the moment}} we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> we feel our belief {{of the whole thing}} taken away. There is, visibly, no {{possibility}} of that group ever having existed, in any place, or on any occasion. It is all a mere mythic absurdity, and faded concoction of fringes, muscular arms, and curly heads of Greek philosophers.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I will, {{with all}} my heart, and farther, too. Yes, yes {{we will have a}} snug walk together, and I have {{something}} to tell you as we go along. There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there. Lord! what a boat it is!" [...] taking a last <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> as they began to be in motion.|$|E
60|$|We found Corky near <b>the</b> door, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> {{with one}} hand up in a {{defensive}} sort of way, as if he thought it might swing on him.|$|R
60|$|The second {{falsehood}} was, {{that the}} Pre-Raphaelites did not draw well. This was asserted, {{and could have}} been asserted only by persons who had never <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The American {{documentary}} film, Mapplethorpe: <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures,</b> {{was released}} in 2016. It was directed and executive produced by Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, and produced by Katharina Otto-Bernstein.|$|R
60|$|Clive. I {{have brought}} it for you. It {{is not very}} good. There are always so many petites demoiselles copying that Sasso Ferrato; and they chatter about it so, and hop from one easel to another; and the young artists are always coming to give them advice--so {{that there is no}} getting a good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> But I have brought you the sketch; and am so pleased that you asked for it.|$|E
6000|$|The sculptor, who {{had gone}} back to {{scraping}} the chin of the famous public man on whose bust he was at work, stabbed him to the heart with his modeling-tool, and turned to Ferris and his friend. He slanted his broad red beard for a sidelong <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and said: [...] "I know what you mean, Ferris. It's hard, and it's feeble in some ways and it looks a little too much like experimenting. But it isn't so infernally bad." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{look at the}} {{apparently}} smooth surface of the mountain side, one would never think that the ascent could be a work of such difficulty and danger. Yet, <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of crossing a crevasse, and compare {{the size of the}} figures with the dimensions of the blocks of ice. Madame d'Angeville told me that she was drawn across a crevasse like this, by ropes tied under her arms, by the guides. The depth of some of the crevasses may be conjectured from the fact stated by Agassiz, that the thickest parts of the glaciers are over one thousand feet in depth.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> {{minister}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> A stern expression {{came into}} his gentle blue eyes and he got as near to frowning as {{it was possible for}} him to get.|$|R
6000|$|And then {{he stood}} and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> which was as his child's to him, turned and said, [...] "Well for him that {{he is out of}} all this!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Mapplethorpe: <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pictures</b> was {{nominated}} for two awards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Emmy awards, for [...] "Outstanding Cinematography For A Nonfiction Program" [...] and [...] "Outstanding Documentary or Nonfictional Special".|$|R
