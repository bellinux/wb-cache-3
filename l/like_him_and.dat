5|$|Coach's (Nicholas Colasanto) daughter, Lisa, (Allyce Beasley) {{arrives with}} her fiancé, Roy (Philip Charles MacKenzie), a {{door-to-door}} salesman who {{turns out to}} be abrasive and insensitive. Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, Gandhi pooled {{ideas with}} some Muslim leaders who sought {{religious}} harmony <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> opposed the proposed partition of British India into India and Pakistan. For example, his close friend Badshah Khan {{suggested that they}} should work towards opening Hindu temples for Muslim prayers, and Islamic mosques for Hindu prayers, to bring the two religious groups closer. Gandhi accepted this and began having Muslim prayers read in Hindu temples to play his part, {{but was unable to}} get Hindu prayers read in mosques. The Hindu nationalist groups objected and began confronting Gandhi for this one-sided practice, by shouting and demonstrating inside the Hindu temples, {{in the last years of}} his life.|$|E

5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} years, Porto Alegre turned his {{attention}} to politics, retiring from his military career as a lieutenant general, the second-highest rank in the Imperial Army. He was an affiliate of the Liberal Party at the national level and was elected to the legislature of Rio Grande do Sul. He also founded a provincial party, the Progressive-Liberal Party—a coalition of Liberals <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> some members of the Conservative Party. Porto Alegre later entered the lower house of the Brazilian parliament and was briefly Minister of War. When the Paraguayan War erupted in 1864, he returned to active duty. One of the main Brazilian commanders during the conflict, his participation was marked by important battlefield victories, as well as constant quarrels with his Argentine and Uruguayan allies.|$|E

Libby later falls pregnant and gives birth to Susan and Karl's first grandchild, Ben (Noah Sutherland). Susan almost loses her job as principal when a student reports her for assault; however, the case is later dropped. Susan's nephew Darcy Tyler becomes partner in Karl's surgery and plots to sell the business to a clinic chain. Darcy tells Karl and Susan what he is doing, and Susan is furious with her nephew. Susan's sister, Liz (Christine Keogh), leaves her daughter Elly (Kendell Nunn) with the Kennedys for a brief time; Elly later joins her mother in Sweden. Susan slips on some spilt milk and wakes up with retrograde amnesia. She loses thirty years of her memory and believes she is sixteen and the year is 1972. Susan goes through months of counselling to try and regain her memory. During this time, she tells Karl that she does not <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> she goes missing when she tries to find an old boyfriend. Susan begins having flashbacks and starts to regain her memory. Libby's husband Drew Kirk (Dan Paris) dies and Susan finds it hard to comfort her daughter. Susan grows closer to Karl and he asks her to renew their vows. During the ceremony, Susan's memory returns.|$|E

Kevin becomes interested in Dana when he learns {{she is a}} writer <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> she befriends him {{even though he is}} white and their coworkers judge their relationship. They find they have much in common; both are orphans, both love to write, and both their families disapproved of their aspiration to become writers. They become lovers.|$|E
25|$|The AWA was {{no longer}} the top {{promotion}} after the WWWF rejoined the NWA. The AWA reached new heights, however, after powerhouse wrestler Hulk Hogan gained nationwide attention from starring in Rocky III, and became a solid fan favorite. Despite Hogan being the AWA's top draw, Gagne would not let him be champion, believing technical wrestlers, <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Nick Bockwinkel, should be the focus of a wrestling company. Since founding the AWA, Gagne had built the company off of technical wrestling. Hogan left in 1983, irreparably damaging the AWA.|$|E

Despite this, Shannon calls Brendon {{the next day and}} invites him, Jason, and their friend Melissa to his {{birthday}} party, which Brendon resentfully accepts. When the kids arrive at Shannon's party, they see that no one has arrived. Shannon laments about how his bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> the kids sympathize with the bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party.|$|E

25|$|In January 1962 the {{national}} Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled {{and replaced by}} The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether {{he was in a}} wide shot or a close up. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Richardson {{revealed}} that executive producer Lucy Allan {{was going to}} return Ste to his [...] "bad" [...] ways. Richardson said that Ste had portrayed the whole [...] "bad thing" [...] and mellowed. He felt Ste was emulating fellow character Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), because Ste was [...] "running a restaurant, camping it up <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> talking like him". Allan wanted to change that and see him regain some old habits. These changes did not happen because Allan quit her position soon after.|$|E

[...] Jackman is startled to see that Jekyll looks exactly <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> that he died at around Jackman's current age; and Callendar speculates that he is a descendant of the original Doctor Jekyll, {{except for the fact that}} Doctor Jekyll had died without children.|$|E

He broke into Evans' office, read her files, and asks Michael if he is awake or asleep. However, Gemini says that the world needs people <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Michael; people who can see it sideways. As he takes a flight to Portland, Gemini says that he hopes Michael doesn't wake up and then hangs up.|$|E
500|$|The special has {{received}} positive critical reception. In talking about Resnick {{with regards to}} the special, Baltimore City Paper Baynard Woods wrote that it [...] "combines the traditional kind-of-creepy positivity of the infomercial host with the creepy techno-utopian positivity of a TED Talk's technologist." [...] He ultimately opined that the humor derived from [...] "the disconnect between what Resnick claims—that his avatar is a complete backup of himself—and the reality that {{it is not at all}} <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> is, in fact, extremely limited." [...] Ezra Lefko of What Weekly, another Baltimore-based publication, praised the special. In particular, he expressed his approval of seeing [...] "success and national exposure for these talented artists." [...] Lea McLellan of Mountain Xpress called it [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "a good representation of their bizarre comedic stylings." ...|$|E

Several policemen arrive at the scene and begin to remove the bodies by putting them in wheelbarrows. Meanwhile, Jean Noel is seen running on a desert road. The policemen then begin to dig graves for the corpses. Jean Noel then spots another specimen who looks just <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the two begin to run. They are soon joined by more specimens before arriving at the playground. By chanting at the policemen, the specimens appear to mind control them into dance. Jean Noel continues to run and stops {{when he sees the}} crashed spaceship. The video ends with the band's jackalope logo.|$|E

500|$|Hartmann {{became one}} of only 27 German {{soldiers}} in World War II to receive the Diamonds to his Knight's Cross. Hartmann was summoned to the Führerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze, Adolf Hitler's military headquarters near Rastenburg, to receive the coveted award from Hitler personally. On arrival, {{he was asked to}} surrender his side arm — a security measure caused by the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt on 20 July 1944. Hartmann refused and threatened to decline the Diamonds if he were not trusted to carry his pistol. After consulting Oberst Nicolaus von Below, Hitler's Luftwaffe adjutant, Hartmann was allowed to keep his side arm and accepted the Diamonds. During Hartmann's meeting with Hitler, Hartmann discussed at length the shortcomings of fighter pilot training. Allegedly, Hitler revealed to Hartmann that he believed that, [...] "militarily, the war is lost," [...] and that he wished the Luftwaffe had [...] "more <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Rudel." ...|$|E

In the interview, Minaj said, [...] "We wanted to have geisha themes, samurai themes, stuff like that. I wanted to tell a love story.

[...] The video premiered July 21, 2010 on MTV.com. Actor Michael Jai White portrays Minaj's love interest in the video.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of episode two onwards, {{as part of the}} opening credits, Mr. Bean falls from the sky in a beam of light, accompanied by a choir singing Ecce homo qui est faba ("Behold the man who is a bean"), recorded by Southwark Cathedral Choir in 1990. These opening sequences were initially in black and white in episodes two and three, and were intended by the producers to show his status as an [...] "ordinary man cast into the spotlight". However, later episodes showed Mr. Bean dropping from the night sky in a deserted London street against the backdrop of St Paul's Cathedral. At the end of episodes three and six he is also shown being sucked right back up into the sky in the respective background scenes (black scene in episode 3 and street scene in episode 6). Atkinson has acknowledged that Bean [...] "has a slightly alien aspect to him". In an episode of the animated series, [...] "Double Trouble", the alien aspect of him was used in a storyline, in which he is taken inside a spacecraft with [...] "aliens" [...] who look exactly <b>like</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> even have their own plushy toys. In an obvious homage towards the end, the aliens send him back home in a beam of light and music similar to the opening of the original Mr. Bean series. Whether Bean is an extraterrestrial is not made clear.|$|E
