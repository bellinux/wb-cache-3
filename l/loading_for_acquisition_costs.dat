While commonly believed as a compromise to the strict government regulations, remanufacturing is actually becoming a profitable business model.

In this thesis, we study one major problem in remanufacturing, namely, sorting policies that specify which returned items should be remanufactured and which should be scrapped. We examine a remanufacturer who acquires used products from third party brokers or directly from the market in both single and multiple periods. In single period setting, we examine the optimal policies when the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> is piecewise linear convex as well as linear. We show that a simple sorting policy exists when the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> is linear. We study the multi-period problem and prove that the unique optimal policies in multiple periods exist.

The current authors assessed whether oral levofloxacin treatment of patients with severe CAP, followed-up for 30 days, would save money. Over a 12 -month period, 129 hospitalised patients with severe non-intensive care unit CAP {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either oral levofloxacin or sequential antibiotic treatment. Direct and indirect costs were compared over a 30 -day period from several perspectives. CAP resolved in 71 out of 77 oral levofloxacin (92 %) and in 34 out of 37 sequential antibiotic treatment patients (92 %). Patients' characteristics, treatment duration, hospital length of stay and mortality were similar in both groups. Drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs</b> were 1. 7 -times smaller in oral levofloxacin patients, who were less often transferred to rehabilitation centres, but they used more physicians' visits during follow-up and their total costs were lower. As only a minority of patients was still active, inability to work and, hence, indirect costs were similar in both groups. In this study, oral levofloxacin for severe non-intensive care unit community-acquired pneumonia was equally effective as sequential antibiotic treatment, but did not lead to major costs savings except <b>for</b> drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> External factors linked with patients' characteristics and/or medical practice are likely to play a role and should be addressed...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} the generation and maintenance of immunological memory to Plasmodium are poorly understood and the reasons why protective immunity in humans is so difficult to achieve and rapidly lost remain a matter for debate. A {{possible explanation for the}} difficulty in building up an efficient immune response against this parasite is the massive T cell apoptosis resulting from exposure to high-dose parasite Ag. To determine the immunological mechanisms required for long-term protection against P. chabaudi malaria and the consequences of high and low acute phase parasite <b>loads</b> <b>for</b> <b>acquisition</b> of protective immunity, we performed a detailed analysis of T and B cell compartments over a period of 200 days following untreated and drug-treated infections in female C 57 BL/ 6 mice. By comparing several immunological parameters with the capacity to control a secondary parasite challenge, we concluded that loss of full protective immunity is not determined by acute phase parasite load nor by serum levels of specific IgG 2 a and IgG 1. Abs, but appears to be a consequence of the progressive decline in memory T cell response to parasites, which occurs similarly in untreated and drug-treated mice with time after infection. Furthermore, by analyzing adoptive transfer experiments, we confirmed the major role of CD 4 (+) T cells for guaranteeing long-term full protection against P. chabaudi malaria.

40|$|AbstractFor decades, the DoD has {{employed}} numerous {{reporting and}} monitoring tools <b>for</b> characterizing the <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost</b> of its major programs.

Curiously, though, there have been extremely few studies regarding {{the behavior of the}} other cost component of a system's life cycle: Operating and Support (O&S) costs. This is particularly strange considering that O&S costs tend to dominate the total life cycle cost (LCC) of a program, and that LCCs are widely regarded as the preferred metric for assessing actual program value. The upshot for not examining such costs is that the DoD has little knowledge of how LCC estimates behave over time, and virtually no insights regarding their accuracy. In recent years, however, enough quality LCC data has amassed to conduct a study to address these deficiencies. This paper describes a method for conducting such a study, and represents (to the authors’ knowledge) the first broad-based attempt to do so. The results not only promise insights into the nature of current LCC estimates, but also suggest the possibility of improving the accuracy of DoD LCC estimates via a stochastically-based model...|$|R

To date, there are not guidelines for estimating the cost of drugs financed by US public programs. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide standards for estimating the cost of drugs financed by US public programs for utilization in pharmacoeconomic evaluations. MethodsThis report was prepared by the ISPOR Task Force on Good Research Practices—Use of Drug Costs for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Medicare, Medicaid, and other US Government Payers Subgroup. The Subgroup was convened to assess the methodological and practical issues confronted by researchers when estimating the cost of drugs financed by US public programs, and to propose standards for more transparent, accurate and consistent costing methods. ResultsThe Subgroup proposed these recommendations: 1) researchers must consider regulation requirements that affect the drug cost paid by public programs; 2) drug cost must represent the actual <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost,</b> incorporating any rebates or discounts; 3) transparency with respect to cost inputs must be ensured; 4) inclusion of the public program's perspective is recommended; 5) high cost drugs require special attention, particularly when drugs represent a significant proportion of health-care expenditures for a specific disease; and 6) because of variations across public programs, sensitivity analyses <b>for</b> actual <b>acquisition</b> <b>cost,</b> real-world adherence, and generics availability are warranted. Specific recommendations also were proposed for the Medicare and Medicaid programs. ConclusionsAs pharmacoeconomic evaluations for coverage decisions made by US public programs grows, the need for precise and consistent estimation of drug costs is warranted.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{extensive}} interest in Special Purpose Inexpensive Satellite’s (SPINSAT) that perform cost effective space oriented missions. Reduced reliability and short delivery schedules are two key issues relating {{to the design of}} such satellites <b>for</b> minimizing <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> These issues are important factors in the design of a spacecraft power system which can be considered to be the heart of the entire satellite. The power system constitutes {{a substantial portion of the}} overall satellite system cost that must be reduced for SPINSAT missions. Minimum cost or inexpensive satellite implies prudent power system design with minimal redundancy, inexpensive energy source and battery with high cycle life. All of these factors must be considered during the design phase of a small SPINSAT and in particular, of the power system. Fairchild Space Company was recently awarded a contract to build such a small satellite for the Profile (Passive Radio Frequency Interference Location Experiment) program. The power system for the Profile program has gone through the considerations mentioned above in terms of cost, reliability, mission life and requirements compliance. Some of the major factors that were addressed during the design phase for Profile are the selection of battery type, battery charge control, main bus voltage level, power control and conditioning, dependence on other parts of the satellite, and system redundancy. Various trade-off studies were conducted in order to achieve an optimum design for minimizing the satellite <b>acquisition</b> <b>costs.</b> This paper describes the Profile power system design, the rationale for component selection (including system topology and bus voltage), and how the system design satisfies the primary SPINSAT objectives...|$|R
