5|$|The {{definitive}} {{version of}} the Hunter was the FGA.9, on which the majority of export versions were based. Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government, the Hunter proved far more successful, and had a lengthy service life with various operators, {{in part due to}} its <b>low</b> <b>maintenance</b> requirements and operating costs.|$|E
5|$|Profits for the {{undertaking}} showed a steady rise, {{due in part}} to the <b>low</b> <b>maintenance</b> costs of the river. Income from tolls rose from £321 in 1712 to £1,137 by 1802. By this time, traffic consisted of about 11,500tons of coal carried from Bridgwater upstream out of a total tonnage of 14,000tons. Dividends for 1797 were 11.5%, but the capital debt had risen to £85,466 by 1800, when the auditors refused to examine the accounts, because the likelihood of the poor ever benefitting from the navigation was receding. After much negotiation, the capital debt was reduced to £13,000. An act of parliament dated 14 July 1804 enshrined this position, and ensured that interest was limited to six percent, with profits being used to reduce the debt. By 1828, the amount owing had reduced to £4,426.|$|E

40|$|Human {{needs are}} in {{increasing}} day-by-day, to satisfy those needs {{the small and}} medium scale industries are increasing. Most of small and medium scale industries uses traditional storage system i. e store the metal sheets horizontally on floor available within the industry. Such system has many drawback and safety factor is also less. Due to {{which most of the}} industries are searching for better and efficient storage system which can provide them better safety, better handling, compactness and <b>low</b> <b>maintenances.</b> Storage system should consume less space, more efficient, much safety with <b>low</b> <b>maintenances.</b> To design such system many of industrial sector come forward with hydraulic and pneumatic or mechatronics system but such systems are not compatible with small and medium scale industries due to maintenance cost and requirement of skilled labour for handling such system. So, here for storage of metal sheets a simple metal sheet storage system has been suggested. It is affordable and easy to handle in any type of small and medium scale industries...|$|R

An advantage of this method is <b>low</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E

25|$|The more {{carnivorous}} a plant is, {{the less}} conventional its habitat {{is likely to}} be. Venus flytraps live in a very specialised habitat, whereas less carnivorous plants (Byblis, Pinguicula) are found in less unusual habitats (i.e., those typical for non-carnivores). Byblis and Drosophyllum both come from relatively arid regions and are both passive flypapers, arguably the <b>lowest</b> <b>maintenance</b> form of trap. Venus flytraps filter their prey using the teeth around the trap's edge, {{so as not to}} waste energy on hard-to-digest prey. In evolution, laziness pays, because energy can be used for reproduction, and short-term benefits in reproduction will outweigh long-term benefits in anything else.|$|R

While copper’s initial cost {{is higher than}} some other architectural metals, it usually {{does not need to}} be replaced during the life of a building. Due to its durability, <b>low</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and ultimate salvage value, the additional cost for copper may be insignificant over the life of a roofing system.|$|E

25|$|Static relays have no or few moving parts, {{and became}} {{practical}} {{with the introduction}} of the transistor. Measuring elements of static relays have been successfully and economically built up from diodes, zener diodes, avalanche diodes, unijunction transistors, p-n-p and n-p-n bipolar transistors, field effect transistors or their combinations. Static relays offer the advantage of higher sensitivity than purely electromechanical relays, because power to operate output contacts is derived from a separate supply, not from the signal circuits. Static relays eliminated or reduced contact bounce, and could provide fast operation, long life and <b>low</b> <b>maintenance.</b>|$|E
