Satsuki and Mei find that the house is inhabited by tiny animated dust creatures called susuwatari –- small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. When the girls become comfortable in their new house and <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> Tatsuo, the soot spirits leave the house to drift away on the wind. It is implied {{that they are going to}} find another empty house –- their natural habitat.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Sellers {{wrote to}} the BBC in 1948, and was {{subsequently}} auditioned. As a result, he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in New To You. His act, largely based on impressions, was well received, and he returned the following week. Frustrated with {{the slow pace of}} his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be Kenneth Horne, star of the radio show Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh. Speer called Sellers a [...] "cheeky young sod" [...] for his efforts, but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on ShowTime and subsequently to work on Ray's a <b>Laugh</b> <b>with</b> comedian Ted Ray. In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in Starlight Hour, The Gang Show, Henry Hall's Guest Night and It's Fine To Be Young.|$|E
500|$|Fred Patton of Animation World Magazine {{described}} the anime as [...] "delightfully witty {{and even an}} educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like." [...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions." [...] The reviewers of THEM Anime and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching Azumanga Daioh.|$|E
500|$|The troops under Patton's command {{received}} the speech well. The general's strong reputation caused considerable excitement among his men, and they listened intently, in absolute silence, as he spoke. A majority indicated they enjoyed Patton's speaking style. As one officer recounted {{of the end}} of the speech, [...] "The men instinctively sensed the fact and the telling mark that they themselves would play in world history because of it, for they were being told as much right now. Deep sincerity and seriousness lay behind the General's colorful words, and the men well knew it, but they loved the way he put it as only he could do it." [...] Patton gave a humorous tone to the speech, as he intentionally sought to make his men <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> his colorful delivery. Observers later noted the troops seemed to find the speeches very funny. In particular, Patton's use of obscene humor was well received by the enlisted men, as it was [...] "the language of the barracks".|$|E

500|$|Michael {{had shown}} the office a [...] "work in progress" [...] {{cut of the}} film years ago, but the {{employees}} all mistook it for a comedy, and Michael was so offended by their laughing that he shut down the screening. Everyone is very eager to see Michael's film, albeit only because they all appear in it, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) warns everyone {{to be mindful of}} how sensitive Michael is and not laugh. However, Pam is unable to keep herself from crying out in horror when she sees her mother cast in the film as a scantily clad nurse, and Jim (John Krasinski) fails to fully suppress his laughter at [...] "The Scarn" [...] scene, so Michael angrily stops the movie and takes it away. Michael asks Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) what she thought and she does not seem impressed. Michael gets angry at her because he considers the film his [...] "dream", and he then offers the rest of the office the opportunity to finish seeing the film, which they happily accept. While watching, Michael begins noting how the film is not really very good; he steps outside and tells Holly that it is a bad film but also one that people are having fun watching. They sit down and <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> the rest of the office through the film's conclusion.|$|E
500|$|When {{the band}} {{completed}} writing and recording demos for the songs, the three headed to Los Angeles to record drum tracks at Chick Corea's Mad Hatter Studios in January 1999. Barker recorded {{the majority of}} his drum tracks in eight hours. The recording process for the album was completed over a period of four months, and production was handled at several production facilities in southern California, including Signature Sound and Studio West in San Diego, Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, and Conway Recording Studios and The Bomb Factory in Los Angeles. For Barker, the album was [...] "fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. To record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded [...] "Mutt" [...] for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound. Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment. Barker kept attempting to irritate Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated. In addition, the band had so much fun with Finn that there were days when very little work was accomplished: [...] "Recording can get pretty monotonous, but at least we could <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> Jerry," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "A pretty typical day would involve multiple takes for one part of one song, and then everyone would get naked and jump on Jerry." [...] The band chose [...] "never to work with anyone else again," [...] and Finn would produce their next three releases.|$|E

2500|$|By late 1937, Méliès {{had become}} very ill and Langlois {{arranged}} {{for him to}} be admitted to the Léopold Bellan Hospital in Paris. Langlois had become close to him, and he and Franju visited him shortly before his death. When they arrived, Méliès showed them one of his last drawings of a champagne bottle with the cork popped and bubbling over. He then told them: [...] "Laugh, my friends. <b>Laugh</b> <b>with</b> me, laugh for me, because I dream your dreams." [...] Georges Méliès died of cancer on 21 January 1938 at age 76 — just hours after the passing of Émile Cohl, another great French film pioneer — and was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|Broadly speaking, {{the plays}} {{deal with the}} subject of despair {{and the will to}} survive in spite of that despair, {{in the face of an}} uncomprehending and incomprehensible world. The words of Nell—one of the two {{characters}} in Endgame who are trapped in ashbins, from which they occasionally peek their heads to speak—can best summarize the themes of the plays of Beckett's middle period: [...] "Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. ... Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. And we laugh, we <b>laugh,</b> <b>with</b> a will, in the beginning. But it's always the same thing. Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} prophesied in Mamre the {{previous}} year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, {{on the first}} anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was [...] "an hundred years old", when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> me." [...] Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac.|$|E

2500|$|Norbury {{said that}} he had spoken to {{executive}} producer Gareth Philips about the connection between Riley and Lynsey when they initially shared scenes. Hassan later teased that there could be complicated times for Lynsey when she begins to flirt with Riley. She said that there is a real sexual attraction between them but due to Lynsey's friendship with Riley's ex-fiancee Mercedes she would have to support Mercedes while having a secret relationship with Riley which could become complicated. Norbury said that although Riley feels Lynsey is a lovely girl and someone he can have a <b>laugh</b> <b>with,</b> Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) is a better match for Riley. Hassan felt that her alter-ego is happy to keep things a secret between her and Riley although when Mitzeee discovers the relationship Lynsey is on the [...] "receiving end of a lot of jealousy". Hassan explained that although Lynsey does not want to go head-to-head with Mercedes and Mitzeee, she will not step aside either.|$|E
2500|$|In the taxi, Dawn {{opens her}} [...] "Secret Santa" [...] present: an oil {{painting}} set from Tim with the words, [...] "Never give up" [...] written next to Dawn's sketch of Tim, {{which she had}} made earlier in the day. Brent walks his date to her car and she gestures through the window for him to call her. Returning to the office, he is subject to yet another offensive comment from Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson) about his date, and Brent, {{in a moment of}} anger, and having finally been pushed too far with the insults, tells him bluntly, [...] "why don't you fuck off". In the final scenes, Dawn returns to the office and kisses Tim, indicating that she has left Lee. The whole office staff gather for a group photo. Brent asks to have a group photo of just him and the [...] "old gang". While David, Tim, Dawn, Gareth, {{and the rest of the}} office members gather round for the photo, David finally manages to make his colleagues <b>laugh,</b> <b>with</b> an impersonation of Frank Spencer.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Truth be told, it's quite refreshing {{for an artist}} to embrace their perceived public image, but the joke is really on us. Why? Because it's Cher Lloyd who has the last <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> another hit on her hands." [...] X. Alexander of Idolator said [...] "Instead of blasting us with that 'Swagger Jagger', she's coming at us with the uber-catchy 'Want U Back' — a good choice, since we haven't {{been able to get}} it out of our heads since we first heard it." [...] Virgin Media's Matthew Horton wrote that the song has [...] "dynamic catchy bounce." [...] David Griffiths from 4Music praised the track, writing: [...] "It might not sound a million miles away from Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the USA', but it's got Cher's stamp all over it. From her dead pan delivery ('Please, this ain't even jealousy, she ain't got nothin' on me') to her screams of frustration peppered throughout the track, this has the potential to be an enormous global hit." [...] Bradley Stern from [...] "MuuMuse" [...] commented: [...] "It is one of the album’s catchiest, cutest moments–even if Lloyd’s gritting her teeth and clenching her fists with rage." [...] He further wrote: ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Rice of The New York Times commented: [...] "Kunle Afolayan {{wants to}} scare you, {{he wants to}} thrill you, {{he wants to make}} you laugh, but most of all, he would like you to suspend your disbelief — in his plots, yes, which tend to be over the top, but also about what is {{possible}} in Africa." [...] Shari Bollers of Afridiziak stated [...] "All the characters were created to enable the audience to warm up to them and to <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> and at them. With its switching of dual languages of native and English, it was easy to follow. It was a film that included everyone and warmed us with the humour. Whether Nigerian or not you will find this film funny." [...] Caitlin Pearson of The Africa Channel stated: [...] "What makes the plot of Phone Swap engaging are the performances from its all-star cast, and a visual range in its cinematography that allows us to see more of Nigeria than any claustrophobic Nollywood film could ever hope to do. [...] Francis McKay of Flick Hunter gave a 3 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "Kunle Afolayan crafted a highly watchable film with a good story and a cast led by two talented actors. The film is a good representation of Nigeria...".|$|E
2500|$|The rest of {{the scene}} is {{populated}} with doughty and good-humoured English workers. It is George II's birthday (30 October) (indicated by the flag flying on the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in the background) and {{the inhabitants of the}} scene are no doubt toasting his health. Under the sign of the Barley Mow, a blacksmith or cooper sits with a foaming tankard {{in one hand and a}} leg of beef in the other. Together with a butcher—his steel hangs at his side—they <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> the pavior (sometimes identified as a drayman) as he courts a housemaid (the key she holds is a symbol of domesticity). Ronald Paulson suggests a parallel between the trinity of signs of ill-omen in Gin Lane, the pawnbroker, distiller, and undertaker, and the trinity of English [...] "worthies" [...] here, the blacksmith, pavior, and butcher. Close by a pair of fish-sellers rest with a pint and a porter sets down his load to refresh himself. In the background, two men carrying a sedan chair pause for drink, while the passenger remains wedged inside, her large hoop skirt pinning her in place. On the roof, the builders, who are working on the publican's house above the [...] "Sun" [...] tavern share a toast with the master of a tailor's workshop. In this image it is a barrel of beer that hangs from a rope above the street, in contrast to the body of the barber in Gin Lane.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] when Abram was ninety-nine years old, God {{declared}} his new name: [...] "Abraham"– [...] "a father of many nations", {{and gave him}} the covenant of circumcision. God gave Sarai the new name [...] "Sarah", and blessed her. Abraham was given assurance that Sarah would have a son. Not long afterwards, Abraham and Sarah were visited by three men. One of the visitors told Abraham that upon his return next year, Sarah would have a son. While at the tent entrance, Sarah overheard what was said, and she laughed to herself about the prospect of having a child at their ages. The visitor inquired of Abraham why Sarah laughed at the idea of bearing a child, for her age was as nothing to God. Sarah soon became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, at the very time which had been spoken. The patriarch, then a hundred years old, named the child [...] "Isaac" [...] (Hebrew yitschaq, [...] "laughter") and circumcised him when he was eight days old. For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, [...] "God hath made me to laugh, [...] all that hear will <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> me." [...] Abraham held a great feast on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. It was during this banquet that Sarah happened upon the then teenaged Ishmael mocking and was so disturbed that she requested that both he and Hagar be removed from their company. Abraham was initially distressed by this but relented when told by God to do as his wife had asked.|$|E
