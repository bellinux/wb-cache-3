50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is {{the position}} of a piston in which it is farthest from, or nearest to, the crankshaft. The former is known as top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) while the latter is known as bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC).|$|R
50|$|Process 1-2 is an {{adiabatic}} (isentropic) {{compression of}} the charge as the piston moves from bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC) to top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC).|$|R
5000|$|As {{steam engines}} are {{commonly}} horizontal, the relevant terms are front <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and back <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> rather than [...] "top" [...] and [...] "bottom".|$|R
50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> of piston #1 is {{the point}} from which ignition system measurements are made and the firing order is determined. For example, ignition timing is normally specified as degrees of crankshaft rotation before top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BTDC). A very few small and fast-burning engines require a spark just after top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (ATDC), such as the Nissan MA engine with hemispherical combustions, or hydrogen engines.|$|R
50|$|More generally, the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is any {{position}} of a crank where the applied force is straight along its axis, meaning no turning force can be applied. Many sorts of machines are crank driven, including unicycles, bicycles, tricycles, various types of machine presses, gasoline engines, diesel engines, steam locomotives, and other steam engines. Crank-driven machines rely on the energy stored in a flywheel to overcome the <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> or are designed, {{in the case of}} multi-cylinder engines, so that <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> can never exist on all cranks at the same time. A steam locomotive {{is an example of the}} latter, the connecting rods being arranged such that the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> for each cylinder occurs out of phase with the other one (or more) cylinders.|$|R

50|$|Engine {{displacement}} is the {{swept volume}} {{of all the}} pistons inside the cylinders of a reciprocating engine in a single movement from top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) to bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC). It is commonly specified in cubic centimetres (cc or cm3), litres (l), or cubic inches (CID). Engine displacement {{does not include the}} total volume of the combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{is rarely}} {{a problem for}} {{internal}} combustion engines, as these usually require cranking over to provide cylinder compression and so do not attempt to self-start from stationary. Some large stationary diesel engines, where these used a compressed air starting mechanism, have suffered from the problem of <b>dead</b> <b>centres</b> and so used a small manual barring gear.|$|R
50|$|A short, unhappy stint {{teaching}} English at Denstone College, Staffordshire, 1931-33, inspired {{his novel}} <b>Dead</b> <b>Centre.</b>|$|R
50|$|At the top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{and bottom}} <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> valves open briefly {{with the rest}} of the time the valves being closed. Both the {{displacer}} piston and power piston move together in the same direction at the same time. The clever bit is that at the end of each stroke a valve is opened. This releases pressure or vacuum so the next cycle can begin.|$|R
50|$|In a pistonless rotary engine, {{the term}} {{is applied to the}} {{corresponding}} rotor movement; see <b>Dead</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} {{normally have}} at least two double acting cylinders, which enables the cranks to be set so that at least one piston will always be off the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and no starting assistance is required. In the common case of a two piston locomotive, the cranks are set at right angles, so that whenever one piston is at <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> the other is in mid-stroke, and giving four equally spaced power strokes per revolution.|$|R

50|$|A {{parallel}} twin with this many cylinders would be self-starting from <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> anyway (assuming the usual crankshaft with cranks at 90°).|$|R
5000|$|In a multi-cylinder engine, pistons {{may reach}} top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{simultaneously}} or {{at different times}} depending on the engine configuration. For example: ...|$|R
5000|$|If a single-cylinder {{steam engine}} stops {{in either of}} the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{positions}} it must be moved off the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> before it will restart. In small engines this is done by turning the flywheel by hand. In large engines the flywheel is moved with a lever or [...] "turning bar". Both operations must be done with care to avoid the operator becoming entangled in the machinery. Even larger engines might {{require the use of}} a barring engine.|$|R

50|$|Squish is {{an effect}} in {{internal}} combustion engines which creates sudden turbulence of the fuel/air mixture as the piston approaches top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC).|$|R
50|$|Process 4-1 {{completes the}} cycle by a constant-volume {{process in which}} heat is {{rejected}} from the air while the piston is at bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{slider-crank}} mechanism {{does not}} output a smooth torque {{even if the}} pressure is constant (e.g., at top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> there is no torque generated) ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{solutions}} to this have been applied. One {{of the simplest}} is to try not to stop in this position, the crudest to apply a strong arm with a crowbar to turn the engine over a little. Small steam barring engines were also used to move the engine away from <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> before starting. If the engine has multiple cylinders, most geometries for these are arranged so that all cylinders are never at <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> together and so one may always be used for starting.|$|R
50|$|As the {{ignition}} system is normally arranged to produce sparks before top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{there is a}} risk of the engine kicking back during hand starting, to avoid this problem one of the two magnetos used in a typical aero engine ignition system is fitted with an 'impulse coupling', this spring-loaded device delays the spark until top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and also increases the rotational speed of the magneto to produce a stronger spark. When the engine fires, the impulse coupling no longer operates and the second magneto is switched on.|$|R
5000|$|The {{displacement}} {{is defined}} as the total volume of air/fuel mixture an engine can draw in during one complete engine cycle. In a piston engine, this is the volume that is swept as the pistons are moved from top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> to bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> To the layperson this is the [...] "size" [...] of the engine. Motorcycle engines range from less than 50 cc (cubic centimetres), commonly found in many small scooters, to 5735 cc, a Chevrolet V8 engine, currently used by Boss Hoss in its cruiser style motorcycle.|$|R
50|$|At top <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> {{the piston}} gets {{very close to}} the flat portion of the {{cylinder}} head above, and the resultant turbulence produces excellent mixing of the fuel and air.|$|R

50|$|His {{works are}} {{distinct}} for their juxtaposition of text and image against a flattened foreground. Abdulla's handpainted annotations briefly describe the scene depicted and are placed <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{at the top}} of his paintings.|$|R
50|$|To avoid {{problems}} of premature condensation, {{the engine and}} boiler units were mounted together. Engines were three-cylinder single-acting vertical simple expansion engines, with 120° crankshaft spacing, {{so as to be}} self-starting without <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> problems.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{image from}} the Northern Irish works of Sloan is Walk X from 1985. It is a silver gelatin print. In it we see <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> {{splitting}} the image, a uniformed police officer with a peaked cap. He is in profile, staring tight-lipped at the parade, feet apart in a rooted stance, symbol of law-and-order but also unusually for the North, of impartiality, indicated by his <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> stance. From the left a huge Lambeg drum, strapped to its unseen owner's chest, juts out across the body; {{but it has been}} rendered semi-transparent so that the outline shape of the police officer can still be seen.|$|R
5000|$|High {{piston speed}} around top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) and a fast power stroke {{expansion}} enhances fuel-air mixing {{and reduces the}} time available for heat transfer losses {{and the formation of}} temperature-dependent emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx).|$|R
50|$|A further benefit may be {{obtained}} by admitting the steam to the cylinder slightly before front or back <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> This advanced admission (also known as lead steam) assists in cushioning the inertia of the motion at high speed.|$|R
50|$|Upon starting, semi-compound working allowed boiler {{steam to}} be {{admitted}} directly to the low-pressure cylinders through a reducing valve. This obtained greater tractive effort and avoided starting trouble due to the high-pressure crank being at or near <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R
50|$|Process 2-3 is a constant-volume heat {{transfer}} to the working gas from an external source while the piston is at top <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> This process is intended to represent the ignition of the fuel-air mixture and the subsequent rapid burning.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{is usually}} {{constructed}} as a circular poppet valve with a conical seat, {{inserted into the}} cylinder from the outside. A protrusion on the inside is hit by the piston as it approaches top <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> forcing the valve open.|$|R
5000|$|Piston {{moves from}} crank end (BDC, bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and maximum volume) to {{cylinder}} head end (TDC, top <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and minimum volume) as the working gas with initial state 1 is compressed isentropically to state point 2, through compression ratio [...] Mechanically {{this is the}} isentropic compression of the air/fuel mixture in the cylinder, {{also known as the}} compression stroke. This isentropic process assumes that no mechanical energy is lost due to friction and no heat is transferred to or from the gas, hence the process is reversible. The compression process requires that mechanical work be added to the working gas. Generally the compression ratio is around 9-10:1 [...] for a typical engine.|$|R
50|$|On a {{two-cylinder}} engine the cranks, whether {{inside or}} outside, are set at 90 degrees. As the cylinders are double-acting (i.e. fed with steam alternately at each end) this gives four impulses per revolution and ensures {{that there are}} no <b>dead</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|R
