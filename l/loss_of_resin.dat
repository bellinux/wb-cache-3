50|$|Induced (traumatic) resin {{in white}} spruce leaders {{resistant}} or {{susceptible to the}} white pine weevil was analyzed for volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids after simulated white pine weevil damage (Tomlin et al. 2000). Leaders from 331 trees were wounded just below the apical bud with a 1-mm diameter drill, coinciding with the natural time of weevil oviposition in the spring. Leaders were removed in the autumn, and the bark and xylem from {{the upper and lower}} regions of the leader extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unwounded trees had low amounts of resin in xylem compared with bark. In response to wounding, volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids increased in the upper xylem (area of wounding), with resistant trees showing a greater increase than susceptible trees. Wounding caused monoterpenes in particular to decrease in the lower region of the leader (away from the drilled area) in greater amounts in susceptible trees than in resistant trees. In response to wounding, the proportion of monoterpene to resin acid increased in the upper and lower xylem of resistant trees, and slightly increased in the upper xylem of susceptible trees. Monoterpene-enriched resin is more fluid than constitutive resin, and probably flows more readily into oviposition cavities and larval mines, where it may kill immature weevils. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> components in the lower xylem suggested catabolism and transport of these materials to the site of wounding; however, energetic and regulatory data are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This study provides a basis for measuring the ability of a tree to undergo traumatic resinosis, which could be used to screen for resistance to white pine weevil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: The null-hypothesis that {{retention}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> fissure sealants predicts caries manifestation no {{more accurately}} than random values was tested. Methods: Systematic reviews were checked and electronic databases searched for clinical trials. Trials {{reporting on the}} re-tention of resin sealants and caries occurrence in permanent molar teeth, with minimum 24 -month follow-up period, were included. Extracted data: number of sealed teeth, number of teeth without completely retained sealants, number of sealed teeth with caries. The number of teeth with complete sealant retention and absence of carious lesions/cavities was calcu-lated; the predictive outcomes: true/false positive; false/true negative were established. Random values were generated as control-data. Diagnostic Odds ratios (DOR) were computed and tested for statistical difference. Summary Receiver Oper-ating Characteristic curves were plotted. Results: 95 trials were found. Median DOR values were 1. 21 and 0. 28 for test- and control data, respectively. Wilcoxon test (z = 0. 56; p = 0. 58) and Sign test (z = 1. 38; p = 0. 17) results were statistically non-significant. The null-hypothesis was not rejected. Conclusions: Predictions based on the retention <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> sealants, regarding caries manifestation, was no more accu-rate than random guesses.

30|$|The {{durability}} <b>of</b> isocyanate <b>resins</b> consisting <b>of</b> emulsion-type polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (EMDI) {{was investigated}} under constant dry heating. Two kinds <b>of</b> <b>resin,</b> water only-added resin and polyol/wateradded resin, {{were used in}} this study. The kinetic studies based on the weight <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>resins</b> were carried out by isothermal thermogravimetry (TG) at temperatures ranging from 260 ° to 320 °C. The apparent activation energies <b>of</b> the <b>resins</b> were calculated for weight <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %. The values of apparent activation energy <b>of</b> the <b>resins</b> increased with increasing weight loss.

The best-fitting regression function for the behavior of bond-strength reduction was determined statistically. The apparent activation energy <b>of</b> each <b>resin</b> was calculated from the regression function for the half-life period. According to the calculated values, the adhesion durability <b>of</b> polyol/wateradded <b>resin</b> was superior to that <b>of</b> water only-added <b>resin.</b> To speculate on the changes in weight loss and the chemical structure <b>of</b> the <b>resins</b> in the glue lines under dry heating, changes in the cured resins were also observed.|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} course <b>of</b> phenol-formaldehyde <b>resin</b> extended with thiolignin {{was investigated in}} air at atmospheric pressure by means of thermoanalytical methods.

The DTA curves of the cured phenol-formaldehyde resins extended with thiolignin showed two peaks of exothermal reactions at lower temperatures than 550 ℃. The first exothermal peak (310 ～ 340 ℃) was attributed to thermoxidation of thiolignin, and the second (510 ～ 540 ℃) was done mainly to thermooxidation <b>of</b> phenol-formaldehyde <b>resin.</b> The temperature at first exothermal peak was as follows (ref.

The fabrication activity was successful and the feasibility of the multistep processing technology was established. Delaminations or unbonded plies were visible on the heat shield and resulted from excessive <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> and lack of sufficient pressure applied on the part during the curing cycle.

30|$|Only flaming time {{differed}} significantly between Class I and Class II cones; other burning characteristics {{did not differ}} between these cone classes. The difference of flaming time was substantial, however, with Class I cones flaming 1.5 times longer than Class II cones. Initial weathering and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> likely explain the longer flaming time of Class I compared to Class II cones. Resin has an energy content of 35.3 MJ kg− 1 (Agee 1993), {{much higher than the}} 21.8 MJ kg− 1 of cone tissue (van Wagtendonk et al. 1998 b). The resinsealed serotinous cones of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) and knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata Lemmon) flamed on average for 605 s and 740 s, respectively (Fonda and Varner 2004), despite their closed structure and presumably high bulk density, consistent with resin being an important determinant of pine cone flaming time.|$|E
40|$|Ion {{exchange}} using perchlorate-selective resin {{is possibly}} the most feasible technology for perchlorate removal from water. However, in current water treatment applications, selective resins are used once and then incinerated, making the ion-exchange process economically and environmentally unsustainable. A new concept has been developed involving the biological regeneration of resin-containing perchlorate. This concept involves directly contacting perchlorate-containing resins with a perchlorate-reducing microbial culture. In this research, the feasibility of multi-cycle loading and bioregeneration of a macroporous perchlorate-selective resin was investigated. Loading and bioregeneration cycles were performed, using a bench-scale fermenter and a fluidized bed reactor followed by fouling removal and disinfection of the resin. The results revealed that selective macroporous resin can be employed successfully in a consecutive loading-bioregeneration ion-exchange process. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> capacity stabilized after a few cycles of bioregeneration, indicating {{that the number of}} loading and bioregeneration cycles that can be performed is likely greater than the five cycles tested. The results also revealed that most of the capacity loss in the resin is due to perchlorate buildup from previous regeneration cycles. The results further indicated that as the bioregeneration progresses, clogging of the resin pores results in strong mass transfer limitation in the bioregeneration process...|$|E

Similar to viscosity reduction, the experimental results demonstrate that the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 shows high activity in the aspect of upgrading heavy components. Table  1 also indicates that the resin content, respectively, decreased by 2.89  % and 1.85  % after oxidation over catalysts Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2, and Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2, while asphaltene content decreased by 6.16  % and 4.57  %, implying that the two catalytic ions mainly react with asphaltene. The different catalytic performances of additives {{are related to the}} molecular structure differences between resin and asphaltene. This {{is due to the fact}} that asphaltenes have longer alkyl branch sides, more layer structures, and higher average molecular weight than the resins. From another perspective, it is known that some <b>of</b> the <b>resins</b> can crack into saturate or aromatic fractions, and asphaltenes can split into resin during thermolysis (Wang et al. 2009). Intuitively, the cracking <b>of</b> original <b>resins</b> can decrease their content only to a limited degree, but the new resins generated by asphaltene splitting can compensate for the cracking <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> original <b>resins.</b> Hence, the overall content <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> only changes slightly.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} silica nano-particles with {{different}} size were prepared by sol–gel technique, then surface modification by using cyclic carbonate functional organoalkoxysilane (CPS) was performed. Various amounts of carbonated silica particles directly added into carbonated soybean oil (CSBO) and carbonated polypropylene glycol (CPPG) resin mixture to prepare polyurethane–silica nanocomposite coating compositions by nonisocyanate route using an aliphatic diamine as a curing agent. Cupping, gloss, impact, and taber abrasion tests {{were performed on}} aluminum panels coated with those nano-composite formulations and tensile tests, thermogravimetric and SEM analyses were conducted on the free films prepared from the same coating formulations.

In addition, the maximum weight <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> CSBO-CPPG <b>resin</b> combination was shifted to higher temperatures with incorporation of silica nano-particles The positive effect of modified silica particles on thermal stability of CSBO-CPPG system could be explained {{in such a way that}} PPG chains are able to disperse particles in the medium throughout the interactions between ether linkages and silanol groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} phylogenetically informed comparative {{analyses of}} 81 taxa of Dalechampia (Euphorbiaceae) vines and shrubs {{to assess the}} roles of historical contingency and trait interaction {{in the evolution of}} plant-defense and pollinator-attraction systems. We asked whether defenses can originate by exaptation from preexisting pollinator attractants, or vice versa, whether plant defenses show escalation, and if so, whether by enhancing one line of defense or by adding new lines of defense. Two major patterns emerged: (i) correlated evolution of several complementary lines of defense of flowers, seeds, and leaves, and (ii) 5 to 6 <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> the <b>resin</b> reward, followed by redeployment <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> for defense <b>of</b> male flowers in 3 to 4 lineages, apparently in response to herbivore-mediated selection for defense of staminate flowers upon relaxation of pollinator-mediated selection on resin. In all cases, redeployment <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> involved reversion to the inferred ancestral arrangement of flowers and resiniferous bractlets. Triterpene resin has also been deployed for defense of leaves and developing seeds. Other unique defenses against florivores include nocturnal closure of large involucral bracts around receptive flowers and permanent closure around developing fruits (until opening again upon dehiscence). Escalation in one major clade occurred through an early dramatic {{increase in the number of}} lines of defense and in the other major clade by more limited increases throughout the group's evolution. We conclude that preaptations played important roles in the evolution of unique defense and attraction systems, and that the evolution of interactions with herbivores can be influenced by adaptations for pollination, and vice versa...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} on {{the decay of}} acid ion exchange resin from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. The qualitative study concentrated on observing the impact on resin strength of varying electrolyte concentrations and varying di-vinyl benzene contents, during the loading phase. The phenomenon of osmotic shock in addition to resin cracking and swelling is clearly observed. A further qualitative study bore out the change in resin rigidity as the resin is artificially degraded through repeated loadings and regenerations performed by using a specially constructed device that cyclically loads and regenerates resin up to 1000 times in a three week period. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> rigidity was observed under these circumstances and was measured by means of observing changes in degree of swelling/contraction and changes in translucence. Quantitative study of the resin was limited to its characterisation through measurement of the equilibrium through the Mass-Action Law, capacity and resin kinetics. A study, of existing kinetic rigorous modelling methods {{and in particular the}} extensively published challenge of the multiple mechanism adsorption process, was undertaken. A rigorous model, that divorces the external and internal mass-transport parameters from the traditionally utilised lumped parameter, is proposed. All kinetic measurements were performed in a 1 litre closed circuit (finite system) consisting of a variable-pump, a five mL zero length column (ZLC) and a reservoir, allowing for the insertion of probes and sample extraction. An original method of model simulation for the purposes of fitting to kinetic data was developed and consists of determining the resin surface concentration from flux data assuming the applicability of Newton's Law of Cooling to the ionic flux through the external laminar layer. Simulation of flux inside the resin was achieved by assuming an internal homogeneous environment and the applicability of the Nernst-Plank equation that combines transport effects of both Fick's Law of Diffusion and inter-ion electrical forces to the flux of both the adsorbing and desorbing ions simultaneously, during the transient adsorption process...|$|E
40|$|The The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) is {{continuing}} to investigate the behavior of fully grouted roof bolts in the weak roof rock of the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). This paper describes the results of three studies: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 A series of 24 pull tests of bolts installed fully grouted and overcored to leave 12 inches of grouted bolt. The tests compared the pull-out performance of offset-head roof bolts with that of standard 5 / 8 -inch bolts; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 A second series of 24 tests that compared the pull-out loads obtained by bolts installed with 1 ft of resin (a Short Encapsulation Pull Test or SEPT) to that of fully grouted bolts overcored to leave only 12 inches of grouted bolt, and; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 An investigation into the pressures generated during the installation of fully grouted resin bolts. All of the bolts installed and pulled were overcored and removed from the roof after the pull tests to allow inspection of the resin. The first study {{found that there was}} no significant difference in pullout load between the offset-head bolts and the standard bolts. The second study, comparing the SEPT bolts and the partially-overcored fully grouted bolts, indicated that SEPT can significantly underestimate bolt anchorage grip factor, suggesting that the SEPT is a conservative measure of actual bolt performance. Significant <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> to cracks in the roof was observed in the bolts overcored in the SRCM. The third study explored one possible explanation for the resin loss, high pressures generated during bolt installation. These tests employed bolts installed in strain gauged steel tubes. The results confirmed that significant pressures (greater than 4, 000 psi) can be generated during bolt installation. The results of the pressure tests, combined with the observations of resin loss in bolts installed in the SRCM, suggest that under some circumstances resin loss and under-encapsulation could take place and lead to degraded bolt performance. Glove fingering was observed in all recovered bolts to various degrees. The limited comparative data suggested that the effect of glove fingering ranged from slight to moderate. Complete mixing of the resin was observed on all of the 40 bolts recovered (28 fully grouted and 12 SEPT). Australian and U. S. resins were compared and the Australian resins were observed to have much smaller catalyst compartment areas and lower resin viscosities. These differences are suggested as potential explanations for occasional resin mixing problems noted in Australian resin bolt installations...|$|E
40|$|The resin {{anchored}} {{rock bolt}} is used {{extensively in the}} mining industry to stabilize the roof and prevent it from collapsing. However, there are different defects associated with a resin anchored rock bolt. Examples are partially encapsulated bolts, over-spinned bolts and corroded bolts. These defects reduce {{the integrity of the}} roof, and thereby {{have an effect on the}} safety and productivity of the mines. The integrity of the rock bolts is a critical issue for the mining industry because of its influence on the safety of mining operations. Different research groups around the world have addressed the problem of determining rock bolt integrity. The most promising technique found in the literature study was based on guided ultrasonic waves (Beard and Lowe, 2003). This study extended the previous work by Beard and Lowe (2003) using guided ultrasonic waves, to investigate damage in more realistic embedded bolts which deviate from pure cylinders. The fundamental L(0, 1) mode in its lower frequency range, as suggested by Beard and Lowe was utilized. This was done through the use of finite element model simulations of various defect scenarios, which were compared to experimental measurements on bolts. Defects like <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> encapsulation, voids and local corrosion cracks were addressed. The time traces of the different finite element defect scenarios could be directly compared to experimental time traces which distinguish this study from the analytical approach. Some finite element modelling issues were investigated and it was found that the time step is critical if an implicit solver is used, whereas for an explicit solver the element size is critical if accurate answers are needed. Furthermore it was also apparent that the boundary of the mortar has an influence on the results. The method used in the study was to move the boundaries far enough to prevent interference. This however increases the model size and thereby the computer resources required. Axisymmetric defects were modelled using axisymmetric finite elements to reduce the problem size. These models gave results comparable to the measured bolts. Three-dimensional finite element models seemed to be promising for simulating non-axisymmetric defects. It was found that it is not possible to solve large three-dimensional models without energy absorbing boundaries. Axisymmetrical and three dimensional finite element models of a partially encapsulated bolt and a bolt with a local corrosion crack were built. It was possible to detect simulated local corrosion cracks with the finite element models. Clear reflections for the crack in the bolt could be seen. If the bolt, resin and rock are cracked, different reflections will be detected. These different reflections complicated the interpretation of the results. Once the integrity of models such as these has been established, the models could in principle be used to train neural networks for use in commercial equipment. The present study was limited to lower frequencies because of computer resource limitations. Basic principles and modelling issues could however be addressed and it may be expected that these principles could soon be extended to higher frequencies with a new generation of computers.

40|$|This {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} with the aim of carrying out an exploratory investigation into the possibility of using sorghum residue and a new adhesive technology to manufacture a fibre panel. Its purpose was to not only to initiate a protocol for manufacture but to also determine the properties of the panel, establishing any advantageous aspects and highlighting any shortcomings and deficiencies when assessed against current Australian standard specifications. It is our intention that this exploratory study will form the groundwork to allow us to determine which areas need further research to be able to manufacture a panel that could complement the current products available to the construction and furniture manufacturing industries. The manufacturing process and resulting panels highlighted the following: 1. Most of the properties of the panel were below standard specifications. This result could be directly attributed to the technical characteristics of the equipment used for the resination process. It is believed that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> both <b>resin</b> and fibre during this step resulted in a lower than expected outcomes for panel density, glue bond quality, MoE and MoR. Addressing this issue will give tighter control of the amount <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> applied with minimal fibre loss and better determination of the mechanical properties of the panel. 2. Fibre pre-treatment as required when using current formaldehyde based adhesives is not necessary with an eMDI adhesive. This adhesive doesn’t have the major inconvenient to release toxic emission of formaldehyde. 3. The waxy nature of sorghum results in a panel that meets Australian standard requirements for fibre swelling with minimal fibre processing.

40|$|In this work, the {{long-term}} bond strengths of adhesive resin cements to zirconia ceramic and human dentin were evaluated, and resin-ceramic and resin-dentin bonding mechanisms were investigated. In chapter 3, {{the influence of}} surface pre-treatment on the bonding durability of three resin cements (Super-Bond C&B resin cement : SB, Clearfil™ Esthetic cement: CEC, Chemiace II: CH) to zirconia ceramic was studied. Most importantly, the influence of chemical reactions of functional monomers in primer on the resin-ceramic bonding were investigated. Within the limitation of this study, priming pre-treatment with primers can increase the bonding durability of three resin cements to airborne-particle abraded ziconia ceramic. Only silane {{is important for the}} initial resin-ceramic bonding, but are not able to produce a strong durable resin-ceramic bonding. The pre-treatment with MDP or 4 -META-containing primers make SB and CEC to produce a durable bond to airborne-particle abraded zirconia ceramic. Due to the decomposition of CH resin cement, the bonding durability of CH without pre-treatment and with pre-treatment with Monobond S and Metal/Zirconia Primer are not testable due to the spontaneous debond during storage. Without surface priming pre-treatment, only SB showed acceptable long-term bond strength to airborne-particle abraded zirconia ceramic. These conclusions can be supported by the combination of XPS, TBS and SEM results. In clinical try-in procedures of zirconia ceramic restorations, to remove contaminations prior to bonding is very important to realize a long-term durable resin bond clinically. In chapter 4, XPS and TBS were combined together to investigate whether there are contaminations on the zirconia ceramic surface left after try-in simulation, and the influences of contamination and cleaning methods on zirconia ceramic bonding durability with MDP-containing resin cements. After saliva immersion and using a silicone disclosing agent, airborne-particle abraded ceramic specimens were cleaned with acetone, 36 % phosphoric acid, additional airborne-particle abrasion, or only water spray. Chemical analyses of specimen surfaces were done using XPS. Our results showed that contamination, existing after try-in simulation as confirmed by chemical analysis with XPS, significantly reduced resin -ceramic bonds. Airborne-particle abrasion was the most effective method to remove contaminants and to create a clean zirconia ceramic surface suitable for long-term durable resin bonding. The combination of chemical surface characterization with XPS and long-term TBS performance was very useful {{to determine the effects of}} the contamination and cleaning methods on ceramic bonding. Understanding the degradation mechanism of dentin bonding is of significant importance for improving {{the long-term}} dentin bonding of adhesive resin cements and the longevity of bonded zirconia ceramic restorations. In chapter 6, mTBS was used to evaluate the bonds of three resin cements (Super-Bond C&B resin cement: SB, Panavia F 2. 0 : PF, and RelyX Unicem: RU) to different regions of dentin, SEM and TEM were used to investigate the resin-dentin bonding interface and fractographic analysis after mTBS testing. ANOVA results showed that mTBS to superficial dentin was significantly higher than to deep or cervical dentin for all three resin cements. For groups SB and PF, with the highest mTBS to superficial dentin, failed primarily cohesively in resin cement. mTBS of SB to deep and cervical dentin were significantly higher than those of PF and RU. RU, with the lowest regional mTBS, failed mostly within demineralized dentin. SEM and TEM showed that adhesive failures in SB and PF occurred at the top of hybrid layer (HL), but no obvious hybrid layer was observed in RU. In chapter 7, the effect of structural changes of collagen fibrils on the bonding durability of a total etch resin cement (SB) and a self-etching resin cement (PF) to dentin was investigated. AFM was used to observe structural changes of intact dentin collagen fibrils after acidic conditionings of two bonding systems. After 90 d water storage and 15, 000 thermal cycles (TC) as artificial aging, μTBS was utilized to evaluate the bonding durability of the two bonding systems to dentin. μTBS after 1 d or 90 d water storage without TC were separately measured in control groups. A cross-banding periodicity of about 67 nm along collagen fibrils was seen on demineralized intertubular dentin surfaces in AFM images. For both resin cements, thermal cycling decreased (p < 0. 05) μTBS of 1 d and 90 d, compared to controls. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopic examinations revealed that the top and bottom of HL were weak links in the bonding interface over time. The results suggest that the top of HL contains disorganized collagen fibrils from the smear layer which degrade over time. AFM results indicate that the demineralized intact collagen fibrils beneath the smear layer were not denatured during acidic conditioning. However, these collagen fibrils may be structurally unstable due to poor-infiltration by resin or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> protection within the HL over time, reducing the long-term μTBS. Artificial aging using water storage with thermal cycling accelerates the degradation of adhesive resin cement-dentin bonding and therefore serves as aging model. This study is very important to provide the evidence that the decomposition of dentin collagen fibrils in the resin-dentin bonding interface over time, although the short-term application of the acidic conditioners used in the two bonding systems do not denature the intact dentin collagen fibrils, is one main factor decreasing the dentin bonding...|$|E

Also, this study intends {{to review the}} papers on the fracture mode, namely “fractography”, under scanning electron microscopy finding fracture initiation site, {{and the effect of}} filler content on the fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> composites. It will also review the effect of aging on the fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> composites in different media, mainly distilled water, and acidic environment. In the review performed on fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> composites we used “fracture toughness (KIc) ”, aging AND fracture toughness, AND fractography” <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> composites as the search strategy. The outcome of the review revealed that most of the studies investigated fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> composites under Mode I and less under mode II. However, some others looked at the fracture toughness <b>of</b> dental <b>resin</b> composites under mixed-mode loading conditions. It was also found that fracture toughness studies performed on the same types <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> composites resulted in different values of KIc. The differences were related to the method of performance that requires different specimen geometries...|$|R
30|$|The {{integration}} {{of this new}} scientific data with existing ethnographic accounts of these and similar items contributes towards a wider understanding of the use <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> in Sahul. This study highlights the use <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> for less-well documented uses such as medicine and narcotics, {{as well as the}} more commonly referenced adhesives. The identification <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> from particular species used for specific purposes can offer insight into past use of natural materials and early adaptation to varying environments, plant exploitation practices and selection of resin-based materials, early knowledge of chemical properties <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> and the development of technologies, and cultural uses <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> for specific purposes. The methods used in this study show potential for similar identifications <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> from archaeological contexts and highlights the potential for developing a framework to allow the identification <b>of</b> archaeological <b>resins</b> more efficiently and effectively. This work demonstrates that <b>resin</b> analysis <b>of</b> museum artefacts is a useful tool for both ethnographic studies and archaeological research.|$|R
30|$|For asphaltene, both f A and H AU / C A {{decreased}} after catalytic aquathermolysis. The {{reduction in}} aromaticity {{could be attributed}} to the rupture of polyring structures after the removal of heteroatoms or the hydrogenation of unsaturated groups, while the increase in the aromatic condensation degree might originate from the aggregation of aromatic units after the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> side chains. For resin, the H/C, f A and H AU / C A changed slightly after catalytic aquathermolysis, almost the same as those <b>of</b> the crude <b>resin.</b> This is consistent with the previous results that the content <b>of</b> the <b>resin</b> changed much more but its molecular weight remained the same. It seems that during the aquathermolysis, the side chains of asphaltene might be more easily cracked than the side chains <b>of</b> <b>resin,</b> and parts <b>of</b> asphaltene might be transferred to resin after cracking.|$|R

UV-curable {{waterborne}} polyurethane/acrylate (WPUA) {{composite resin}} was prepared, and its properties {{were compared with}} those <b>of</b> waterborne polyurethane <b>resin.</b> Results showed that the particle size distribution <b>of</b> the compounding <b>resin</b> was broader, and the compatibility of two phases in resin system became better after adding the acrylate into polyurethane. Moreover, water and alcohol resistances, and mechanical properties <b>of</b> composite <b>resin</b> were superior to those <b>of</b> waterborne polyurethane <b>resin.</b> Comprehensive properties <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> film were the best when photoinitiator amount is 3 % <b>of</b> <b>resin...</b>|$|R
30|$|However, {{despite the}} range <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> {{resources}} in Australia and Papua New Guinea, {{we know very}} little about the role <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> in indigenous communities. The focus <b>of</b> instrumental <b>resin</b> analysis for archaeological research is often centered on the hafting of composite tools [7, 8], which although extremely important, has been criticised for being too dominant, leading to the exclusion of the study of other functions <b>of</b> such <b>resins</b> [9].|$|R
50|$|Highly {{crosslinked}} resins typically swell {{much less}} than the latter. The property that allows these types <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> to work efficiently lies in their porous properties.

These types <b>of</b> <b>resins</b> are utilized in situations where swelling <b>of</b> the <b>resins</b> may cause a physical barrier to reaction purification.

30|$|Water stress due to drought {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a cause <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets <b>of</b> radiata pine in New Zealand and Norway spruce in Europe. Cown (1973) showed that resin pockets in radiata pine on the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand were often associated with false rings, which are an indirect effect of soil moisture deficit on xylem formation. More recently, the availability of water {{was found to be}} a factor in the formation <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets in radiata pine in the central North Island of New Zealand (Woollons et al., 2009). This analysis was based on observations <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pocket occurrence. The authors found that high vapour pressure deficit in October (which is a measure of water demand), low soil water availability, stem top-outs (which are a highly localised measure of maximum wind gusts), and fast diameter growth (which is indicative of early heavy thinning) were positively related to the number <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets. Seifert et al. (2010) found that stress due to lack of water appeared {{to play a role in}} the presence <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets in Norway spruce, with increased numbers <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets associated with lower precipitation during the growth season, wider growth rings, and longer crown lengths. Watt et al. (2011) reported the incidence <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets in radiata pine showed regular peaking in the latter part of the growth rings on sites where the water stress would be expected to peak late in the growing season.|$|R

30|$|The Type 1 and 2 {{resin pocket}} raw data were {{summarised}} for the stem bending and control treatments prior to analysis. Growth rings prior to 2003, and heights above 6 metres from the ground, {{were not used}} in the analysis. The exclusion of this data is unlikely to affect the results, as the vast majority <b>of</b> the <b>resin</b> pockets occurred from 2003, and at heights below 6 metres above the ground. Within each combination of ring and height class, {{the presence or absence}} <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets <b>of</b> each type, and the number <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets were obtained. Presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets was then analysed using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure in SAS Version 9.2 with a logistic link function and binary distribution function. The number <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pockets was also analysed with PROC GLIMMIX using a Poisson link function but this analysis gave similar results to the presence/absence analysis and is not presented here. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>resin</b> pocket numbers was extremely skewed with some trees having large numbers and others having only a few resin pockets. This meant that a simple measure of presence/absence within each combination of height class and ring gave comparable results to complete counts.|$|R
