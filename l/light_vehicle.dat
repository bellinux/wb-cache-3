25|$|In 2008, with rapidly rising oil prices, {{industries}} such as {{the automotive}} industry, are experiencing a combination of pricing pressures from raw material costs and changes in consumer buying habits. The industry is also facing increasing external competition from the public transport sector, as consumers re-evaluate their private vehicle usage. Roughly half of the US's fifty-one <b>light</b> <b>vehicle</b> plants are projected to permanently close in the coming years, {{with the loss of}} another 200,000 jobs in the sector, on top of the 560,000 jobs lost this decade.

25|$|The LTAS {{protection}} system follows an A-kit/B-kit principle, with vehicles designed 'fitted for, but not with', protection.

The A-kit is fitted on the production line and {{is a combination of}} a limited amount of armoring, in difficult-to-access areas of the vehicle, together with a significant amount of armor installation attachments and required support structures. The bulk of the armor, the B-kit, is installed in the field on an 'as required' basis. Two soldiers can install B-kit armor in five hours. An 800-pound RPG protection kit can be installed in two hours at field-level maintenance and completed by the crew within 30 minutes. The JLTV mounts up to four M7 <b>Light</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Obscuration Smoke Systems.|$|E

500|$|Skylon is {{a series}} of designs for a single-stage-to-orbit {{spaceplane}} by the British company Reaction Engines Limited (REL), using SABRE, a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system. [...] The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft that would take off from a purpose-built runway, and accelerate to Mach5.4 at [...] altitude (compared to typical airliners' [...] ) using the atmosphere's oxygen before switching the engines to use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. It could carry [...] of cargo to an equatorial low Earth orbit (LEO); up to [...] to the International Space Station, almost 45% more than the capacity of the European Space Agency's Automated Transfer Vehicle; or [...] to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO), over 30% more than SpaceX F9 RTLS (.) The relatively <b>light</b> <b>vehicle</b> would then re-enter the atmosphere and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic composite skin. [...] When on the ground, it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance. If the design goal is achieved, it should be ready to fly again within two days and be able to complete 200 orbital flights.|$|E
