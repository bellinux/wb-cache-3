50|$|Early {{methods for}} {{identifying}} RNA-protein interactions relied {{on either the}} affinity purification of RNA-binding proteins or the immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes. These methods lacked a cross-linking step and obtained <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratios. Because RNA-binding proteins are frequently components of multi-protein complexes, RNAs bound to non-target proteins may be co-precipitated. The data obtained using early immunoprecipitation methods have been demonstrated {{to be dependent on}} the reaction conditions of the experiment. For example, the subset of RNA-protein interactions preserved depends highly on the protein concentrations and ionic conditions. Furthermore, the reassociation of RNA-binding proteins following cell lysis may lead to the detection of artificial interactions.|$|E
50|$|At room {{temperature}} radiation damage induced defects temporarily trap electrons and holes resulting from ionization, {{which are then}} emitted back to the conduction band or valence band in a time that is typically longer than the read-out time of the connected electronics. Consequently the measured signal is smaller than it should be. This leads to <b>low</b> <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> <b>noise</b> ratios that in turn can prevent the detection of the traversing particle.At cryogenic temperatures, however, once an electron or hole, resulting from ionization or from detector leakage current, is trapped in a local defect, it remains trapped {{for a long time}} due to the very low thermal energy of the lattice. This leads to a large fraction of 'traps' becoming filled and therefore inactive. Trapping of electrons and holes generated by particles traversing the detector is then prevented and little or no signal is lost. The understanding of this has been detailed in a number of papers.|$|E
