40|$|This study {{analyzed}} how {{anaerobic digestion}} of dairy manure might change the amount, form, {{and rate of}} phosphorus (P) leached by rainfall. Anaerobic digestion has become an increasingly popular manure management option because it generates methane {{that can be used}} to make energy, but little is known about the behavior of P when digested manure is applied to fields. Leaching experiments were performed using simulated rainfall on digester influent (undigested manure) and effluent (digested manure) collected from a dairy farm near Ithaca, NY. A previously published manure-P model was applied to the experimental data to quantify rates of P leaching. Dissolved P-leaching from digested and undigested manures were similar to each other, although digested manures appear to generally leach more dissolved P. Interestingly, both digester influent and effluent leached dissolved P more rapidly and in greater quantities than fresh manure, i. e., manure from a dairy barn floor. It is suggested that the key difference between the <b>liquid</b> <b>manures</b> in this study and "fresh manure" is that fresh manure has a higher solids content, i. e., it is less <b>liquid</b> than the <b>manure</b> used in anaerobic digesters. The findings of this study suggest that it is important to avoid field spreading of <b>liquid</b> <b>manures</b> when rainfall is imminent or fields are wet in order to prevent nonpoint P loading to streams and lakes...|$|R

The results demonstrated that <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> is a valuable resource of P for crop production and provided no evidence for lower season-long availability of P in manure compared with P in fertilizer.

60|$|While {{the family}} {{and two or three}} guests went to dinner, we walked out to see the place. The gardener, an Irishman, showed us through the garden, which is large and well cared for. They {{certainly}} get everything from Nature which she can possibly be persuaded to give them, here in England. There were peaches and pears growing against the high brick southern walls,--the trunk and branches of the trees being spread out perfectly flat against the wall, very much like the skin of a dead animal nailed up to dry, and not a single branch protruding. Figs were growing in the same way. The brick wall, very probably, was heated within, by means of pipes, in order to re-enforce the insufficient heat of the sun. It seems as if there must be something unreal and unsatisfactory in fruit that owes its existence to such artificial methods. Squashes were growing under glass, poor things! There were immensely large gooseberries in the garden; and in this particular berry, the English, I believe, have decidedly the advantage over ourselves. The raspberries, too, were large and good. I espied one gigantic hog-weed in the garden; and, really, my heart warmed to it, being strongly reminded of the principal product of my own garden at Concord. After viewing the garden sufficiently, the gardener led us {{to other parts of the}} estate, and we had glimpses of a delightful valley, its sides shady with beautiful trees, and a rich, grassy meadow at the bottom.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Maintenance {{and control}} of liquid levels in {{anaerobic}} lagoons and storage ponds is enhanced by pretreatment with liquid‐solid separation or periodic removal of accumulated sludges. Until local disposal or nutrient recycling options become available, sludges can be contained, dewatered, and stored using geotextile filtration. A geotextile filtration testing method termed a hanging‐bag {{test was used to}} treat dairy lagoon sludge, swine lagoon sludge, <b>liquid</b> dairy <b>manure,</b> and <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure.</b> Hanging‐bag performance was evaluated by: (1) determining solids and plant nutrient mass retention efficiencies (MRE), (2) quantifying the overall volume reduction, and (3) characterizing the dewatered manure. After three fill‐dewater cycles, geotextile filtration performed similarly for the sludges, retaining an average 87. 6 % of total solids (TS), 58. 4 % of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), and 86. 7 % total phosphorous (TP). Geotextile filtration was also effective in dewatering and concentrating the sludges; by highly concentrating the retained solids, it reduced the total influent sludge volume requiring disposal to less than 18. 5 %. Despite relatively high MRE values for <b>liquid</b> swine <b>manure</b> (70. 2 % of TS, 65. 1 % of TAN, and 75. 7 % of TP), geotextile filtration was ineffective as a primary liquid‐solid separation, with 60. 3 % of the total influent volume remaining. For <b>liquid</b> dairy <b>manure</b> (TS = 0. 71 %), geotextile filtration reduced the total influent volume to less than 1 %, concentrated the solids and nutrients in the dewatered material 16 to 21 times greater than the influent, and retained 38. 4 % of TS, 25. 8 % of TAN, and 45. 0 % of TP, making this an effective liquid‐solid separation technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to conduct a thorough accounting of energy used to transport <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> from farm storage to the field and to surface-apply the manure. Energy consumption was determined using both energy data from the literature plus data from field-scale research. Energy consumption was compared between two manure application systems (the drag hose and the slurry wagon systems) and two application timing treatments (single vs. twice-annual manure application). The single annual application of <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> applied at 81. 5 m 3  ha- 1 and transported 1. 8  km from storage to field consumed 2180 mJ ha- 1 with the drag hose system and 2185 mJ ha- 1 with the slurry wagon system. The twice-annual manure application regime used 2726 and 2209 mJ ha- 1 for the drag hose and slurry wagon systems, respectively. When energy use was calculated on the basis of MJ per kg of available N, <b>liquid</b> pig <b>manure</b> applied once annually with the slurry wagon system provided N at 17. 76 mJ kg- 1 of available N, which was 33 % of the energy cost of N from anhydrous ammonia and 23 % of the energy cost of N from urea. Manure transport distance could be increased to 8. 4  km before the energy cost per kg of available N from pig manure was equivalent to anhydrous ammonia, and up to 12. 3  km before the energy cost of manure N was equivalent to urea N.
