40|$|Palm oil {{production}} {{is currently the}} focus of contentious debate. On the one hand, it yields positive socio-economic impacts and {{can be a powerful}} engine for rural development. On the other hand, it can generate severe negative impacts regarding ecological and social sustainability. Sustainability concerns have spurred numerous efforts to introduce standards and certification schemes for palm oil, including ISPO (Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil) and RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil). Yet, potential large-scale ecological benefits of sustainability standards concerning reduced deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions are difficult to achieve. In order to make the palm oil sector more sustainable, it is essential to include the important group of smallholders in certification schemes. At the same time, smallholder certification is especially challenging as it demands capacities that smallholders often lack. This study presents findings from a research project on sustain­ability standards for smallholders in the Indonesian palm oil sector – focussing on the challenges and gaps of smallholder certification and the benefits that can be gained.

40|$|INTRODUCTION] The {{study is}} set in the context of: (a) overall weak farmer-buyer {{relations}} in most parts of Uganda’s agro-sector which affect the development prospects of small holder farmers (SHFs), and (b) a growing interest by the private and public sector, including the Government of Uganda (GOU) and development agencies in the contribution of value chain (VC) analysis and support interventions to economic development in the country. This study analyzes the governance of domestic value chains (DVCs) in the agricultural sector in Uganda. It focuses at exploring how agricultural produce buyers set up, coordinate and monitor - that is govern - the DVCs with their supplying farmers. Particularly how buyers govern the latter’s activities and performance and thus the division of labour in the DVC. Governance in this context constitutes for instance: (i) setting the requirements for farmers in terms of product quantity, quality and delivery, or production processes, (ii) monitoring compliance, and (iii) assisting farmers to meet the set requirements. This study focuses on such governance systems of various buyers which operate a DVC with SHFs. The buyers are called lead firms (LFs) of the DVC. The research was concerned with: the rationale and functioning of the business relation between the LF and SHFs, related benefits and costs as well as <b>lessons-learnt,</b> farmers’ upgrading as well as opportunities and challenges which will have to be addressed by the VC actors or call for assistance from for instance GOU and respective support institutions...|$|R

In doing such an evaluation, we believe the Coalition's work will be able to contribute to future advocacy efforts and cross-sectoral campaigns for issues of social justice. The CADIC Coalition's remit, on the rights of families comprised of Irish children, their migrant parents and other close family members, has meant concentrated efforts towards win-able propositions, and their impact, and it has harnessed the unique, collective expertise, commitment and passion of a diverse group of individuals and organisations. National, regional and local NGOs, spanning human rights, legal aid, children's rights, faith-based migrant support and other migrant and immigrant support organisations came together and brought pressure on Government and State agencies to review their policies and to uphold the rights of these children and their families. As part of the evaluation of CADIC, the Coalition sought to learn about good practice in coalition building in Ireland. A process was agreed to abstract learning from the review feedback and to generalise this learning to provide a <b>lessons-learnt</b> document for coalition-building in Ireland. This document presents learning acquired during the CADIC review as a practical and straightforward guide to enable coalitions or those individuals and organisations that are considering building a national coalition in Ireland become more effective.

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} {{rationale}} behind the shifts, ruptures and paradigm changes within the scholarship on peace-building. In particular, the thesis is concerned with examining if, and how, these shifts have significantly altered {{the manner in which}} the foundational elements of thinking about peace-building have changed beyond the ‘liberal peace-building’ paradigm. To do so, the thesis engages with the logic of critique that has led to the emergence of different theoretical approaches to peace-building that culminate with the ‘local turn’. The thesis begins by tracing an initial shift towards more invasive forms of peace-building in the late 1990 s-early 2000 s, before engaging with the emergence of the local turn. The research focuses on the case of Kosovo in order to understand how a <b>lessons-learnt</b> approach facilitated the shift towards more invasive and intrusive forms of peace-building, which can be understood less as a deep reconceptualisation of the manner of conducting peace-building operations and more as a refinement of methods of socio-political engineering from the outside. Furthermore, the case of Kosovo is also central to the local turn, as the rise of local ownership discourses is fundamentally tied to the critiques of the extensive international mission in the territory, and of its by-products, particularly resistance and marginalisation of local agency. Along with an assessment of the theoretical underpinnings of the shift towards post-liberal, relational and non-linear approaches to bottom-up peace-building, the thesis examines the implications of the framing of the ‘everyday’ in order to assess the extent to which these bottom-up approaches have been able to by-pass the problems attributed to the liberal peace approach. By looking at its normative project of change, the thesis argues that despite its critical and radical intentions the local turn retains certain foundational epistemological and ontological elements of modernist and positivist approaches that have so far characterised the very mainstream approaches these critiques claim to transcend...|$|R
40|$|Warning systems {{commonly}} {{use information}} provided by networks of sensors able to monitor and detect impending disasters, aggregate and condense these information to provide reliable information to a decision maker whether to warn or not, disseminates the warning message and provide this information to people at risk. Ultimate aim is to enable those in danger to make decisions (e. g. initiate protective actions for buildings) and {{to take action to}} safe their lives. This involves very complex issues when considering all four elements of early warning systems (UNISDR-PPEW), namely (1) risk knowledge, (2) monitoring and warning service, (3) dissemination and communication, (4) response capability with the ultimate aim to gain as much time as possible to empower individuals and communities to act in an appropriate manner to reduce injury, loss of life, damage to property and the environment and loss of livelihoods. Commonly most warning systems feature strengths and main attention on the technical/structural dimension (monitoring & warning service, dissemination tools) with weaknesses and less attention on social/cultural dimension (e. g. human response capabilities, defined warning chain to and knowing what to do by the people). Also, the use of risk knowledge in early warning most often is treated in a theoretical manner (knowing that it is somehow important), yet less in an operational, practical sense. Risk assessments and risk maps help to motivate people, prioritise early warning system needs and guide preparations for response and disaster prevention activities. Beyond this risk knowledge {{can be seen as a}} tie between national level early warning and community level reaction schemes. This presentation focuses on results, key findings and <b>lessons-learnt</b> related to tsunami risk assessment in the context of early warning within the GITEWS (German-Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning) project. Here a novel methodology reflecting risk information needs in the early warning context has been worked out. The generated results contribute significantly in the fields of (1) warning decision and warning levels, (2) warning dissemination and warning message content, (3) early warning chain planning, (4) increasing response capabilities and protective systems, (5) emergency relief and (6) enhancing communities’ awareness and preparedness towards tsunami threats. Additionally examples will be given on the potentials of an operational use of risk information in early warning systems as first experiences exist for the tsunami early warning center in Jakarta, Indonesia. Beside this the importance of linking national level early warning information with tsunami risk information available at the local level (e. g. linking warning message information on expected intensity with respective tsunami hazard zone maps at community level for effective evacuation) will be demonstrated through experiences gained in three pilot areas in Indonesia. The presentation seeks to provide new insights on benefits using risk information in early warning and will provide further evidence that practical use of risk information is an important and indispensable component of end-to-end early warning...|$|R

40|$|The entire {{relations}} between the decolonization issue and the European integration has not been studied well so far, especially from the Asian perspective. Besides, European integration was not only an internal European affair, it was deeply affected or even sped up by {{the changes in the}} {{relations between}} in colonial centers and peripheries or even West Europe and the colonized world in total. For this reason, the first Indochina War in my research may serve as one of the striking cases to be investigated. Together {{with the end of the}} World War II, other events occurring in the late 1940 s and early 1950 s such as the establishment of the Peoples Republic of China (1949), the outbreak of the Korean War (1950), the emergence of the Cold War, etc have changed the entire structure of the world politics and international relations. Under this circumstance, the relation between France and West Germany was indeed to be re-defined. As a matter of fact, the colonized world was also much influenced. Within this context, European framework at that time was not shaped yet and Europe was still on the move of economic and political reconstruction. Although main colonial powers (France and Britain) were weakened after the World War II, France was in dilemma in between recolonization and European integration. To some extent, France ignored the de facto decolonization that would be unavoidable tendency all over the colonized world. In many French leaders minds, recolonization and thus, owning colonies are considered a part of their foreign policy and empire. For West Germany, after the formation of the Federal Republic, top leaders or representatives of different political groups were searching for the reorganization of their state which would be different from what had existed in the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich. Additionally, political ideas of European policy were not yet set up in West Germany. The problem is that under what dimension the Federal Republic should be or should push forwards? How diverse political parties should act in future? How the problem of the German reunification should be resolved? All the above-mentioned issues set the basis for the official attitudes of the federal government headed by Dr. Konrad Adenauer and other political and religious groups. The first Indochina War produced a huge media event in West Germany in the early 1950 s. Accordingly, the West German media reflected the public view of the West German society and culture in the early 1950 s on happenings inside and outside Europe. These views may help West German politicians and the society re-define the entire position of West Germany in the 1950 s and the decades that followed. Rooted from the impacts of the French decolonization in Indochina and other crucial events in Europe and Africa, some <b>lessons-learnt</b> were figured out for West Germany: firstly, the German-Franco reconciliation (Élysée Treaty 1963); secondly, West German (further) integration into the Western institutions; thirdly, the West German policy towards the Third World countries; fourthly, the emergence of the New Left in the FRG. Finally, by giving a humble explanation to postcolonial theory, in my thesis the French decolonization in Indochina was a tool to understand the relations between France and West Germany. They were the fundament for a common interpretation of defeat and losses which deeply influenced the interactions of the contemporary leading politicians  for Germany, the collapse of its world power aspirations and the establishment of more than one German state, for France the defeat against Germany and the following collapse of its colonial empire. For that, decolonization was used to explore new interactions of the world entangled. The influence of the French decolonization in Indochina on France, West Germany in particular and on Europe in general as the decolonization has sped up the process of the European integration since the 1950 s...|$|R

This thesis analyzes two NDI Acquisition programs, the SGT York and Avenger Air Defense Systems, to determine what factors made SGT York a failure and Avenger a success. From this analysis, <b>lessons-learned</b> are identified {{that can be used}} by other acquisition managers and their staffs to effectively manage future programs. Significant <b>lessons-learned</b> indicate that the maturity of the system, high-level support, media support, and program manager skilled at properly tailoring an NDI program are {{critical to the success of}} an NDI program.
