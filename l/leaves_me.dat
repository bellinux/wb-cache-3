5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that the more I worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

The sheer idiocy (and impossibility) of having a fully fueled shuttle on the back of the Boeing during the trans-Atlantic crossing should be evident, and later in the film, the whole Jaws-falls-in-love and becomes a 'good guy' routine <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> rather cold, and provides far too much cheesy comedy moments, as does the gondola driving through the square scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Mosley has {{described}} it as [...] "a lively type, underappreciated I think." [...] LTC's digitisation deliberately maintained its eccentricity and irregularity true to period printing, avoiding perfect verticals. In 1923, Morison at the British branch of Monotype thought it somewhat florid {{in comparison to the}} version of his branch which he considered a personal project, noting in a 1923 letter to American printer Daniel Berkeley Updike that [...] "I entertain very decided opinions about this latest of Mr. Goudy's achievements... a comparison <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> with a preference for our version." [...] He added that he [...] "could not bring myself to believe" [...] that Garamond himself had cut the swash capitals that [...] "Mr. Goudy has done his best to reproduce".|$|E

500|$|Lost Horizons {{opens with}} [...] "Elements", which [...] "blends {{acoustic}} guitars, flugelhorns, synths, skittering breakbeat rhythms, a folksy harmonica, and ... a falsetto 'doo-doo' chorus". Overlaying {{the music is}} a voiceover, courtesy of English actor John Standing, that lists the basic 'elements' {{that make up the}} world: ash, metal, water, wood, fire, and (eventually, later in the song) sky. The second track, [...] "Space Walk", is set to a recording of Ed White's 1965 space walk on the Gemini 4 mission. Franglen and Deakin chose to use the sample after listening to an album called Flight to the Moon (1969); the two were struck by how moving and emotive many of the tracks were. Deakin later said, [...] "'One small step' <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> cold, because it was so obviously scripted. But the spacewalk… even after hearing it so many times, it's so vivid." ...|$|E
500|$|Converge {{took their}} {{music in a}} more {{progressive}} direction with Axe to Fall. Kurt Ballou noted that drummer Ben Koller had been listening to more progressive rock {{over the last few}} years, and that he tried to complement this sound on the guitar. He {{went on to say that}} he was getting the [...] "more straightforward, raw punk aggression out in a yet-to be named hardcore side project that I started. So that <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> free to get weird and progressive with Converge." [...] Ballou considers the band's previous three albums (Jane Doe, You Fail Me and No Heroes) to be a trilogy in regards to their sound, and hoped to push their musical boundaries on Axe to Fall. The tracks on the album have been noted to range from [...] "drone-and-pummel" [...] to atmospheric. Jacob Bannon believes this album is [...] "not about being as loud and vicious as possible." [...] Feeling that 40–50 minutes of metallic hardcore can be difficult to listen to for some, Converge used softer tracks, or [...] "slow jams," [...] such as [...] "Damages" [...] and [...] "Wretched World" [...] to take the listener [...] "to some other places." ...|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} the album [...] "offers up another batch of great, club-ready songs that are a touch too weird for American hit radio. Robyn sings and raps about {{standard}} diva themes (dance-floor ecstasy, self-reliance), but the music is deliciously wacked-out." [...] Pitchfork's Joe Colly felt the album needed a [...] "classic single on par with 'Dancing on My Own' or ' Heartbeat'", but concluded, [...] "Minor quibbles and missteps aside, Body Talk Pt. 2 is a perfectly solid—and occasionally awesome—record." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that through the album, Robyn proves [...] "that stylish, cutting-edge pop doesn't have to be competitive or egotistical." [...] Adam Johns of Drowned in Sound was mixed in his review, writing that [...] "While it's a fairly remarkable piece of craft, her icy disco diversion here <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> somewhat flat [...] It should satisfy the listeners who primarily show up for Creative Robyn." [...] Luke Winkie of musicOMH wrote a mixed review as well, saying that [...] "Pt 2 doesn't have the same feel it's as if Robyn may have exhausted her supply of great songs too soon. It has its moments, but in general just doesn't compare to Pt 1." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Proposition Infinity" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "This is the series I've {{been missing for}} years. It was goofy, spastic, over-stuffed, occasionally cruel, and bizarrely sincere." [...] He graded the episode A-, praising the [...] "No on Infinity" [...] ad parody and reappearances of George Takei and Hedonismbot in particular. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote: [...] "I’d {{like to see them}} lay off the contemporary commentary episodes for a bit, but other than that it was exactly what any fan of the show would hope for." [...] Danny Gallagher of TVSquad stated that the episode's [...] "robotic take on the needless hysteria and blatant hypocricy [...] of gay marriage was not only steeped in satiric goodness, but it was downright hilarious." [...] He felt that the episode's writing was an improvement over the previous episodes in the season and that it [...] "really used the storied and rich history of the characters to its advantage." [...] In particular, Gallagher praised Takei's cameo as one of the episode's funniest, even stating it {{to be one of the}} series' best. [...] Alasdair Wilkins of io9 also praised the episode, calling it [...] "a triumph for the new Futurama, and just the sort of episode that <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> convinced that the show's revival was completely worthwhile." [...] Michelle Castillo of Television on Today enjoyed the attack on California Proposition 8, stating that the episode [...] "poked fun at the issues in the unique way that only 'Futurama' can pull off." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph McCabe of Nerdist stated on the episode, [...] "This week’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is so {{good that}} it <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> {{in a state of}} pessimism. Because I can’t see any way to follow it up that gives a {{satisfying}} resolution to the story it so beautifully presents." [...] He called it [...] "one of the very finest episodes S.H.I.E.L.D. has given us, {{and one of the few}} a viewer with almost no prior knowledge of the show can fully appreciate", and praised the handling of Simmons' and Daniels' relationship, saying that Henstridge and Casey [...] "complement one another marvelously". Discussing the episode for Vox, Caroline Framke called it [...] "astonishing", praising the decision to dedicate an episode to Simmons' ordeal rather than just reveal it through flashbacks in [...] "normal" [...] episodes, as well as the efforts of Bochco, Titley, and Henstridge, and the use of the [...] "sinister" [...] on-screen hour counter. Also reviewing the episode for Den of Geek, Marc Buxton scored it 4.5 stars out 5, calling it [...] "the most experimental episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date, and ... it might have been the finest hour of the series so far". Buxton felt that the episode retroactively improved the earlier season three episodes, which he had called [...] "anticlimactic" [...] due to their handling of Simmons' storyline, and praised Henstridge's performance. He also positively compared the episode's villain, which he described as [...] "hard to grasp, mysterious, and ever present", to [...] "the best Steven Moffat Doctor Who villains".|$|E

The first line {{she came up with}} was [...] "lung of love, <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> breathless"; thus the Details album track [...] "Flicks" [...] was born. A week later, Sigsworth phoned her again and together they wrote and recorded [...] "Breathe In", which would eventually become the first Frou Frou single.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{concept for}} Frou Frou was Sigsworth's, {{and the project}} {{was to have been}} an album written and {{produced}} by her with each track featuring a different singer, songwriter, poet or rapper. Heap explains that Sigsworth invited her over to his studio to write lyrics to a four-bar motif he had, with one condition – that she include the word [...] "love" [...] somewhere. The first line she came up with was [...] "lung of love, <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> breathless", and the Details album track, [...] "Flicks" [...] was written.

2500|$|When the Allies {{advanced}} {{into the}} Netherlands in late 1944, the Nazi regime {{had attempted to}} enact a scorched earth policy, and some docks and harbours were destroyed.

At {{the very end of the}} [...] "hunger winter" [...] in April 1945, Seyss-Inquart was with difficulty persuaded by the Allies to allow airplanes to drop food for the hungry people of the occupied north-west of the country.
