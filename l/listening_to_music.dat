40|$|In {{this text}} {{we wanted to}} {{research}} which kind of <b>music</b> youths <b>listen</b> <b>to,</b> why they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> and how they <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music.</b> We were interested {{to find out how}} music effects them positively and negatively. We chose to interview 14 students attending middle- and highschool, both girls and boys, to find out how youths <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> and how they perceive that music effects them. We concluded in our interview study that youths <b>listen</b> extensively <b>to</b> <b>music.</b> We could clearly see that our informants use music in different ways. Many informants use <b>music</b> <b>to</b> enhance their feelings and many use <b>music</b> <b>to</b> increase their ability to concentrate. It is also evident that the informants use different kinds of music for different situations and contexts, for example when they are sad they want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> happy <b>music</b> or when they are doing sports they want <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>music</b> with a high tempo to endure and to want more.

5|$|A horse's {{hearing is}} good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the {{potential}} for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had {{a higher rate of}} gastric ulcers than horses <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music,</b> and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.|$|E

5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms {{at each end of}} the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>music,</b> reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For over thirty days, the Chili Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, the Chili Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E
