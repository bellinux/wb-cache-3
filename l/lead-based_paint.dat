5|$|Poisoning {{typically}} {{results from}} ingestion of {{food or water}} contaminated with lead, and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil, dust, or <b>lead-based</b> <b>paint.</b> Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters. Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in. Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes, lead paint, and residual emissions from leaded gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had <b>lead-based</b> <b>paint,</b> down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E
25|$|Lead poisoning* is {{uncommon}} in dogs. Exposure to lead is from eating paint chips from <b>lead-based</b> <b>paint</b> (found in houses painted prior to 1950), and eating lead {{objects such as}} shot, fishing sinkers, or counterweights.

40|$|Abstract: In the US the {{dominant}} {{sources of lead}} {{through much of the}} 20 th Century (eg, vehicular emissions, plumbing, household paint) have been significantly diminished. The reductions in adult and pediatric average blood lead levels in the US have been extraordinary. Progress continues: the US Environmental Protection Agency recently developed a new air standard for lead. In the 21 st Century, the average blood lead level in a society may be seen as a marker of the status of their public’s health. However, the threat of lead exposure remains a significant public health problem among subpopulation groups in the US and in many less developed countries. This paper examines some of the specific issues involved in the reduction of blood lead in a post-industrial era. These involve the control of the remaining exogenous primary sources, both general (eg, industrial emissions) and specific (eg, at-risk occupations), exogenous secondary sources (eg, contaminated urban soils, legacy <b>lead-based</b> <b>paints),</b> an endogenous source (ie, cumulative body lead burden) and emergent sources...|$|R

50|$|A local {{fruiterer}} and restaurateur, William (Bill) Hodge, who {{had joined}} the Lodge in 1920, was Master in 1924-25. In 1925 he began a project to embellish the temple that was to take nine years to complete. Working mainly in the evenings he painted trompe l'oeil murals on all four internal walls of the lodge room. These murals are replicas of those that decorated the Masonic Temple at the Criterion Restaurant, London and were featured {{in an article in}} the September 1921 edition of an English Masonic magazine, the Masonic Record. Using the small black and white photographs accompanying the article as a guide, Hodge reproduced the scenes of classical and biblical architecture on the walls of the Pomona temple. Between 1925 and 1928 he painted the Eastern and Western walls and between 1932 and 1934 the southern and northern walls. Hodge mixed the <b>lead-based</b> <b>paints</b> himself, using a neutral palette of beige, grey, black and white. During both periods he worked by kerosene light, as electricity was not supplied to Pomona until 1941. Hodge died in 1949 and is buried in Pomona cemetery.|$|R

40|$|Lead occurs {{naturally}} in soils {{but may be}} significantly elevated in areas impacted by human activities. High soil lead levels in New England are primarily associated with the past use of <b>lead-based</b> <b>paints,</b> leaded gasoline and lead-arsenate insecticides. Occasionally, they {{may be due to}} scrap metal disposal or previous industrial use. These lead-containing products have been taken off the market decades ago but lead is a persistent pollutant and will remain in the soil almost indefinitely. In certain situations soils contaminated with lead can present a human health risk. Lead poisoning can affect all age groups but children are particularly at risk because they most commonly engage in hand-to-mouth activities through which lead can be ingested. Soils used for edible plant production are a concern with regards to the level of lead in the soil as well as the potential for lead to be taken up by plants. Inhaling dust while playing or gardening in contaminated soil is also an ingestion pathway. Because of the potentially severe mental and physical effects of lead poisoning, soil testing laboratories routinely receive requests for lead testing. Total soil lead tests involve the use of hazardous chemicals and the purchase of equipment not typically used for routine soil fertilit...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{composition}} of the paints used on works of art is crucial in attributing them to the artist or workshop that created them, as well as to devising strategies for their preservation and restoration. Much current research is focussed on the development of non-invasive spectroscopic methods, enabling in situ paint analysis without the need for sampling. However, whilst a lot of work has been carried out on looking at {{the composition}} of artists' materials qualitatively, little has been performed to analyse them quantitatively. In this work, we investigate the use of Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy, in isolation and in conjunction with complementary fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy, to look at the spectral changes that occur with varying the paint/binder ratio in model historic <b>lead-based</b> <b>paints.</b> When used in conjunction with multivariate analysis, we demonstrate that it can be possible to obtain a semi-quantitative estimation of {{the composition of}} a paint film from its Fourier transform Raman spectrum, given a set of suitable reference spectra recorded from paints produced within the workable mixture range.

30|$|The {{concentration}} range of trace {{elements such as}} Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn {{were found in the}} collected leachate samples and are also reported in Table  2. Fresh leachate samples showed a higher degree of metal solubilization, due to lower pH values caused by the biological production of organic fatty acids. As the dumping site age increased, the consequent increase in pH values caused a certain decrease in metal solubility (Mohan and Gandhimathi 2009). The stabilized leachate samples have less concentration when compared to fresh leachate samples. The concentration of Zn (4.80  mg/L) in the leachate shows that the dumping site receives waste from batteries and fluorescent lamps. The presence of Pb in the leachate samples are in the range 1.85 – 5.15  mg/L. The possible source of lead may be batteries, chemicals for photograph processing, older <b>lead-based</b> <b>paints</b> and lead pipes disposed at the landfill, which indicates toxicity to all forms of life at this level. Acidity in the leachate causes lead to be released from refuse (Al-Yaqout 2003). Cd (1.4  mg/L) and Cu (1.92  mg/L) are also present in the leachate samples whereas high Mn (8.18  mg/L) concentrations suggest a strong reducing environment. A variety of waste is dumped at Ariyamangalam open dump site, which likely indicate the origin of Mn, Pb, Cu, Cd, and Fe in leachate.|$|R
