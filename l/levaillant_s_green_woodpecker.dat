50|$|The grey-headed {{woodpecker}} is more demanding than the European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{in terms of}} its habitat. It prefers old mixed coniferous forest with a high proportion of dead trees, feeding primarily on ants, although not being as exclusively dependent on this group as the <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The {{grey-headed woodpecker}}'s nest is typically excavated into dead or severely damaged trees.|$|R

50|$|The grey-headed {{woodpecker}} (Picus canus), {{also known as}} the grey-faced woodpecker, is a Eurasian member of the woodpecker family, Picidae. Along with the more commonly found European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and the Iberian <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> it is one of three closely related sister species found in Europe. Its distribution stretches across large parts of the central and Eastern Palaearctic, {{all the way to the}} Pacific Ocean.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed {{woodpecker}} is a somewhat less specialised ant hunter than the European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> In its foraging strategy it is intermediate between many Dendrocopos {{species on the}} one hand, and the often ant-specific members of the genus Picus. This reduced ant specialisation of the {{grey-headed woodpecker}} allows it to be sympatric with European <b>green</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and even to breed at about 100 meters from them.|$|R

5000|$|... 'Professor Yaffle', {{the wooden}} bookend {{character}} in the 1974 children's animation series Bagpuss, was based loosely upon the <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> 'Yaffle' was among many English folk names for the European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> relating to its laughing call; others include laughing Betsey, yaffingale, yappingale and Jack Eikle. Other names, including rain-bird, weather cock and wet bird, suggest its supposed ability to bring on rain. Other names include nickle, and nicker pecker. The species {{has been the subject}} of postage stamps from several countries. The European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is associated with Woodpecker Cider, an image of the bird is used on the merchandise. The woodpecker was the totem of the Italic tribe of the Picentes, and features of the coat of arms and flag of the Italian region of Marche.|$|R
5000|$|Calls {{made by the}} European <b>green</b> <b>{{woodpecker}}</b> and {{grey-headed woodpecker}} resemble each other. The far-carrying territorial song of the grey-headed woodpecker is more melodic and cleaner than the explosive [...] "laughter" [...] of the <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The call series consists of ten to fifteen utterances of declining pitch and gradual slowing. The verse may appear melancholic and [...] "dying". The territorial song of females is similar, but somewhat quieter, less melodious, but more croaky and often shorter.|$|R

50|$|The main food of the European <b>green</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is ants {{of the genera}} Lasius and Formica {{for which}} it spends much of its time {{foraging}} on the ground, though other insects and small reptiles are also taken occasionally. The bird's distinctive, elongated, cylindrical droppings often consist entirely of ant remains. At ant nests, it probes {{into the ground and}} licks up adult ants and their larvae. They have tongues that wrap to the back of their head. <b>Green</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> will often forage in short grazed or mown permanent grasslands where the availability of ant nests is high.|$|R
