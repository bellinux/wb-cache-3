However, little of that work proved to have lasting significance. Today, Lexis is largely remembered for two items that bear his name—the <b>Lexis</b> <b>ratio</b> and the Lexis diagram. His theory of mortality has also enjoyed a recent revival of interest.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Lexis</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is used in}} {{statistics}} as {{a measure}} which seeks to evaluate differences between the statistical properties of random mechanisms where the outcome is two-valued [...] - [...] for example [...] "success" [...] or [...] "failure", [...] "win" [...] or [...] "lose". The {{idea is that the}} probability of success might vary between different sets of trials in different situations.|$|E

The Oxford Dictionary of Statistics cites {{him as a}} [...] "pioneer of the {{analysis}} of demographic time series". [...] Lexis is largely remembered for two items that bear his name—the <b>Lexis</b> <b>ratio</b> and the Lexis diagram.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 1876, Lexis was {{the chair}} of the Economics Department at the University of Freiburg. The various papers written by him during his eight-year tenure at Freiburg were, in the eyes of {{statistics}} historian Stephen Stigler, [...] "his most important statistical work". Foremost among them was the 1879 paper [...] "On the Theory of the Stability of Statistical Series", which introduced the quantity now often called the <b>Lexis</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
30|$|Such {{practical}} situations {{have been}} noticed since {{over a century}} ago (e.g. Lexis [1879]; Student [1919]). The <b>Lexis</b> <b>ratio</b> {{appears to be the}} first statistic suggested for testing for the presence of over- or under-dispersion relative to a binomial hypothesized model in populations structured in clusters. Also, for count data, Fisher ([1950]) considered using the sample index of dispersion for testing the appropriateness of a Poisson distribution for an observed variable Y.|$|E
