40|$|Cash flow is {{the life}} blood of the {{construction}} industry and basically cash flow is majorly contributed by payment that gain. Unfortunately, <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> becomes a habit {{in the construction industry}} and this practice could turn the construction company to many implications such as bankruptcy, the higher the contract sum due to the risk, uncomfortable relationship between the payer and payee, disturbance supply chain and others. The objectives of this master project are to study the construction industry payment scenario, impact of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> to contractors, to identify the factors of <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> in the construction industry and to identify methods for tackling <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> in the construction industry. Literature review by performing focusing on issues related to <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and primary data were collected by distributing 100 sets of questionnaires based on convenience sampling. The collected data were analysed by using frequency distribution and relative important index. The results of the study show that the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> {{is one of the most}} critical problems in the Malaysian construction industry. The majority of the contractor experienced <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> quite frequently and even beyond the stipulated term. The top 3 impact of the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> problems is the negative chain effect on other parties, results in delay in completion projects and leads to bankruptcy or liquidation. The top 3 factors that contribute to the <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> problem are disagree with the valuation of work done, technical problem and conflict among parties involve. The top 3 method for tackling <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> problem are uses of technology, sector based approaches and fair and clear payments practice...|$|R

25|$|Japan has various laws restricting {{interest}} rates. Under civil law, {{the maximum}} interest rate is between 15% and 20% per year depending upon the principal amount (larger amounts having a lower maximum rate). Interest in excess of 20% is subject to criminal penalties (the criminal law maximum was 29.2% until it was lowered by legislation in 2010). Default interest on <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> may be charged at up to 1.46 times the ordinary maximum (i.e., 21.9% to 29.2%), while pawn shops may charge interest of up to 9% per month (i.e., 108% per year).|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{potential}} ethics violations arose over {{use of a}} state {{cell phone}} and state vehicle for personal use. Soon after, a previously tabled bill in the legislature that would change Bunn’s office to an appointed position in lieu of an election was reintroduced. The legislation never made it into law. While an ethics investigation was pending, it came to light in 2001 that Bunn was delinquent on almost $15,000 in property taxes. The taxes were owed in two counties, some {{as far back as}} 1997, with one property facing foreclosure by the county. County records disclosed a pattern of <b>late</b> <b>payments</b> on property taxes dating to as early as 1992. Bunn paid all the back taxes, including interest, and apologized for the transgression, blaming it partly on a change of address due to selling his law firm and on not having the money after leaving private legal practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} {{corporate}} failure, {{at least in}} the market segment of the economy, all begin of the creation of credit and debt. Occasionally excessive debts are run up through outright embezzlement of the company's assets or fraud by the people who run the business. Negligent mismanagement, which is found to breach the duty of care, is also sometimes found. More frequently, companies go insolvent because of <b>late</b> <b>payments.</b> Another business on which the company relied for credit or supplies could also be in financial distress, and a string of failures could be part of a broader macroeconomic depression. Periodically, insolvencies occur because technology changes which outdates lines of business. Most frequently, however, businesses are forced into insolvency simply because they are out-competed. In an economy organised around market competition, and where competition presupposes losers or contemplates excess, insolvencies necessarily happen. The variety of causes for corporate failure means that the law requires different responses to the particular issues, and this is reflected in the legal meaning of insolvency.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are examined {{in an analysis}} of habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> of trade credit by UK small firms. Multivariate logistic regression is employed to test the influence of variables expected to discriminate between small firms which pay late habitually and those which never or only occasionally pay late. Case studies extend quantitative analysis by validating interpretation of the results and providing explanations for unexpected outcomes. The results provide strong evidence of a financing demand for habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment.</b> There is a positive relationship between habitual <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and difficulty obtaining bank finance and <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> by debtors and a negative relationship with the use of long term sources of finance. The influence of relationships between customer and supplier is shown to be complex. A concentrated supplier base is shown to be positively associated with <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> and case studies provide evidence that this is because increased knowledge of suppliers' credit management procedures is used to pay late without penalties. The implications of this result for the large number of firms that do not enforce their statutory right to interest on <b>late</b> <b>payment</b> are highlighted.
