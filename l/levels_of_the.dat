5|$|Dietary {{selenium}} {{comes from}} nuts, cereals and mushrooms. Brazil nuts are the richest dietary source (though this is soil-dependent, since the Brazil nut {{does not require}} high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> element for its own needs).|$|E
5|$|In TgPVR1 mice, the {{transgene}} encoding {{the human}} PVR {{was incorporated into}} mouse chromosome 4. These mice express the highest <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transgene and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, intracerebral, intramuscular, and intravenous pathways, but not through the oral route.|$|E
5|$|In diurnal animals, it {{is typical}} for blood <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hormone cortisol—which {{is used to}} {{increase}} blood sugar and aid metabolism and is also produced in response to stress—to be most stable in the afternoon after decreasing throughout the morning. However, cortisol levels are also the most reactive to environmental changes unrelated to sleep and daylight during the afternoon. As a result, {{this time of day}} is considered optimal for researchers studying stress and hormone levels. Plants generally have their highest photosynthetic <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day at noon and in the early afternoon, owing to the sun's high angle in the sky. The large proliferation of maize crops across Earth has caused tiny, harmless fluctuations in the normal pattern of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, since these crops photosynthesize large amounts of carbon dioxide during these times and this process sharply drops down during the late afternoon and evening.|$|E
