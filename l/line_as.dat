5000|$|Perhaps as {{a symptom}} of the {{theoretical}} nature of heraldic stains, the hatchings assigned to these have been inconsistent among sources.

5|$|Atomic sodium has a {{very strong}} {{spectral}} line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same <b>line</b> <b>as</b> is used in sodium vapour street lights).

The line was first studied in 1814 by Joseph von Fraunhofer during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the Fraunhofer lines. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely-spaced lines split by fine and hyperfine structure.|$|E

The Georgia introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern screw propeller instead of old-fashioned side paddlewheels and the Alabama launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay <b>Line</b> <b>as</b> president for 26years (1867–1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.|$|E
