40|$|Recovering {{wood for}} reuse {{in a new}} house affects energy and {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. This paper finds the energy and emissions for recovering softwood <b>framing</b> <b>lumber</b> and hardwood flooring from an old house for installation in a new house. Recovering wood displaces primary production of new wood products and avoids the end-of-life (EOL) burdens for the old house. We used a cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis and examined the EOL burdens for the wood products when disposed of including the effect of biogenic CO 2. Results showed that recovering softwood <b>framing</b> <b>lumber</b> and hardwood flooring for reuse consumed 320 and 761 MJ/m 3 while displacing primary production energy of 6, 467 and 7, 763 MJ/m 3, respectively. Burning wood for energy at EOL avoided coal power production. GWP increased by two to four times when including biogenic CO 2.

50|$|In {{order for}} an astrophotographer {{to capture a}} <b>light</b> <b>frame,</b> {{he or she must}} place a light source over the imaging instrument's {{objective}} lens such that the light source emanates evenly through the users optics. The photographer must then adjust the exposure of their imaging device (CCD or DSLR camera) so that when the histogram of the image is viewed, a peak reaching about 40 - 70% of the dynamic range (maximum range of pixel values) of the imaging device is seen. The photographer typically takes 15 - 20 <b>light</b> <b>frames</b> and performs median stacking. Once the desired <b>light</b> <b>frames</b> are acquired, the objective lens is covered so that no light is allowed in, then 15 - 20 dark frames are taken, each of equal exposure time as a <b>light</b> <b>frame.</b> These are called Dark-Flat frames.|$|R

50|$|Milliken-Smith Farm is a {{historic}} home and farm complex located at Montgomery in Orange County, New York.

The resin is used to produce Canada balsam, and was traditionally used as a cold remedy and as a glue for glasses, optical instrument components, and for preparing permanent mounts of microscope specimens. Given its use as a traditional remedy and the relatively high ascorbic acid content of its needles, historian Jacques Mathieu {{has argued that the}} balsam fir was the [...] "aneda" [...] that cured scurvy during the second expedition into Canada of Jacques Cartier. The wood is milled for <b>framing</b> <b>lumber</b> (part of SPF lumber), siding and pulped for paper manufacture. Balsam fir oil is an EPA approved nontoxic rodent repellent. The balsam fir is also used as an air freshener and as incense.|$|R

50|$|The Lepanto Commercial Historic District {{encompasses}} the traditional commercial {{heart of the}} small city of Lepanto, Arkansas. The district includes one block of Greenwood Avenue between Berry and Holmes Streets, and portions of two more blocks at either end, {{as well as two}} blocks of Berry Street, with a few buildings on adjacent streets. Lepanto was founded in 1903, but its surviving commercial architecture only dates as far back as c. 1915, when the Portis Company cotton gin was built at the eastern end of the district. Other early buildings include the triangular c. 1920 Arlington Light and Power building at 320 Greenwood, and the unusual Barton's of Lepanto building at 111 Berny Street, built as a wood <b>frame</b> <b>lumber</b> yard office c. 1920; its walls were bricked in 1955 when it was converted to a hardware store.|$|R
50|$|Vinyl siding {{features}} a chlorine base, making it inherently slow to ignite and flame retardant. All organic materials (that is, anything containing carbon) will ignite, but {{the higher the}} temperature a material has to reach before it flames, the safer it is. PVC won’t ignite, even from another flame, until it reaches about 730°F (387°C) and won’t self-ignite until about 850°F (454°C). Those ignition temperatures are significantly higher than common <b>framing</b> <b>lumber,</b> which ignites from a flame at 500°F (260°C) and self-ignites at 770°F (410°C). Also, ASTM D2863 tests show that rigid PVC’s high Limiting Oxygen Index means that it needs unusually high amounts of oxygen to burn and stay burning. Rigid PVC (vinyl siding) will not independently sustain combustion in air with a normal concentration of oxygen (about 21 percent) — so it extinguishes more easily.|$|R
