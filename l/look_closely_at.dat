25|$|However, {{there are}} {{circumstances}} where the courts accept that procedural protections {{should be more}} limited or even placed in abeyance, {{and this is a}} function of context. This is especially so in matters of national security where the sensitivity of such matters demands that the courts do not <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> government decisions to limit procedural rights. In wartime, the case of Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) is regarded to be of great constitutional significance. The House of Lords found that there could be no inquiry into whether there were reasonable grounds for the detention of the appellant as it was a subjective matter for the Home Security to determine, as prescribed by legislation. However, in Lord Atkin's acclaimed dissenting judgment, he refused to endorse this construction of the law. Lord Atkin's judgment is now taken as the correct decision, where every imprisonment is prima facie illegal until justified by the arresting authority. Nonetheless, national security is still an important issue that can and does limit procedural protection in certain cases.|$|E

I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has stuck his thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

2500|$|U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena, {{appealed to}} federal {{prosecutors}} to scrutinize the widespread political corruption in Los Angeles County. [...] At least six other cities where {{officials have been}} recently charged with corruption include Irwindale, La Puente, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Temple City, and Vernon. [...] "A much more rigorous focus is obviously merited by events", Schiff said, citing statutes that specifically aim at scams involving [...] taxpayer dollars. [...] "Some of these cases are difficult to prosecute (at the local level) and where the U.S. Attorney does very well is chasing it down."

2500|$|Critics have disputed Ehrlich's main thesis about {{overpopulation}} and {{its effects}} on the environment and human society, and his solutions, {{as well as some of}} his specific predictions made since the late 1960s. One criticism concerns Ehrlich's allegedly alarmist and sensational statements and inaccurate [...] "predictions". Ronald Bailey of Reason Magazine has termed him an [...] "irrepressible doomster... who, as far as I can tell, has never been right in any of his forecasts of imminent catastrophe." [...] On the first Earth Day in 1970, he warned that [...] "n ten years all important animal life in the sea will be extinct. Large areas of coastline will have to be evacuated because of the stench of dead fish." [...] In a 1971 speech, he predicted that: [...] "By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people." [...] "If I were a gambler," [...] Professor Ehrlich concluded before boarding an airplane, [...] " [...] I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000."

However, if you <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> England, what can I tell you? They're having all kinds of problems, just like everybody else."

2500|$|A compass {{should be}} laid {{down on a}} level surface so that the needle only rests or hangs on the bearing fused to the compass casing – if used at a tilt, the needle might touch the casing on the compass and not move freely, hence not {{pointing}} to the magnetic north accurately, giving a faulty reading. To see if the needle is well leveled, <b>look</b> <b>closely</b> <b>at</b> the needle, and tilt it slightly {{to see if the}} needle is swaying side to side freely and the needle is not contacting the casing of the compass. If the needle tilts to one direction, tilt the compass slightly and gently to the opposing direction until the compass needle is horizontal, lengthwise. Items to avoid around compasses are magnets of any kind and any electronics. Magnetic fields from electronics can easily disrupt the needle, preventing it from aligning with the Earth's magnetic fields, causing inaccurate readings. The Earth's natural magnetic forces are considerably weak, measuring at 0.5 Gauss and magnetic fields from household electronics can easily exceed it, overpowering the compass needle. Exposure to strong magnets, or magnetic interference can sometimes cause the magnetic poles of the compass needle to differ or even reverse. Avoid iron rich deposits when using a compass, for example, certain rocks which contain magnetic minerals, like Magnetite. This is often indicated by a rock with a surface which is dark and has a metallic luster, not all magnetic mineral bearing rocks have this indication. [...] To see if a rock or an area is causing interference on a compass, get out of the area, and see if the needle on the compass moves. If it does, it means that the area or rock the compass was previously at is causing interference and should be avoided.|$|E
