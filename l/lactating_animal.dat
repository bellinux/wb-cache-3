30|$|For example, rich {{families}} reported distributing cash {{to families}} asking for paran instead of livestock; this shift disadvantages poor herders who gain a temporary cash benefit {{but not a}} long-term subsistence benefit from a gift of a <b>lactating</b> <b>animal,</b> {{as they would have}} in the past. This may indicate a breakdown in traditional practices in this system (Aktipis et al. 2011; Cronk 1991; Cronk 2007; Herren 1987). This result is not surprising since stratification and inequality usually appear in areas where there are alternative forms of resource and labour acquisition, such as access to land rights, permanent wells or dams, and cash (Dahl and Hjort 1976). Similarly, we suggest that the breakdown of social welfare systems may be due to greater access to cash or other necessary herd or household inputs among some families but not others. For example, rich families could distribute cash to poor families instead of livestock or use cash to buy alternative protein sources thereby milking their own livestock less, allowing for greater investment in calf growth since calves consume the majority of production (Dahl and Hjort 1976).|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} how free-ranging mares of {{two species}} of equids (donkeys and Shetland ponies) modify their foraging behaviour to meet the increased nutritional requirements induced by lactation. We initially hypothesised that lactating mares would graze for a longer time and/or graze faster than non-lactating (dry) mares. The grazing behaviour of free-ranging animals. foraging in two low-productive dune areas, was recorded during I year. Results show that in both species <b>lactating</b> <b>animals</b> did. not spend more time grazing than non-lactating mares. However, <b>lactating</b> <b>animals</b> took more bites, and therefore achieved a higher bite rate than dry mares.

Many of these {{studies were carried out}} to evaluate nutritional characteristics associated with different diets. The data collected were sufficient to evaluate total manure, total and volatile solids, and N excretion values. Some experiments had sufficient number of samples analyzed to evaluate P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cl, S, and micro-elements. Statistical analyses were conducted to determine if a single column value was appropriate and define the regression equations necessary to estimate excretions if the assumptions of the column inputs were not met. The results indicate that separate classifications are needed for replacement heifers and mature animals. Final classifications for replacement heifers included: milk fed calves, weaned calves weighing less than 274 kg, heifers weighing between 273 and 613 kg, and veal calves. Additionally, classifications for lactating and dry animals are needed. Previously, the estimates for manure production and nutrient excretion were based on body weight. These findings indicate that a better predictor for lactating cattle is daily milk production instead of body weight.

40|$|Ivermectin (IVM) is a macrocyclic {{disaccharide}} anthelmintic {{agent with}} broad-spectrum antiparasitic action. It {{is used for}} controlling internal and external parasites in food-producing animals (bovine, swine and equine species), including donkey. This drug is included in Council Regulation (EEC) 2377 / 9, annex I, with Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) ranging from 15 to 100 μg kg− 1 depending on the species. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of IVM mainly depend on the animal species, formulation and route of administration. Due to its high lipophilicity it accumulates in milk of food producing animals. Detailed IVM pharmacokinetic {{studies were carried out}} for horse, pig, cattle, sheep, and goat, but there is lack of information for asinine species. Consequently, the absence of “label milk withdrawal time” and MRLs in donkey’s milk indicates that IVM should not be used in lactating animals. On the contrary, information about IVM residues in milk would be of paramount importance {{in view of the fact}} that donkey’s milk is a suggested substitute for infants suffering from hypersensitivity to cow’s, sheep’s and goat’s milk protein or from multiple hypersensitivity.

Although IVM is approved for use in all <b>lactating</b> <b>animal</b> species the possibility of an illegal use should be considered. In this paper, the problems arising from IVM administration in lactating donkey are analysed.

40|$|The {{mammary gland}} is a specialized, {{enlarged}} sudoriferous or sweat (apocrine) gland that produces and secretes milk during lactation. Milk consists of simple sugars, lipids, proteins, {{vitamins and minerals}} dissolved in water, which accounts for up to 88 % per unit volume of milk. The water content of milk will {{vary depending on the}} animal species under investigation and the physiological state of the <b>lactating</b> <b>animal.</b> Current knowledge suggests that water is secreted across the mammary epithelium in a transcellular manner, in response to an osmotic gradient produced largely by the lactose content of milk. Milk yield and quality are important criteria for the dairy industry. Despite the economic importance of milk yield {{little is known about the}} physiological mechanisms responsible for water transport in the bovine mammary gland. Recent studies suggest that several aquaporin proteins are present in the rodent, bovine and human mammary gland. Aquaporins play fundamental roles in water and small solute transport across epithelial and endothelial barriers. Immunohistochemical techniques have confirmed the presence of AQP 1 and AQP 3 water channels in rat, mouse, bovine and human mammary glands. Studies from our laboratory suggest that in addition to AQP 1 and AQP 3 the AQP 4, AQP 5 and AQP 7 proteins are expressed in different epithelial and endothelial locations in the mammary gland. This chapter discusses the potential functional role of aquaporin water channels in the transport of water and small solutes across endothelial and epithelial barriers in the mammary gland and explores how these membrane proteins may be involved in milk production. © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Using a grazing model that simulated individual herbivore behaviour in relation to environmental distributions of forage resource (grass) and parasites (faeces), we tested the hypothesis that an animal’s level of parasite exposure via the faecaleoral route is affected by the composition of physiological states in the group. Four physiological states were considered: parasite naïve, parasitized, <b>lactating</b> and parasite-immune <b>animals.</b> Baseline parasite exposure levels for each state were generated by simulating single-state groups and were compared to simulations of each of the six two-state combinations.

40|$|Early {{studies of}} the mammary gland and its {{innervation}} led to the belief, {{at least in some}} quarters, that mammary activity is {{under the control of the}} nervous system. 6 With the development of endocrinology, however, growth and function of the mammary apparatus were found to be determined by secretions of the ovaries and hypophysis. In a number of species mammary development identical with that occurring during pregnancy has been induced by the proper administration of ovarian hormones, and in some species full lactation has followed the administration of lactogenic substance from the hypophysis to animals whose mammary glands have grown under the influence of extrinsic ovarian hormones. " 4 In the normal sequence of events in the intact animal, however, full lactation does not occur until the parturient animal has been suckled. Moreover, cessation of suckling is rather promptly followed in the fully <b>lactating</b> <b>animal</b> by termination of lactation and by mammary involution. 14 In explanation of these commonly observed facts it has been suggested 0 11, 12, 13 that irritation of the nipples by suckling sets up centripetal nerve impulses which, by stimulation of the hypophysis, lead to maintenance of the mammary glands and of lactation. If this explanation is correct, adequate irritation of the nipples by artificial means in the complete absence of young should exert the same effect as suckling, without the complicating factor of a possible psychic effect of the mere presence of the young. The experiments reported here were designed to test this assumption, in the belief that retardation of mammary involution by chemical irritation of the nipples would establish nipple irritation as at least one of the means by which suckling maintains the lactating mammary gland. Mice were used as the test animals and spirits of turpentine was employed as the irritant. At autopsy the mammary glands were removed with the skin and fixed in Bouin's picro-formol.

40|$|Extracellular matrix (ECM) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the maintenance of mammary epithelial differentiation in culture. We asked whether changes in mouse mammary specific function in vivo correlate with changes in the ECM. We showed, using expression of beta-casein as a marker, that the temporal expression of ECM-degrading proteinases and their inhibitors during lactation and involution are inversely related to functional differentiation. After a lactation period of 9 d, mammary epithelial cells maintained beta-casein expression up to 5 d of involution. Two metalloproteinases, 72 -kD gelatinase (and its 62 -kD active form), and stromelysin, and a serine proteinase tissue plasminogen activator were detected by day four of involution, and maintained expression until at least day 10. The expression of their inhibitors, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, preceded the onset of ECM-degrading proteinase expression and was detected by day two of involution, and showed a sharp peak of expression centered on days 4 - 6 of involution. When involution was accelerated by decreasing lactation to 2 d, there was an accelerated loss of beta-casein expression evident by day four and a shift in expression of ECM-remodeling proteinases and inhibitors to a focus at 2 - 4 d of involution. To further extend the correlation between mammary-specific function and ECM remodeling we initiated involution by sealing just one gland in an otherwise hormonally sufficient <b>lactating</b> <b>animal.</b> Alveoli in the sealed gland contained casein for at least 7 d after sealing, and closely resembled those in a lactating gland. The relative expression of TIMP in the sealed gland increased, whereas the expression of stromelysin was much lower than that of a hormone-depleted involuting gland, indicating that the higher the ratio of TIMP to ECM-degrading proteinases the slower the process of involution. To test directly the functional role of ECM-degrading proteinases in the loss of tissue-specific function we artificially perturbed the ECM-degrading proteinase-inhibitor ratio in a normally involuting gland by maintaining high concentrations of TIMP protein with the use of surgically implanted slow-release pellets. In a concentration-dependent fashion, involuting mammary glands that received TIMP implants maintained high levels of casein and delayed alveolar regression. These data suggest that the balance of ECM- degrading proteinases and their inhibitors regulates the organization of the basement membrane and the tissue-specific function of the mammary gland.

40|$|Expression of {{acquired}} immunity to gastrointestinal parasites usually breaks down during the periparturient period, which is characterised by an increased worm burden and nematode egg excretion. It {{is believed that}} this breakdown of immunity may have a nutritional basis, and that by reducing nutrient scarcity the <b>lactating</b> <b>animal</b> {{will be able to}} reduce her worm burden. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to carry out four experiments to investigate the potential use of metabolisable protein as an alternative way to control gastrointestinal parasitism in periparturient animals. A lactating rat model was used to address this issue as lactating rats exhibit a breakdown of immunity to the gastrointestinal nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. The first experiment (chapter two) aimed to verify that a reduction in worm burden is indeed related to changes in nutrient supply and not associated with changes in the gut environment. This was achieved by manipulating nutrient (litter) demand whilst nutrient supply was maintained constant. The results showed that the periparturient breakdown of immunity to N. brasiliensis (measured by a reduced worm burden) was sensitive to changes in nutrient demand and that these effects were independent of changes in the gut environment. The second experiment (Chapter Three) tested the effect of increased protein supply or reduced protein demand on the resistance to parasites in lactating rats whilst energy intake was kept constant. Under these conditions effects of protein supply could not be confounded with effects of any nutrient or energy intake. The results supported the view that under a restricted feeding regime, breakdown of immunity to N. brasiliensis (measured by a reduced number of eggs in the colon content) was sensitive to changes in protein scarcity. Following on from this, the next experiment (Chapter Four) assessed the effects of a gradual increase in protein supply on resistance and immune responses to N. brasiliensis in lactating rats. It was shown that as protein contents of the diets progressively increased, the number of worms and eggs present in the colon decreased. Although we found that differences in protein supply affected parasite burden, we found no affects of protein supply on local immune responses. This may have been due to the single sampling point used. Therefore, the objective of the last experiment (Chapter Five) was to assess temporal effects of increased protein supply on resistance and immune responses to N. brasiliensis. In agreement with previous experiments, the results showed that an increase in protein at times of protein scarcity improved resistance to N. brasiliensis, illustrated by a lower number of nematode eggs in the colon. The results also showed that local immune responses such as immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgE & IgG 2 a), RMCP II levels and goblet cell counts were affected by differences in protein supply at various time points post secondary infection. The potential application of using a lactating rat as a suitable model to fully understand the underlying immunological basis of relaxation in immunity during the periparturient period and its sensitivity to nutrient scarcity is considered in the General Discussion (Chapter Six) ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2001. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The goat is a {{significant}} domestic animal throughout the world today. With an estimated world goat population of 590 million goats in 1991 (FAO, 1991 as citied by Haenlein, 1996) {{it is impossible to}} consider the goat as insignificant. The need for milk, and it seems particularly goat’s milk, is obvious if one considers the increase in dairy goat populations over the past 20 years. Across the globe the dairy goat population has increased by 52 % while in developing and developed countries, there has been an increase of 56 % and 17 %, respectively (Haenlein, 2000). The goat dairy industry in South Africa is still very underdeveloped, yet it holds tremendous potential for the entrepreneur willing to take the risk and do the job correctly. With the present South African financial situation the opportunities that exist for exporting value added products to countries with stronger currencies is a market with extraordinary potential. In New Zealand, the national herd consists of approximately 16000 dairy goats and 90 % of the milk produced is turned to powdered milk and then exported to the East, a valuable source of foreign currency. In South Africa, the same potential exists and with some vision and hard work the dairy goat industry can make a valuable contribution to generating foreign currency. Research into the protein requirements and particularly protein degradability requirements of dairy goats is scarce, yet in recent years there has been an increased interest in the effect of protein supplementation to lactating animals (Mishra & Rai, 1996). In the work of Mishra & Rai (1996) there were benefits obtained from the use of different rumen degradable proteins for lactating dairy goat does. The does on the highly degradable protein diet had a better feed intake while the does on the low degradable protein diet gave a higher milk production. Other research on this field of study has also delivered positive results with more than one species of <b>lactating</b> <b>animal</b> that had increased levels of UDP in the diet (Robinson et al., 1991 and Christensen et al., 1993). Loerch et al. (1995) suggested that improved production by making use of rumen undegradable proteins would have no effect if crude protein were not a limiting factor in production. Pailan & Kaur (1995) and Mishra & Rai (1996) did research on lowered CP levels with increased UDP levels in lactating dairy does. They used of three diets, with the one having a 20 % lower CP value but an increased level of UDP (40 - 45 % of total CP). From this work it was concluded that a decreased CP level and an increased level of UDP is able to sustain production when compared with diets with a higher CP value. The current study consists of two trials. In the first trial the effect of weaning age and dietary protein degradability on the growth of Saanen kids was investigated. In the second trial the effect of dietary protein degradability on the production of lactating Saanen does was investigated. Fifty-eight Saanen kids were divided into groups to determine the effect of weaning age (42 vs. 70 days) on animal performance. Within the weaning day treatments, the kids were again divided into two dietary treatments. One group received a low UDP creep diet (LC) and the other a high UDP creep diet (HC). The two creep diets were formulated with rumen degradable: undegradable protein (RDP : UDP) ratios of 70 : 30 and 60 : 40, referred to as LC and HC, respectively. However, the results from the degradability trial indicated no difference in RDP: UDP ratios for the low and high creep (72 : 28 and 73 : 27 respectively) diets. At 15. 66 ± 3. 09 kg the kids were taken off the creep diet and put on the growth diet. At this transition, the kids in each of the 4 established treatments were again randomly divided into two dietary treatments, a high or a low UDP growth diet, resulting in a total of eight treatments for the trial. The two growth diets were formulated with RDP: UDP ratios of 70 : 30 and 60 : 40, referred to as low growth (LG) and high growth (HG) respectively. Results from the degradability trial indicated RDP: UDP ratios for the LG and HG of 73 : 27 and 68 : 32 respectively. The growth trial was conducted over 140 days and feed intake, bodyweight change and feed conversion efficiency were compared for each of the 8 treatments. From the trial with the Saanen kids it was concluded that weaning dairy goat kids at 42 days of age when feed intake was 240 g/day resulted in similar growth rates when compared with weaning at 70 days. The two creep diets did not differ in RDP: UDP ratios and thus no conclusion can be made regarding the influence of the creep diets on the growth of Saanen kids from 20 to 80 days of age. The two growth diets did in fact differ from one another, in terms of RDP: UDP however, protein degradability had no influence on the performance of the Saanen kids from 80 to 140 days of age. Twenty-one lactating Saanen does were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three experimental diets. The treatments had two RDP: UDP ratios and two crude protein (CP) levels. Treatments were formulated to be 1) RDP: UDP = 70 : 30, CP = 20 % 2) RDP: UDP = 62 : 38, CP = 20 % and 3) RDP: UDP = 62 : 38, CP = 18. 3 %. In the production trial the does were milked for 120 days, during which milk yield, milk composition, bodyweight change, feed intake and feed conversion efficiency were compared between the treatments. In the digestibility and nitrogen metabolism trial, 18 does varying from 84 to 110 days in lactation, were used to compare the experimental diets. Furthermore, the experimental diets were compared in a degradability and rate of passage trial using cannulated Dohne merino wethers. Results from the degradability trial indicated that the low UDP, low protein high UDP and high UDP diets had RDP: UDP ratios of 82 : 18, 78 : 22 and 79 : 21 respectively, and that the dietary protein degradability did not differ significantly between diets. Results from the production trial indicated that there was {{a significant}} difference in feed intake, dry matter (DM) intake and bodyweight. The does on the low UDP diet had significantly higher feed intakes and DM intakes and were significantly heavier at the end of the trial period. As the diets didn’t differ in protein degradability other factors must have influenced the intakes between diets. Palatability may have influenced feed and DM intake, as the low protein high UDP and high UDP diets both contained higher levels of fishmeal. No significant differences in milk production, milk composition or milk production efficiency were observed. Besides the fact that the diets did not differ in effective protein degradability, large variations in milk production between animals and low numbers of animals per treatment limited the ability to measure a difference between the treatments. Results from the digestibility trial varied between diets with the low UDP diet having a significantly lower digestibility overall than the other two diets. Reasons for the difference in digestibility could be due to the difference in rate of passage (low UDP = 0. 064 /hour versus the 0. 044 - 0. 045 /hour of the low protein and high UDP diets respectively) and the high ADF value of the low UDP diet. Because no difference in effective protein degradability existed between the diets it is not possible to make an accurate conclusion on whether or not the dietary protein degradability had an influence on production parameters tested in this trial.

Wereldwyd het die melkbokpopulasie met 52 % toegeneem, terwyl dit in ontwikkelende en ontwikkelde lande met 56 % en 17 % onderskeidelik, toegeneem het (Haenlein, 2000). Ten spyte van die feit dat die bokmelk-industrie in Suid-Afrika nog baie onderontwikkel is, is daar geweldige potensiaal vir die entrepeneur wat bereid is om ‘n risiko te loop en die taak korrek aan te pak. Binne die huidige Suid-Afrikaanse finansiele situasie bestaan daar veral geleenthede om waardetoegevoegde produkte na lande waarvan die wisselkoers sterker is, uit te voer. In Nieu Zeeland is die nasionale kudde ongeveer 16000 melkbokke en 90 % van die geproduseerde melk word verwerk na poeiermelk en uitgevoer na die Ooste. In Suid-Afrika bestaan dieselfde potensiaal en met die korrekte visie en harde werk kan die melkbok-industrie ‘n belangrike bydra lewer om buitelandse valuta te verdien. Alhoewel navorsing aangaande die proteien-degradeerbaarheidsbehoeftes van melkbokke skaars is, bestaan daar die afgelope paar jaar ‘n toenemende belangstelling in die effek van proteien supplementering aan lakterende diere (Mishra & Rai, 1996). In die werk van Mishra & Rai (1996) is die voordele om verskillende rumen degraderende proteTenvlakke in lakterende melkbokke te gebruik, aangetoon. Ooie op ‘n hoogs degradeerbare prote'fen-dieet het beter voerinnames getoon, terwyl die ooie op ’n laag degradeerbare prote'fen-dieet hoer melkproduksies gelewer het. Navorsing van hierdie aard op ander lakterende spesies het ook positiewe resultate met ‘n toename in verbyvloeiprote'ien in die dieet gelewer (Robinson et al., 1991 en Christensen et al., 1993). Loerch et al. (1995) het voorgestel dat ‘n verbeterde produksie, deur gebruik te maak van verbyvloeiprote'fn, geen effek sal he as ruprote'fen (RP) nie ‘n beperkende faktor i. t. v produksie is nie. Beide Pailan & Kaur (1995) & Mishra en Rai (1996) het navorsing gedoen op die invloed van verlaagde RP-vlakke en verhoogde nie-degradeerbare protein (NDP) vlakke in die diete van lakterende melkooie. Daar is gebruik gemaak van drie diete, waarvan die een dieet ‘n 20 % laer RPinhoud, maar ‘n verhoodge NDP-vlak (40 - 45 % van totale RP) gehad het. Vanuit hierdie werk is die gevolgtrekking gemaak dat ‘n verlaging in RP-vlak en ‘n verhoging in NDP-vlak dieselfde produksie kan onderhou, soos met ‘n hoer RP-inhoud. Die huidige navorsing bestaan uit twee proewe. In die eerste proef is die effek van speenouderdom en dieet-prote'fen-degradeerbaardheid op die groei van Saanen-lammers ondersoek. In die tweede proef is die effek van dieet-proteien-degradeerbaardheid op die produksie van lakteerende Saanen melkbokke ondersoek. Agt-en-vyftig Saanen-lammers is verdeel in twee speenouderdom-behandelings, nl. ‘n 42 dae (42) en ‘n 70 dae (70) speenouderdom. Binne hierdie speenouderdom-behandelings is die lammers verder verdeel in twee dieet-behandelings. Die een groep het ‘n lae NDP kruiprantsoen (LK) en die ander ‘n hoe NDP kruiprantsoen (HK) ontvang. Die twee kruiprantsoene was geformuleer om rumen degradeerbare proteien (RDP) : NDP verhoudings van 70 : 30 (LK) en 60 : 40 (HK) te bevat, maar die resultate van die degradeerbaarheidsproef het aangetoon RDP: NDP verhoudings van 77 : 23 (LK) en 78 : 22 (HK). Die lammers is vanaf die kruipdieet oorgeplaas op ‘n groeidieet by ‘n gemiddelde lewende massa van 15. 99 ± 3. 09 kg. Tydens hierdie oorplasing is die lammers van die vier bestaande behandelings verdeel in ‘n verdere twee dieetbehandelings, nl. ‘n hoe of ‘n lae NDP groei-dieet (LG en HG onderskeidelik), met die gevolg dat ‘n totaal van agt behandelings in hierdie proef bestaan het. Die twee groeidiete is geformuleer met RDP: NDP verhoudings van 70 : 30 (LG) en 60 : 40 (HG) onderskeidelik, maar die resultate van die degradeerbaarheidsproef het aangetoon RDP: NDP verhoudings van 78 : 22 (LG) en 72 : 28 (HG). Die groeiproef is uitgevoer oor 140 dae en voerinname, verandering in liggaamsgewig en voeromsettingsdoeltreffendheid (VOD) is vergelyk tussen die agt behandelings. Uit die lammerproef is die gevolgtrekking gemaak dat boklammers wat op 42 dae gespeen is, wanneer voerinname 240 g/dag is, soortgelyke resultate i. t. v. groeitempo lewer as lammers wat op 70 dae gespeen is. Die twee kruiprantsoene het nie van mekaar in RDP: NDP verskil nie en dus kan geen gevolgtrekking gemaak word omtrentdie invloed van dieet-protel'en-degradeerbaarheid op die groei van Saanen boklammers van 20 tot 80 dae ouderdom. Die twee groei diete het van mekaar verskil in RDP: NDP maar dieet-proteien-degradeerbaardheid het geen invloed op die groei van die Saanen boklammers van 80 tot 140 dae ouderdom gehad nie. Een-en-twintig lakterende Saanen-ooie is ewekansig in drie groepe. Die behandelings het twee RDP: NDP-verhoudings en twee ruprotei'en (RP) -peile ingesluit. Behandelings was 1) RDP: NDP = 70 : 30, RP = 20 % 2) RDP: NDP = 62 : 38, RP = 20 % en 3) RDP: NDP = 62 : 38, RP = 18. 3 %. Tydens hierdie produksieproef is die ooie vir 120 dae gemelk en die melkopbrengs, melksamestelling, verandering in liggaamsgewig, voerinname en VOD bepaal en vergelyk tussen behandelings. In die verterings- en stikstofmetabolismeproef is 18 ooie gebruik om die diete te vergelyk. Verder is die diete ook vergelyk in ‘n degraderings- en deurvloeitempoproef met gekannuleerde Dohne merino hamels. Dieet-proteien-degradeerbaardheid waardes verkry uit die degradeerbaarheidsproef het aangedui dat die bepaalde RDP: NDP verhoudings was 82 : 18, 78 : 22 en 79 : 21 vir die lae NDP, lae prote'fen hoe NDP en hoe NDP diete, en dat daar geen verskil in dieet-prote'fen-degradeerbaardheid was tussen die drie rantsoene. Resultate van die produksieproef dui daarop dat daar verskille in voerinname, droematerialinname, en liggaamsgewig tussen die drie rantsoene was. Die ooie op die laer NDP rantsoen het ‘n hoe voer en DM inname gehad en was swaarder na 120 dae in die proef as die ooie in die ander twee behandelings. Redes vir hierdie verskille is nie as gevolg van dieet-proteiendegradeerbaarheid nie. Die smaaklikheid kon dalk ‘n rol gespeel het omdat dat die twee hoe NDP rantsoene hoer vlakke van vismeel gehad het. Daar was geen verskil in melkproduksie, melksamestelling en melkproduksiedoeltreffenheid tussen die drie behandelings. Resultate van die verteringsproef het tussen die laer NDP-rantsoen en die ander twee rantsoene gevarieer. Die rede vir die verskil in verteerbaarheid mag wees a. g. v. verskillende deurvloeitempo’s (laer NDP = 0. 064 /uur teenoor 0. 044 - 0. 045 /uur vir die laeproteien en hoe-proteienrantsoene) en die ADF waarde wat van die lae NDP rantsoen verskil het van die ander twee rantsoene. Omdat die resultate van die degradeerbaarheidsproef aangedui het dat daar geen verskil in dieet-proteiendegradeerbaardheid was nie is dit nie moontlik om ‘n gevolgtrekking te maak random die invloed van dieet-proteien-degradeerbaardheid op die produksie van lakterende Saanen melkbokke nie...|$|E

40|$|Background: Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) {{is known to}} affect the lipid metabolism in growing and <b>lactating</b> <b>animals.</b> However, potential effects on the metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins in <b>lactating</b> <b>animals</b> and co-occurring effects on their offspring are unknown. We aimed to investigate the effects of dietary CLA on concentrations of tocopherol in various tissues of lactating rats and their offspring and expression of genes involved in tocopherol metabolism. Methods: Twenty-eight Wistar Han rats were allocated to 2 groups and fed either a control diet (control group) or a diet containing 0. 9 % of cis- 9, trans- 11 and trans- 10, cis- 12 (1 : 1) CLA (CLA group) during pregnancy and lactation. Feed intake of dams and body weight of dams and their pups were recorded weekly. Tocopherol concentrations in various body tissues were determined at day 14 of lactation in dams and 1, 7 and 14 days after birth in pups. Expression of selected genes involved in metabolism of tocopherol was determined in dams and pups. The data were statistically analysed by analysis of variance. Results: Feed intake and body weight development of nursing rats and their pups was similar in both groups. In livers of CLA-fed dams, tocopherol concentrations decreased by 24 % but expression of TTPA and CYP 3 A 1, involved in tocopherol transport and metabolism, were not influenced. In the dams adipose tissue, gene expression of receptors involved in tissue tocopherol uptake, LDLR and SCARB 1, but not of LPL, increased by 30 to 50 % and tocopherol concentrations increased by 47 % in CLA-fed compared to control dams. Expression of LPL, LDLR and SCARB 1 in mammary gland was not influenced by CLA-feeding. Tocopherol concentrations in the pups livers and lungs were similar in both groups, but at 14 days of age, adipose tissue tocopherol concentrations, and LDLR and SCARB 1 expression, {{were higher in the}} CLA-exposed pups. Conclusions: We show that dietary CLA affects tissue concentrations of tocopherol in lactating rats and tocopherol metabolism in rats and pups, but hardly influences tissue tocopherol concentrations in their offspring. This indicates that supplementation of CLA in pregnant and <b>lactating</b> <b>animals</b> is uncritical considering the tocopherol status of new-borns...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{ceruloplasmin}} cDNA clone in RNA blot analysis, {{a single}} 3. 7 kb ceruloplasmin-specific transcript was detected in rat mammary gland tissue from pregnant and <b>lactating</b> <b>animals.</b> Ceruloplasmin gene {{expression in the}} mammary gland was tissue-specific, with no evidence of expression in brain, heart or other extrahepatic tissues. Ceruloplasmin mRNA was also detected in mammary gland tissue from male, virgin female and non-pregnant/multiparous animals, and the abundance of ceruloplasmin-specific transcripts in virgin female rats was independent of their stage of oestrus. In virgin female mammary gland the content of ceruloplasmin mRNA was 20 % of that in hepatic tissue from these animals and approx. 2 - 3 -fold greater than that found in mammary gland tissue of pregnant or <b>lactating</b> <b>animals.</b> Development studies revealed ceruloplasmin gene expression in male and female mammary gland by only 2 weeks of age, prior to the onset of puberty. Biosynthetic studies indicated that the ceruloplasmin mRNA in mammary gland tissue was translated into a 132 kDa protein qualitatively similar to that synthesized in liver. By in situ hybridization, ceruloplasmin gene expression was localized to the epithelium lining the mammary gland alveolar ducts, without evidence of expression in the surrounding mesenchyme. Ceruloplasmin gene expression was also detected in a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line and in biopsy tissue from women with invasive ductal carcinoma. Taken together, these data indicate that the mammary gland is a prominent site of extrahepatic ceruloplasmin gene expression {{and add to the}} evidence that ceruloplasmin biosynthesis is associated with growth and differentiation in non-hepatic tissues...|$|R
40|$|Delay in {{the onset}} of lactogenesis {{has been shown to}} occur in women who are obese, however the {{mechanism}} altered within the mammary gland causing the delay remains unknown. Consumption of high fat diets (HFD) has been previously determined to result decreased litters and litter numbers in rodent models due to a decrease in fertility. We examined the effects of feeding a HFD (60 % kcal from fat) diet versus a low-fat diet (LFD; 10 % kcal from fat) to female Wistar rats on lactation outcomes. Feeding of HFD diet resulted in increased pup weights compared to pups from LFD fed animals for 4 d post-partum. Lactation was delayed in mothers on HFD but they began to produce copious milk volumes beginning 2 d post-partum, and milk yield was similar to LFD by day 3. Mammary glands collected from <b>lactating</b> <b>animals</b> on HFD diet, displayed a disrupted morphologies, with very few and small alveoli. Consistently, there was a significant decrease in the mRNA expression of milk protein genes, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT 1) and keratin 5 (K 5), a luminobasal cell marker in the mammary glands of HFD <b>lactating</b> <b>animals.</b> Expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH 1), the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin (5 -HT) biosynthesis, and the 5 -HT 7 receptor (HTR 7), which regulates mammary gland involution, were significantly increased in mammary glands of HFD animals. Additionally, we saw elevation of the inflammatory markers interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF- a).
