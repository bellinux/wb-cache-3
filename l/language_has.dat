5|$|Like the {{national}} language, {{the people of}} Sandakan mainly speak Malay, with a distinct Sabahan creole. The Malay language in Sandakan {{are different from the}} Malay language in the west coast which resembles Brunei Malay. In Sandakan, this <b>language</b> <b>has</b> been influenced by many words from the Suluk language. As Sandakan had also been dominated by the Hakka and Cantonese Chinese, Hakka and Cantonese widely spoken, while today Mandarin dominates as the lingua franca among both dialect subgroups. While for the east coast Bajau, their <b>language</b> <b>has</b> similarities with the Sama language in the Philippines and also borrowed many words from the Suluk language which is different from the west coast Bajau who had been influenced by the Malayic languages of Brunei Malay.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} systematicity and {{productivity}} {{depend on the}} compositional structure of language means that <b>language</b> <b>has</b> a combinatorial semantics. If thought also has such a combinatorial semantics, then {{there must be a}} language of thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} Tawau mainly speak Malay, with a {{distinct}} Sabahan creole. The Malay language here {{are different from the}} Malay language in the west coast which resembles Brunei Malay. In Tawau, the language had been influenced by the Indonesian language spoken by the Buginese, Florenese and Timorese. As most Tawau Chinese are Hakka Chinese, Hakka Chinese is widely spoken. The east coast Bajau's <b>language</b> <b>has</b> similarities with the Sama language in the Philippines and has borrowed words from the Suluk language. The Bajau language on the east coast is different from the west coast Bajau, where the <b>language</b> <b>has</b> been influenced by Malayic languages from Brunei Malay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{importance}} of vowels in distinguishing one word from another varies from language to language. Nearly all <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> {{at least three}} phonemic vowels, usually [...] as in Classical Arabic and Inuktitut (or [...] as in Quechua), though Adyghe and many Sepik <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> a vertical vowel system of [...] Very few <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> fewer, though some Arrernte, Circassian, Ndu <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> been argued to have just two, [...] and , with [...] being epenthetic.|$|R
5000|$|Thus English {{inherited}} a phoneme [...] in positions where other West Germanic <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> [...] {{and most other}} Indo-European <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> : English three, German drei, Latin tres.|$|R
50|$|The {{indigenous}} people of Groote Eylandt in their Enindhilyagwa <b>language</b> <b>have</b> the name awulka for the species {{and the people}} of Yirrkala in the Rirratjingu <b>language</b> <b>have</b> the name dangapa for it.|$|R
5|$|Language endangerment {{occurs when}} a {{language}} is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the <b>language</b> <b>has</b> no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.|$|E
5|$|The Irish <b>language</b> <b>has</b> a vast {{treasury}} {{of written}} texts from many centuries, and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the 6th to 10th century, Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland {{for most of}} those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.|$|E
5|$|The cave temples, {{numbered}} 1 to 4 in {{the order}} of their creation, in the town of Badamithe capital city of the Chalukya kingdom (also known as Early Chalukyas)are dated from the late 6th century onwards. The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the dedication of the shrine by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579CE). The inscription, written in the old Kannada <b>language,</b> <b>has</b> enabled the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.|$|E
50|$|Generally, Khoisan <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> an SV {{constituent}} order. Central Khoisan <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> {{a dominant}} AOV constituent order, including Khwe, though AOV and OAV order is used {{more frequently in}} casual conversation and storytelling.|$|R
5000|$|Phonologically, the Ryukyuan <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> some cross-linguistically unusual features. Southern Ryukyuan <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> {{a number}} of syllabic consonants, {{including}} unvoiced syllabic fricatives (e.g. Ōgami Miyako [...] 'breast'). Glottalized consonants are common (e.g. Yuwan Amami [...] "horse"). Some Ryukyuan <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> phonemic central vowels, e.g. Yuwan Amami [...] "tree". Ikema Miyako has a voiceless nasal phoneme [...] Many Ryukyuan languages, like Standard Japanese and most Japanese dialects, have contrastive pitch accent.|$|R
50|$|Only {{some of the}} <b>{{languages}}</b> <b>have</b> nominal classes, as the Bantu <b>languages</b> <b>have,</b> {{where in}} others these have eroded. The large numbers of consonants in many languages {{is due to the}} erosion of noun-class prefixes.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} <b>language</b> <b>has</b> seven monophthong vowel phonemes. They {{are aligned}} into three vowel harmony groups by a parameter called ATR (advanced tongue root); {{the groups are}} ATR, +ATR, and neutral. This alignment seems to have superseded an alignment according to oral backness. However, some scholars still describe Mongolian as being characterized by a distinction between front vowels and back vowels, and the front vowel spellings 'ö' and 'ü' are still often used in the West to indicate two vowels which were historically front. The Mongolian vowel system also has rounding harmony.|$|E
5|$|The two {{official}} {{languages of}} the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each <b>language</b> <b>has</b> produced a noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only {{the language of}} a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for over two thousand years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} <b>language</b> <b>has</b> {{been explained}} as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{engineered}} <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> {{been considered}} candidate global auxiliary languages, and some languages intended as international auxiliary <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> certain [...] "engineered" [...] aspects (in {{which they are}} more regular and systematic than their natural language sources).|$|R
50|$|Other <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted}} to add this feature {{in a variety}} of ways. TOM took the Objective-C system a step further and allowed for the addition of variables also. Other <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> used prototype-based solutions instead, the most notable being Self.|$|R
25|$|Whereas {{isolating}} <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> a low morpheme-to-word ratio, polysynthetic <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> a {{very high}} ratio. There is no generally agreed upon definition of polysynthesis. Generally polysynthetic <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> polypersonal agreement although some agglutinative languages that aren't polysynthetic can also have it, such as Basque, Hungarian and Georgian. Some authors apply the term polysynthetic to languages with high morpheme-to-word ratios, but others use it for languages that are highly head-marking, or those that frequently use noun incorporation.|$|R
5|$|English, Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are the {{official}} languages, with English predominant. New Zealand English is mostly non-rhotic and sounds similar to Australian English, {{with a common}} exception being the centralisation of the short i. The Māori <b>language</b> <b>has</b> undergone a process of revitalisation and is spoken by 3.7percent of the population. New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99percent and {{over half of the}} population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification. In the adult population 14.2 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher, 30.4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22.4 percent have no formal qualification. As of the 2013 census, just under half the population identify as Christians, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the most significant minority religions. New Zealand has no state religion and just over 40percent of the population does not have a religion.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a tonal language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The <b>language</b> <b>has</b> been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus emphasize that the Macedonian <b>language</b> <b>has</b> a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E
30|$|Like spoken <b>languages,</b> sign <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> {{their own}} grammars that consist of several {{linguistic}} levels, such as morphology, syntax and semantics [7]. They also have lexical {{items that are}} called signs [40]. The main difference is the visual–spatial mode. Another difference {{is related to the}} language structure. While spoken <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> a sequential structure, i.e., phonemes are produced sequentially in time, sign <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> a parallel structure and can produce signs using several body parts simultaneously.|$|R

5|$|The Armenian <b>language</b> <b>has</b> two {{distinct}} standardized forms: Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian, both widely spoken among the Armenian American community. Armenians from Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and few other countries speak the Western dialect, which was spoken in Turkish (Western) Armenia, the eastern regions of Turkey with historical Armenian presence. Eastern Armenian is primarily spoken in the Republic of Armenia and Iran, though the Iranian Armenians {{have their own}} dialect. Furthermore, Western and Eastern Armenian use two different spellings. In Armenia, the reformed orthography is used, while most Armenians in the diaspora (including Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Iran) use the classical orthography.|$|E
5|$|The English <b>language</b> <b>has</b> been {{official}} {{in the state of}} Oklahoma since 2010. The variety of North American English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is quite diverse with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland, and Southern dialects. In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident population five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 95% in 1990. 238,732 Oklahoma residents reported speaking a language other than English in the 2000 census, about 7.4% of the state's population. Spanish is the second-most commonly spoken language in the state, with 141,060 speakers counted in 2000. The two most commonly spoken native North American languages are Cherokee and Choctaw with 10,000 Cherokee speakers living within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area of eastern Oklahoma, and another 10,000 Choctaw speakers living in the Choctaw Nation directly south of the Cherokees. Cherokee is an official language in the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area and in the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are compared as in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The <b>language</b> <b>has</b> a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E
50|$|Algonquian <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> a locative.|$|R
50|$|The Chimakuan <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> phonemic {{inventories}} {{similar to}} other languages of the Mosan sprachbund, with three vowels, ejective consonants, uvular consonants, and lateral affricates. However, both <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> typological oddities: Chemakum had no simple velar consonants, and Quileute has no nasal consonants.|$|R
50|$|The Khoisan <b>{{languages}}</b> <b>have</b> pulmonic, ejective, {{and click}} consonants, the Chadic <b>languages</b> <b>have</b> pulmonic, implosive, and ejective consonants, and the Nguni languages utilize all four, pulmonic, click, implosive, and ejective, in normal vocabulary. Most other languages utilize {{only one or}} two airstream mechanisms.|$|R
5|$|Today, {{one can see}} Gaelic {{written on}} the walls of the parish church, but the <b>language</b> <b>has</b> {{effectively}} died out, and English is totally dominant. Nevertheless, there are still some 72 residents (4.3%) of the village who know the language. The village is also a big location on the Highland folk-circuit, and enjoys a vibrant musical culture in the Gaelic tradition. It is a regular practice for local musicians to meet in the Balconie Inn, one of the two licensed establishments of the town, and engage in evening-long sessions. Many prominent musicians on the Celtic music scene have visited, including Eilidh Steel and Dougie MacLean.|$|E
5|$|When {{adopting}} {{new concepts}} or technologies, Greenlandic usually constructs new words made from Greenlandic roots, but modern Greenlandic has also taken many loans from Danish and English. The <b>language</b> <b>has</b> {{been written in}} the Latin script since Danish colonization began in the 1700s. The first orthography was developed by Samuel Kleinschmidt in 1851, but within a hundred years already differed substantially from the spoken language because {{of a number of}} sound changes. An extensive orthographic reform undertaken in 1973 that made the script easier to learn resulted in a boost in Greenlandic literacy, which is now {{among the highest in the}} world.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any <b>language</b> <b>has</b> ever been.|$|E
