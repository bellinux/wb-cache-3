50|$|In 1907, Scarpa {{began taking}} {{a group of}} {{visitors}} from Pasadena across the Newport bay in a gondola decorated with Japanese lanterns. One year later, on July 4, 1908, the first <b>lighted</b> <b>boat</b> parade took place. Scarpa, along with his fellow small boat operators, put together a loosely organized affair consisting of nine vessels. The parade, illuminated by Japanese lanterns, was led by Scarpa’s gondola and followed by eight canoes. Thus, Scarpa has been credited with creating the first <b>lighted</b> <b>boat</b> parade.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Gerald! Gerald!' {{came the}} wild crying voice of Winifred. He did not answer. Slowly the launch drifted round in a pathetic, clumsy circle, and slunk {{away to the}} land, {{retreating}} into the dimness. The wash of her paddles grew duller. Gudrun rocked in her <b>light</b> <b>boat,</b> and dipped the paddle automatically to steady herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the idea}} of a {{combined}} pontoon and <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> that would carry troops is by no means new; but these are rather an unusual type and if it were known that we were building them, it might give the enemy a hint. I suppose you told Brandon the thing's to be kept quiet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Canoes {{are very}} scarce; the price {{has risen from}} 50 dollars and 80 dollars to 100 dollars each. Many parties have built <b>light</b> <b>boats</b> for themselves, {{but they did not}} answer." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{river is}} navigable by rafts and <b>light</b> <b>boats</b> up to 80 km from its mouth. The passage of typhoons can bring {{significant}} flooding. The Tym {{and its tributaries}} are rich in spawning salmon.|$|R
60|$|The large boat, meanwhile, {{had been}} {{picked up by the}} Talisman, after having rescued Mr Mason and Henry, both of whom were placed in the gig. This <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> was now {{struggling}} to make the ship, but owing to the strength of the squall, her diminished crew were unable to effect this; they therefore ran ashore to await the issue of the fight and the storm.|$|E
60|$|The paddlers redoubled their exertions, and the <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> almost flew along {{over the}} water. For {{a few minutes}} those in the canoe behind also did their utmost; but it was plain that they were falling behind, rather than gaining. Then one of the {{officials}} stood up, and shouted an {{order for them to}} stop. They were some distance behind, but the words could be plainly heard.|$|E
60|$|A sweep {{with both}} oars brought the gondola's head, in a moment, almost {{at right angles}} to the course that she had been pursuing; and the next sent her dancing on a new line, just as a four-oared gondola swept down upon them, missing their stern by only three or four feet. Had they been less quick in turning, the iron prow would have cut right through their <b>light</b> <b>boat.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The drop of {{the oars}} resembled the {{movements}} of a nice machine, and the <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> skimmed along the water like a duck that approaches to the very brink of some imminent danger, and then avoids it, at the most critical moment, apparently without an effort. While this necessary movement was making, Barnstable arose, and surveyed the cliffs with keen eyes, and then turning once more in disappointment from his search, he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made out}} your shape--on the sky." [...] A cry of {{surprise}} expired {{on her lips}} and she could only peer downward. Lingard, alone in the brig's dinghy, with another stroke sent the <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> nearly under the yacht's counter, laid his sculls in, and rose from the thwart. His head and shoulders loomed up alongside {{and he had the}} appearance of standing upon the sea. Involuntarily Mrs. Travers made a movement of retreat.|$|E
6000|$|... "For instance, if we {{suppose that}} the <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> has one million of {{particles}} of matter, the heavy one would have, perhaps, twenty millions. Of course {{the effect of the}} pushing has to be divided among twenty times as many particles, and of course will only carry them one twentieth part as far; so that the bodies that are now large and heavy, would only move slowly, though they would move easily, if the attraction of the earth were to cease.|$|E

50|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Nauru wear the usual tropical clothes: short trousers and light shirts. Fishing still follows a traditional method: the island anglers wait in small <b>light</b> <b>boats</b> for fish to arrive. The custom of fishing by trained frigatebirds has been preserved.|$|R
60|$|When he {{left the}} crowd of boats, Raoul pulled toward the rocks which bound {{the shores of the}} bay, near the gardens of Portici. This was a point {{sufficiently}} removed from the common anchorage to be safe from observation; and yet so near as to be reached in considerably less than an hour. As the <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> proceeded Ghita gradually regained her composure. She dried her eyes and looked around her inquiringly, as if wondering whither their companion was taking them.|$|E
60|$|The {{two women}} became intimate. Their lives seemed {{suddenly}} to fuse into one, inseparable. Ursula went to Winifred's lodging, she spent there her only living hours. Winifred was {{very fond of}} water,--of swimming, of rowing. She belonged to various athletic clubs. Many delicious afternoons the two girls spent in a <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> on the river, Winifred always rowing. Indeed, Winifred seemed to delight in having Ursula in her charge, in giving things to the girl, in filling and enrichening her life.|$|E
6000|$|Three ducks were {{swooping}} {{down in a}} swift line. The guns banged, and a duck fluttered. The men {{pushed their}} <b>light</b> <b>boat</b> out on the burnished lake, disappeared beyond the reeds. Their cheerful voices and the slow splash and clank of oars came back to Carol from the dimness. In the sky a fiery plain sloped down to a serene harbor. It dissolved; the lake was white marble; and Kennicott was crying, [...] "Well, old lady, how about hiking out for home? Supper taste pretty good, eh?" ...|$|E
25|$|From 1979 to 2011, St. Joseph was {{the site}} of the Venetian Festival, which {{comprised}} three traditions: the Blessing of the River, the <b>Lighted</b> <b>Boat</b> Parade, and a Classic Boat Parade. The festival's name was a nod to similarities between St. Joseph and Venice, Italy.|$|R
