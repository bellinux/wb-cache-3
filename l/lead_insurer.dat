40|$|Are {{insurance}} companies relatively opaque? This question is investigated {{by comparing the}} bid-ask spreads of insurers and those of non-financial control firms. Results suggest that {{insurance companies}} are opaque. However, the in-formation asymmetry is only relatively large for small and low franchise-value insurance companies. Information asymmetry in the stock market, proxied by bid-ask spreads, is positively related to risky underwriting activities and private bonds, suggesting that they <b>lead</b> <b>insurers</b> to be more opaque. Liquid assets also amplify the level of information asymmetry due to asset transformation risk...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Solvency 2 advent and the best-estimate {{methodology}} {{in future}} cash-flows valuation <b>lead</b> <b>insurers</b> to focus particularly on their assumptions. In mortality, hypothesis are critical as insurers use best-estimate laws instead of standard mortality tables. Backtesting methods, i. e. ex-post modelling validation processes, are encouraged by regulators and rise an increasing interest among practitioners and academics. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach (both parametric and non-parametric models compliant) for mortality laws backtesting under model risk. Afterwards, a specification risk is introduced {{assuming that the}} mortality law is subject to random variations. Finally, the suitability of the proposed method will be assessed within this framework...|$|R

In June of 1998, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the National Association of Independent Insurers (NAII) sponsored a seminar titled, ''Solar Technology and the Insurance Industry. '' Presentations were made by insurance company representatives, insurance trade groups, government and state emergency management organizations, and technology specialists. The meeting was attended by insurers, brokers, emergency managers, and consultants from more than 25 US companies. <b>Leading</b> <b>insurers</b> from the personal line and commercial carriers were shown how solar technology {{can be used in}} underwriting, claims, catastrophe response, loss control, and risk management. Attendees requested a follow-up report on solar technology, cost, and applications in disasters, including suggestions on how to collaborate with the utility industry and how to develop educational programs for business and consumers. This report will address these issues, with an emphasis on pre-disaster planning and mitigation alternatives. It will also discuss how energy efficiency and renewable technologies can contribute to reducing insurance losses...|$|R

30|$|A {{rational}} insurer {{is concerned}} with the controls which directly mitigate the risks that they are liable for, creating a question of misaligned incentives. In the literature, the insurer is assumed to be the victim of moral hazard. We suggest that where an applicant expects the insurer to manage their cyber risk exposure, the presence of gaps in coverage can <b>lead</b> the <b>insurer</b> to select security controls which expose the insured party to risks not covered by the policy. Such a case is an example of moral hazard in which the insured party is the victim and the insurer is the “guilty” party.|$|R
40|$|The main {{causes that}} <b>lead</b> to <b>insurer’s</b> {{solvency}} {{issues such as}} the underwriting, investment or reinsurance deficiencies have remained the same over time. However, their incidence is increasing, as well as their complexity. Solvency II, the latest directive in this field is intended to be the legislative act that will settle the solvency issue on the European insurance market. The Solvency II Directive will lead to a new approach to the supervision process at the common European level, based on economic principles for assessing the assets and liabilities. It will use common principles when taking into account the multitude and variety of risks to which the company is exposed. These will form the basis for establishing the level of the capital and updating the calculation methods for the capital of the insurance companies under unusual circumstances.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the impact of {{intermediaries}} on insurance market transparency and performance. In a market exhibiting product differentiation and coexistence of perfectly and imperfectly informed consumers, competition among <b>insurers</b> <b>leads</b> to non-existence of a pure-strategy market equilibrium. Consumers may become informed about product suitability by consulting an intermediary. We explicitly model two intermediary remuneration systems: commissions and fees. We find that social welfare under fees is first-best efficient but fees lead to lower expected profits of insurers and non-existence of a pure-strategy market equilibrium. Commissions, in contrast, cause 'overinformation' of consumers relative to minimal social cost, but yield a full-information equilibrium in pure strategies associated with higher expected profits of insurers. This might explain why intermediaries are generally compensated by insurers. [...] product differentiation,intermediation,insurance oligopoly...|$|R
5000|$|Health care {{experts from}} across the {{political}} spectrum - liberal, moderate, and conservative - agreed that the House Republican health care bill was unworkable and suffered from fatal flaws, although specific objections varied depending on ideological perspective. Experts agreed that the bill fell far short of the goals laid forth by President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign - [...] "Affordable coverage for everyone; lower deductibles and health care costs; better care; and zero cuts to Medicaid" [...] - because the bill was (1) [...] "almost certain" [...] to reduce overall health care coverage and increase deductibles and (2) would phase out the Medicaid expansion. [...] Among the key concerns identified by health-care experts were that (1) the tax credits funded at the level proposed in the bill are insufficient to pay for individual insurance, and could lead to Americans dropping out of the health care market; (2) the bill's elimination of the ACA's community rating provision (barring insurance companies from charging older people more than three times what they charge younger people) would increase cost disparities between age groups and would increase premiums for Americans more prone to illness; (3) the dropping of healthy people from the health insurance market (adverse selection) could <b>lead</b> to <b>insurer</b> [...] "death spirals" [...] that would decrease choice; and (4) the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion was likely to result in a loss of healthcare for poorer Americans.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the avalanche of claims against attorneys, legal malpractice insurers have sought to limit their exposure. These insurers have followed the <b>lead</b> of <b>insurers</b> that issued directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies containing exclusionary provisions, {{commonly referred to as}} FDIC exclusions or regulatory exclusions. These policy provisions specifically excluded claims made by government regulators such as the FDIC and the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). Despite express exclusionary language in the directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, the FDIC and FSLIC challenged the regulatory exclusions. The regulators claimed that the exclusions were unenforceable because they were contrary to public policy. A number of trial courts have ruled on the validity of regulatory exclusions under directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. Some courts have been persuaded by the FDIC 2 ̆ 7 s myriad arguments and have declared that the regulatory exclusions are unenforceable because they contravene public policy. Other courts have held that no public policy abrogates the regulatory exclusions. To date, there has been no reported decision on regulatory exclusions in legal malpractice policies. Therefore, the only guidance on the enforceability of such exclusions is the case law on regulatory exclusions in directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies. After discussing the current case law and statutory developments affecting directors 2 ̆ 7 and officers 2 ̆ 7 liability policies, this article will consider the applicability of public policy arguments to legal malpractice policies. Finally, the article will discuss the consequences of judicial rewriting of the policies to both insured attorneys and their clients...|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{have said}} that the rate review process is not robust enough. [...] Without a federally {{mandated}} provision giving the ability to deny excessive rate increases, some insurances companies are still raising rates as much as before. For example, California can review rate requests for technical errors, but cannot deny rate increases. Notably, an initiative measure, “Approval of Healthcare Insurance Rate Changes,” will be on the November 2014 Statewide Ballot to require that health insurance rate changes be approved by the Insurance Commissioner before taking effect.Another criticism relates to the trigger for a rate review. Some consumer groups argue that the trigger for a review should include additional factors aside from just the proposed percentage increase in the premium. [...] These same groups want health insurance plans that have medical loss ratios under 80 percent to be subject to rate review.In terms of efficacy of the rate review program, those in the insurance industry argue that rate increases are the result, not the driver, of rising healthcare costs, and that insurance companies’ administrative costs and profits equal just 4 percent of national health expenditures. Rather than having regulators focus on restricting insurance rate increases, they say, government and others should make greater efforts to control underlying health spending, such as the outlays for hospital and physician services. Furthermore, insurers have raised the possibility that, if they are forced to accept rate increases that do not keep up with cost trends, pricing will be unsustainable in the long run. This could <b>lead</b> to <b>insurers</b> being driven out of business or forced to abandon particular markets or states.|$|R
40|$|Insurance {{contracts}} are frequently modelled as principal–agent relationships. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to examine the interaction between differential bargaining power and the efficiency of insurance contracts. The analysis is undertaken in a framework of state-contingent production, which allows us to consider, as separate choices, the level of effort committed by the client and the riskiness of the equilibrium state-contingent production vector. Our central result is that, in the presence of hold-up problems, the exercise of monopoly power by <b>insurers</b> <b>leads</b> clients to undertake socially costly self-protection, leading to suboptimal levels of insurance. Clients can exploit information asymmetries to offset the bargaining power of the insurer, but this process is also socially costly. Hence, competitive markets for insurance will yield a Pareto-superior outcome to the constrained Pareto-optimum reached in markets where insurers have monopoly power. More generally, in a bargaining situation, an increase in the bargaining power of clients will increase social welfare.

40|$|A global {{clean energy}} {{transformation}} is underwayand it has significant implications for fossil fuel {{companies and their}} investors. This new Ceres report, Assets or Liabilities? Fossil Fuel Investments of <b>Leading</b> U. S. <b>Insurers,</b> focuses on the risks to insurance companiesthe second-largest type of institutional investor after pension funds based on assets under management. It is already well understood by U. S. insurance regulators that insurers' massive bond and equity holdings expose them to both credit risk and systemic/market risk. As insurers also face uncertainty related to the size and timing of their insured loss payouts, insurance regulators require companies to invest conservatively so they can meet their financial obligations and remain financially stable. In light of these factors, {{as well as the}} crucial role of insurers in providing a safety net in the face of climate change, Ceres examined the 40 largest US insurance group's investments (bonds, common stock, and preferred stock) in the oil and gas, coal and electric/gas utilities sectors. Are insurers, and the industry's regulators, taking action to identify and evaluate their potential investment exposure? What are the best strategic options for companies to reduce identified threats, and how should regulators assess insurers' risk management...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} how {{the duty}} to settle, which requires liability insurers to pay damages awarded against their insured {{in excess of the}} policy limits when the insurers reject a reasonable settlement offer within the limits, may have indirectly led certain of their insureds [...] small business recreational vendors like horse riding stables or some motels offering swimming pools with diving boards [...] to sanitize the recreational activities they offer. More generally, {{the duty to}} settle 2 ̆ 7 s effect on the lawsuits injured customers brought against small business recreational vendors may have led a wide variety of such vendors to sanitize activities the vendors previously offered in a manner that disassociates the activities from the most severe injuries, but leaves them less enjoyable for many. This paper 2 ̆ 7 s scope is narrow. In sum, the duty to settle helps the severely injured plaintiff, or, more precisely, any plaintiff whose suit might result in a larger judgment, bargain for the limits of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability insurance. The duty to settle achieves this effect by making it harder for the small business defendant and its liability insurer to exploit the advantages that arise from the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s judgment-proof status. The liability insurer can no longer take advantage of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s judgment-proof status and of the ceiling that imposes upon the best possible outcome for a plaintiff continuing to litigate. In the absence of the duty to settle, or of some other method for giving plaintiffs access to unlimited liability insurance, the plaintiffs understandably resign themselves to bargaining down from those limits. By undermining the effect of those limits, the duty to settle dramatically increases the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s exposure, especially for severe injuries, and, hence, <b>leads</b> the <b>insurer</b> to pressure its insured to alter its activities so as to reduce the chance, for whatever reason, of a customer suffering a severe injury...|$|R
40|$|Air {{transport}} {{is subject}} to various risks. One of them is bird strike hazard. Despite numerous regulations concerning prevention from this type of occurrence, {{it is not possible}} to eliminate them entirely. Bird strikes most often take place during take-off and landing, that is on or in the vicinity of an airport. For that reason airport operators are the first parties that can be made accountable for this occurence. International law imposes numerous responsibilities on airport operators in terms of bird strike hazard prevention on air operations, thus placing airport operators in a “key position” in the system of safety. However, the party that suffers significant damages in the first instance, is the aircraft operator. If a bird strike takes place on or in the vicinity of an airport, an aicraft operator can sue the airport operator for compensation of damages. Generally, the issue of indemnity {{is subject to}} out of court negotiations, however instances in which there is a lack of agreement between the parties, i. e. airport operator, aircraft operator or their <b>insurers,</b> <b>lead</b> to legal proceedings for compensation. This article attempts to illustrate the relationship between air traffic participants such as airport operators and aircraft operators in connection with their obligations and liability, particulary taking into account the legal obligations of an airport operator...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we explain}} why {{existing}} cyber-insurance contracts condi-tion their premiums {{only on a}} client’s general features (such {{as the number of}} employees, sales volume) but do not reflect the client’s security practices. Indeed, we show that even if a competitive insurer can monitor (and enforce) security requirements for a vast majority of his clients, with only a minor fraction of the clients being able to subvert monitoring, no equilibrium con-tract would include security requirements. We consider arbitrary risk-averse users, whose costs of improving security are given by an arbitrary convex function. In our model, a user’s probability to incur damage (from being attacked) depends on both his own security and network security: thus, secu-rity is interdependent. We introduce two user types (normal and malicious), and allow one of the user types (malicious users) to be able to subvert insurer monitoring, even when security levels of normal users are perfectly enforce-able (zero cost) for insurers. This asymmetric information causes adverse selection problem (i. e., malicious users will buy insurance, which <b>leads</b> to higher <b>insurer</b> costs). We prove that no matter how small the fraction of malicious users is, equilibrium contract that specifies user security does not exist. Thus, we demonstrate, in a general setting, a failure of cyber-insurance market to underwrite contracts conditioning user premium on user security...|$|R
40|$|Subrogation {{means that}} a person who indemnifies another is {{entitled}} to step into the shoes of the person and take over whatever right he may have against third parties. But, it is found that the insurers are not always successful in their subrogation claims against the wrongdoer in the construction industry. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} insurers? right of subrogation claim in construction contract, this master project has been carried out with the intention to identify circumstances that do not allow insurers to exercise their rights of subrogation. This project has been carried out mainly through documentary analysis of the relevant cases repeated in law journals, such as Malayan Law Journal, Singapore Law Report, Building Law Report, etc. Eighteen cases has been chosen to be analysed in accordance with the feature of right of subrogation against co-insured and the waiver of subrogation clauses in the standard forms of contract. The result showed that, in conjunction with insurance clauses, construction contracts do include provisions that require the insurance policies to be in the form of joint names of the employer, contractor, subcontractor and all related third parties. This would <b>lead</b> to the <b>insurers</b> not being able to exercise the usual rights of subrogation against any of the joint insured. Besides that, the construction contracts also require the insurance policies to contain cross liability or waiver of subrogation clauses. The clauses provide that the insurances carrier, after settling and paying a claim, cannot pursue the damage paid for by the insured parties? insurance carrier. These effectively prevent an insurer from seeking recovery from the party at fault. So, where a loss has been caused by a subcontractor and the principal contractor seeked recovery, the insurer cannot pursue the claim from the subcontractor...|$|R
40|$|Transparency in {{insurance}} law {{attaches to the}} rights and duties of the parties, the relationships between insurers, insurance intermediaries such as agents and brokers, insurance supervisory law and insurance dispute resolution procedures. Regarding the rights and duties of the insurer and the prospective policyholder, it requires insurers to disclose precontractual information {{in a timely manner}} that is clear, understandable, legible and unambiguous. Transparency as a value is incredibly important {{in insurance}} contracts. This contribution focuses exclusively on the insurer's duty of disclosure during precontractual negotiations. Although the insured's duty of disclosure has enjoyed more attention in the past, the duty clearly applies to the insurance proposer as well as the insurer. The purpose of this contribution is to evaluate {{the nature and extent of}} the insurer's transparency duties as informed by both common and statutory laws. The insurer's duty is derived primarily from the statutory rights of access to information in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and the Promotion of Access to Information Act. It is furthermore supported by specific insurance consumer protection law found in the detailed provisions on mandatory disclosures in the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, the Long-term Insurance Act, the Short-term Insurance Act and, finally, the Policyholder Protection Rules issued in accordance with these acts. Strict rules on advertising can be found in the General Code of Conduct issued under the FAIS Act. The Act furthermore specifically targets the activities of insurance intermediaries in precontractual disclosures. The fact that insurance products and services have been exempted from the scope of the Consumer Protection Act from 28 February 2014 should not diminish the insured's right to rely on universal consumer protection principles as envisaged by South African insurance legislation. The insurer's duty to disclose is in the last instance also derived from the common law duty not to make misrepresentations by commission or omission. When negotiating an insurance contract, the insurer's duty to speak is not based on a general requirement of bona fides, but is recognised as an ex lege duty due to the involuntary reliance of the prospective insured on information supplied by insurers in the market. A lack of transparency should <b>lead</b> to the <b>insurer's</b> accountability. A failure to disclose material information or a disclosure of false information that goes to the root of the matter and that induces the prospective policyholder to buy the insurance product is recognised as an actionable misrepresentation. Statutory provisions do not diminish the common-law duty not to make misrepresentations, but provide details of the nature and extent of the information duty to provide clarity and legal certainty in the determination of the standards of transparency required in law. In addition, statutes provide for enforcement actions by regulators, orders that could affect the licence of the insurer and provide for punishable offences and penalties. In terms of common law, a misrepresentation by omission or commission renders the insurance contract wholly or in part voidable. The policyholder may decide to rescind the contract and claim restitution. He may also, in conjunction with rescission, or as an alternative when deciding to maintain the contract, claim delictual damages or even constitutional damages when judged by a court of law as appropriate relief. Statutory remedies include a monetary award by the Insurance Ombud. Even though such an award is capped at R 800 000, it is submitted that it is preferred to a civil law damages claim. ...|$|R
