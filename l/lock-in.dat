30|$|Recent {{contributions}} to the literature on incumbents’ rigidities and path dependence emphasize that both resource-based and routine-based reasons for the stability of strategic patterns can largely {{be traced back to}} organizations’ unchanged strategic premises (Benner and Tripsas 2012; Gilbert 2005, 2006; Koch 2011; Rothmann and Koch 2014; Tripsas and Gavetti 2000). Strategic premises are the basic assumptions on which strategic patterns are based and consist of a system’s self-understanding and its perception of the environment (Albert and Whetten 1985; Porac and Thomas 1989). In mature industries, the strategic premises of market players may converge even across different institutional frameworks (Benner and Tripsas 2012; Flier et al. 2003; Huff 1982; Porac et al. 1989; Spender 1989). While strategic premises generally guide strategic choice, they may become particularly problematic in <b>lock-ins</b> (Tripsas 2009). Because strategic premises constitute {{an essential part of the}} organizational context in which the strategic path is engraved, they tightly constrain strategic activities in <b>lock-ins</b> due to constrained perceptions or normative rejections of strategic alternatives and the contraction of resource investments (Koch 2011; Miller and Chen 1994; Rothmann 2013; Sydow et al. 2009; Tripsas and Gavetti 2000). Therefore, the literature on incumbents’ rigidities and path dependence regards the update of potentially obsolete strategic premises in <b>lock-ins</b> as a necessary pre-condition for strategic change in <b>lock-ins</b> (Rothmann and Koch 2014; Tripsas 2009; Tripsas and Gavetti 2000).|$|R

40|$|Since the Industrial Revolution the {{cyclical}} {{processes of}} {{rise and fall}} of regional economies have been accelerating. Many of the specific problems of the falling part of clustering, that is old industrial areas, are related to path dependency and <b>lock-ins.</b> Particularly political <b>lock-ins</b> hinder the necessary restructuring processes in old industrial areas. They can be considered as thick institutional tissues aiming at preserving existing industrial structures and therefore unnecessarily slowing down industrial restructuring and indirectly hampering the development of indigenous potential and creativity. Of the recently born offspring of the family of territorial innovation models, the learning region concept seems to be most focused on overcoming and avoiding political <b>lock-ins</b> in old industrial areas. Most scholars consider learning regions as regional 2 development concepts in which the main actors are strongly, but flexibly connected with each other and are open both to intra-regional and inter-regional learning processes. Policy-makers in learning regions are involved in learning from institutional errors made in the past and by doing that in avoiding path-dependent development. Empirical evidence shows that the learning region is of limited importance to unlock regional economies from path dependency, due to three weaknesses: its fuzziness, its normative character in its squeezed position between national innovation systems and global production networks. A less normative and more process-oriented concept is proposed in this paper, namely that of the learning cluster. key words: learning region, regional innovation policy, industrial restructuring, path dependency, <b>lock-ins,</b> learning cluste...|$|R

40|$|Spatial <b>lock-ins</b> may {{hinder the}} {{physical}} environment from adapting to new conditions and thereby risk to inhibit necessary change in society and reproduce current structures. This process reinforces uneven geographic development and urban interpretive prerogative. The study aims to strengthen the ability of planning practice to open spatial <b>lock-ins</b> caused by urbanisation and to confront challenges generated by uneven geographic development. Focus is set on how planning practice can establish and activate relevant local-regional contexts for specific planning situations, and clarify and enable combinations of resources that are made invisible when economic growth dominates planning objectives. The research is conducted through a design-based research process where participation in planning practices has enabled an active interplay between practice and theory. Through architectural thinking, spatial alternatives have been modelled to test theoretical argumentation, and has made visible and problematized spatial situations and their structural conditions. The research has been developed and made operative through the work in two empirical contexts: In-depth comprehensive plan Mariestad – Tidanpromenaden and Structural image Skaraborg as research tools. The study develops a theoretical and methodological framework constituted by three interacting conceptual tools. The first conceptual tool, fragile urban landscapes clarifies how spatial <b>lock-ins</b> cause fragile social, political, economic and ecological processes. It makes visible how the interplay between spatial conditions and structural transformations create <b>lock-ins</b> as combinations of scarcity of resources, competence, decision mandate and rigidity in current spatial structures and planning organisation. The second conceptual tool, urban ecologies, makes visible the urban landscape as layered complex productive material and discursive configurations. Urban ecologies can thereby {{be used as a}} tool to reveal how topographies, infrastructures and resources both enable and constrain transformation and change in society. The third conceptual tool, urban key projects, relates to situation-oriented interventions that combine resources from different urban ecologies in order to trigger local-regional transformation. The research demonstrates how the three conceptual tools together can support planning practice to implement material and discursive changes in order to break reproduction of spatial <b>lock-ins</b> and support re-negotiations of the urban landscape. This implies a process of reading and mapping material and discursive compositions, re-valuing and combining resources and potential related to the planning situation, problematizing ongoing transformation processes, formulating alternative directions of development and an incremental, coupled and long-term implementation. Hereby the developed theoretical and methodological framework can be used to open spatial lockins and expand local-regional acting space for planning practice...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{empirical}} and theoretical literature on economic growth {{to examine how}} the four components of the climate change bill, namely mitigation, proactive (ex ante) adaptation, reactive (ex post) adaptation, and ultimate damages of climate change affect growth, especially in developing countries. The authors consider successively the Cass-Koopmans growth model and three major strands of the subsequent literature on growth: with multiple sectors, with rigidities, and with increasing returns. The paper finds that although the growth literature rarely addresses climate change per se, some issues discussed in the growth literature are directly relevant for climate change analysis. Notably, destruction of production factors, or decrease in factor productivity may strongly affect long-run equilibrium growth even in one-sector neoclassical growth models; climatic shocks have had large impacts on growth in developing countries because of rigidities; and the introducing increasing returns has {{a major impact on}} growth dynamics, in particular through induced technical change, poverty traps, or <b>lock-ins.</b> Among the most important gaps identified in the literature are lack of understanding of the channels by which shocks affect economic growth, lack of understanding of <b>lock-ins,</b> heavy reliance of numerical models assessing climate policies on neoclassical-type growth frameworks, and frequent use of an inappropriat...|$|R
