5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bat)</b> is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} east-central Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1906, this species was later included in the mainland African M.minor. A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M.manavi in fact included five different species. M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to different species.|$|E

40|$|Behavioral {{plasticity}} is a {{key feature}} allowing animals to broaden their dietary niche when novel food resources become available, and <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats</b> provide an appropriate model system to study the underpinnings of behavioral plasticity, since although generally being an insectivorous species, some individuals {{have been reported to}} catch fish. Aiming to get insight into the origin of fishing behavior in <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats,</b> we studied in the field the differences in sensorial and mechanical reactions to insect-like (stationary) and fish-like (temporary) prey stimuli between well-known piscivorous and strictly insectivorous individuals. Both piscivorous and insectivorous individuals exhibited a qualitatively similar reaction to temporary target stimuli (longer and deeper dips and terminal echolocation phase skewed towards buzz I compared to stationary stimuli). Nevertheless, the quantitative differences observed in the sensorial and mechanical features (the intensity of the shift was significantly greater in piscivorous than in insectivorous individuals) show that piscivorous individuals have honed their capture technique likely enhancing the fishing success. Thus, our results suggest that the fishing technique was developed from a primary reaction shared by all <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats.</b> All individuals seem to be mechanically and sensorially adapted to detect and capture fish, although under appropriate environmental conditions, they would further improve their technique by experience and/or social learning...|$|R
50|$|LLOV was {{discovered}} in 2002 in Schreibers's <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats</b> (species Miniopterus schreibersii) found dead in Cueva del Lloviu, Asturias, Spain, {{as well as in}} caves in Spanish Cantabria and in caves in France and Portugal. It has not yet been proven that the virus is the etiological agent of a novel bat disease, but healthy Schreibers' <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats</b> were not found to contain traces of the viruses, thereby at least suggesting that the virus may be pathogenic for certain bats. Necropsies of dead bats did not reveal macroscopic pathology, but microscopic examination suggested viral pneumonia. Cueva del Lloviu is frequented by tourists, yet no human infections or disease has ever been observed, suggesting that LLOV is the second filovirus not pathogenic for humans (the first one being Reston virus (RESTV)).|$|R

The woodland is also a good habitat for various birds including jays (Garrulus), Syrian woodpeckers (Dendrocopos syriacus), Sardinian warblers (Sylvia melanocephala), Eurasian hobbies (Falco subbuteo), great tits (Parus major), great spotted cuckoos (Clamator glandarius) and snake eagles (Circaetus).|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses {{can create}} {{endogenous}} forms on infiltration into the germline cells of their hosts. These forms are then vertically transmitted {{and can be}} considered as genetic fossils of ancient viruses. All retrovirus genera, with the exception of deltaretroviruses, have had their representation identified in the host genome as a virus fossil record. Here we describe an endogenous Deltaretrovirus, identified in the germline of <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats</b> (Miniopteridae). A single, heavily deleted copy of this retrovirus has been found in the genome of miniopterid species, but not in the genomes of the phylogenetically closest bat families, Vespertilionidae and Cistugonidae. Therefore, the endogenization occurred in a time interval between 20 and 45 million years ago. This discovery closes the last major gap in the retroviral fossil record and provides important insights into the history of deltaretroviruses in mammals...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLloviu virus (LLOV), a phylogenetically {{divergent}} filovirus, is {{the proposed}} etiologic agent of die-offs of Schreibers׳s <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats</b> (Miniopterus schreibersii) in western Europe. Studies of LLOV remain limited because the infectious agent {{has not yet}} been isolated. Here, we generated a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the LLOV spike glycoprotein (GP) and used it to show that LLOV GP resembles other filovirus GP proteins in structure and function. LLOV GP must be cleaved by endosomal cysteine proteases during entry, but is much more protease-sensitive than EBOV GP. The EBOV/MARV receptor, Niemann–Pick C 1 (NPC 1), is also required for LLOV entry, and its second luminal domain is recognized with high affinity by a cleaved form of LLOV GP, suggesting that receptor binding would not impose a barrier to LLOV infection of humans and non-human primates. The use of NPC 1 as an intracellular entry receptor may be a universal property of filoviruses...|$|R

40|$|The <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bats</b> (Miniopterus sp.) {{are among}} the most widely {{distributed}} mammals in the world. However, despite recent focus on the systematics of these bats, their taxonomic position has not been resolved. Traditionally, they are considered to be sole members of Miniopterinae, 1 of 5 subfamilies within the largest family of bats, the Vespertilionidae. However, this classification has increasingly been called into question. Miniopterines differ extensively from other vespertilionids in numerous aspects of morphology, embryology, immunology, and, most recently, genetics. Recent molecular studies have proposed that the miniopterines are sufficiently distinct from vespertilionids that Miniopterinae should be elevated to full familial status. However, controversy remains regarding the relationship of the putative family, Miniopteridae to existing Vespertilionidae and to the closely related free-tailed bats, the Molossidae. We report here the first conclusive analysis of the taxonomic position of Miniopterus relative to all other bat families. We generated one of the largest chiropteran data sets to date, incorporating ∼ 11 kb of sequence data from 16 nuclear genes, from representatives of all bat families and 2 Miniopterus species. Our data confirm the distinctiveness of Miniopterus, and we support previous recommendations to elevate these bats to full familial status. We estimate that they diverged from all other bat species approximately 49 – 38 MYA, which is comparable to most other bat families. Furthermore, we find very strong support from all phylogenetic methods for a sister group relationship between Miniopteridae and Vespertilionidae. The Molossidae diverged from these lineages approximately 54 – 43 MYA and form a sister group to the Miniopteridae–Vespertilionidae clade...|$|R

50|$|Cape {{horseshoe}} bats are {{endemic to}} Cape Province in South Africa, where they inhabit shrubby coastal environments. They are nocturnal, spending the day roosting in large colonies in coastal caves or mine adits. They are often found {{together with other}} species of bat, including Geoffroy's horseshoe bat and Schreibers' <b>long-fingered</b> <b>bat.</b> They are ambush hunters, hiding among vegetation and preying mainly on beetles and moths. Their echolocation calls are relatively long, lasting from 28 to 42 milliseconds, with only short pauses between pulses. The peak frequency varies between different individuals, ranging from 82 to 86 kHz. This type of call enables them to quickly locate rapidly moving insects in cluttered environments with plentiful vegetation.|$|E

Changes in the corpus luteum volume corresponded closely with those of plasma progesterone values. Maintenance of gravid females at 25 =deg 2 weeks in winter resulted in significant increases in the plasma progesterone concentration and the corpus luteum volume...|$|E
