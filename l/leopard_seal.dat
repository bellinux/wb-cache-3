5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> {{is known}} to prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern fur seals and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American fur seals.|$|E
5|$|The {{emperor penguin}} {{has some of}} its {{breeding}} places concentrated in Queen Maud Land. All four of the true Antarctic seals, namely the Weddell seal, <b>leopard</b> <b>seal,</b> crabeater seal and Ross seal, {{can be found in}} the King Haakon VII Sea off Queen Maud Land. The Ross seal is notably found in its greatest numbers in the King Haakon VII Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} predators thought to attack healthy adults, and who attack emperor {{penguins}} in the water, are both mammals. The {{first is the}} <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> (Hydrurga leptonyx), which takes some adult birds, as well as fledglings soon after they enter the water. Orcas (Orcinus orca), mostly take adult birds, although they will attack penguins of any age in or near water.|$|E
25|$|Pinnipeds inhabiting {{the areas}} include South American sea lions, South American fur <b>seals,</b> {{carnivorous}} <b>leopard</b> <b>seals</b> (seal-eating seal) and gigantic southern elephant seals.|$|R

5|$|The {{macaroni}} penguin's predators {{consist of}} birds and aquatic mammals. The <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> (Hydrurga leptonyx), Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), Subantarctic fur seal (A. tropicalis), and killer whale (Orcinus orca) sometimes hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Colonies suffer low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take eggs and young that have been left unattended or deserted. Skua species, the snowy sheathbill (Chionis alba), and kelp gull (Larus dominicanus) prey on eggs, and skuas and giant petrels also sometimes take chicks.|$|E
5|$|While most vocals are audible to {{the human}} ear, a captive <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> was {{recorded}} making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce infrasonic vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.|$|E
5|$|Seals {{typically}} consume {{their prey}} underwater {{where it is}} swallowed whole. Prey that is too large or awkward is taken to the surface to be torn apart. The <b>leopard</b> <b>seal,</b> a prolific predator of penguins, is known to violently swing its prey back and forth until it is decapitated. The elaborately cusped teeth of filter-feeding species, such as crabeater seals, allow them to remove water before they swallow their planktonic food. The walrus is unique in that it consumes its prey by suction feeding, using its tongue to suck the meat of a bivalve out of the shell. While pinnipeds mostly hunt in the water, South American sea lions are known to chase down penguins on land. Some species may swallow stones or pebbles for reasons not understood. Though they can drink seawater, pinnipeds get most of their fluid intake from the food they eat.|$|E

5|$|Although {{pinnipeds}} are widespread, {{most species}} prefer the colder {{waters of the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They {{spend most of their}} lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; but a few, like the <b>leopard</b> <b>seal,</b> feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. Walruses are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice- or water-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. Walruses are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of walruses and the complex songs of Weddell seals.|$|E

50|$|New Zealand fur seals’ known predators are killer whales, sharks, male New Zealand sea lions, and {{possibly}} <b>leopard</b> <b>seals.</b> New Zealand sea lions are also known to target pups as their prey.|$|R
50|$|<b>Leopard</b> <b>seals</b> {{have shown}} a predilection for attacking the black, torpedo-shaped {{pontoons}} of rigid inflatable boats, necessitating researchers to equip their craft with special protective guards {{to prevent them from}} being punctured.|$|R
25|$|Hunting {{by humans}} {{is no longer}} a serious threat. The eggs and chicks of the ducks are at risk from {{introduced}} brown rats and predatory birds, especially brown skuas. There is a record of an adult bird being killed and eaten by a <b>leopard</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seals {{are known}} to inhabit the sound in various {{locations}} along the coast and on the islands. The species that are sighted most often are the Australian sea lion and the New Zealand fur seal. Species that have been sighted, but {{are considered to be}} occasional visitors, include the subantarctic fur seal and the <b>leopard</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|E
25|$|After Life in the Freezer was broadcast, A. N. Wilson, then a {{television}} reviewer for The Independent, {{wrote a column}} accusing the production team of staging a harrowing sequence in which a <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> killed and dismembered a young penguin. He claimed that the chances of filming natural behaviour like this were far too low, and that the crew must have thrown baby penguins to the seal until they got the shot they wanted.|$|E
50|$|The Weddell Sea is {{abundant}} with whales and seals. Characteristic fauna {{of the sea}} include the Weddell seal and killer whales, humpback whales, minke whales, <b>leopard</b> <b>seals,</b> and crabeater seals are frequently seen during Weddell Sea voyages.|$|R
2500|$|Also, {{a number}} of marine mammals {{are found in the}} waters of the Chathams, {{including}} New Zealand sea lions, <b>leopard</b> <b>seals,</b> and southern elephant seals. Many whale species are [...] attracted to the rich food sources of the Chatham Rise.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrurga Cove (...) is a cove on the {{southwest}} side of Signy Island, in the South Orkney Islands, opening on Fyr Channel. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after the <b>leopard</b> <b>seals,</b> Hydrurga leptonyx, that commonly frequent the cove.|$|R
25|$|The crabeater seal {{shares a}} common recent {{ancestor}} {{with the other}} Antarctic seals, which are together known as the lobodontine seals. These include the Ross seal (Ommatophoca rossii), <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> (H. leptonyx) and Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli). These species, collectively belonging to the Lobodontini tribe of seals, share teeth adaptations including lobes and cusps useful for straining smaller prey items {{out of the water}} column. The ancestral Lobodontini likely diverged from their sister clade, the Mirounga (elephant seals) in the late Miocene to early Pliocene, when they migrated southward and diversified rapidly in relative isolation around Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} a chick is tragic, but it does allow the parents {{to return to the}} sea to feed {{for the rest of the}} {{breeding}} season. When a mother penguin loses its young in a fierce storm, it sometimes attempts to steal another mother's chick. At times, the young are abandoned by one parent, and they must rely on the return of the other parent, which can recognize the chick only from its unique call. Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the <b>leopard</b> <b>seal),</b> dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground.|$|E
25|$|Hubie, a shy, gullible, but {{kindhearted}} penguin, is in {{love with}} the female penguin Marina, but he lacks self-confidence leading him to be bullied by the much more impressive, but the vain and cruel Drake, who also wants Marina, but clearly for lust. One night, Hubie and Marina manage to confirm how they feel for each other, but Hubie cannot quite find a perfect pebble to propose to Marina with. He wishes on a star to make his dream come true and he receives a beautiful emerald cube (whom he mistook it for a pebble) from the sky. Ecstatic, Hubie rushes to find Marina but is thwarted by Drake, who demands Hubie to give him the emerald. When Hubie refuses, Drake throws him into the water. Hubie narrowly escapes from a <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> and climbs onto a piece of ice where he is swept away from Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|Antarctic krill is the {{keystone}} {{species of the}} ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, <b>seals,</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>seals,</b> fur seals, crabeater seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds. The ocean there is so full of phytoplankton because around the ice continent water rises from the depths to the light flooded surface, bringing nutrients from all oceans back to the photic zone.|$|R
50|$|In Antarctica, {{three young}} penguin brothers—Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico—defy {{the laws of}} nature to save an egg the other {{penguins}} believe to be doomed. After saving it from a pack of <b>leopard</b> <b>seals</b> and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into Private.|$|R
2500|$|Antarctic krill is the {{keystone}} {{species of the}} Antarctic ecosystem beyond the coastal shelf, and provides an important food source for whales, <b>seals,</b> <b>leopard</b> <b>seals,</b> fur seals, crabeater seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other species of birds. Crabeater seals have even developed special teeth as an adaptation to catch this abundant food source: its unusual multilobed teeth enable this species to sieve krill from the water. Its dentition looks like a perfect strainer, but how it operates in detail is still unknown. Crabeaters are the most abundant seal in the world; 98% of their diet {{is made up of}} [...] E. superba. These seals consume over 63 million tonnes of krill each year. <b>Leopard</b> <b>seals</b> have developed similar teeth (45% krill in diet). All seals consume 63–130 million tonnes, all whales 34–43 million tonnes, birds 15–20 million tonnes, squid 30–100 million tonnes, and fish 10–20 million tonnes, adding up to 152–313 million tonnes of krill consumption each year.|$|R
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that as {{with some other}} seabirds (e.g. the flightless Plotopteridae), the evolutionary radiation of cetaceans and pinnipeds outcompeted the pseudotooth birds and drove them into extinction. While this may be correct for the plotopterids, for pelagornithids it is not all too likely for two reasons: First, the Pelagornithidae continued to thrive for 10 million years after modern-type baleen whales evolved, and in the Middle Miocene Pelagornis coexisted with Aglaocetus and Harrison's whale (Eobalaenoptera harrisoni) in the Atlantic off the Eastern Seaboard, while the Pacific Osteodontornis inhabited the same seas as Balaenula and Morenocetus; the ancestral smallish sperm whale genus Aulophyseter (and/or Orycterocetus) occurred in both Northern Hemisphere oceans at that time, while the mid-sized sperm whale Brygmophyseter roamed the North Pacific. As regards Miocene pinnipeds, a diversity of ancient walruses and ancestral fur seals like Thalassoleon inhabited the north-east, while the ancient <b>leopard</b> <b>seal</b> Acrophoca is a remarkable species known from the south-east Pacific. Secondly, pinnipeds are limited to near-shore waters while pseudotooth birds roamed the seas far and wide, like large cetaceans, and like all big carnivores all three groups were K-strategists with moderate to very low population densities.|$|E
