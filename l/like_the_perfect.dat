After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one at an outdoor restaurant. For the final scene, Hardwell used a crane shot on the Numb3rs sound stage.|$|E

Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying breath that if she were to give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessus’ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> solution to her problem to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E

The song features additional vocals from American rapper Lil Jon. GoonRock produced and later mixed the song alongside Kenny Moran at The House on the Hill Studios in Los Angeles, California. Of GoonRock, Lopez commented by stating that he is [...] "very forward with his sound". After recording her vocals for the song, Flo Rida recorded a rap verse for the song. Those involved {{in the production of}} the song were extremely happy with the song before Flo Rida's rap appeared on it, but once his vocals were on the song it [...] "took it over the top top". When choosing who she wanted to feature on the song, Lopez had several other rappers in mind, such as Big Sean. Lopez revealed: [...] "We had a couple of people who said yes, that they would get on it, but [...] just seemed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> one."

[...] Spotnitz was very excited about bringing closure to the Pfaster-Scully story. He explained, [...] "For me, what really justified bringing Donnie back was the final act of the script when Donnie comes for Scully and she ends up shooting him full of holes." [...] The final scene, however, proved difficult to script. Director Rob Bowman noted, that the act [...] "was a tough scene.

5000|$|The term [...] "perfect" [...] {{was first}} applied {{in discussions of}} Latin grammar, {{to refer to a}} tense which expresses a {{completed}} action ("perfect" [...] in the sense of [...] "finished").

And we also felt like college is so much about self-discovery and figuring out who you are." [...] He added, [...] "It felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> place to do this, but we had that line. So we tried versions where they met young and then we skipped ahead to college.

[...] Scanlon said during pre-production that, [...] "Pete Docter, the original director, and John Lasseter…finally said to me, 'it's great that you're honoring that, but you have to do what's right for the story.'

Georgette Cline of The Boombox gave the song a positive review stating that, although the lyrics are {{a bit on the}} morbid side, it works in Beyoncé's favor, [...] "proving she can tackle a myriad of subjects". Matthew Horton of BBC criticized the song's order of placement on the track list of 4, stating that [...] "'Run the World (Girls)' is tagged on like a bonus track following 'I Was Here', which sounds <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> ending for the album." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also had the same view, saying it [...] "disrupts the flow of up-tempo songs on the second half 4". Perpetua however calls it a [...] "showstopper" [...] and added that it [...] "work well as a bittersweet emotional climax for the album". Perpetua finished his review by saying that [...] "'I Was Here' is the blustery ballad one would expect by a Beyoncé/Warren team-up, and stands off as flat and generic when compared to the rest of 4." [...] Another reviewer of the same magazine, Jody Rosen complimented Beyoncé's vocals stating that she sings with authority; however, he coined [...] "I Was Here" [...] as a low point on the album and added that it is [...] "swamped in 'My Way'-style self-mythologizing." ...|$|E

[...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical.

And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical.

500|$|Despite other R-rated horror films having {{centered}} around teenagers, {{some such as}} Scream having been successful, Bock said the second reason Jennifer's Body under-performed {{at the box office}} is the R-rating, which he described as a [...] "killer" [...] for the film. He said the film is set in high school and [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> package for teens" [...] but that [...] "the R rating banned many teens from the theaters" [...] and the studio was left with [...] "an R-rated film marketed to whom, exactly?" [...] Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly felt that it was a slow and disappointing weekend for the box office in general; 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was steep competition, and with low box office performances by the Matt Damon film The Informant! and Jennifer Aniston film Love Happens, she concluded that this may support [...] "the current hypothesis floating around Hollywood, that movie stars no longer matter" [...] and that it takes more than a name to open a film. S.T. VanAirsdale of Movieline echoed Sperling's sentiment about the weekend, as [...] "some of the stinkiest high-profile openings in recent memory". He concluded five reasons for Jennifer's Bodys underperformance at the box office. The first, he said, is the distributor. [...] "20th Century Fox's genre wing, Fox Atomic, had Jennifer's Body in the can by the time the mother ship shut it down last spring", he said. [...] "Instead of offloading the film to Fox Searchlight, which nimbly maneuvered Diablo Cody's previous brainchild Juno to awards-season lucre in 2007, a decision was somehow reached to fill a gap in Big Fox's early fall slate with a gory" [...] and [...] "post-feminist horror romp starring Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried". VanAirsdale classified this as a [...] "ig mistake" [...] and that [...] "ou'd {{have to go back to}} The Devil Wears Prada to find an example of a Fox release that worked without a genuine male lead; you’d probably have to go back to Aliens to find a genre example of such that they pulled off successfully." [...] He named the second reason as the marketing, stating that the film was not well-marketed (whether by billboards, transit posters, lobby standees, or other promotional venues), even in New York.|$|E
