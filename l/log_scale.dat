40|$|Experiments in an {{extraordinary}} turbulent boundary layer called the sink flow, displaying a perfect streamwise invariance, show a wide extent of logarithmic scaling for moments of streamwise velocity up to order 12, even at moderate Reynolds numbers. This is in striking contrast to canonical constant-pressure turbulent boundary layers that show such comprehensive <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> only at ultra-high Reynolds numbers. This demonstrates that ultra-high Reynolds number is not necessary for comprehensive <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> to occur; while specific details of the sink flow are special, the relevance to general turbulent boundary layers is that the sink flow {{underscores the importance of}} the streamwise invariance condition that needs to be met in a general flow for obtaining <b>log</b> <b>scaling.</b> Indeed, a simple heuristic theory shows that, for <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> in the inertial sublayer, the invariance of dimensionless mean velocity and higher-order moments along a mean streamline is a necessary and sufficient condition. Ultra-high Reynolds number primarily appears to make these log scalings universal. Comment: 05 pages (including bibliography), 03 figures (figure # 3 has three subplots...|$|R
40|$|Two {{equation}} {{and higher}} order closures for compressible turbulence fail {{to capture the}} compressible wall layers' <b>log</b> <b>scaling.</b> Accounting for the distinction between Favre and Reynolds averaged variables in the compressible moment equations indicate that turbulent transport expressions obtained using the 'variable density approximation' are in error. The error {{is related to the}} enstrophy, a Reynolds averaged variable appearing in the equation for the Favre averaged k; recognizing this fact an expression for the transport of dissipation consistent with simple mixing length arguments is obtained. Within the (limited) context of a gradient transport hypothesis a rational form for the turbulent transport of the dissipation is found. Modestly better agreement with the well established compressible Van Driest <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> is found in k - epsilon calculation...|$|R

In discrete terms, the number of overestimates minus underestimates will have a binomial distribution. In continuous terms, if one makes a Fermi estimate of n steps, with standard deviation σ units on the <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> from the actual value, then the overall estimate will have standard deviation σ, since the standard deviation of a sum scales as [...] {{in the number of}} summands.|$|E

[...] This follows, because many natural growth processes are driven by the accumulation of many small percentage changes.

[...] When back-transformed onto the original scale, it makes the distribution of sizes approximately log-normal (though if the standard deviation is sufficiently small, the normal distribution can be an adequate approximation).|$|E

50|$|A <b>log</b> <b>scaling</b> {{method that}} has been popular since the {{adaptation}} of trucks to haul logs has been the 'ramp scale'. In this approach, the log truck is driven beside a scale ramp which is simply an elevated platform, and from there the log scaler climbs around on the truck and on the load and measures and grades the logs. Although the ramp is typically operated by the scaling bureau, it may be located with a sawmill yard that is buying the logs {{or it may be}} at some other convenient location. Depending on the location, the ramp may <b>scale</b> <b>logs</b> for a single mill, or the ramp may be located so that <b>logs</b> <b>scaled</b> may proceed to multiple destinations. The photo at the right shows two trucks at a typical Pacific Northwest bureau scale ramp. Ramp scaling is often used where space is limited, speed is important, or the logs are of relatively low value. Assessing the grade of each log involves inspecting it for defects, but when a given log is situated {{in the middle of a}} truckload of logs it may be difficult to examine it.|$|R

5000|$|Logarithmic (often {{referred}} to as log) scales {{can be a very}} valid means of representing data, however if used without clearly being labelled as so, or displayed to a reader who is unfamiliar with the concept of log scales, a graph using a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> can be misleading. Log scales put the data values in terms of a chosen number (the base of the log) to a particular power, the base is often e (2.71828...) or 10. For example, log scales may give a height of 1 [...] "unit" [...] for a value of 10 in the data and a height of 6 [...] "units" [...] for a value of 1000000 (1x10^6) in the data. Log scales have common usage in some fields, including the VEI (volcanic explosivity index) scale or the richter scale for earthquakes, magnitudes of stars in astronomy and the pH of acidic and alkaline solutions are also based on a form of <b>log</b> <b>scale,</b> but can have the effect of making data less immediately apparent to the eye. Often the reason for the use of log scales is that the graph's author wishes to display vastly effects of vastly different scales on the same axis, without log scales comparing quantities such as 10^3 versus 10^9 becomes impractical from a visual perspective. A graph with a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> which was not clearly labelled as such, or a graph with a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> presented to a viewer who did not have knowledge of logarithmic scales, would generally result in a representation which made data values look of similar size whilst in fact being of widely differing magnitudes. Misuse of a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> can make vastly different values (such as 10 and 10 thousand) appear close together (on a <b>log</b> <b>scale</b> they would be only [...] "1" [...] and [...] "4" [...] ), or it can make small values appear to be negative due {{to the way in which}} logarithmic scales represent numbers smaller than the chosen value used as their base.|$|E
