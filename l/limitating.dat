There is now a large literature that demonstrates the utility of satellite remote sensing and spatial modelling within geographical information systems (GIS) and firmly establishes these technologies as the key tools for spatial epidemiology. This review outlines the strength of satellite remotely sensed data for spatial mapping of landscape characteristics in relation to disease reservoirs, host distributions and human disease.

40|$|Investigation of {{the concept}} "nature", {{according}} to the author, is predominantly of socio-political significance. As a matter of fact, until the 19 th century, socio-political life {{was based on the}} so-called "natural law" (ius naturale) which was an effective means of <b>limitating</b> and suppressing the despotism of the rulers, tyranny, dictatorship, totalitarian regimes, as well as in demasking unjust laws. In the past century, the historical consciousness (and everything pertaining to it) repressed the "ius naturale", attempting to relativize it. The consequences of this can be felt by us, living in the 20 th century, the epoch of merciless, apocalyptic, totalitarian regimes. Therefore, a tendency towards the revalorization of the nastural law in social and political life is recently being felt. The concept "natural", according to he author, has a theological meaning as well. Not only in christology and the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, but also in the understanding of the entire relationship between God and man, nature and grace.

40|$|Relativistic bending in the {{vicinity}} of a massive body is characterized only by the post-Newtonian parameter γ within the standard parameterized post-Newtonian formalism, which is unity in General Relativity. Aiming at estimating this parameter, we use very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to measure the gravitational deflection of radio waves emitted by distant compact radio sources, by Solar System bodies. We analyze geodetic VLBI observations recorded since 1979. We compare estimates of γ and errors obtained using various analysis schemes including global estimations over several time spans and with various Sun elongation cut-off angles, and analysis of radio source coordinate time series. We arrive at the conclusion that the relativistic parameter γ cannot be estimated at better than 2 × 10 ^- 4. The main factor of limitation is the uncertainty in the determination of (global or session-wise) radio source coordinates. A sum of various instrumental and modeling errors and analysis strategy defects, that cannot be decorrelated and corrected yet, is at the origin of the <b>limitating</b> noise.

40|$|Abstract. Highly-modular parsers can be {{constructed}} as directly-executable top-down backtracking processors, and combined to form more-complex parsers using operators defined in the host programming language. In functional and logic programming, this approach is implemented using parser combinators and definite clause grammars respectively. Standard implementations are inefficient for ambiguous languages and cannot accommodate left-recursive grammars, and hence are <b>limitated</b> in their use. Memoization is known to improve efficiency, {{and there has been}} some success in accommodating left-recursion. However, there is no integrated solution to both problems that is entirely satisfactory. This paper extends the approach to accommodate ambiguity and direct and indirect left recursion in polynomial time, and to create compact polynomialsized representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees which can be generated for highly-ambiguous languages. ...|$|R

The results from the present research work, performed on nine varieties of pepper which differ in spicy, showed that the androgenetic potential of the pepper in anthers culture is dependent on the capsaicin contained in the fruits of the pepper.

The number of MRSA-isolates in 1990 compared to 1989 is approximately the same. Phage-type pattern and antibiogram were determined for 168 MRSA-isolates from 42 hospitals. Based on epidemiological knowledge the MRSA-strains of 1989 and 1990 can be subdivided into three groups. Six MRSA phage-types were found {{in more than one}} hospital (epidemic types) and five MRSA phage-types were found more than once in one hospital (endemic types).
