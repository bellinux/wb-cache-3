Since all of the major futures exchanges list both LIBOR (or the respective national equivalent) based contracts and government bond contracts, a fund such as The FI-RV Investor can take advantage of opportunities in this area of relative value as well. Frequently, as the credit concerns of either banks, governments or corporations comes into question, the spreads between these issuers moves quite substantially.|$|E

The particular question investigated is whether the announcements and operations of the TAF are associated with downward shifts of the LIBOR; such an association would provide one indication of the efficacy of the TAF in mitigating liquidity problems in the interbank funding market. The empirical results suggest that the TAF has helped to ease strains in this market. Federal Reserve System; Interbank market; Financial markets; Bank liquidity...|$|E
40|$|At {{the center}} of the {{financial}} market crisis of 2007 - 2008 was a highly unusual jump in spreads between the overnight inter-bank lending <b>rate</b> and term <b>London</b> <b>inter-bank</b> <b>offer</b> <b>rates</b> (Libor). Because many private loans are linked to Libor rates, the sharp increase in these spreads raised the cost of borrowing and interfered with monetary policy. The widening spreads became a major focus of the Federal Reserve, which took several actions [...] including the introduction of a new term auction facility (TAF) [...] - to reduce them. This paper documents these developments and, using a no-arbitrage model of the term structure, tests various explanations, including increased risk and greater liquidity demands, while controlling for expectations of future interest rates. We show that increased counterparty risk between banks contributed to the rise in spreads and find no empirical evidence that the TAF has reduced spreads. The results have implications for monetary policy and financial economics. ...|$|R
40|$|We derive general {{properties}} of two-factor {{models of the}} term structure of interest rates and, in particular, the process for futures prices and rates. Then, as a special case, we derive a no-arbitrage model of the term structure in which any two futures rates act as factors. In this model, the term structure shifts and tilts as the factor rates vary. The cross-sectional {{properties of}} the model derive from the solution of a two-dimensional, autoregressive process for the short-term rate, which exhibits both mean-reversion and a lagged persistence parameter. We show that the correlation of the futures rates is restricted by the no-arbitrage conditions of the model. In addition, we investigate the determinants of the volatilities and the correlations of the futures rates of various maturities. These are shown {{to be related to}} the volatility of the short rate, the volatility of the second factor, the degree of meanreversion and the persistence of the second factor shock. We also discuss the extension of our model to three or more factors. We obtain specific resuits for futures rates in the case where the logarithm of the short-term rate [e. g., the <b>London</b> <b>Inter-Bank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR) ] follows a two-dimensional process. We calibrate the model using data from Eurocurrency interest rate futures contracts...|$|R
40|$|Brent {{crude oil}} futures {{contracts}} are traded {{on both the}} Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) and the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE). Through a mutual offset system between SIMEX and IPE, Brent crude oil futures contracts can be traded up to nineteen hours each day. The inter-relationship between the two futures contracts, the spot price of Brent crude oil and the riskfree interest rate, suggest the existence of cointegration among SIMEX Brent crude oil futures prices, lagged IPE Brent crude oil futures prices, Brent spot prices and the <b>London</b> <b>Inter-bank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>Rate</b> (LIBOR). Error-correction representations of two standard futures pricing models, namely the unbiased expectations and cost-of-carry hypotheses, are formulated for SIMEX Brent crude oil futures contracts. These formulations are augmented by including the lagged IPE futures price in the mispricing error. The resulting Augmented Unbiased Expectations Hypothesis (AUEH) and the Augmented Cost-of-Carry (ACOC) models are estimated and tested against each other, and also against the standard unbiased expectations and cost-of-carry models, using nested and non-nested testing procedures. Forecasting comparisons are also made among the various models and the autoregressive integrated moving average models fitted to SIMEX Brent crude oil futures prices. Results from the nonnested tests and the forecasting criteria show clearly that the augmented models outperform their standard (non-augmented) counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{analysis}} of different sukuk structures from a financial perspective. This examination includes murabahah and ijara-based sukuk, the former offering a fixed return, and the latter, the most popular form of sukuk, a variable return. The potential for other more novel sukuk structures based on musharakah partnership contracts is also examined, and sukuk pricing issues are explored using alternative benchmarks to <b>London</b> <b>Inter-bank</b> <b>Offer</b> <b>Rate.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Flow charts are used to illustrate the financial transfers and the rights and obligations of sukuk investors as well as the beneficiaries of the funding. Historical data have used to assess whether the payments flows are more stable in the case of sovereign sukuk where the returns are based on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than interest. Findings – The paper finds that special purpose vehicles are a prerequisite for the successful issuance and management of sukuk. The use of GDP-based pricing benchmarks would have resulted in greater payments stability for sovereign debt in Saudi Arabia, but not for Malaysia. Research limitations/implications – The data analysis was restricted to two countries, but this could be extended. Alternative pricing benchmarks were suggested for sovereign sukuk but not for corporate sukuk. Practical implications – Ministries of Finance and Central Banks of Muslim countries should review their debt financing policies and explore the potential of sovereign sukuk. Originality/value – Little has been written previously on the use of musharakah partnership contracts for sukuk, and pricing issues have not hitherto been systematically investigated.

However; we find few studies on risk management and a lack of empirical investigation on factors affecting the risk of Malaysian banks. These gaps have motivated us to identify the main factors associated with the risk of locally listed deposit-taking institutions. The findings show that three factors were signlficantly associated with unsystematic risk, while the systematic risk and the total risk of these deposit-taking institutions were significantly affected by four main factors. These four factors namely non-performing loans, cost of funds, loan to deposit ratio and <b>inter-bank</b> <b>offered</b> <b>rate</b> however; were found to have a more profound effect on the total risk than on the systematic risk or the unsystematic risk of Malaysian deposit-taking institutions...|$|R

40|$|Learning market participants’ policy rate {{expectations}} is a {{major issue}} for central banks. The underlying {{reason for this is}} that the interest rate expectations of market participants may themselves contain information on market participants’ perceptions of the economic prospects, which decision-makers might want to incorporate into their own assessment of the outlook. Market participants’ expectations, however, cannot be observed directly and are difficult to quantify. Of the two most common approaches, we will discuss in detail the one where we infer market expectations from the prices of the financial instruments which are closely related to expectations. In properly functioning, liquid markets we can infer market participants’ expectations of future interest rates from the prices of and returns on government securities and inter-bank transactions. Before the onset of the financial crisis, BUBOR (Budapest <b>Inter-bank</b> <b>Offered</b> <b>Rate)</b> reflected market participants’ expectations of the interest rate relatively reliably, but since the deepening of the crisis, this has changed for a number of reasons, which we will also seek to pinpoint. The fact that BUBOR no longer reflects real market expectations, i. e. it distorts them, is all the more important as this measure serves as a benchmark rate for other financial products, among other things, for corporate loans. The loss of the information content of BUBOR means that the yield curve derived from returns on inter-bank market instruments provides a more accurate measure of market expectations if we exclude data on BUBOR fixings. Nevertheless, forward rate agreements (FRAs) settled on BUBOR remain suitable for the quantification of market participants’ expectations. However, in interpreting these, it is important that, in addition to credit and liquidity risk premia, the bias caused by BUBOR should also be taken into consideration. interest rates, expectations, financial markets, monetary policy. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1984, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that an increasing number of banks were trading actively in a variety of relatively new market instruments, notably interest rate swaps, foreign currency options and forward rate agreements. While recognizing that such instruments brought more business and greater depth to the <b>London</b> <b>Inter-bank</b> market, bankers worried that future growth could be inhibited unless a measure of uniformity was introduced. In October 1984, the British Bankers' Association (BBA)—working with other parties, such as the Bank of England—established various working parties, which eventually culminated in the production of the BBA standard for interest rate swaps, or [...] "BBAIRS" [...] terms. Part of this standard included the fixing of BBA interest-settlement rates, the predecessor of BBA Libor. From 2 September 1985, the BBAIRS terms became standard market practice. BBA Libor fixings did not commence officially before 1 January 1986. Before that date, however, some rates were fixed for a trial period commencing in December 1984.|$|R
