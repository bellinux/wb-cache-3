25|$|In 1905, Standing Bear {{decided to}} leave the reservation. He was no longer willing to endure {{existence}} under the control of an overseer. Luther sold his <b>land</b> <b>allotment</b> and bought a house in Sioux City, Iowa, where he worked as a clerk in a wholesale firm. After a brief job doing rodeo performances with Miller Brothers 101 Ranch in Oklahoma (former old Indian Territory), he moved to California to seek full-time employment in the motion picture industry. While Standing Bear left the confinement of the reservation, he continued his responsibilities as an Oglala Lakota chief, fighting to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty through public education.|$|E
25|$|Zitkála-Šá was {{an active}} member of the Society of American Indians, which {{published}} the American Indian Magazine. From 1918 to 1919 she served as editor for the magazine, as well as contributing numerous articles. These were her most explicitly political writings, covering topics such as the contribution of Native Americans to World War I, <b>land</b> <b>allotment,</b> and corruption within the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agency within the Department of Interior that oversaw American Indians. Many of her political writings have since been criticized for favoring assimilation. She called for recognition of Native American culture and traditions, while also advocating US citizenship rights to bring Native Americans into mainstream America. She believed this was how they could gain political power.|$|E
25|$|Outside of his {{overseeing}} of the mihnah, Ibn Abi Du'ad {{spent his}} time at court developing a reputation for moderation and compassion, interceding on several occasions to save individuals who had become subject to al-Mu'tasim's wrath from punishment and securing favors from the caliph for various patrons. At the same time, he came {{to play an important}} role in the fiscal affairs of the caliphate, his staff overseeing, for example, the division of spoils during the Amorium campaign in 838; he is also said to have pushed through an irrigation canal project in Khurasan, and following a large fire in Baghdad he was able to convince the caliph to entrust him with distributing five million dirhams for the relief of the citizens there. Ibn Abi Du'ad additionally took part in the move to the new capital of Samarra in 836, where he received a <b>land</b> <b>allotment</b> in the central city, and in 840 he presided over the heresy trial of the disgraced general al-Afshin.|$|E

50|$|Red Lake leaders {{warned the}} United States about {{reprisals}} if their Reservation were violated. The {{members of the}} White Earth and Mille Lacs reservations both voted overwhelmingly to accept <b>land</b> <b>allotments</b> and allow the surplus land sold to the whites, with the tribes to receive the lump sums of money from the sales. The Leech Lake Reservation members also voted for <b>land</b> <b>allotments.</b> The October 5, 1898 Battle of Sugar Point was over land.|$|R

500|$|During the Great Depression, the Wallers {{fell behind}} on the {{mortgage}} for their farm, and after Willis died in 1938, the bank foreclosed. Annie and Odell then agreed to become sharecroppers for a white landlord, Oscar Davis. The relationship quickly soured. Davis was also a sharecropper, and when his own landlord reduced Davis' <b>land</b> <b>allotment,</b> Davis reduced that of the Wallers to only [...] The Wallers accused Davis of failing to pay Annie an agreed $7.50 {{for taking care of}} Davis' ill wife for three weeks; when the Wallers subsequently refused to work in Davis' fields, Davis evicted them. Following the eviction, someone on the Davis farm mutilated one of the Wallers' dogs. After Annie's cousin Robert helped her harvest the farm's wheat, Davis took the whole crop rather than give the Wallers their share. In April 1940, Odell had taken a job constructing electrical lines in Maryland, but he returned on the weekend of July 1314 to investigate the worsening situation.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian New Deal, Collier's chief realization, was {{landmark}} legislation authorizing tribal self-rule {{under federal}} supervision, {{putting an end}} to <b>land</b> <b>allotment</b> and generally promoting measures to enhance tribes and encouraging education. Collier was highly regarded by most Indian tribes, although he was vilified by others. [...] He antagonized Navajo people, and some Iroquois, including the Seneca people. For the Oklahoma Indian population, largely exempted from the Indian New Deal, the influence of Collier's efforts was felt in their process of acquiring autonomy in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1900, writer Hamlin Garland met Cornelius in El Reno, Oklahoma, and {{described}} him as [...] "a giant in size and a man of ability who located here after a most astonishing career in New York." [...] Garland credits Cornelius for suggesting that Indians be given standard surnames to protect their property rights during the <b>land</b> <b>allotment</b> process. At the time, there was no system of surnames for Indians through which legal titles could be traced, allotment of lands to individuals were, {{and the source of}} unnecessary confusion and litigation. After appealing to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Garland was hired to manage the project for several years.|$|E
50|$|The Chippewa also mistrusted {{administration}} of the vote; the whites, who {{had an interest in}} allotment, counted the total number of votes, rather than the Chippewa. Red Lake leaders warned the United States about reprisals if their Reservation was violated. The White Earth and Mille Lacs reservations overwhelmingly voted to accept <b>land</b> <b>allotments</b> and allow surplus land sold to the whites. Supposedly the Leech Lake Reservation's men also overwhelmingly voted to accept <b>land</b> <b>allotments</b> and have the Reservation surplus land sold to the whites. The events of October 1898 indicate otherwise.|$|R
50|$|The Dawes Commission {{was created}} by Congress in 1893 as a further attempt to {{convince}} the members of tribes to receive their tribal <b>land</b> <b>allotments.</b> Members of the Five Civilized Tribes (Indian Territory) were exempt from the original Dawes Act legislation, and the Dawes Commission was to convince the Five Civilized Tribes to agree to cede tribal title of Indian lands. The commission established procedures for members of Indian tribes in Oklahoma Territory to register with their respective Indian Nations (only one nation if there was mixed ancestry), and procedures to receive <b>land</b> <b>allotments.</b>|$|R
40|$|A Professional Project {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, at the University of New Mexico. This research examines the Rights-of-Way process for Navajo <b>allotment</b> <b>lands.</b> Today, there are 566 Indian nations. Each nation has its own history relating to Indian <b>allotment</b> <b>lands.</b> In the 1880 s, <b>allotment</b> <b>lands</b> were created through federal Indian policy as tribal trust lands were allotted to individual Indian tribal members of various nations. This research examines a real example of the Rights-of-Way process for Navajo <b>allotment</b> <b>lands</b> {{as it relates to}} the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project. <b>Land</b> access for <b>allotment</b> <b>lands</b> is questionable. Water access for the Water Supply Project secured and supplied through the recent Navajo Nation San Juan River Water Rights Settlement. The water pipeline alignment will cross six types of land. Each type has its own Rights-of-Way process. This research will examine the current Rights-of-Way process for Navajo <b>allotment</b> <b>lands.</b> This research applied three methods to identify the current Rights-of-Way process for <b>allotment</b> <b>lands.</b> A document review for existing federal and tribal policy for <b>allotment</b> <b>lands</b> finds that the Navajo Nation does not have authority over <b>allotment</b> <b>lands.</b> The U. S. Bureau of Indian Affairs has authority over <b>allotment</b> <b>lands.</b> For Navajo <b>allotment</b> <b>lands,</b> the Rights-of-Way process is initiated by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation for the Water Supply Project. The Bureau of Indian Affairs will approve or disapprove Rights-of-Way easement. The results show the current Rights-of-Way process for Navajo <b>allotment</b> <b>land</b> is quite general. After examination, the research identifies areas of improvement for the current the Rights-of-Way process. This research provides recommendations to improve and update the current Rights-of-Way process starting with a better framework to understand the Rights-of-Way process for Navajo <b>allotment</b> <b>lands...</b>|$|R
2500|$|With {{the goal}} of assimilating the Native Americans, the Curtis Act of 1898, {{sponsored}} by a Native American who believed {{that was the way}} for his people to do better, ended tribal governments. In addition, it proposed the end of communal, tribal lands. Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in severalty (individually). The US declared land in excess of the registered households needs to be [...] "surplus" [...] to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers. In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the Dawes Commission to manage the <b>land</b> <b>allotment</b> policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.|$|E

For about the same number of years I had tried to live a peaceful and happy life; tried to adapt myself and make re-adjustments to fit the white man’s mode of existence. [...] But I was unsuccessful. I developed into a chronic disturber. [...] I was a bad Indian, and the agent and I never got along. I remained a hostile, even a savage, if you please. And I still am. I am incurable.” [...] While Standing Bear left the confinement of the reservation, he continued his serious responsibilities and as an Oglala Lakota chief, fighting to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty through public education.|$|E

At three dollars the crowd fought for the tickers. The man happened to find a valise full of them handy, and he passed them out like putting hot biscuits on a plate. The backs were hard to unscrew, but the crowd put its ear to the case, and they ticked mollifying and agreeable. Three of these watches were genuine tickers; the rest were only kickers. Hey? Why, empty cases with one of them horny black bugs that fly around electric lights in 'em. Them bugs kick off minutes and seconds industrious and beautiful.
