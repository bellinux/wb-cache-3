500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

In contrast with most popular multiplayer shooters such as Doom and Descent, XvT required far more data tracking and flow.

The deep space setting of XvT, along with the conventions established in earlier titles, required that information about all craft be available to all players all of the time.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the back}} of the {{commercial}} success of 'Over the Top' Empey arrived in Hollywood in 1918 to star in a dramatic filmed production using the book's title [...] (the melodramatic screenplay used bore only a passing resemblance to the book's content [...] ) by the 'Vitagraph Company of America'. He was also briefly a popular songwriter during the war years, writing the lyrics for hits such as Your Lips Are No Man's Land But Mine, Liberty Statue is <b>Looking</b> <b>Right</b> <b>at</b> You, and Our Country's In It Now, We've Got To Win It Now. After this, he set his ambition upon a career in cinema production and established his own production company - [...] "The Guy Empey Pictures Corporation" [...] - with the money he had made from 'Over the Top's' royalties. Throughout the 1920s he worked in the rapidly developing film production industry that Hollywood was becoming, initially acting in his own productions, and subsequently working behind the camera producing, writing and directing silent films such as: The Undercurrent (1919), Millionaire for a Day (1921), The Midnight Flier (1925), Into No Man's Land (1928), and Troopers Three (1930). However, the revolution in film-making that took place with the introduction of sound film {{at the end of the}} 1920s, combined with the increasing competition in Hollywood as its gathering financial power attracted professional talent able to work in the new audio-visual medium from across the world, spelled the end of Empey's career there, apparently unable to adapt to the new changed environment along with many others from the Classical Hollywood Silent Era.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Streep found major {{commercial}} success when she starred in Phyllida Lloyd's Mamma Mia!, a film {{adaptation of the}} 1999 West End musical of the same name, based on the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA. Shot in England and Greece along with Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, and Colin Firth, she played the free-spirited single mother Donna in the film, a former backing singer and owner of a small hotel on an idyllic Greek island, whose daughter (Seyfried), a bride-to-be who never met her father, invites three likely paternal candidates to her wedding. Streep who had seen the Broadway version of the musical several years earlier, felt [...] "absolutely flabbergasted" [...] about Lloyd's offer to star in screen musical, though her cast was not green lit until a successful rehearsal with original ABBA member Benny Andersson months before filming. Altogether, she recorded fourteen songs for the film, including [...] "Money, Money, Money", [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] and [...] "The Winner Takes It All," [...] some of which re-entered several music charts around the globe. An instant box office success, Mamma Mia! became Streep's highest-grossing film to date, with box office receipts of US$602.6 million, also ranking it first among the highest-grossing musical films of all-time. Nominated for another Golden Globe, Streep's performance was generally well received by critics, with Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe writing, [...] "indeed, Streep brings {{out the best in}} everybody. She's connecting with an audience in a way she never has - grinning, eye-rolling, bouncing, and at one point, <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> us ... It's an electric image that's been 30 years in coming. The greatest actor in American movies has finally become a movie star." ...|$|E
5000|$|The trial {{took place}} on Monday, October 4, 1880 in London, Ontario, with James Carrol being charged {{with the murder of}} Johannah Donnelly. The crown {{prosecutor}} was Aemilius Irving assisted by James MaGee; the defense consisted of Hugh MacMahon, William Meredith and John Blake. [...] The witness list for the prosecution was as follows; William Donnelly, Nora Donnelly, Martian Hogan, William Blackwell Hock M.D., William Williams, Enoch Murphy, James Feeley, Robert Rojs, John O’Conner, Patrick Whelan, Anne Whelan, Mary Hastings O’Conner, Michael O’Conner, Charles Pope, William Hodge, Henry Phair, and Martin Hogan Jr. The two key witnesses were Johnny O’Conner and William Donnelly. Johnny O’Conner's testimony ran, in part: “Tom told him to read the warrant: Carroll said there was lots of time for that: then in a few minutes a whole crowd jumped in and commenced hammering them with sticks and spade; then Tom ran out into the front room and outside: I saw him run out and Bridget ran upstairs and I ran after her and she shut the door and I ran back again in the room and got under the bed behind the clothes basket: then they started hammering Tom outside: the bed was about two feet and an inch high from the floor and no curtains about the bottom of the bed: they carried Tom in the house again: I heard them throw him down on the floor, and heard the handcuffs rattling or whatever they had on his hand: then someone said, “Hit that fellow with a spade and break his skull open.” Then the fellow hit his three or four whacks with the spade: when Tom was outside I heard him say, “Oh! Oh! Oh!” I did not see them hit Tom with the spade, but heard them; then some of them told the fellow that had the light to bring it here to where Tom was: he brought the light and they were doing something to Tom: they were standing round him: I saw the standing round him: then I saw Thomas Ryder and John Purtell standing near the room door, the bedroom door; then some of them asked where was the girl; another one answered, “Look upstairs”; then they went upstairs and saw some of them too, but did not know any of them; then they came down: I heard nothing going on upstairs, and poured coal oil on the bed and set it on fire; it was the bed I was under; I heard someone say that oil would burn off the blanket, and wouldn’t burn at all; then they all run out when they set fire to it; then I got out from under the bed and put on my pants and tried to quench the fire with my coat; I hit the fire with my coat: I then heard Tom breathing, then I went out to the front room and saw Tom dead on the floor; then I ran out to the kitchen and tramped on the old women; there was a light from the fire in my bed, also from Tom’s bed: the door of Tom’s room was open, and the door from the front room into the kitchen: the old women was lying between the door from the front room into the kitchen and the kitchen door going outside; I then ran out and went over to Whalen’s, Pat Whalen, and rapped at Whalen’s door.” [...] He then went to explain what James Carroll, Thomas Ryder and John Purtell were wearing that night. “Purtell had dark clothes, Ryder a peaked cap, and Carroll had grey pants; their faces were not blackened: I saw one man with his face blackened, and a long coat on, a middling sized man; Carroll saw me in bed, he looked right at me, and I saw him <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> me for a while; he did not speak to me: I did not see anyone strike the Donnellys, I only heard them.” ...|$|E

Pursing his lips while thinking, his eyes <b>looking</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> you to tell you he was ready for whatever you might want to ask, he responded to questions with directness, wit and a touch of irony.
