5000|$|Within the United States, {{the primary}} {{standard}} for vertical filing cabinets is the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA) Standard X5.3. [...] BIFMA used {{to maintain a}} separate Standard X5.2 for <b>lateral</b> <b>filing</b> cabinets, but that standard has been withdrawn. The standards provide requirements for cabinet stability, durability, and strength, among others. The General Services Administration (GSA) also maintains standards for vertical and lateral steel filing cabinets, A-A-3186and A-A-3187respectively. The GSA standards define two grades of filing cabinets, medium- and heavy-duty. They reference the BIFMA standard for the medium-duty cabinets, and provide additional performance requirements for the heavy-duty cabinets. The GSA is also responsible for maintaining the standards for filing cabinets and security containers for storing classified materials; more information on that subject {{may be found in}} the article on classified information in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lateral</b> <b>files</b> are {{typically}} 20 inches deep and manufactured in 30-, 36-, and 42-inch widths and 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer versions. The 30 in, two-drawer version is popular for use inside cubicle workstations, {{as it is}} engineered to fit under or alongside the cubicle work surfaces. Logic {{for the use of}} 3-, 4-, and 5-drawer files {{is similar to that of}} vertical files. Unlike vertical <b>files,</b> most <b>lateral</b> <b>files</b> allow for side-to-side or front-to-back filing.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} for <b>lateral</b> <b>files</b> is that access and view of all files can {{be easier than}} with a vertical file because the drawers do not extend as far.|$|R
50|$|Some users prefer {{side-to-side}} filing, as {{they can}} search index tabs from a seated position. All-width <b>lateral</b> <b>files</b> can accommodate this configuration, though {{the capacity of the}} file is somewhat diminished.|$|R
5000|$|In most instances, the top [...] "5th drawer" [...] of a five-drawer <b>lateral</b> <b>file</b> is a flipper {{door with}} {{pull-out}} shelf, {{as most people}} {{would not be able}} to access the top of a drawer at this height.|$|R
50|$|A {{filing cabinet}} (or {{sometimes}} file cabinet in American English) {{is a piece}} of office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple context, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. The two most common forms of filing cabinets are vertical <b>files</b> and <b>lateral</b> <b>files.</b> A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. A <b>lateral</b> <b>file</b> cabinet has drawers that extend from the long side (various lengths) of the cabinet. These are also called side filers in Great Britain. There are also shelf files, which go on shelves. In the United States, file cabinets are usually built to accommodate 8.5 × 11 paper, and in other countries, filing cabinets are often designed to hold other sizes of paper, such as A4 paper.|$|R
50|$|Typical designs used {{contemporary}} but conventional furniture {{which was}} {{available at the}} time. Standard desks and chairs were used, with <b>lateral</b> <b>file</b> cabinets, curved screens, and large potted plants used as visual barriers and space definers. Floor plans frequently used irregular geometry and organic circulation patterns to enhance the egalitarian nature of the plan. Many designs used slightly lower than normal occupancy density to mitigate the acoustical problems inherent in open designs.|$|R
5000|$|A shelf file is {{a cabinet}} {{designed}} to accommodate folders with tabs on the side {{rather than on the}} top. The cabinet has no drawers, only shelves. Some shelf files come with doors that recede into the cabinet. These cabinets are typically 12" [...] or 18" [...] deep, for letter or legal size folders respectively. Like <b>lateral</b> <b>files,</b> they are made in 30", 36", 42" [...] and 45" [...] widths but are usually only installed in 5-high and 6-high applications.|$|R
40|$|International audienceA partial {{dentition}} {{found in}} the Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) of Normandy (France) associates lateral teeth of Asteracanthus magnus with anterior teeth usually attributed to A. tenuis or A. longidens. According to this French specimen, teeth usually identified as anterior of A. magnus represent in fact teeth of the first <b>lateral</b> <b>file.</b> This discovery explains the apparent rarity of isolated anterior teeth of A. magnus in the fossil record, for which no associated dentition were hitherto known. It also demonstrates that the general arrangement of the dentition of A. magnus {{is closer to the}} one of A. smithwoodwardi than to the one of A. medius...|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{acquired}} in 1966 by C.I.T. Financial, a holding group, and was merged with B.K. Johl, a Canadian manufacturer of office furniture. All-Steel-Equip pioneered the <b>lateral</b> <b>file</b> in 1967, with production beginning in 1969, {{and it became}} a huge commercial success. The company restructured after the merger with B.K. Johl, and in 1973 renamed its furniture divisions All-Steel Inc. and All-Steel Canada Ltd., both of which reduced to Allsteel in 1986. Allsteel was bought and sold by a number of different holding companies and finally merged into HNI Corporation in 1998. Its archives are held by Past Present Future (a furniture restoration store) in Minneapolis.|$|R

40|$|Modular systems {{furniture}} is tangible personal property, {{whether or not}} affixed to realty. A contract to sell and install modular systems {{furniture is}} a contract {{for the sale of}} tangible personal property and is not a construction contract. Persons who contract to sell and install modular systems furniture are retailers of the items which they sell and install, and tax applies to the entire contract price less those charges excludable from gross receipts or sales price pursuant to sections 6011 and 6012 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Retailers who claim a deduction for such charges should maintain complete and detailed records to support the amounts claimed. Such records should include, but not be limited to, a separate accounting of charges for installation labor, such as labor to affix, bolt, fasten, or hardwire panels to realty and labor to fasten or affix fully constructed components to fully constructed panel systems or other components. Charges for fabrication labor, such as labor to attach, assemble, connect, construct, or fabricate panel systems or components, labor to attach or connect one panel to another to form workstations or cubicles, and labor to construct or fabricate the individual panels, components, or accessories are subject to tax. For contracts to sell and install modular systems entered into on or after October 1, 1999, ten percent (10 %) of the total contract price, excluding charges attributable to freestanding desks, credenzas, <b>lateral</b> <b>files,</b> bookcases, worktables, returns, convergents, corner units, storage towers, chairs, footrests, and other property not attached to panels, other components, or realty, but including all other charges, will be presumed to be a charge for labor to install or apply the property sold. Retailers may claim the ten percent (10 %) labor deduction in lieu of separately accounting for the actual installation charges incurred...|$|R
40|$|Since {{instrumentation}} of the apical foramen {{has been}} suggested for cleaning and disinfection of the cemental canal, selection of the file size and position of the apical foramen have challenging steps. This study analyzed the influence of apical foramen <b>lateral</b> opening and <b>file</b> size can exert on cemental canal instrumentation. Thirty-four human maxillary central incisors were divided in two groups: Group 1 (n= 17), without flaring, and Group 2 (n= 17), with flaring with LA Axxess burs. K-files of increasing diameters were progressively inserted into the canal until binding at the apical foramen was achieved and tips were visible and bonded with ethyl cyanoacrylate adhesive. Roots/files set were cross-sectioned 5 mm from the apex. Apices were examined by scanning electron microscopy at × 140 and digital images were captured. Data were analyzed statistically by Student&# 8217;s t test and Fisher&# 8217;s exact test at 5 % significance level. SEM micrographs showed that 19 (56 %) apical foramina emerged laterally to the root apex, whereas 15 (44 %) coincided with it. Significantly more difficulty to reach the apical foramen was noted in Group 2. Results suggest that the larger the foraminal file size, the more difficult the apical foramen instrumentation may be in laterally emerged cemental canals...|$|R
40|$|Intentional dental modification, in {{the form}} of {{ablation}} and filing, is reported for the first time from Cambodia in two late prehistoric sites (Phum Snay and Phum Sophy, c. 2500 to 1500 [*]bp). Bioarchaeological research is relatively new for this region, and this study significantly adds to our reconstruction of past behaviours in mainland Southeast Asia. The skeletal samples combine both excavated material and large looted collections {{in the form}} of ossuaries. People from Phum Sophy and Phum Snay had similar rates of anterior maxillary dental ablation, 60 and 47 %, respectively, and 21. 4 and 7. 7 %, respectively, in the mandible. Patterns of ablation most commonly involve the removal of the maxillary <b>lateral</b> incisors. Intentional <b>filing</b> was less common than ablation but affected Phum Snay and Phum Sophy individuals to a similar level (4 – 7 %). Filing was also restricted to the anterior dentition, and a range of patterns were evident, many involving filing of the mesial and distal aspects of the crown of the upper and lower incisors and canines to give a pointed appearance. Patterns of ablation or filing were not strongly associated with a particular sex or age group. However, a limited number of ablation and filing patterns were exclusive to each site. The significance of this practice in relation to rites of passage, status, community and family relationships, and trauma is discussed. It is also shown that the modifications show distinct differences in prevalence and pattern, particularly that of filing, to nearby temporal neighbours in southern Cambodia and northeast Thailand, suggesting a unique cultural behaviour for this region...|$|R
