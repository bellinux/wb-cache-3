40|$|The FLEGT (Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade) {{initiative}} {{is among the}} recent attempts to combat deforestation and promote sustainable forest development. However, ideas about what the objectives of FLEGT are and how legality should be interpreted differ among different actors involved. Some advocate a narrow interpretation of legality that promotes a strong {{role of the state}} and focuses on law enforcement, while others advocate a broader interpretation that includes issues of participation and sustainability. These different interpretations mirror current developments in international forest governance which are influenced on the one hand by broader trends in governance, which focus on voluntary instruments, participation and marketization, while on the other hand, the nation state remains a very powerful actor. This article uses a discourse analytical approach to analyze the discursive structure of FLEGT, particularly the European Union FLEGT Action Plan and the Indonesian <b>legality</b> <b>standards.</b> Our findings show that FLEGT is first and foremost shaped by state oriented discourses that promote regulatory instruments and a narrow interpretation of legality. Sustainability and participatory considerations are present, both in the EU and in the Indonesian context, but they come in a secondary position. The article concludes by positioning these findings in the international forest governance debate and by discussing the implications of the discursive structure of FLEGT for sustainability, participatory governance and the state...|$|E
40|$|The Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade {{programme}} (FLEGT) of the European Union aims at stimulating both legal {{timber production}} and good forest governance. The EU establishes Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with individual tropical timber exporting countries; these VPAs {{should be developed}} through a stakeholder-inclusive governance process and define national standards for timber legality. The national policy level serves as an interface between the EU policy and the local realities of forest exploitation. This article assesses whether new assemblages of timber <b>legality</b> <b>standards</b> were developed at this interface. It presents the opinions of people actively engaged in the FLEGT/VPA process in Ghana (n = 38) and Indonesia (n = 40) about which principles regarding timber legality, law enforcement and social safeguards were considered during the VPA negotiations in each country. Almost {{half of the respondents}} (44 %) were positive about the integrative focus of VPA discussions focusing on both forestry and livelihood issues, 40 % considered it had mostly a limited focus or traditional timber sector focus, and 16 % indicated a high degree of attention to social responsibility issues. There were differences in the characteristics of respondents and their opinions between Ghana and Indonesia; these reflect differences in organisation of the FLEGT/VPA process. The findings demonstrate how depending on country-specific policy processes principles from an international forest policy are adapted at national level; this may involve new assemblages of the original policy principle...|$|E
40|$|Illegal logging {{has been}} at the centre of policy debates about the current state and future {{prospects}} of Indonesia’s forestry sector. One of the prevailing views is that clandestine cross-border timber trade is responsible for illegal logging in the country. This paper shows the core of the illegal logging problem lies not in timber smuggling in remote locations but in licensed forestry operations that engage in gross over-harvesting and violate shipping regulations. These actions, in turn, are necessitated by a vast supply-demand disparity in Indonesia’s wood-working sector. The current timber trade system in Indonesia that stresses administrative and document compliance is insuffi cient because it is easy to manipulate and its enforcement is lax. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more stringent timber <b>legality</b> <b>standard</b> that would be simpler to enforce and easier to evaluate. However, this will only work if a serious effort is made to restructure (downsize) forest industries and develop sustainable industrial timber plantations. Cross-border timber trade in Indonesia: critical or overstated problem? Forest governance lessons fro...|$|R

Recently electronic voting has been adopted by several governments for use in these wide scale elections. As with most large scale electronic systems, electronic voting may vulnerable to malicious software and tampering.

40|$|To meet {{international}} market demand for legally sourced timber, Indonesia has introduced the <b>Legality</b> Verification <b>Standard</b> (SVLK). SVLK adoption {{is having an}} immediate impact on the timber industry in Indonesia {{and it is not}} yet clear how this will affect smaller producers – much depends on enforcement and implementation. This book examines the SVLK from the industy 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, providing analyisis of the readiness to implement at both central government and local government levels. It considers all the requirements to meet the certification, and the expectations of the national and {{international market}}. The research considers sample provinces, presenting the private sector 2 ̆ 7 s perspective on SVLK implementation in East Java, Central Java, West Java, Banten, DIY Yogyakarta, and South Sulawesi...|$|R
40|$|We adopt a welfare-based, in {{contrast}} to a decision-theoretic, approach to the choice of legal standards for refusals to license IPs. We show that if the presumption of legality is not strong, the Commission’s prior in the Microsoft interoperability information case, Decision Theoretic considerations are not helpful for deciding which type of standard is superior. Indeed, a “low false-acquittals ” rule, such as the Microsoft rule, may well be equally effective to a “low false-convictions ” rule, such as the “exceptional circumstances ” rule, in reducing the costs of decision errors – contrary to what is suggested by Ahlborn, Evans and Padilla (2005). In this sense we agree with the analysis on this issue of Ritter (2005). However, we show that the latter rule may still be welfare superior to the former rule due to its welfare improving deterrence effects. We also show that, when the presumption of legality is strong, both these rules are likely to be welfare inferior to Per Se <b>Legality</b> (the <b>standard</b> chosen in Xerox), even though the “exceptional circumstances ” test may be superior in decision error terms...|$|R

This thesis explores specific and topical problem of international expropriation law, with the main focus on the vast network of international investment agreements (IIAs) supplemented by the general rules of international law. The thesis traces the context and evolution of the protection of foreign investments {{in response to the}} transformation of state liability in international law. Particular consideration is given to the relationship between the International Minimum Standard (IMS) and the Calvo Doctrine as two clashing descriptive statements of customary international law governing the treatment of foreigners and their assets. With the onset of the BIT generation, the economical accountability of states is examined in compliance with the scope and conditions defined in clauses and provisions of the contemporary investment treaties. In addition, the thesis focuses on the substantive protection accorded to foreign investors and investments. The aim is to identify the limits of the state's right to expropriate foreign investments by imposing <b>legality</b> requirements <b>standard.</b> The requirements for lawful expropriation are addressed with a thorough examination of jurisprudence of international courts and [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} legal {{nature of a}} Personal Identification Number (PIN) and the legal {{position}} when it is voluntarily or involuntarily disclosed to a third party. It also comments on the <b>legality</b> of the <b>standard</b> form contracts that contain terms relating {{to the use of}} PINs. It will be argued that the common law should now regard a PIN as a signature, in light of the development of modern information technology. Further, a PIN holder owes a duty of care to his bank when using his PIN. However, if the PIN disclosure is obtained from the holder by unconscionable or deceptive means, the holder should not be held liable for any consequential losses. Moreover, a bank has a duty to warn its customers of any criminal act which may be practised upon a PIN holder...|$|R
