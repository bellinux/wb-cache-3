2500|$|Townsend ordered B Company under Major Noel Ford {{to prepare}} for a patrol to locate the firing points which were {{believed}} to be in the area between the abandoned villages of Long Tan, Long Phuoc, and the Nui Dat 2 feature. Having done so, it was to establish the direction of the Viet Cong withdrawal. Meanwhile, a platoon from C Company mounted in APCs was to investigate a suspected base plate location south-west of Nui Dat. A Company would continue its patrol in the vicinity of Nui Dat 2, while 7 Platoon, C Company—already conducting a night ambush on the southern edge of the TAOR—would search a number of sites as it returned that morning. No SAS patrols were deployed {{as a result of the}} attack, although several had previously been planned to the north between Binh Ba and the Courtenay plantation in preparation for upcoming operations, and went ahead unchanged. Another patrol was inserted near the Song Rai, [...] north-east of Nui Dat, on the morning of 17 August. Noting signs of significant activity soon afterwards, it located several tracks moving west made approximately six hours earlier, possibly by a Viet Cong <b>logistic</b> <b>unit.</b> Yet the patrol was compromised and due to radio interference and faulty equipment the information was unable to be reported until extraction two days later. Nonetheless, Australian intelligence continued to assess a ground attack against Nui Dat as unlikely. But with the bombardment a likely indicator of further offensive action against 1 ATF, Jackson felt he would be unable to adequately respond with only one battalion. 5 RAR was therefore ordered to return to Nui Dat, and was expected back by 18 August.|$|E
