50|$|In geometry, {{the major}} axis of an ellipse is its longest diameter: a line segment {{that runs through}} the center and both foci, with ends at the widest points of the perimeter. The semi-major axis is one half of the major axis, and thus runs from the centre, through a focus, and to the perimeter. Essentially, it is the radius of an orbit at the orbit's two most distant points. For the special case of a circle, the semi-major axis is the radius.

5000|$|Late in {{the winter}} season, the mid-morning sun melts {{the top of the}} frozen snow base {{creating}} a soft layer, 1-2 cm deep, that is ideal for <b>long</b> <b>radius</b> carved turns. This is spring snow. By mid-afternoon, the melted layer is likely to have become too deep for enjoyable skiing, i.e. too heavy or too slushy. On some slopes, the melt layer poses an extreme avalanche risk in the afternoon and ski area management will close such runs by late morning. Ideal spring snow conditions are found when the melt layer does not exceed 2cm and the diurnal cycle of melting and refreezing creates a smooth frozen surface, that does not become overly wet in the sun. An exaggerated melting and refreezing cycle results in 'corn' (see above).|$|E

50|$|The cuboctahedron is {{the unique}} convex {{polyhedron}} {{in which the}} <b>long</b> <b>radius</b> (center to vertex) {{is the same as}} the edge length; thus its long diameter (vertex to opposite vertex) is 2 edge lengths. This special symmetry is a property of only a few polytopes: the two-dimensional hexagon, the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the four-dimensional 24-cell and 8-cell (tesseract). Only these polytopes can be constructed, with their radii, from equilateral triangles which meet at the center of the polytope, each contributing two radii and an edge. More generally, all the interior elements which meet at the center of these polytopes have special symmetry, as in the dissection of the cuboctahedron into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra. Each polytope also occurs as cells of a characteristic space-filling tessellation: the tiling of regular hexagons, the rectified cubic honeycomb (of alternating cuboctahedra and octahedra), the 24-cell honeycomb and the tesseractic honeycomb. Each tessellation has a dual tessellation; the cell centers in a tessellation are cell vertices in its dual tessellation. The densest regular sphere-packing in two, three and four dimensions uses the cell centers of one of these tessellations as sphere centers.|$|E

5000|$|Sydney Allard soon saw the {{potential}} of the economically more vibrant - but sports car starved - US market and developed a special competition model to tap it, the J2. The new roadster was a potent combination of a lightweight, hand-formed aluminium body fitted with independent front suspension and de Dion type rear axle, inboard rear brakes, and designed for a Ford [...] "flathead" [...] V8. Allard's distinctive front suspension was produced by splitting the I-beam front axle in two to make swing axles, with <b>long</b> <b>radius</b> rods and a new feature, for their day, of inclined telescopic shock absorbers. Importing American engines just to ship them back across the Atlantic proved problematic, so US-bound Allards were soon shipped engineless and fitted out in the States variously with newer overhead valve engines by Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, and Oldsmobile. In that form, the J2 proved a highly competitive international race car for 1950, most frequently powered by 331-cubic-inch Cadillac engines. Domestic versions for England came equipped with Ford or Mercury flatheads. Russian-American engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov, formerly of Ardun (named after founders Yura and Zora ARkus-DUNtov) where he designed and developed aluminium overhead valve hemi heads for flathead Fords, worked for Allard from 1950 to 1952 and raced for the factory Allard team at Le Mans in 1952 and 1953.|$|E

Further, measurement of solid distribution in the three bends has given some insight into the causes for the reduced wear in these modified bends.

With these, the Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) market {{has started to}} be active and there are numerous efforts to apply this to real life in all sectors of society. To date, the M 2 M market has applied the existing marker-based AR technology in entertainment, business and other industries. With the existing marker-based AR technology, a designated object can only be loaded on the screen from one marker and a marker has {{to be added to}} load on the screen the same object again. This situation creates a problem where the relevant marker should be extracted and printed in screen so that loading of the multiple objects is enabled. However, since the distance between markers will not be measured in the process of detecting and copying markers, the markers can be overlapped and thus the objects would not be augmented.
