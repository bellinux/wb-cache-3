50|$|Dredge pipe pieces {{may have}} {{different}} thicknesses, shapes and lengths, they are also provided with <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> for easy handling. They supposed to have smooth surface for low frictions. In most cases the flanges are cast together with the pipe to provide a stronger connection between flange and pipe.|$|E
50|$|Another {{factor in}} the design of a precast shape {{has to do with the}} {{schedule}} and sequencing of the actual field installation. The shape design must take into account job accessibility, what other lining components are already in place when the shapes are installed, and how the shape can be handled physically on the job site. Weight and lifting limitations must be considered and planned for, as well as the type of access available into the furnace or vessel. If necessary, <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> or other fixtures can sometimes be incorporated into the shape design.|$|E

40|$|Defects are {{produced}} when <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> being welded on ship sections during the building process. The {{large amount of}} heat produced in the welding work causes “heat affected zone” in the base metal on sections and destroys painted coatings on the plates; and residual stress decreases the mechanical performance of the steel plates. To eliminate the defects, it is hypothesized that “structural adhesive bonding” can replace welding for installing <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> to some extent. An investigation of the application of adhesively bonded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> in ship building is processed to give methods for the application and check the feasibility of replacing welded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> with adhesively bonded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs.</b> In the research, a serious of rules for adhesively bonded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> is adapted from rules for welded lifting lugs; “structural adhesives”, “adhesive bonding joints”, “the shape and geometry of lifting lugs” and “positions for installation” are investigated. Then adhesively bonded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> are designed based on the adapted rules; and then improved after the evaluation by FEM simulation. The results show that adhesively bonded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> can replace welding <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> with high probability when the capacity is less than 20 ton; when the capacity is between 20 ton and 30 ton, limitations such as “not enough bonding area” and “no positions for installation” constrain the replacement. When the capacity of a lifting lug is above 30 ton, adhesively bonded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> cannot replace welded <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs.</b> Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringMarine and Transport Technolog...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeavy wall {{reactors}} {{and large}} diameter pressure vessels usually face unique challenges in their erection onto their foundations at the jobsite. Today, 800 ton to 1, 500 ton reactors and or large diameter vessels with diameters ranging up to 15 meters {{are common in}} the refining industry. These pressure vessels are usually fabricated in shops dispersed globally and require unique heavy duty equipment for their safe handling, transportation and erection. The challenge {{is to find a}} safe, efficient and cost effective solution based upon the limitations of the equipment, job site and the lift equipment available for erection. Equipment for the handling heavy reactors and large diameter pressure equipment is usually scarce, expensive. Planning well in advance of the lift date is required. Careful consideration must be given to the choice and design of attachment to the pressure vessels used for the lift to ensure that the vessel and lifting components are not overstressed during the lifting process. This paper identifies the types of evaluations that must be performed to determine the stresses in the vessel and lifting attachments during the lifting. The paper also discusses different types of <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> that may be attached to each end of the vessel either by bolting or welding and discusses {{the pros and cons of}} each. The paper also provides an example of a finite element analysis (FEA) of a top nozzle, a FEA of a pair of lifting trunions and a FEA of welded on <b>lifting</b> <b>lugs</b> for buried pipe. The intent of the paper is to outline the effects on the vessel due to different types of lifting configurations in combination with the lifting parameters.

40|$|Abstract — Boom or tower type crane consist hook {{facility}} to lift or move material {{and it is}} more flexibility than simple beam type horizontally established gantry crane. In this crane, beam is lifted by means of wire rope, link or chain to the distal end of boom and material can be lift by means of wire rope with lifting point. Beam is directly suspended using wire ropes and its move by boom crane. Wire ropes are fitted with lugs which are directly welded to the horizontally suspended beam for lifting material or objects. Generally, Beams are used to move slender materials specifically say slender plate as one industry application. Slender plate type objects are flexible in nature so, it may be sag or bend {{during a time of}} lifting because of only two <b>lifting</b> <b>lug</b> are generally used. Moreover, fixed size of beam is used for a single application of lifting plate so; this is a limitation of a beam, and in major cases it requires changing as application changes. On the other hand, due to two lifting point on a beam plate may be band or sag so it’s require to solve two problem simultaneously. Also it is not solution to simply weld more number of <b>lifting</b> points say <b>lug</b> to beam, but need of specific and optimum design is requirement which is detail describe in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{that the}} Allies were {{preparing}} a major push toward Tunis, the Germans launched a spoiling {{attack on the}} night of 20/21 April 1943. Four points were attacked simultaneously, including a pass {{on the north side of}} a hill called Djebel Djaffa. Two Tigers and several other tanks advanced through this pass before dawn, and were gradually driven back during the day. Tiger 131 was hit by three shots from 6-pounders from British Churchill tanks of A Squadron, 4 Troop of the 48th Royal Tank Regiment. A solid shot hit the Tiger's gun barrel and ricocheted into its turret ring, jamming its traverse, wounding the driver and front gunner and destroying the radio. A second shot hit the turret <b>lifting</b> <b>lug,</b> disabling the gun's elevation device. A third shot hit the loader's hatch, deflecting fragments into the turret. The German crew bailed out, taking their wounded with them and leaving the knocked-out but still driveable and largely intact tank behind. Their identity and fate are unknown. The tank was secured by the British as they captured Djebel Djaffa hill. Tiger 131 was the first intact Tiger tank captured by British forces.|$|R

40|$|Labour and labour {{conditions}} in Dutch forestry and in management of Dutch wildlife areas are studied by literature review, evaluation of workplaces and questionnaires. In the Netherlands, very few statistics are available about labour and absence through illness in forestry {{and management of}} wildlife areas. In this study, mainly based on data concerning the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, {{it is estimated that}} about 3867 people work in these sectors, and this number will probably rise. Absence trough illness was about 7 %; this was more than the Dutch overall average of 5. 5 %. The most important reasons for sick leave were pain in the back or in the limbs, due to frequent <b>lifting,</b> <b>lugging,</b> pushing, pulling and exposure to vibrations. Cutting or pruning trees using chain saws and mowing using two-wheeled tractors or portable mowers were activities causing the most physical load. Forestry is known to be a dangerous sector compared to others, but national statistics concerning accidents are not available. Hygiene is amore important topic than in most other sectors, since often no sanitary facilities are available. Lyme-disease, caused by ticks, is a typical occupational disease in this sector. Also the mental load of workers in this sector is substantial. Forest workers have to observe many rules and laws, and have to deal with involvement of the general public and public opinion. Also workers in wildlife areas have to be good at handling the general public and public opinion, but additionally have to deal with changing objectives of the organization they work for. Beside of the traditional nature protecting tasks, they now also have to educate the visitors. Staatsbosbeheer and other organizations watching over forest or wildlife areas have taken initiatives to improve {{labour conditions}} for their employees. Initiatives, which are usable for others, are entered in the recommendations of this study...|$|R
40|$|The Disposable Solid Waste Cask (DSWC) is a {{shielded}} cask {{capable of}} transporting, storing, and disposing of six non-fuel core components or approximately 27 {{cubic feet of}} radioactive solid waste. Five existing DSWCs are candidates for use in storing and disposing of non-fuel core components and radioactive solid waste from the Interim Examination and Maintenance Cell, ultimately shipping them to the 200 West Area disposal site for burial. A series of inspections, studies, analyses, and modifications were performed to ensure that these casks {{can be used to}} safely ship solid waste. These inspections, studies, analyses, and modifications are summarized and attached in this report. Visual inspection of the casks interiors provided information with respect to condition of the casks inner liners. Because water was allowed to enter the casks for varying lengths of time, condition of the cask liner pipe to bottom plate weld was of concern. Based on the visual inspection and a corrosion study, it was concluded that four of the five casks can be used from a corrosion standpoint. Only DSWC S/N- 004 would need additional inspection and analysis to determine its usefulness. The five remaining DSWCs underwent some modification to prepare them for use. The existing cask lifting inserts were found to be corroded and deemed unusable. New lifting anchor bolts were installed to replace the existing anchors. Alternate <b>lift</b> <b>lugs</b> were fabricated for use with the new lifting anchor bolts. The cask tiedown frame was modified to facilitate adjustment of the cask tiedowns. As a result of the above mentioned inspections, studies, analysis, and modifications, four of the five existing casks can be used to store and transport waste from the Interim Examination and Maintenance Cell to the disposal site for burial. The fifth cask, DSWC S/N- 004, would require further inspections before it could be used...|$|R

6000|$|Then {{they set}} to work, {{and for a}} week they toiled {{to put up a}} mast of steel, and hang from it a {{gridiron}} of copper wires two hundred feet by twelve. The theme of all that time was work, work continually, straining and toilsome work, and all the rest was grim hardship and evil chances, save for a certain wild splendour in the sunset and sunrise in the torrents and drifting weather, in the wilderness about them. They built and tended a ring of perpetual fires, gangs roamed for brushwood and met with wolves, and the wounded men and their beds were brought out from the airship cabins, and put in shelters about the fires. There old Von Winterfeld raved and became quiet and presently died, and three of the other wounded sickened for want of good food, while their fellows mended. These things happened, as it were, in the wings; the central facts before Bert's consciousness were always firstly the perpetual toil, the holding and <b>lifting,</b> and <b>lugging</b> at heavy and clumsy masses, the tedious filing and winding of wires, and secondly, the Prince, urgent and threatening whenever a man relaxed. He would stand over them, and point over their heads, southward into the empty sky. [...] "The world there," [...] he said in German, [...] "is waiting for us! Fifty Centuries come to their Consummation." [...] Bert did not understand the words, but he read the gesture. Several times the Prince grew angry; once with a man who was working slowly, once with a man who stole a comrade's ration. The first he scolded and set to a more tedious task; the second he struck in the face and ill-used. He did no work himself. There was a clear space near the fires in which he would walk up and down, sometimes for two hours together, with arms folded, muttering to himself of Patience and his destiny. At times these mutterings broke out into rhetoric, into shouts and gestures that would arrest the workers; they would stare at him until they perceived that his blue eyes glared and his waving hand addressed itself always to the southward hills. On Sunday the work ceased for half an hour, and the Prince preached on faith and God's friendship for David, and afterwards they all sang: [...] "Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott." ...|$|R
