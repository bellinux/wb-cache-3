25|$|Midwater {{longliners}} – {{are usually}} medium-sized vessels which operate worldwide, purpose built to catch large pelagics. The <b>line</b> <b>hauler</b> is usually forward starboard, where {{the fish are}} hauled through a gate in the rail. The lines are set from the stern where a baiting table and chute are located. These boats need adequate speed to reach distant fishing grounds, enough endurance for continued fishing, adequate freezing storage, suitable mechanisms for shooting and hauling longlines quickly, and proper storage for fishing gears and accessories.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chief of}} a burlak gang was called Vodoliv (Водолив), {{next in line}} was the Dyadya (Дядя, captain), {{followed}} by the Shishka (Шишка, first in the <b>line</b> of <b>haulers),</b> while the last in line was called Kosny (Косный, last in the <b>line</b> of <b>haulers).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Longliners – use {{one or more}} long heavy fishing {{lines with}} a series of {{hundreds}} or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called [...] "snoods". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines [...] handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic <b>line</b> <b>haulers.</b> The <b>lines</b> are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, <b>line</b> <b>haulers,</b> hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum.|$|R
50|$|Two 'B' Class 4-6-0 engines {{with outside}} {{cylinder}} and inside motion and built by Messrs. Kitson & Co. Ltd. of Leeds were also acquired in 1904. 'Rhodes' and 'Milner', Nos. 5 and 6 respectively, were main <b>line</b> <b>haulers</b> and worked the mail trains between the Zambezi and Blantyre. 'Milner' also worked on Trans-Zambezia Railway from July 1923 to 1934 {{and from the}} Dona Ana Bridge to Tete, until 1944. 'Rhodes' continued in main line service until 1951. One 'C Class locomotive worked on the railways for a short period.|$|R
50|$|Crab Orchard & Egyptian 1136 and 1161 {{are both}} still in {{operation}} as short <b>line</b> freight <b>haulers</b> on the CO&E lines based in Herrin, Illinois and Marion, Illinois respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} type was the 'D' Class, type 4-8-0 with bogie tender, some {{purchased}} in 1917 from Messrs. R. & W. Hawthorn, Leslie and Peckett of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, others in 1930 from North British Locomotive Works, Glasgow. The Shire Highlands and Central Africa railways operated Nos. 8 to 12 and 19 to 24 and the Trans-Zambezia line took over Nos. 13, to 15, {{all of which}} were main <b>line</b> <b>haulers</b> and pulled trains on all sections of the system. Typical loads were: Border to Sankulani {{at the base of the}} escarpment 450 tons, and uphill from Sankulani to Limbe 180 tons.|$|R
40|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are under-exploited {{resources}} of Indian EEZ. Exploitation of oceanic tuna and billfishes are possible only by longlining and purse seining. Existing {{deep sea fishing}} vessels in India are mostly trawlers equipped for bottom trawling for shrimps and fishes. Most of them are stem trawlers and few are double riggers. Hence the deck layout is not suitable for either longlining or purse seining. Both longlining and purse seining for oceanic tuna and billfishes are specialized techniques which require special onboard facilities, deck layout and deck machineries like <b>line</b> <b>haulers,</b> chute, shooting and hauling accessories for longlining and special powerful purse winch, power block etc. for tuna piu'se seining...|$|R
5000|$|In 2014 {{the only}} {{electrified}} lines hauling freight by electricity were three short <b>line</b> coal <b>haulers</b> (mine to power plant) and one switching railroad in Iowa. [...] The total electrified route length {{of these four}} railroads is 122 mi. While some freight trains run on parts of the electrified Northeast Corridor and on part of the adjacent Keystone Corridor, these freight trains use diesel locomotives for traction. The total electrified route length of these two corridors is 559 mi.|$|R
