25|$|Due to the LCD layer {{that generates}} the desired high {{resolution}} images at flashing video speeds using very low power electronics {{in combination with}} these excellent LED based backlight technologies, LCD technology has become the domination display technology for products such as televisions, desktop monitors, notebooks, tablets, smartphones and mobile phones. Although competing OLED technology is pushed to the market, such OLED displays does not feature the HDR capabilities like LCDs in combination with 2D LED backlight technologies have, reason why the annual market of such LCD-based products is still growing faster (in volume) than OLED-based products while the efficiency of LCDs (and products like portable computers, mobile phones and televisions) may even be further improved by preventing the light to be absorbed in the colour filters of the LCD. Although until today such reflective colour filter solutions are not yet implemented by the LCD industry and did not made it further than laboratory prototypes, such reflective colour filter solutions still <b>likely</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> implemented by the LCD industry to increase the performance gap with OLED technologies).|$|E
25|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} are strong competitors with many ant species. They {{have managed to}} displace many native ants {{which has led to}} a number of ecological consequences. However, studies show that these ants are not always superior competitors that suppress native ants. Habitat disturbance prior to their arrival, and recruitment limitations, are more plausible reasons why native ants are suppressed. Between Tapinoma melanocephalum and Pheidole fervida, the red imported fire ant is stronger than both species but shows different levels of aggression. For example, they are less hostile towards T. melanocephalum in contrast to P. fervida. Mortality rates in T. melanocephalum and P. fervida when fighting with red imported fire ants are high, being 31.8% and 49.9% respectively. The mortality rate for red imported fire ant workers, however, is only 0.2% to 12%. The imported crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva) exhibits greater dominance than the red imported fire ant and has been known to displace them in habitats where they encounter each other in. Larger colonies of pavement ants (Tetramorium caespitum) can destroy red imported fire ant colonies, leading entomologists to conclude that this conflict between the two species may help impede the spread of the red imported fire ant. Individuals infected by SINV-1 can be killed faster than healthy individuals by Monomorium chinense. This means that ants infected with SINV-1 are weaker than their healthy counterparts and more than <b>likely</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> eliminated by M. chinense. However, major workers, whether they are infected or not, are rarely killed.|$|E

500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis <b>likely</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. Everything seems to be on the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E

This dissertation used a conceptual design to explore the effect of independent variables on Latina/o students' success. The following hypotheses were tested at the. 05 confidence level: (1) The higher the level of Latina/o students' college preparation, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (2) the higher the Latina/o students' level of motivation, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (3) the higher the level of Latina/o students' involvement in ethnic organizations, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (4) the higher the moral support given to Latina/o students, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (5) the higher the Latina/o students' perceptions of university support, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (6) the higher the Latina/o students' level of financial support, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (7) the higher the Latina/o students' level of acculturation into American society, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (8) the higher the Latina/o students' level of integration into American society, the more <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (9) the more hours Latina/o students work, the less <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (10) the more family, relationship, or health crises during school year, the less <b>likely</b> they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> to succeed; (11) the higher the academic classification, the more likely Latina/o students are to succeed; and (12) a Latina student versus a Latino student is more likely to succeed. The dependent variable was the success of Latina/o students as indicated by their cumulative grade point averages (CUMGPA). The relationship between the independent and the dependent variables was investigated through a 65 -item survey. The population for this study included all undergraduate Latina/o students enrolled at Northern Illinois University from the 1993 fall semester through the 1998 spring semester. The 1321 surveys were distributed during fall semester 1998. Participants returned 412 usable surveys, which represents a 31 % return rate. Data generated from the instrument were collected and analyzed using statistical procedures: Bivariate and Multiple regressions. As a result of this study, a model for Latina/o student retention has been developed. Through step-wise regression, a final set of ten independent variables was selected that had a statistically significant relationship with CUMGPA: Academic Classification [...] -Hypothesis 11 (positive), Scholarship [...] -Hypothesis 6 (positive), Subjective Evaluation of Preparation [...] -Hypothesis 1 (positive), Missed Classes [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Semester GPA Below 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Subjective Evaluation of Readiness for College [...] -Hypothesis 2 (positive), Go to Community College if Semester GPA fell below a 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Would Repeat Courses if Semester GPA fell below a 2. 0 [...] -Hypothesis 1 (negative), Ethnic Mix of Friends [...] -Hypothesis 8 (positive as mix move toward All Anglo), and Ethnic Identity/Support [...] -Hypothesis 3 (negative). The final Best-Fit model explained 47 % of the variance in Latina/o CUMGPA. Previous academic preparation was the strongest predictor of success. However, students more immersed in Latina/o organizations did not achieve the same level of success of those students less involved. Also, these factors must be investigated for their impact on retention, not just success. Students with a lower CUMGPA can remain enrolled and graduate, as long as they maintain the minimum GPA.
