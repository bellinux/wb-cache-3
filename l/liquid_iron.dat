5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a <b>liquid</b> <b>iron</b> sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} was to confirm {{the hypothesis that the}} conventional flow curves of <b>liquid</b> cast <b>iron</b> put on sferoidization determined from the rod fluidity test are comparable to flow curves of liquids in environmental temperature. Moreover has been identified, that conventional flow curves for this <b>liquid</b> cast <b>iron</b> are similar to generalized non- Newtonian liquids curves. For rods with the diameters 3 - 8 mm there are three various curves: 1 – the flow curve of <b>liquid</b> cast <b>iron</b> put on spheroidization overheated about 80 K resemble a shape adequately to a curve of densified liquid with shearing. This phenomenon can be caused by high overcooled and creation of crystallization nuclei; 2 – metal alloys overheated about 180 K resemble a shape adequately to Newtonian liquid; 3 – metal alloys overheated about 210 K resemble a shape of curve adequately to dispersed liquid with shearing. This phenomenon probably depends on influence of gas which creates on boundary of metal-sand mould...|$|R
5|$|The {{technology}} {{required for}} blast furnaces may have either been transferred from China, or {{may have been}} an indigenous innovation. Al-Qazvini in the 13th century and other travellers subsequently noted an iron industry in the Alburz Mountains to the south of the Caspian Sea. This is close to the silk route, so that the use of technology derived from China is conceivable. Much later descriptions record blast furnaces about three metres high. As the Varangian Rus' people from Scandinavia traded with the Caspian (using their Volga trade route, {{it is possible that the}} technology reached Sweden by this means. High quality ores, water power for bellows for blast and wood for charcoal are readily obtainable in Sweden. However, since blast furnace has also been invented independently in Africa by the Haya people, it is more likely the process has been invented in Scandinavia independently. The step from bloomery to true blast furnace is not big. Simply just building a bigger furnace and using bigger bellows to increase the volume of the blast and hence the amount of oxygen leads inevitably into higher temperatures, bloom melting into <b>liquid</b> <b>iron</b> and, cast iron flowing from the smelters. Already the Vikings are known to have used double bellows, which greatly increases the volumetric flow of the blast.|$|E
25|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{were used}} to produce <b>liquid</b> <b>iron.</b> The blast furnace was operated at higher temperatures and at a greater reducing condition than the bloomery furnace. A greater reducing environment was achieved by increasing the fuel to ore ratio. More carbon reacted with the ore and produced a cast iron rather than solid iron. Also, the slag produced was less rich in iron.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the effect of {{impurities}} in the natural gas stream on the characteristic of foam behaviour in the blended piperazine and MDEA solution. Hydrocarbon <b>liquids,</b> <b>Iron</b> Sulphide, Sodium Chloride, Acetic Acid, Methanol and Polyethylene Glycol were used as the impurities. The results indicated that the type of impurities determined the foam formation of the amine solution. The concentration of piperazine-MDEA blends also enhanced to the increasing of the foam height of blended piperazine-MDEA. Iron sulfide, hydrocarbon and sodium chloride are the impurities which apparently contributed to the high foaming tendency of the solutions. At the same concentration of the impurities, iron sulfide appeared as the most influential contaminant to the foam formation, which promoted the highest foamability in any concentrations of the blend piperazine-MDE...|$|R

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, pig iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the <b>liquid</b> pig <b>iron</b> to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through <b>liquid</b> pig <b>iron</b> to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, other alloys of steel began to follow.
