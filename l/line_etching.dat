50|$|In grade 9, the Visual Arts Foundation Major IA course {{offers an}} {{overview}} of visual arts {{as a foundation for}} further study. Students will become familiar with the elements and principles of design and the expressive qualities of various materials through working with a range of materials, processes, techniques, and styles. They will learn and use methods of analysis and criticism and will study the characteristics of particular historical art periods and a selection of Canadian art and the art of other cultures. This course will introduce the theme of developing imaginative ideas and technical skills through drawing and painting. Both representational and abstract styles will be studied. Drawing concepts, the use of tone, line and volume through still life and portrait, will be developed in pencil, inks and chalks. Printmaking, through <b>line</b> <b>etching,</b> will reinforce design principles. Film animation will be studied as well. The second grade 9 course, Visual Arts Foundation Major IB, introduces topics such as sculpture, and ceramics. Students will learn about sculptural form and the design arts, through the process of making a plaque. Students will also learn about pattern and design; by designing their own wall papers and through research on Escher. Historical techniques will be explored through a thematic approach to Art History.|$|E
5000|$|Dzi stones {{made their}} first {{appearance}} between 2000 and 1000 BC, in ancient India: {{a few hundred}} thousand were supposedly brought back by Tibetan soldiers from Persia or ancient Tajikistan during a raid. The malicious effect of the “evil eye” was taken very seriously by these people. Dzi were considered to counteract the evil eye. The artisans who made the dzi created amulets with “eyes” on them as a “fight fire with fire” form of protection. Artisans used agate as the base stone, and then embellished the beads lines and shapes using ancient methods that remain mysterious. Treatments may have included darkening with plant sugars and heat, bleaching and white <b>line</b> <b>etching</b> with natron, and protecting certain areas with grease, clay, wax or a similar substance. A hole was drilled before the bead was decorated as drilling caused most breakage during the production process, and holes were also useful for stringing and dipping numerous beads as a step in coloration. The earliest holes were conical and done with solid drill bits drilling from both ends and, hopefully, meeting {{near the center of the}} bead. Very small drill tips of chipped flint were used without abrasives and numerous other materials, regardless of hardness, when used with abrasives. Neolithic era beads were also drilled with hollow, tubular abrasion driven bits of reed and, later, during the Chalcolithic, copper. These drilled a hole with a core of agate inside the tubular drill. Tubular bit holes were parallel walled rather than conical, but also done from both ends. Both methods required arduous work done with a bow drill, with time and effort being determined by hardness of abrasive, from ground sand (quartz) to corundum.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{experimental}} investigations of size effects in ferroelectric perovskite nanostructures. When {{the size of}} a ferroelectric material is reduced down to the nanoscale, its physical properties are expected to differ considerably from the bulk properties. In order to address size effects, we have developed a novel fabrication scheme which allows us to define sub- 50 nm ferroelectric PbTiO 3 nanomesas on prestructured SrRuO 3 templates, grown on SrTiO 3 substrates. The SrRuO 3 templates were prepared using a top-down lithography technique based on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Surface modifications through STM <b>line</b> <b>etching</b> of SrRuO 3 thin films have been carried out in order to establish the etching process in a controllable and reproducible fashion. From these <b>line</b> <b>etching</b> experiments, we observed that an applied bias voltage above a threshold value was necessary for successful <b>line</b> <b>etching.</b> Moreover, the <b>line</b> <b>etching</b> was found to depend on both bias voltage and scan speed for a fixed number of scans. The depth of the etched lines increases with increasing bias voltage and scan repetitions as well as with decreasing scan speed. The PbTiO 3 nanomesas were deposited on the nanostructured SrRuO 3 templates using an off-axis radio frequency magnetron sputtering technique. The as-grown PbTiO 3 nanomesas had a lateral size and a thickness down to ~ 30 nm and ~ 4 nm, respectively. Piezoresponse force microscopy measurements for the 4 nm thick PbTiO 3 nanomesas showed that the piezoelectric response increases strongly as the lateral size was reduced from ~ 120 nm down to 30 nm. For the same lateral size range, a reduction of the coercive voltage was also observed. The laterally size-dependent behavior is attributed to the reduction of in-plane strain, imposed on the mesa structure by the substrate, when shrinking the lateral dimensions of the nanomesas. In addition, {{it was found that the}} PbTiO 3 nanomesas had a polydomain structure, similar to that observed in the as-grown, surrounding, homogeneous PbTiO 3 thin film.

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} fabrication and optimization of micro-scale gratings formed by nanosecond laser etching. The mechanism of nanosecond laser processing and the geometric phase analysis (GPA) are discussed, and the factors influencing the fabrication process including laser energy, laser fluence, and ablation threshold of material, are experimentally studied. In order {{to eliminate the}} dependence of the processing parameters on the samples, depositing Al film on a sample before laser processing is proposed for the fabrication of high-quality gratings. The energy of the laser pulse is optimized for clear <b>line</b> <b>etching</b> on Al film considering the distance between adjacent lines of parallel gratings. The optimal energy of the laser pulse is 9. 8 μJ, and the optimum fluence is 9. 5 J/mm 2 with the waist radius of the laser beam 25. 7 μm. With the optimal parameters, experimental {{results indicate that the}} highest frequency of parallel gratings is about 30 lines/mm, with a line width of 29 μm, and the distance between two adjacent laser pulses being of 10 μm. By performing tensile tests, micro-scale gratings fabricated on specimens are experimentally verified. The verification tests prove that the proposed fabrication method for the micro-scale gratings in GPA measurements is reliable and applicable, and the micro-scale gratings can be fabricated in many areas of interest, such as the crack tip, for deformation measurements. Furthermore, the adhesion between the Al film and the tested sample is strong enough so that the pattern sticks well to the sample...|$|E

40|$|If {{we define}} the {{slowness}} curve by the normal vector {{of the material}} point of the crystal surface divided by the growth (or etching) rate of that point. Frank’s theorem states that, {{in the course of}} crystal’s growing or etching, each point of the boundary surface moves along its own straight line (or the characteristic line) which is parallel to the normal of the slowness curve. Since he didn’t find out the speed of the crystal surface point advancing along this characteristic, the etched crystal shape can not be determined quantitatively. In this paper we derive the equation in explicit form expressing the surface moving speed along the characteristics in terms of the microscopic parameters (in atomic size) and variables such as step density, step flux, and step height. Not all the microscopic variables are measurable, so we have to drive certain equations relating the microscopic variables to the macroscopic ones (such as the orientations of the crystal boundary lattice plane, slopes of the characteristic <b>lines,</b> <b>etching</b> rates, and so on) through the kinematics theory of particles. One measurement of the macroscopic variables at any particular instant is enough to determine not only the etching (or growth) rates of the crystal but also the etched crystal shape of any subsequent instant. 1...|$|R

50|$|Armor etching, using strong mineral acids, was not {{developed}} until the fifteenth century. Etchants mixed from salt, charcoal, and vinegar {{were applied to}} plate armor that had been painted with a maskant of linseed-oil paint. The etchant would bite into the unprotected areas, causing the painted areas to be raised into relief. Etching in this manner allowed armor to be decorated as if with precise engraving, but without the existence of raised burrs; it also prevented the necessity of the armor being softer than an engraving tool. Late in the seventeenth century, etching became used to produce the graduations on measuring instruments; the thinness of <b>lines</b> that <b>etching</b> could produce allowed {{for the production of}} more precise and accurate instruments than were possible before. Not long after, it became used to etch trajectory information plates for cannon and artillery operators; paper would rarely survive the rigors of combat, but an etched plate could be quite durable.

30|$|From Figure  2 b, it {{was noted}} that the {{fabrication}} depth increased with the increase of the scanning load or the contact pressure on the wearless scanned area. To analyse the effect of contact pressure on nanofabrication in a more detailed manner, a scratch consisting of a wearless area and groove was performed on the quartz surface under progressive loads from 0 to 40 μN by AFM. As shown in Figure  4, the cross-sectional profile of the scanned area (dashed line) revealed that the surface was wearless below Fn = 15 μN, where the corresponding contact pressure Pc was below 5.1 GPa. With the further increase of the normal load from 15 to 40 μN, the groove was formed on the surface and the wear depth increased from 0 to 1.7 nm (dashed <b>line).</b> After <b>etching</b> for 6 h at 293 K, the etched thickness increased from 0 to 2.9 nm on the wearless scanned area and then tended to stabilise on the groove. Therefore, the upper limit of the contact pressure for low-destructive scanning was 5.1 GPa, and the critical fabrication depth was 2.9 nm after single low-destructive scanning and post-etching. The fabrication of deeper nanostructure can be realised through repeated scanning or refabrication process (Figures  2 c and 5).|$|R
