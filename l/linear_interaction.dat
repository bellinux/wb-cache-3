40|$|Abstract [...] A {{theory for}} the {{quantitative}} analysis of multicomponent mineral systems {{by means of}} X-ray diffraction is presented. A <b>linear</b> <b>interaction</b> between mineral pairs is postulated. The theory is verified experimentally for bicomponent and tricomponent systems {{using a variety of}} sample preparation techniques including random powder mounts, suspensions sedimented onto glass slides, and pressed powder pellets. The minerals studied include quartz, fluorite, kaolinite, glauconite, illite, and montmorillonite. The determination of the <b>linear</b> <b>interaction</b> factors for mineral pairs is treated theoretically and experimentally. Emphasis is placed upon techniques that are applicable to naturally occurring mineral systems. Four approaches are presented for determining <b>linear</b> <b>interaction</b> coefficients for various types of such mineral systems. These approaches are applied to the experimental data and the results are compared. Results accurate within 2 per cent are commonly obtained. Experimental techniques are discussed and a qualitative and quantitative error analysis is presented.

This allows measurement-based non-classical state preparation, which {{has been applied to}} great success in various physical systems, and provides a route for quantum information processing with otherwise <b>linear</b> <b>interactions.</b> In cavity optomechanics much progress has been made using <b>linear</b> <b>interactions</b> and measurement, but observation of non-linear mechanical degrees-of-freedom remains outstanding. Here we report the observation of displacement-squared thermal motion of a micro-mechanical resonator by exploiting the intrinsic non-linearity of the radiation pressure interaction. Using this measurement we generate bimodal mechanical states of motion with separations and feature sizes well below 100 ~pm. Future improvements to this approach will allow the preparation of quantum superposition states, which can be used to experimentally explore collapse models of the wavefunction and the potential for mechanical-resonator-based quantum information and metrology applications.

40|$|Since Hansch's extra {{thermodynamic}} multi-parameter approach, originally coined as Linear Free Energy Relationship, great {{efforts in}} medicinal chemistry {{have been made}} to properly estimate the binding free energy. Despite the often small amount, its value is however very critical in determining a successful binding. As a result, its correct estimate may provide a guide for a prospective rational drug design. The calculation of the absolute binding free energies is however a very challenging task as it requires a rigorous treatment of a number of physical terms that are both very time demanding and to some extent not immediately interpretable.

40|$|Abstract—A {{universal}} {{criterion for}} effectiveness of linear transformation of waves with locally close characteristic exponents in smoothly inhomogeneous media is obtained. The same criterion is applicable for estimating {{the effectiveness of}} nonadiabatic transitions in slow atomic collisions.

In this case, the solution of the problem is reduced to elementary arithmetic calculations. © 2001 MAIK “Nauka/Interperiodica”. 1...|$|E
