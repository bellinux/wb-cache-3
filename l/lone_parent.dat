40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of welfare reform on the work and poverty of <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> living on welfare in depressed local labour markets. It uses a comparative approach to compare supply-side welfare-to-work programmes in Sheffield, UK and Buffalo, USA, and draws on current debates in geography, {{the social sciences and}} feminist scholarship to examine the connections between work, poveliy and welfare. It is based on a detailed evaluation of the circumstances of sixty <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> in Buffalo and Sheffield and the programmes in which they participated. I begin by critically assessing the literatures which examine the restructuring of work, poverty and welfare states in the post-Fordist period and discussing the importance of qualitative methods in researching welfare reform. The first of four empirical chapters examines how <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> on welfare in depressed local labour markets live in poverty, carry out a great deal of unpaid work, and face multiple barriers to moving into employment. I then examine the different approaches to employing <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> in Buffalo and Sheffield, and assess whether the programmes move <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> off benefit and into employment, and whether they subsequently return to welfare. The last of these four chapters shows that <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> are moving into are poorly paid, insecure and precarious employment, often leaving them in poveliy and struggling to balance their paid and unpaid work. The dissertation concludes by suggesting that an alternative approach to welfare reform is needed that addresses the demand-side of the labour market, invests in education and training, and tackles the multiple barriers to employment faced by <b>lone</b> <b>parents.</b> I argue that whilst welfare reform ignores the geography of employment, the growth of the working poor, and the value of unpaid work, it will not be effective in ending the economic and social exclusion of <b>lone</b> <b>parents.</b> ESR...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} {{movement}} of <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> from economic inactivity to employment via an active labour market programme (ALMP) affect their health? This study examined the psychosocial health impact of two ALMPs on <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> in the UK; and whether the change in their psychosocial environment as measured by a newly developed scale of the latent and manifest benefits of employment (LAMB) explain any health impacts. The data for the study were obtained from sixty-two <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> participating in the programmes who were followed longitudinally for five months. These were compared with a control group (n= 56) of economically inactive <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> {{at the beginning and}} end of the course. Structured questionnaires comprising scales of psychological health, self-esteem, mastery, positive and negative affect, self-efficacy, perceived psychosocial environment (LAMB) and social support were administered to the programme participants at three time intervals, i. e., at the beginning, during and end of the programme. In-depth qualitative interviews were also conducted at each time interval with both the programme participants and control group <b>lone</b> <b>parents.</b> The study indicates that entry into the ALMPs produces significant improvements in psychological health, as well as on all other measures as compared to the economically inactive group. Significant changes were also observed on the LAMB scale with enhanced access to latent functions of employment. The quantitative results show that access to social contact and support acts as the main mechanism through which a positive health change occurs. The lack of social contact, i. e., social isolation and financial strain are posited to be responsible for the ill health of the economically inactive <b>lone</b> <b>parents.</b> The research is discussed in relation to the development of Health Impact Assessment (HIA) methodologies, as well as the implications for current UK government emphasis on encouraging <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> into work via active labour market programmes.

40|$|The {{last thirty}} years saw {{dramatic}} increases in the employment rates of married/co-habiting mothers in the UK. Yet the employment rates of lone mothers were lower in the early 1990 s than in the late 1970 s, at just under 40 percent; and 25 percentage points {{lower than those of}} married mothers. In 1997 the incoming Labour government initiated a series of policy reforms aimed at reducing child poverty. A key element of their strategy was a move towards increasing employment rates among families with children. This paper evaluates how this package of policy reform impacted on <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> employment. We use propensity score matching to construct a benchmark sample and then apply difference-in-difference estimation techniques to assess what would have happened to <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> employment in the absence of policy reform. Our results show that, of the 11 -percentage point rise in the rate of employment of <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> between 1992 and 2002, 5 -percentage points can be attribute to policy reform. This increase in employment occurred in-spite of significant rises in the level of support for non-working <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> claiming Income Support. This is {{in sharp contrast to the}} experience of the USA, where welfare generosity did not increase and time limits and mandatory job search were employed alongside tax credits to get <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> back to work. In the UK, further substantive policy changes are currently being phased in and so it is probable that there will be further employment gains for <b>lone</b> <b>parents</b> over the next few years.
