25|$|Smith-Dorrien {{finally managed}} to locate Snow (GOC of the newly arrived 4th Division), at 5am (his brigades were {{assembling}} in their positions between 3.30am and 5.30am). He was not under Smith-Dorrien's orders but agreed to assist. Smith-Dorrien cancelled his orders to retreat and decided to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Smith-Dorrien still hoped for assistance from I Corps, which did not reach its intended position to the immediate east of Le Cateau. This news reached French at 5am – woken from his sleep once again, and insisting that the exhausted Murray not be woken, he telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to “make every endeavour” to fall back {{but that he had}} “a free hand as to the method”, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible. Wilson ended the conversation – by his own account – by saying “Good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Yours is the first cheerful voice I've heard in three days.” Smith-Dorrien's slightly different recollection was that Wilson had warned him that he risked another Sedan.|$|E

If {{there is more than one}} badnjak, the {{thickest}} of them is regarded as the main one, and is brought in first. Stepping across the threshold, right foot first, the man greets his gathered family with the words [...] "Good evening and happy Christmas Eve to you." [...] The woman of the house greets him back, saying [...] "May God give you well-being, and may you have good luck", or [...] "Good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and together with you for many years to come [...] ", or similar, before throwing grain from a sieve at the man and the badnjak he carries. In the clan of Kuči, the woman touches the [...] "beard" [...] of the main badnjak with a whole loaf of bread. In Montenegro, two women holding lighted candles stand one on either side of the house door as the badnjaks are carried in.|$|E
500|$|The {{background}} {{score was}} composed by Tony Gatlif and Delphine Mantoulet. The main {{theme of the}} songs is the Romani association with France. Despite the sad story, there are cheerful tracks too, with pieces for the waltz, tarantella and java. The film's music plays a prominent role from the opening credits to Catherine Ringer's track in the closing credits, [...] "Les Bohemians", a waltz piece written by Gatlif and Mantoulet, which is described as setting {{the tone for the}} film. [...] "Les Bohemians" [...] is the first French song ever featured in a Gatlif movie. Gatlif chose Ringer for the track, inspired by the [...] "blood in the mouth" [...] feel to her voice. The song translates as [...] "Good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all, if anyone worries that we’re gone, tell them we’ve been thrown from the light and the sky, we the lords of this vast universe." [...] The java dance piece composed by Delphine accompanies a scene where the characters secretly congregate in a barn for dancing, signifying the scenario then when public gatherings were prohibited. The track [...] "Un Poulailler A La Bastilles", sung by Gatlif's son Valentin Dahmani, plays on the existing racist stereotype of Romani as chicken thieves. The film also incorporates sound effects of horses, explosions and a watch mechanism. The soundtrack also has a tune of the [...] "Le Temps des cerises", the revolutionary song of the Paris Commune. The music for the song's version in the movie was composed by Gatlif, using clockwork sounds and banjo. Other soundtrack vocalists included Kalman Urszuj, Sandu Ciorba and Ikola.|$|E

2500|$|In the North Channel on her Glasgow to Liverpool route at 05:15 on 11 March 1915, HMS Bayano was {{attacked}} by the German submarine SM U-27 about ten miles west of Corsewall Lighthouse, Corsewall Point, Galloway, Scotland. The auxiliary cruiser sank in just five minutes and took the commander, Commander H. C. Carr, and 194 other crew members down with it. Most of the crew was asleep and only 26 men survived to be rescued by the British steamer Castlereagh. Bayano Lieutenant Commander Guy described Captain Carr on the bridge, standing without fear waving goodbye while shouting [...] "Good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> boys" [...] before the ship disappeared under the waves.|$|E

2500|$|Murrow {{achieved}} great {{celebrity status}} {{as a result of}} his war reports. They led to his second famous catchphrase. At the end of 1940, with every night's German bombing raid, Londoners who might not necessarily see each other the next morning often closed their conversations with [...] "good night, and good luck." [...] The future British monarch, Princess Elizabeth, said as much to the Western world in a live radio address at the end of the year, when she said [...] "good night, and good <b>luck</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> all". So, at the end of one 1940 broadcast, Murrow ended his segment with [...] "Good night, and good luck." [...] Speech teacher Anderson insisted he stick with it, and another Murrow catchphrase was born.|$|E

2500|$|French {{was awakened}} at 2am on 26 August with news that Haig's I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien (3.50am) to assist him.
