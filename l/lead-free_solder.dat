25|$|A glass solder is used, e.g., {{for joining}} {{together}} parts of cathode ray tubes and plasma display panels. Newer compositions lowered the usage temperature from 450 to 390°C {{by reducing the}} lead(II) oxide content down from 70%, increasing the zinc oxide content, adding titanium dioxide and bismuth(III) oxide and some other components. The high thermal expansion of such glass can be reduced by a suitable ceramic filler. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> glasses with soldering temperature of 450°C were also developed.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronics}} {{industry is}} heading towards <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering.</b> Cost, toxicity, energy consumption {{as well as}} resource depletion are issues of particular concern. These aspects were examined and compared to the conventional tin-lead technology. The results show that <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> will clearly reduce the material toxicity potential of PCBs. But it will also increase the energy consumption for the material production and, depending on the <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders,</b> for the soldering processes. Higher solder metal values, however, might boost PCB recycling and thus compensate the higher material energy consumption. It could be shown that, based on the available data and nowadays recycling processes, some <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> will decrease recycling cost, but the higher energy consumption for <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> can not be compensated.

40|$|Extensive {{work has}} been {{conducted}} by industry to develop <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> for electronics applications. The driving force behind this effort is pressure to ban or tax the use of lead-bearing solders. There has been further interest to reduce the use of hazardous chemical cleaners. <b>Lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> and low-residue, ``no clean`` assembly processing are being considered as solutions to these environmental issues. Most of the {{work has been}} directed toward commercial and military printed wiring board (PWB) technology, although similar problems confront the hybrid microcircuit (HMC) industry, where the development of <b>lead-free</b> HMC <b>solders</b> is generally lagging. Sandia National Laboratories is responsible for designing a variety of critical, high reliability hybrid components for radars.

2500|$|Tin-Silver-Copper (Sn-Ag-Cu, or [...] "SAC") solders {{are used}} by two-thirds of Japanese {{manufacturers}} for reflow and wave soldering, and by about 75% of companies for hand soldering. The widespread use of this popular <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> alloy family {{is based on the}} reduced melting point of the Sn-Ag-Cu ternary eutectic behavior (217˚C), which is below the 22/78Sn-Ag (wt.%) eutectic of 221°C and the 59/41Sn-Cu eutectic of 227°C (recently revised by P. Snugovsky to 53/47Sn-Cu). The ternary eutectic behavior of Sn-Ag-Cu and its application for electronics assembly was discovered (and patented) by a team of researchers from Ames Laboratory, Iowa State University, and from Sandia National Laboratories-Albuquerque.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, lead is {{prohibited}} in solder and flux in plumbing applications for drinking water use, per the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). Historically, {{a higher proportion}} of lead was used, commonly 50/50. This had the advantage of making the alloy solidify more slowly. With the pipes being physically fitted together before soldering, the solder could be wiped over the joint to ensure water tightness. Although lead water pipes were displaced by copper when the significance of lead poisoning began to be fully appreciated, lead solder was still used until the 1980s because it was thought that the amount of lead that could leach into water from the solder was negligible from a properly soldered joint. The electrochemical couple of copper and lead promotes corrosion of the lead and tin. [...] Tin, however, is protected by insoluble oxide. Since even small amounts of lead have been found detrimental to health, lead in plumbing solder was replaced by silver (food-grade applications) or antimony, with copper often added, and the proportion of tin was increased (see <b>Lead-free</b> <b>solder.)</b> ...|$|E

To assess the reliability of <b>lead-free</b> <b>solders</b> under vibration loading, test equipment has been designed for small solder joints.

40|$|The Directive 2002 / 95 /EC (RoHS Directive), {{among other}} substances, bans {{the use of}} lead in the {{electrical}} and electronics industry. This explorative study assesses the worldwide environmental and economical effects of the substitution of lead in solders and finishes. It shows the worldwide additional cost of <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> compared to soldering with lead-containing solders and finishes.

40|$|At present {{there are}} {{directions}} RoHS-WEEE in European Union which restrict {{the use of}} certain hazardous substances in new electric and electronic products.

A new combined measurement method for analyzing the characteristics of new solder {{in a relatively short}} time was developed at IZM. Therefore, the surface energy as a value for tear-off behavior, the viscosity as a value for the flow behavior and also the corrosion rate were measured.

5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{differences}} between lead-containing and <b>lead-free</b> <b>solder</b> pastes is the [...] "flow" [...] of the solder in its liquid state.

40|$|Several {{regulations}} ban {{materials in}} electronics. The ban {{of lead in}} the European RoHS Directive and the <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> initiatives in Japan have triggered a worldwide shift to <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> even in sectors which {{are not in the}} scope of the RoHS Directive. At the same time, manufacturers continue having problems with the transition to <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering.</b> The environmental benefits of <b>lead-free</b> <b>soldering</b> scientifically are contentious, but it must be considered a political and societal decision to prioritize the potential adverse impacts from lead over the adverse impacts from the use of substitute materials. The use in particular of noble metals and of hazardous metals in electronics together with the low collection and recovery rates drives the risk of environmental and health impacts. In parallel to the ban of lead in EEE, lead applications with a clear risk and much lower avoidance cost persist, like for instance the use of lead in lead shots for hunting. Future material restrictions and bans should take into consideration the efficiency of risk reductions sanctioning the applications with the highest risks at lowest avoidance cost first.
