25|$|The Faraday {{effect is}} caused by left and right circularly {{polarized}} waves propagating at slightly different speeds, a property known as circular birefringence. Since a <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> can be decomposed into the superposition of two equal-amplitude circularly polarized components of opposite handedness and different phase, {{the effect of a}} relative phase shift, induced by the Faraday effect, is to rotate the orientation of a wave's <b>linear</b> <b>polarization.</b>|$|E
30|$|The L-mode waves {{dominate}} in {{the dawn}} sector while the R-mode waves are mostly observed on the dusk sector, as already {{known in the}} ground-based observations. The occurrence rate of left-handed and <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations</b> is 87 % in the morning sector, whereas that of right-handed and <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations</b> is 82 % in the afternoon sector.|$|R
30|$|The only {{situation}} {{for which the}} couple of <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations</b> could appear more effective corresponds {{to the existence of}} <b>linear</b> limiting <b>polarizations</b> at the ionosphere entry point. This case presents a low occurrence and, additionally, would demand that the axes of the transmitted fields be superimposed with the directions of the limiting polarizations, the orientation of which varies with time: the technical challenge appears unrealistic to overcome. Only the generation of <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations</b> with fixed field directions seems possible, and as demonstrated on Figures  1 and 2, it is better anyway to consider the excitation of two complementary circular polarizations.|$|R

25|$|Moreover, {{one can use}} as basis {{functions}} any pair of {{orthogonal polarization}} states, not just <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations.</b> For instance, choosing right and left circular polarizations as basis functions simplifies the solution of problems involving circular birefringence (optical activity) or circular dichroism.|$|R

25|$|Media {{in which}} {{transmission}} of one polarization mode is preferentially reduced are called dichroic or diattenuating.

Contribution of wave polarization to wood characterization is studied, considering detection of rapid and gradual variations in wood structure, determination of moisture content and density distribution along the sample, as well as bulk properties detection. A set of microwave sensors in a collinear arrangement was used in two orthogonal <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations.</b> Significant findings are reported, in particular polarization dependence of moisture related attenuation, as well as improved defect detection accuracy when measurements in two orthogonal <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations</b> are considered.

25|$|Consider {{a purely}} {{polarized}} monochromatic wave. If {{one were to}} plot the electric field vector over one cycle of oscillation, an ellipse would generally be obtained, as {{is shown in the}} figure, corresponding to a particular state of elliptical polarization. Note that <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> and circular polarization can be seen as special cases of elliptical polarization.|$|E
25|$|In reality, a {{coherent}} isotropic radiator of <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> {{can be shown}} to be impossible. Its radiation field could not be consistent with the Helmholtz wave equation (derived from Maxwell's equations) in all directions simultaneously. Consider a large sphere surrounding the hypothetical point source, so that at that radius the wave over a reasonable area is essentially planar. The electric (and magnetic) field of a plane wave in free space is always perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. So the electric field would have to be tangent {{to the surface of the}} sphere everywhere, and continuous along that surface. However the hairy ball theorem shows that a continuous vector field tangent to the surface of a sphere must fall to zero at one or more points on the sphere, which is inconsistent with the assumption of an isotropic radiator with <b>linear</b> <b>polarization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clutter is {{detected}} and neutralized in several ways. Clutter tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all stationary echoes can be eliminated. Sea clutter {{can be reduced}} by using horizontal polarization, while rain is reduced with circular polarization (note that meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.|$|E

30|$|It {{appears that}} power repartitions are dissymmetric {{for the two}} couples of <b>polarizations</b> (two <b>linear</b> or two circular) in {{scenario}} # 1, but this observation is not valid in scenario # 2 : as indicated in column 5, the propagation of the two <b>linear</b> <b>polarizations</b> involves O and X modes with comparable power fractions in this case.|$|R
25|$|In the {{arrangement}} above, the transmission {{axis of the}} linear polarizer is at a positive 45° angle relative to the right horizontal and is represented with an orange line. The quarter-wave plate has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical fast axis and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the unpolarized light entering the linear polarizer is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> are suddenly changing.|$|E
25|$|In the leftmost figure above, the x and y {{components}} of the light wave are in phase. In this case, the ratio of their strengths is constant, so {{the direction of the}} electric vector (the vector sum of these two components) is constant. Since the tip of the vector traces out a single line in the plane, this special case is called <b>linear</b> <b>polarization.</b> The direction of this line depends on the relative amplitudes of the two components.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of {{the larvae}} of fireflies is also circularly polarized, {{as reported in}} 1980 for the species Photuris lucicrescens and Photuris versicolor. For fireflies, {{it is more difficult}} to find a microscopic explanation for the polarization, because the left and right lanterns of the larvae were found to emit polarized light of opposite senses. The authors suggest that the light begins with a <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> due to inhomogeneties inside aligned photocytes, and it picks up circular polarization while passing through linearly birefringent tissue.|$|E

25|$|In all {{electromagnetic}} radiation, {{the electric}} field is {{perpendicular to the}} direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the polarization of the wave. For a transmitted radar signal, the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections. For example, circular polarization is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. <b>Linear</b> <b>polarization</b> returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a fractal surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.|$|E
25|$|Polarization is {{a general}} {{property}} of waves that describes {{the orientation of the}}ir oscillations. For transverse waves such as many electromagnetic waves, it describes the orientation of the oscillations in the plane perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel. The oscillations may be oriented in a single direction (<b>linear</b> <b>polarization),</b> or the oscillation direction may rotate as the wave travels (circular or elliptical polarization). Circularly polarised waves can rotate rightward or leftward in the direction of travel, and which of those two rotations is present in a wave is called the wave's chirality.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that it will pass one <b>linear</b> <b>polarization</b> and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E
