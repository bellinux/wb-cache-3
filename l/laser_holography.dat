The Nd:YAG lasers used were Q-switched, double-pulsed, and frequency-doubled, operating at 20 pulses per second.

50|$|Lippmann's process foreshadowed <b>laser</b> <b>holography,</b> {{which is}} also based on {{recording}} standing waves in a photographic medium. Denisyuk reflection holograms, {{often referred to as}} Lippmann-Bragg holograms, have similar laminar structures that preferentially reflect certain wavelengths. In the case of actual multiple-wavelength colour holograms of this type, the colour information is recorded and reproduced just as in the Lippmann process, except that the highly coherent laser light passing through the recording medium and reflected back from the subject generates the required distinct standing waves throughout a relatively large volume of space, eliminating the need for reflection to occur immediately adjacent to the recording medium. Unlike Lippmann colour photography, however, the lasers, the subject and the recording medium must all be kept stable to within one quarter of a wavelength during the exposure in order for the standing waves to be recorded adequately or at all.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>holography,</b> in its {{original}} [...] "pure" [...] form of the photographic transmission hologram, is the only technology yet created which can reproduce an object or scene with such complete realism that the reproduction is visually indistinguishable from the original, given the original lighting conditions. It creates a light field identical to that which emanated from the original scene, with parallax about all axes and a very wide viewing angle. The eye differentially focuses objects at different distances and subject detail is preserved down to the microscopic level. The effect is exactly like looking through a window. Unfortunately, this [...] "pure" [...] form requires the subject to be laser-lit and completely motionless—to within a minor fraction of the wavelength of light—during the photographic exposure, and laser light must be used to properly view the results. Most people {{have never seen a}} laser-lit transmission hologram. The types of holograms commonly encountered have seriously compromised image quality so that ordinary white light can be used for viewing, and non-holographic intermediate imaging processes are almost always resorted to, as an alternative to using powerful and hazardous pulsed lasers, when living subjects are photographed.|$|E

Recent developments in Digital <b>Holography</b> and <b>Laser</b> Doppler <b>Holography</b> techniques can be considered to alleviate this issue. <b>Laser</b> Doppler <b>holography</b> and transmission microscopy can be coupled to analyze blood flow in fish embryos by adapting a laser Doppler holographic setup to a standard bio-microscope: the two beams of the holographic interferometer (illumination of the object and reference), whose frequency offset is controlled, were addressed to the microscope by optical fibers. Multimodal acquisition and analysis of the data is made by acting on the frequency offset of the two beams, and on the location of the Fourier space filtered zone.
