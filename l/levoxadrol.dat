40|$|Dioxadrol {{exists in}} four isomenc forms. a-(+) -Dioxadrol (dexox-adrol) showed {{phencyclidine}} (PCPHike activity in rhesus mon [...] keys trained to discriminate s. c. administration of ketamine, but neither a-(-) -dioxadrol (Ievoxadrol) nor f 3 -(±) -dioxadrol showed such activity. In addition, response-contingent i. v. dexoxadrol maintained {{higher rates of}} responding than either <b>levoxadrol</b> or fl-dioxadrol in monkeys experienced with ketamine seif-admin-istration. The order of potency in displacing bound 1 -[1 -(2 -thn 1) cydohex 1 Jpipendine from binding sites in rat brain ho-mogenates was dexoxadrol <b>levoxadrol</b> = -(±) -dioxadrol. Viewed {{in the context of}} previous studies with stereochemical probes of the PCP receptor, these results extend and confirm the supposition that dexoxadrol and <b>levoxadrol</b> are the stereo-chemical probes of choice in the study of effects mediate...|$|E
40|$|Phencyclidine (PCP) {{displaceable}} binding of 3 H-PCP to glass-fiber filters {{was eliminated}} and total binding markedly reduced by initial {{treatment of the}} discs with 0. 05 % polyethyleneimine. Assessed with treated filters, unlabeled PCP displaced 3 H-PCP in both rat and pigeon brain membranes with an EC 50 of 1 [mu]M. Of similar high inhibitory potency were dextrorphan, levorphanol, SKF 10047 and ketamine, while morphine, naloxone and etorphine had EC 50 values higher then 1 mM. Using the dissociative anesthetic dexoxadrol and its inactive isomer <b>levoxadrol</b> as displacing agents, stereospecific binding of 3 H-PCP was obtained in rat and pigeon brain membranes. The markedly higher potency of dexoxadrol, relative to <b>levoxadrol,</b> in displacing bound 3 H-PCP is compatible with behavioral data for these enantiomers. However, they were equipotent in displacing 3 H-PCP bound to glass-fiber filters {{in the absence of}} tissue. Heat denaturation, but not freezing, abolished stereospecific binding of 3 H-PCP, which was also absent in rat liver membranes. The stereospecific binding component in brain displayed biphasic saturability at 60 - 70 nM and 300 - 400 nM, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} ketamine, {{phencyclidine}} and analogues to alter catecholamine secretion from cultured bovine adrenal chromaffin cells was investigated. Both ketamine and phencyclidine specifically inhibited nicotinic agonist-induced secretion at concentrations {{which did not}} alter secretion induced by elevated + K depolarization. The inhibition of nicotinic agonist-induced secretion was not overcome by increasing concentrations of nico-tinic agonist. The effects of stereoisomer pairs of phencyclidine-like drugs- dexoxadrol, <b>levoxadrol</b> and (+) PCMP, (-) PCMP- did not reveal stereospecificity for the inhibition, {{in contrast to the}} stereospecific behavioral effects of the drugs. The local anesthetic lidocaine (0. 3 mM) also noncompetitively inhibited nicotinic agonist-induced secretion without inhibiting elevated K+-induced secretion. The data indicate that ketamine and phencyclidine at clinically relevant concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{representative}} drugs from three classes of psychotomimetic compounds (arylcyclohexylamines, benzomorphan opioids and dioxolanes) {{have been examined}} on synaptic transmission at an identified monosynaptic pathway in rat hippocampal slices. The compounds tested were phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, the racemate and isomers of SKF 10, 047 (N-allylnormetazocine), and the isomers of dioxadrol (dexoxadrol and <b>levoxadrol).</b> In the absence of added magnesium ions (Mg) in the perfusion medium low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway evoked a burst of population spikes in the CA 1 cell body region. The secondary components of this response could be abolished by the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (APV). PCP (1 microM) or ketamine (10 microM) selectively blocked the secondary components of the synaptic response. The effect of PCP was neither mimicked nor prevented by hexamethonium and atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, or clonidine and was therefore unlikely to involve cholinergic or adrenergic neurotransmitter systems. The sigma opiate, (+/-) -SKF 10, 047 (10 microM) also abolished selectively the secondary components of the synaptic response. There was no apparent difference between the potency of the stereoisomers of this compound. The action of (+/-) -SKF 10, 047 was not affected by either naloxone or haloperidol, indicating that this effect did not involve opioid receptors or the haloperidol-sensitive sigma site. Dexoxadrol (10 microM), but not <b>levoxadrol</b> (10 microM), also selectively blocked the secondary components of the synaptic response. It is concluded that these psychotomimetic agents can block an NMDA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and that this effect is mediated by a specific PCP/sigma site...|$|E
40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} between dextrorphan (10 mg/kg) and saline in a task in which 20 consecutive key pecks on either {{the left or right}} key, depending on whether dextrorphan or saline had been administered, produced food. During sessions in which stimulus generalization to other drugs was evaluated, 20 consecutive responses on either the dextrorphan- or saline-appropriate key produced food. Dextromethorphan and dexox-adrol produced dose-related stimulus control of behavior similar to that produced by dextrorphan. In contrast, the /-isomers of these compounds, levomethorphan, <b>levoxadrol</b> and levorphanol, at doses up to and including those that markedly decreased the rate of responding, produced responding primarily on the saline-appropriate key. In addition, both the d- and /-isomers of meth-adone, codeine, morphine, butorphanol and profadol resulted i...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1950 s the {{pharmaceutical}} industry has developed a number of chemicals, including phencyclidine, ketamine and related arylcyclohexylamines (PCE and TCP), dizocilpine (MK- 801), N-allylnormetazocine [NANM, (±) SKF- 10, 047], etoxadrol, dioxadrol and its enantiomers dexoxadrol and <b>levoxadrol,</b> which produce a constellation of unusual behavioral effects in animals and man. The compounds best studied in humans are phencyclidine and ketamine. They produce a remarkable dose-dependent dissociation of awareness. All of these substances are now known to be non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors of glutamic acid. They act in the NMDA receptor ion channel. One can conclude, {{on the basis of}} the effects observed with these agents, that glutamic acid and related excitatory amino acids are extremely important in the maintenance of human awareness...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} the N-methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp) channel is functionally and structurally associated with the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor, which mediates the psychotomimetic effects of PCP, sigma opioids, and dioxalanes. To investigate the relationship between N-Me-D-Asp and PCP receptors on a molecular level, we injected mRNA isolated from adult rat brain into Xenopus oocytes. In injected oocytes N-Me-D-Asp application (with glycine) evoked a partially desentizing inward current that was potentiated by glycine and blocked by D-(-) -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV), by Zn 2 + and, in a voltage-dependent manner, by Mg 2 +. These {{results show that the}} distinguishing features of rat brain N-Me-D-Asp channels are reproduced in this translation system. In addition, kainic acid elicited a nondesensitizing inward current at short latency, and quisqualate elicited a delayed oscillatory inward current, presumably mediated by a second-messenger system. Responses to glutamate had both short-latency and delayed components. The PCP derivative N-[1 -(2 -thienyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP) blocked the N-Me-D-Asp-evoked current, and its potency was comparable to its binding affinity in rat brain membranes. Onset of block required the presence of antagonist. Antagonism was stereoselective in that the active ligand dexoxadrol was a more effective blocker than its relatively inactive stereoisomer <b>levoxadrol.</b> adrol. Other PCP receptor ligands, (+) SKF- 10, 047 and MK- 801, also blocked. Potencies of compounds active at N-Me-D-Asp and PCP receptors in oocytes were comparable to those obtained previously in electrophysiological and binding assays on neural tissues. These results indicate the coexpression of neuronal PCP and N-Me-D-Asp receptors in Xenopus oocytes...|$|E
