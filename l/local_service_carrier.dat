Link lent the airline $75,000 to purchase three used Douglas DC-3s— but also removed control of the company from Robinson, making pilot Robert Peach its general manager. In 1948 the Civil Aeronautics Board certified the airline as a <b>local</b> <b>service</b> <b>carrier,</b> awarding a variety of routes in the Mohawk Valley.

40|$|Introduction: The {{adequacy}} of air transportation in New England {{has been the}} subject of intermittent debate-over the last twenty years-, culminating in the Civil Aeronautics Board's 1970 - 1974 "New England Service Investigation" (Docket 22973). Spurred on by Senate hearings on the "Adequacy of Northern New England Air Service" (1971) in particular and by Senator Norris Cotton of New Hampshire in general, in 1974 the Board certificated Air New England as a <b>local</b> <b>service</b> <b>carrier.</b> It was the first certification of a commuter airline by the Board. The certification contradicted the advice of the Board's own Bureau of Operating Rights and the U. S. Department of Transportation and overturned the initial (1973) decision of Administrative Law Judge Greer M. Murphy, who held that existing commuter airlines could provide adequate service in New England without certification. A potentially successful commuter ("Air New England 1970 - 1974," MIT-FTL Report R 75 - 9), millions of subsidy dollars later, Air New England is struggling financially and operationally and is now giving up many subsidized points to replacement commuter carriers. Logan Airport, the major hub of New England, has one of the largest concentrations of commuter carriers in the U. S. During the last seven years, it has ranked in the top three. Some twenty commuters (including all cargo carriers) land at Logan, serving over fifty markets. However, of the passenger-carrying commuters, only four (including Air New England) have remained steady customers since 1973. The others are Command, Pilgrim, and Provincetown-Boston Airlines. This report is an attempt - 2 - to analyze the pattern of commuter airlines operations at Logan. Since the events prior to 1973 are well documented, the emphasis is on the years 1973 - 1981. In Section 2, the theoretical background to analyze the commuter industry Is provided. Section 3 gives the Boston market analysis. In Section 4, a brief description of the aircraft used by commuters is provided as well as a look ahead to the aircraft that will be available to the commuter industry in the 1980 s. Finally, in Section 5 some recommendations are made to monitor the commuter activities at Logan airport. January 198...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{the decade}} between 1962 and 1972, {{certificated}} air service was deleted at about 250 {{points in the}} United States. In some of these cases, the service was no longer needed because of improved highway access to communities of interest.

The federal government, {{through the creation of}} the <b>local</b> <b>service</b> air <b>carriers</b> in the mid- 1940 s and their subsequent subsidy, has attempted to provide better air service to the nation's smaller towns. But the questions persist Is the federal subsidy program effective? Should federal regulation and/or subsidy be extended to commuter carriers? Indeed, should the federal government subsidize this type of service at all? What national goals does subsidy support? Perhaps most important, who should be formulating the answers to these questions?. February 1974 Includes bibliographical reference...|$|R
