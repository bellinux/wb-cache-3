25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. A mutual fund is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, investors can sell short, use a <b>limit</b> <b>order,</b> use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum investment requirement). Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and calls) to be written against them. Covered call strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a call sale or write) on calls written against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|E
50|$|One cancels other (OCO) {{orders are}} used when the trader wishes to {{capitalize}} on only one {{of two or more}} possible trading possibilities. For instance, the trader may wish to trade stock ABC at $10.00 or XYZ at $20.00. In this case, they would execute an OCO order composed of two parts: A <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> for ABC at $10.00, and a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> for XYZ at $20.00. If ABC reaches $10.00, ABC's <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> would be executed, and the XYZ <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> would be canceled.|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{informed}} traders' equilibrium {{choice of}} <b>limit</b> or market <b>orders.</b> We show {{that even after}} incorporating an order's price impact, not only may informed traders prefer to use <b>limit</b> <b>orders,</b> but also the probability of submitting <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> can be so high that in equilibrium <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> convey more information than market orders. We further show that the horizon of the private information is critical for this choice and is positively related to the probability of using <b>limit</b> <b>orders.</b> Our empirical analysis suggests that informed traders do prefer to use <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> and that <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> are indeed more informative. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a trader’s order choice between market and <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> using {{a sample of}} orders {{submitted}} through NYSE SuperDot. We find that traders place more <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> relative to market orders when: (1) the spread is large, (2) the order size is large, and (3) they expect high transitory price volatility. A rise in informational volatility appears neither to increase nor decrease the placement of <b>limit</b> <b>orders.</b> We also find that a rise in lagged price volatility decreases the size of spread, which {{is driven by the}} increase in the placement of <b>limit</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{stop-limit order}} {{combines}} {{the features of}} a stop order and a <b>limit</b> <b>order.</b> A stop-limit order is an order {{to buy or sell}} a stock that combines the features of a stop order and a <b>limit</b> <b>order.</b> Once the stop price is reached, a stop-limit order becomes a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> that will be executed at a specified price (or better). As with all limit orders, a stop-limit order doesn't get filled if the security's price never reaches the specified limit price.|$|E
50|$|A buy <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> {{can only}} be {{executed}} at the limit price or lower. For example, if an investor wants to buy a stock, but doesn't want {{to pay more than}} $20 for it, the investor can place a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> to buy the stock at $20. By entering a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> rather than a market order, the investor will not buy the stock at a higher price, but, may get fewer shares than he wants or not get the stock at all.|$|E
50|$|Market depth is a {{property}} of the orders that are contained in the <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> book at a given time. It is the amount that will be traded for a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> with a given price (if it is not limited by size), or the least favorable price that will be obtained by a market order with a given size (or a <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> that is limited by size and not price). Although a change in price may in turn attract subsequent orders, this {{is not included in}} market depth since it is not known.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} order flow composition and execution quality for {{different types of}} customer orders in six futures pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). We show that off-exchange customers frequently provide liquidity to other traders by submitting <b>limit</b> <b>orders.</b> We also document effective execution costs and turnaround times for customer liquiditydemanding and <b>limit</b> <b>orders.</b> The results imply that negative execution costs reported by Ferguson and Mann (2001) {{are likely to be}} explained by customer <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> earning the bidask spread. We also find that customer <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> {{do not appear to be}} systematically “picked off ” by market makers. Finally, we show that common estimators of the bid-ask spread can be used as a proxy for the cost of immediacy faced by off-exchange customers...|$|R

A unique dataset provides the opportunity to measure trading costs of marketable orders and fill rates and ex post costs of <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> across trading venues. For market orders, we find the primary exchange provides the lowest execution costs. However, the preferencing exchanges are no worse than, and in most cases better than, the nonpreferencing regional exchanges. For <b>limit</b> <b>orders,</b> the regionals execute <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> more frequently than the primary market and with an ex post execution cost that is not very different from the primary market.

The results in-dicate the unconditional trading costs of marketable <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> are significantly greater than market orders.

For example, when a securities firm is holding a customer <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> (an instruction {{to buy or sell}} securities at a certain price), the firm cannot ignore that order and cannot trade for their account using a price that would satisfy the customer's <b>limit</b> <b>order</b> without executing the customer <b>limit</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

40|$|Employing {{comprehensive}} limit-order data which identify investor types, {{this paper}} examines the clustering pattern of limit-order prices. First, <b>limit</b> <b>orders,</b> particularly those submitted by individual investors (IIs), tend to cluster at integer and even prices. Second, nonmarketable limit-order prices cluster more than marketable limit-order prices, indicating that aggressive <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> generally embed more information. Third, investors choosing even-priced <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> are not penalized by lower execution ratios. Fourth, investors (particularly IIs) strategically exhibit front-running behavior. Fifth, price clustering indeed creates price barriers. Finally, {{the degree of}} price clustering using trade data is significantly underestimated, compared to that using limit-order data.

40|$|A German broker’s clients place similar {{speculative}} {{trades and}} therefore {{tend to be}} on the same side of the market in a given stock during a given day, week, month, and quarter. Aggregate liquidity effects, short sale constraints, the systematic execution of <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> (coordinated through price movements) or the correlated trading of other investors who pick off retail <b>limit</b> <b>orders</b> do not fully explain why retail investors trade similarly.

For comparison, we also solve the schedule-following optimal execution problem that penalizes deviations from an order schedule.
