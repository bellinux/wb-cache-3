In this paper, we exploit two ensemble methods {{in order to}} integrate multiple results generated under different conditions. One method is based on majority vote, while {{the other is a}} memory-based approach that integrates maximum entropy and conditional random field classifiers. Our results indicate that the memory-based method can outperform the individual classifiers, but the majority vote method cannot. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we analyze sentiments and {{opinions}} expressed in user-written Web messages. The messages discuss healthrelated topics: medications, treatment, illness and cure, etc. Recognition of sentiments {{and opinions}} is a challenging task for humans {{as well as}} an automated text analysis. In this work, we apply both the approaches. The paper presents the annotation model, discusses characteristics of subjectivity annotations in health-related messages, and reports the results of the annotation agreement. For external evaluation of the <b>labeling</b> results, we <b>apply</b> <b>Machine</b> Learning methods on the annotated data and present the obtained results. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOne {{major problem}} in (trans) dermal drug {{delivery}} is the low penetration rate of drugs through the barrier of the skin. Encapsulation of a drug in lipid vesicles is one strategy to increase the penetration rate of a drug across the skin. In this study, the interactions between fluorescent-labelled liposomes and skin are visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Bilayer labelled gel-state and liquid-state liposomes (conventional or with flexible bilayers) were non-occlusively applied on human skin in vitro. The penetration pathway and penetration depth of the lipophilic fluorescent label into the skin were visualized. From the CLSM images, {{it was clear that}} the <b>label</b> <b>applied</b> in micelles and gel-state liposomes did not penetrate as deep into the skin as the <b>label</b> <b>applied</b> in liquid-state vesicles. Among the liquid-state vesicles, the suspensions with the flexible bilayers showed the highest fluorescence intensity in the dermis. Thus, the thermodynamic state of the bilayer and, to a smaller extent, the flexibility of the bilayer influence, strongly the penetration depth of the label into the skin. The <b>label</b> <b>applied</b> non-occlusively in flexible liposomes penetrated deeper into the skin than after occlusive application...|$|R
