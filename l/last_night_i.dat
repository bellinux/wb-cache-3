25|$|In 1975, Saint Phalle {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Un rêve plus long que la nuit (A Dream Longer Than the Night, later also called Camélia et le Dragon), and she recruited {{many of her}} artist friends to help {{make it into a}} film, a phantasmagorical tale of dragons, monsters, and adolescence. A young girl is held captive by a dragon, manages to escape, and must explore Sept Portes du Mystère ("Seven Doors of Mystery") to find love. Saint Phalle's daughter Laura was the lead character in the film, appearing with Saint Phalle, Jean Tinguely, and other artist friends; Peter Whitehead composed the music. For the filming, she designed several pieces of furniture, which were later displayed on the facade of the Palais des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Palace) in Brussels. From 1968-1988, she also worked on <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> <b>I</b> Had a Dream, a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams.|$|E
500|$|As {{they would}} do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. <b>Last</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E

Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy.

2500|$|In June 2008, drummer Richy Westley {{left the}} group to form his own band Strange and Partners. In August 2008 {{frontman}} Jon McClure said he would quit music after their next album, although a month later he changed his mind. The inconsistency of McClure's actions has led many critics in the music press to report negatively towards the move. Welsh band Future of the Left joked of their delight at the band's split at live shows on their tour at the time, as can be heard on their live album <b>Last</b> <b>Night</b> <b>I</b> Saved Her from Vampires.

On January 4, he told {{supporters}} in New Hampshire, [...] "If you give me the same chance that Iowa gave me <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> truly believe that I will be the president of the United States of America." [...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ...

2500|$|Michael Morpurgo, {{the author}} of the book on which the film is based, visited the set several times while filming was being undertaken: [...] "Spielberg’s a {{wonderful}} storyteller and a kid. He adores stories and that’s what he’s best at. It’s extraordinary to meet someone with that kind of enthusiasm, utterly unspoiled ... When I went to visit him on set, he was clearly enthralled by the countryside. He fell for Devon in a big way. He was warm, kind and open, and utterly without ego ... Spielberg was like a conductor with a very light baton. He hardly had to wave it at all. I was in awe.” Emily Watson also praised Spielberg's approach: [...] "It was intimate, passionate and about the acting. And every single priority that as an actor that you would want to be there was there. It felt very real and focused." [...] On set, he'd come in, in the morning, and say, 'I couldn't sleep <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> <b>I</b> was worrying about this shot!' Which was great! He's human and he's still working in an impassioned way, like a 21-year-old, trying to make the best out of everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. <b>Last</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> hugged my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E
2500|$|In June 1918, McKenzie sought {{approval}} from the trustees to raise revenue by using Fisk's campus as a receiving station for Black troops in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), a precursor to the present-day Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC) program. The Student Army Training Corp allowed students to attend school while they participated in military training exercises during World War I. McKenzie noted that accommodating the troops, [...] "will cramp us very considerably, but the compensation will keep us from any additional indebtedness and probably turn our lodging and boarding department into a self-supporting institution, and enable us to make a number of necessary changes or improvements without cutting into our normal funds. I am glad, too, to be of very direct service to the nation in its persecution of the War." [...] In August 1918, the first of over 600 Black SATC cadets arrived in Nashville. [...] "The boys will live a highly educational military life, centered about Bennett Hall. The girls will live an equally efficient, busy school life, centered about Jubilee Hall," [...] he stated. However the presence of military cadets on Fisk's campus, {{all of whom were}} young men, added to the University's disciplinary problems. While McKenzie appreciated the disciplinary focus of the military's proscribed daily routine, he harshly criticized the military's refusal to acknowledge and abide by Fisk's rules and regulations. At the opening of the 1918 academic year, McKenzie set the tone for a new approach to student conduct by invoking the military's presence and influence on the campus, [...] "We are a military institution. Not that we have been absorbed by the military, but that the essential principles of efficiency exemplified in the military have been absorbed into the university. These principles include concentration of effort, unremitting toil, elimination of all unnecessary activities and motions, regular and insistent schedule of life, promptness, accuracy, reliability thoroughness, instant and complete obedience. With military leaders unwilling to enforce [...] "satisfactory moral standards," [...] their cadets ran rampant, smoking, cursing, and fraternizing with Fisk co-eds. In one significant infraction, a soldier helped a female Fisk student to [...] "escape supervision" [...] of the University and was found with her in a private room. Although the man was arrested, the military administered no punishment. In addition to the poor behavior of cadets, McKenzie strongly criticized the federal government for failing to provide Black soldiers adequate compensation for their service to the nation. [...] "When the immediate aim of efficient fighters was no longer its aim, the Government sought to free itself from its financial obligations and forgot what havoc it would work in the lives of many, many young men," [...] McKenzie lamented in the Fisk News. While the mobilization effort only lasted a few months and World War I ended in November 1918, the military presence had lasting effects on Fisk's campus school discipline. McKenzie continued to experiment the military's model of conduct, but the continued military discipline for student conduct policies after the military's departure from campus angered Fisk students. Viewing the new policies as infringing on their rights, several Fisk students rebelled. McKenzie reported, [...] "The other day the college boys served notice on me that until I was inclined to treat them like men they would refuse to attend the study hall. It did not take very many hours to secure written pledges from all but five of them that they would attend. Since then, one or more of them have attempted to spoil the lights in the study hall, and they have torn down the picture of President Cravath and written an ugly message on the chapel wall where the picture was. McKenzie noted the required study hall also angered certain Fisk alumni, remarking [...] "Only <b>last</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> was sent almost direct word to the effect that the alumni would protest against the study hall, and a reminder of the fact that practically no white man is trusted by any Negro." ...|$|E
