The drawers usually use a drawer slide to facilitate opening the drawer which includes an [...] "outstop" [...] {{to prevent the}} drawer from being pulled {{completely out of the}} cabinet. To open a drawer on most metal {{filing cabinets}}, a small sliding mechanism known as a [...] "thumblatch" [...] must be pressed to release and open the drawer. Each drawer has a handle to grip and pull the drawer with. On the front face of each drawer, there is usually a <b>label</b> <b>holder</b> to allow the user to identify the contents of the drawer.|$|E

40|$|Opinion holder {{identification}} aims {{to extract}} entities that express opinions in sentences. In this paper, opinion holder identification {{is divided into}} two subtasks: author’s opinion recognition and opinion <b>holder</b> <b>labeling.</b> Support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to recognize author’s opinions, and conditional random field algorithm (CRF) is utilized to <b>label</b> opinion <b>holders.</b> New features are proposed for both methods. Our method achieves an f-score of 0. 734 in the NTCIR 7 MOAT task on the Traditional Chinese side, which is the best performance among results of machine learning methods proposed by participants, and also it is close to the best performance of this task. In addition, inconsistent annotations of opinion holders are analyzed, along with the best way to utilize the training instances with inconsistent annotations being proposed...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} demonology of William of Auvergne, to determine {{why and how}} he constructed his theories out of contemporary lore about demons and other spirits. William was master of theology in the University of Paris and bishop of Paris from 1228 {{until his death in}} 1249, in which position he served as a major advisor to the young Louis IX. In addition to being one of the most politically influential people in the French kingdom, William {{was one of the greatest}} thinkers of his generation, producing numerous works of theology, philosophy and science. William's efforts combine an adoption of an Aristotelian "physics" for spiritual entities with an uncompromising reaffirmation of the view that demons are evil, fallen angels. He believed that a demonic conspiracy existed to deceive humans into false worship, and his concerns led him to precisely define the capabilities of demons according to the latest scientific views of spirits, to characterize opinions with which he disagreed as demonic lies and to <b>label</b> their <b>holders</b> as demonic dupes. William's demonology represented a choice between several alternative varied and contradictory conceptions of spirits that circulated among the western European populace. With his demonology, he hoped to help impose an order he considered doctrinally and politically-acceptable onto the turbulence of early thirteenth century France...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} identifying an opinion with its holder and topic, given a sentence from online news media texts. We introduce an approach of exploiting the semantic structure of a sentence, anchored to an opinion bearing verb or adjective. This method uses semantic role labeling as an intermediate step to <b>label</b> an opinion <b>holder</b> and topic using data from FrameNet. We decompose our task into three phases: identifying an opinion-bearing word, labeling semantic roles related to the word in the sentence, and then finding the holder and {{the topic of the}} opinion word among the labeled semantic roles. For a broader coverage, we also employ a clustering technique to predict the most probable frame for a word which is not defined in FrameNet. Our experimental results show that our system performs significantly better than the baseline. ...|$|R

Among the revolutionists, at bottom center, is Edmund Burke wearing clerical robes and carrying a large cross. In October 1788, {{it was clear that}} George III had gone insane. William Pitt and Charles James Fox contended in the House of Commons over the terms of the regency of the Prince of Wales. The king's health provoked a constitutional crisis, because Prince George was not sympathetic to his father or his ministers. He favored Fox over his father's Prime Minister, William Pitt. In this cartoon, the revolutionists are prevented by William Pitt from reaching the king. Title from item. Forms part of: British Cartoon Prints Collection (Library of Congress) ...|$|R
40|$|In botanical gardens, arboreta, {{and other}} public gardens labels are used to {{accession}} plants, to identify them for the public, and to interpret them for the visitor. Permanent record labels are a necessity for the botanical garden that is accumulating scientific data from its collection of plants. An attractive labeling system can identify plants without destroying {{the beauty of the}} garden, and a master interpretive plan for the garden that includes labels may increase the appreciation of the average visitor for the garden and its plants. In Part One of the thesis the author considers the aesthetic and educational limitations of the identification label. He places labeling in the context of interpretation, and he suggests how labeling can be integrated into a master interpretive plan. The writer presents alternatives and adjuncts to labeling as an interpretive tool. In Part Two the author examines the materials of an methods for production of legible, durable and attractive <b>labels</b> and their <b>holders.</b> Advisor: Richard W. Light...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a strategic analysis using a services marketing framework of 3 business {{models in the}} music industry: the traditional music industry; renegade peer-to-peer music file trading; and new, legiti-mate online downloading services. Key recommendations are made on how new, legitimate services can suc-ceed using convergent marketing strategies. Finally, a conclusion is provided addressing {{the future of the}} music industry and other media-related industries. Digital Distribution of Music Since 1999, the Internet has drastically altered the pro-duction, distribution, and consumption of music (Molteni & Ordanini, 2003). Digital music distribution via unauthorized consumer peer-to-peer (P 2 P) file trad-ing {{has become one of the}} most popular Internet activi-ties throughout the world via the renegade pioneer Napster and now current unauthorized organizations such as the popular Kazaa. The term unauthorized refers to the fact that the music currently traded on P 2 P net-works is not licensed by record <b>labels</b> and copyright <b>holders,</b> and under the law throughout the world, is ille-gal.

5000|$|A Miser Brothers' Christmas is a {{stop motion}} {{spin-off}} special {{based on some}} of the characters from the 1974 Rankin-Bass special The Year Without a Santa Claus. Distributed by Warner Bros. Animation under their Warner Premiere <b>label</b> (the rights <b>holders</b> of the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library) and Toronto-based Cuppa Coffee Studios, the one-hour special premiered on ABC Family on Saturday, December 13, 2008, during the network's annual The 25 Days of Christmas programming. [...] Mickey Rooney and George S. Irving reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser at ages 88 and 86. [...] Snow Miser, originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died in 1987, was voiced by Juan Chioran, while Mrs. Claus, voiced by Shirley Booth in the original, was portrayed by Catherine Disher (because Booth had died in 1992). The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style. This is the last Christmas special to feature Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, as he died in 2014, as well as the last time George Irving voiced Heat Miser, as he died in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, {{following}} the death of his wife the previous year, an album entitled Reachin' Arcesia was recorded in Hollywood on Cherokee Ave. at Artists Recording Studios between May 15 and July 26 of that year and released by Alpha Records in small quantity. 300 copies were pressed and released in November 1972. This LP has been 'bootlegged' by various entities, and has been erroneously released under the title 'Arcesia Reaching' with the second side as side one and the first side as side two, thereby skewing the intent of the singer and producer in presenting the songs as intended. A 45 rpm single from the LP, 'Reaching' b/w 'Pictures In My Window' was released in limited quantity in 1979 in Honolulu on the Orpheus-Alephia <b>label,</b> the current <b>holders</b> of the rights thereto. (The record was subsequently reissued without authorization in 1997 by the German label One Little Indian Records). The stark white cover of the original LP release (containing only the artist's name and album title) belied the decidedly unusual music inside. As one might expect, the leader of Arcesia was in fact the 54-year-old John Arcesi himself, who {{spent the better part of}} the 1960s devoting himself to writing, painting, songwriting and occasional rare vocal appearances at benefits in Palm Springs, California. The co-producer and engineer on the record was Alexander Furth. Furth also produced the 1968 single of 'Love Is Like A Mountain'( [...] aka 'Reaching') b/w 'It's All Accordin'.|$|R

The song reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 in May; it might have risen higher, except that in the same month, Atlantic Records, prompted by the overwhelming club response to [...] "We Are Family," [...] sent the last-named track to radio. The song was also a hit in Australia (#5), the Netherlands (#1) and the UK (#6). [...] "He's The Greatest Dancer" [...] was sampled by Will Smith in his 1997 number one hit single [...] "Gettin' Jiggy Wit' It," [...] the first selection he released from his album Big Willie Style. In 2000, DJ Tony Touch recorded a version of the song, entitled [...] "I Wonder Why? (He's the Greatest DJ)," [...] whose lyrics were sung by Keisha Spivey and Pam Long of R&B girl group Total. The song was recorded and released by Dannii Minogue in 2007 and was an international Top 40 hit; it was also sampled by a Russian pop group Hi-Fi in their 1999 song [...] "Pro Leto" [...] (translated as [...] "About Summer"). Robert Hood released a Techno track based on the Hook of this song on his <b>label</b> M-Plant. Nick <b>Holder</b> sampled the song on his 1997 album One Night in the Disco.|$|R
