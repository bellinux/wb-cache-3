50|$|The Traction Avant used a <b>longitudinal,</b> front-wheel <b>drive</b> layout, {{with the}} engine set well within the wheelbase, {{resulting}} in a very favourable weight distribution, aiding the car's advanced handling characteristics. The gearbox was placed {{at the front of}} the vehicle {{with the engine}} behind it and the differential between them, a layout shared with the later Renault 4 and 16 and first generation Renault 5 but the opposite way round to many <b>longitudinal</b> front-wheel <b>drive</b> cars, such as the Saab 96 and Renault 12 and 18 and most Audi models. The gear change was set in the dashboard, with the lever protruding through a vertical, H-shaped gate. Because this vertical orientation could have resulted in the car dropping out of gear when the lever was in the upper positions (i.e. second or reverse gears), the gear-shift mechanism was locked when the mechanical clutch was engaged and released when the clutch pedal was depressed. The result of this layout, along with pendant pedals, umbrella-type handbrake control and front bench seats, was a very spacious interior, with a flat and unobstructed floor. The low-slung arrangement also eliminated the need for running boards to step into or out of the vehicle. These features made them ideal for use as limousines and taxi cabs, and they were quite popular among drivers and passengers alike. Until 1953, black was the only colour available.|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} dynamics of a spin-qubit periodically driven in both longitudinal and transverse directions by two classical fields respectively a radio-frequency (RF) and a microwave (MW) field operating at phase difference ϕ.

We superimpose the RF and MW signals respectively to the longitudinal and transverse components of the magnetic field. The proposed model {{may be used to}} optimize the control of a qubit in quantum devices. The various fields applied are relevant to nearly-decouple the spin-qubit from its environment, minimize decoherence effects and improve on the coherence time.

To {{improve the}} output {{performance}} of piezoelectric linear motors, researches was {{carried on the}} vibration characteristic for the stator of dynamic-friction type non-resonant linear piezoelectric motors.

40|$|Spin {{dynamics}} of field-driven domain walls (DWs) guided by Permalloy nanowires are studied by high-speed magneto-optic polarimetry and numerical simulations. DW velocities and spin configurations are determined as functions of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drive</b> field, transverse bias field, and nanowire width. Nanowires having cross-sectional dimensions {{large enough to}} support vortex wall structures exhibit regions of drive-field strength (at zero bias field) that have enhanced DW velocity resulting from coupled vortex structures that suppress oscillatory motion. Factor of ten enhancements of the DW velocity are observed above the critical longitudinal drive-field (that marks the onset of oscillatory DW motion) when a transverse bias field is applied. Nanowires having smaller cross-sectional dimensions that support transverse wall structures also exhibit a region of higher mobility above the critical field, and similar transverse-field induced velocity enhancement but with a smaller enhancement factor. The bias-field enhancement of DW velocity is explained by numerical simulations of the spin distribution and dynamics within the propagating DW that reveal dynamic stabilization of coupled vortex structures and suppression of oscillatory motion in the nanowire conduit resulting in uniform DW motion at high speed.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of a three-level system (ThLS) sinusoidally driven in both longitudinal and transverse directions and {{in the presence of}} a uniaxial anisotropy D entering the generic Hamiltonian through the zero-energy splitting term D(S^z) ^ 2 where S^z is the projection of the spin vector along the quantization direction. As a consequence of the addition of this term, the order of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is increased by a unit and we observe a sequence of cascaded SU(3) Landau-Zener-Stückelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometers. The study is carried out by analytically and numerically calculating the probabilities of non-adiabatic and adiabatic evolutions. For non-adiabatic evolutions, two main approximations based on the weak and strong driving limits are discussed by comparing the characteristic frequency of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drive</b> with the amplitudes of driven fields. For each of the cases discussed, our analytical results quite well reproduce the gross temporal profile of the exact numerical probabilities. This allows us to check the range of validity of analytical results and confirm our assumptions. For adiabatic evolutions, a general theory is constructed allowing for the description of adiabatic passages in arbitrary ThLSs in which direct transitions between states with extremal spin projections are forbidden. A compact formula for adiabatic evolutions is derived and numerically tested for some illustrative cases. Interference patterns demonstrating multiple LZSM transitions are reported. Applications of our results to the Nitrogen Vacancy Center (NVC) in diamond are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{model for}} the {{depinning}} and driven steady state phases of a solid tuned across a polymorphic phase transition between ground states of triangular and square symmetry. These include pinned states which may have dominantly triangular or square correlations, a plastically flowing liquid-like phase, a moving phase with hexatic correlations, flowing triangular and square states and a dynamic coexistence regime characterized by the complex interconversion of locally square and triangular regions. We locate these phases in a dynamical phase diagram. We demonstrate that the apparent power-law orientational correlations we obtain in our moving hexatic phase arise from circularly averaging an orientational correlation function with qualitatively different behaviour in the <b>longitudinal</b> (<b>drive)</b> and transverse directions. The intermediate coexistence regime exhibits several novel properties, including substantial enhancement in the current noise, an unusual power-law spectrum of current fluctuations and striking metastability effects. This noise arises from the fluctuations of the interface separating locally square and triangular ordered regions. We demonstrate the breakdown of effective ``shaking temperature'' treatments in the coexistence regime by showing that such shaking temperatures are non-monotonic functions of the drive in this regime. Finally we discuss the relevance of these simulations to the anomalous behaviour seen in the peak effect regime of vortex lines in the disordered mixed phase of type-II superconductors. We propose that this anomalous behavior is directly linked to the behavior exhibited in our simulations in the dynamical coexistence regime, thus suggesting a possible {{solution to the problem of}} the origin of peak effect anomalies.

40|$|A finite {{elements}} method (FEM) -analysis {{has been carried}} out with the purpose to study dynamics of carrying system in a machine tool of unique height. This is a one-off machine with high traveling column and a support with horizontal slide can move vertically along the column. Spindle milling and boring units are mounted telescopically at slide butt end. The FEM-analysis of the machine tool has been made due to its renovation. Machine resonances, responses to cutting force, static and dynamic rigidity in spindles have been estimated in the paper. The machine carrying system is subtle, heavy and structurally complicated. Its structural chain includes a carriage, a column, a support, a slide, spindle units interconnected with the help of hydro-static guides. While varying main parameters their influence on rigidity has been investigated in the paper. Height of  support lifting, column material and rigidity of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drive</b> have been changed during the investigations. Static, modal and harmonic MEF-analyses have been executed in the paper. Frequency-response characteristic of the machine has been constructed in the process of the investigations. Two support bending resonances have been detected in the column at low frequency. Such Due to this there are limits for usage of the machine in sub-resonance and static frequency range. The most powerful resonance has been observed at frequency of 27. 8 Hz. The resonance has manifested itself as torsional oscillations of the column together with the support and the slide. Slide bending resonances have been revealed at higher frequencies 65 – 105 Hz. Three intervals which are fit for machine operation have been determined between resonance ranges. There is a prospective usage of the machine in inter-resonance (32 – 65 Hz) and super-resonance (more than 105 Hz) intervals. It has been shown that rigidity in spindle is a sequence higher in dynamic intervals than in a static interval. Machine subtility can be compensated by its transition to high-speed machining. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at {{the wheels of the}} crane is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric overhead travelling crane (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and wheel spacing of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure as well as to measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the crane wheels are measured through strain gauges on the end carriage load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, longitudinal crane travel with payload and lateral crab travel with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>drive</b> mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric overhead travelling crane and its supporting structure...|$|E
