60|$|Fearless, now, his awe gone in tenderness, he <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> looked {{straight}} into her eyes, smiled. But his courage was slipping. He {{wanted to run}} and hide.|$|E
60|$|She assented in silence, and <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b> For once {{at least}} in her life she was totally {{oblivious}} of the charm of her attitude. But he was not, and he turned his eyes aside, {{that he might not}} be tempted to softness.|$|E

6000|$|LESBIA [widening <b>her</b> {{eyes and}} <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> haughtily] And pray {{how does that}} prevent me from knowing as much about men and women as {{people who have no}} self-control? ...|$|R
60|$|And the girl, roused from semi-somnolence, {{would pull}} herself {{together}} with a little jerk, would straighten <b>her</b> shoulders and <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> whilst a quickly smothered sigh of weariness would escape her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "OVERDID 'EM! Don't you know? They're {{always so}} high and mighty! Kinder 'Don't tech me. My mother's an angel; my father's a king'--all {{that sort of}} thing. They did THIS"--she drew herself up in a presumable {{imitation}} of the two women's majestic entrance--"and then," [...] she continued, [...] "you--YOU jest did this"--here she <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and puffing out her small chest, strode towards the colonel in evident simulation of his grandest manner.|$|E
6000|$|And lo, and forsooth! as {{the words}} he was uttering, [...] A rich puff of air set his candle a-guttering, [...] And there rose in the kitchen a sizzling and sputtering, [...] With a {{crackling}} of sparks and of flames a great fluttering, [...] And--of which here could not be two opinions-- [...] A smoking-hot savour of sage and onions. [...] Beam, wall and flagstones the kitchen was lit, [...] Every dark corner and cranny of it [...] With the blaze from the hearthstone. Copper and brass [...] Winked back the winking of platter and glass. [...] And a wonderful squeaking of mice went up [...] At the smell of a Michaelmas supper to sup-- [...] Unctuous odours that wreathed and swirled [...] Where'er frisked a whisker or mouse-tail twirled, [...] While out of the chimney up into the night [...] That ne'er-to-be-snuffed-too-much smoke took flight. [...] "That's one," [...] says the Fairy, finger on thumb, [...] "So now, Mister Sam, there's but two to come!" [...] She leaned her head sidelong; she <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> [...] With a twinkling of eye from the radiance within. [...] Poor Sam stood astounded; he says, says he, [...] "I wish my old Mother was back with me, [...] For {{if there was one}} thing she couldn't refuse [...] 'Twas a sweet thick slice from the breast of a goose." [...] But his cheek grew stiff and his eyes stared bright, [...] For there, on her stick, pushing out of the night, [...] Tap-tapping along, herself and no other, [...] Came who but the shape of his dear old Mother! [...] Straight into the kitchen she hastened and went, [...] Her breath coming quick as if all but spent. [...] "Why, Sam," [...] says she, [...] "the bird be turning, [...] For my nose tells I that the skin's a-burning!" [...] And down at the oven the ghost of her sat [...] And basted the goose with the boiling fat.|$|E

60|$|As {{she stepped}} out upon the stage {{in the glare of}} the light, she seemed as far from him as the roseate crown of snow on Sierra Blanca, and he shivered with a sort of awe. Her singing moved him less than her {{delicate}} beauty--but her voice and the pretty way she had of <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> thrilled him just as when he sat in the little church at Marmion. The flowerlike texture of her skin and the exquisite grace of her hands plunged him into gloom.|$|R
60|$|While speaking, she had unconsciously laid aside <b>her</b> fan, <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> {{mantilla}} {{from her}} head with both hands, and, drawing it around her shoulders and under <b>her</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>chin,</b> had crossed it over her bosom with a certain prim, automatic gesture, {{as if it had}} been the starched kerchief of some remote Puritan ancestress. With her arms still unconsciously crossed, she stooped rigidly, picked up her fan with three fingers, {{as if it had been}} a prayer-book, and, with a slight inclination of her bared head, with its accurately parted brown hair, passed slowly out of the corridor.|$|R
60|$|He {{was quite}} sure that he wanted Sally. There had been moments {{when he had been}} {{conscious}} of certain doubts, but in the smart of temporary defeat these had vanished. That streak of Bohemianism in her which from time to time since their first meeting had jarred upon his orderly mind was forgotten; and all that Mr. Carmyle could remember was the brightness of her eyes, the jaunty <b>lift</b> of <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and the gallant trimness of her. Her gay prettiness seemed to flick at him like a whip in the darkness of wakeful nights, lashing him to pursuit. And quietly and methodically, like a respectable wolf settling on the trail of a Red Riding Hood, he prepared to pursue. Delicacy and imagination might have kept him back, but in these qualities he had never been strong. One cannot have everything.|$|R
6000|$|Dante {{spoke to}} them; and one, a female, <b>lifted</b> up <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> as a blind person does when expressing {{consciousness}} of notice, {{and said she}} was Sapia of Sienna, who used to be pleased at people's misfortunes, and had rejoiced when her countrymen lost the battle of Colle. [...] "Sapia was my name," [...] she said, [...] "but sapient I was not[28], for I prayed God to defeat my countrymen; and when he had done so (as he had willed to do), I raised my bold face to heaven, and cried out to him, 'Now do thy worst, for I fear thee not!' I was like the bird in the fable, who thought the fine day was to last for ever. What I should have done in my latter days {{to make up for the}} imperfect amends of my repentance, I know not, if the holy Piero Pettignano had not assisted me with his prayers. But who art thou that goest with open eyes, and breathest in thy talk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll make you," [...] he said. So {{different}} was {{the voice}} now that another man might have spoken. Then he bent her backward, and, freeing one hand, brought it under <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> and tried to <b>lift</b> <b>her</b> face.|$|R
60|$|She {{sighed and}} sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings. Her son watched {{her face as}} it was <b>lifted,</b> and <b>her</b> small, {{work-hardened}} hands fingering at the bow under <b>her</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|R
60|$|A dreamier {{light came}} into her eye, which wandered, with a turn of the head giving him the tender curve of her cheek, over the levels of the bay, {{roughened}} everywhere by the breeze, but yellowish green in the channels and dark with the thick growth of eel-grass in the shallows; then she <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> face to the pale blue heavens in an effort that slanted towards him the soft round of <b>her</b> <b>chin,</b> and showed <b>her</b> full throat.|$|R
6000|$|Such {{had been}} her {{existence}} before {{the coming of the}} brig with the strangers. She remembered well that time; the uproar in the settlement, the never-ending wonder, the days and nights of talk and excitement. She remembered her own timidity with the strange men, till the brig moored to the bank became in a manner part of the settlement, and the fear wore off in the familiarity of constant intercourse. The call on board then became part of her daily round. She walked hesitatingly up the slanting planks of the gangway amidst the encouraging shouts and more or less decent jokes of the men idling over the bulwarks. There she sold her wares to those men that spoke so loud and carried themselves so free. There was a throng, a constant coming and going; calls interchanged, orders given and executed with shouts; the rattle of blocks, the flinging about of coils of rope. She sat out of the way under the shade of the awning, with her tray before her, the veil drawn well over her face, feeling shy amongst so many men. She smiled at all buyers, but spoke to none, letting their jests pass with stolid unconcern. She heard many tales told around her of far-off countries, of strange customs, of events stranger still. Those men were brave; but the most fearless of them spoke of their chief with fear. Often the man they called their master passed before her, walking erect and indifferent, in the pride of youth, in the flash of rich dress, with a tinkle of gold ornaments, while everybody stood aside watching anxiously for a movement of his lips, ready to do his bidding. Then all her life seemed to rush into her eyes, and from under her veil she gazed at him, charmed, yet fearful to attract attention. One day he noticed her and asked, [...] "Who is that girl?" [...] "A slave, Tuan! A girl that sells cakes," [...] a dozen voices replied together. She rose in terror to run on shore, when he called her back; and as she stood trembling with head hung down before him, he spoke kind words, <b>lifting</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> with his hand and looking into her eyes with a smile. [...] "Do not be afraid," [...] he said. He never spoke to her any more. Somebody called out from the river bank; he turned away and forgot her existence. Taminah saw Almayer standing on the shore with Nina on his arm. She heard Nina's voice calling out gaily, and saw Dain's face brighten with joy as he leaped on shore. She hated the sound of that voice ever since.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sing J. Lee and shot in Los Angeles. It opens to a clock ticking counting down, and flashing quick glimpses of other scenes, some {{from the rest of}} the video, including the main character escaping down a hallway, screaming at the camera and counting calendar days in vivid red lighting, as well as numerous images of a similarly lit flower. These brief images repeat throughout the video. Shots of the band performing on a large indoor stage with bright, dynamic lighting are spliced throughout between the story scenes. Two scientists are shown discussing design plans for a female android posted on a wall in their workplace. A woman sleeps in a bed with a monitor on her wrist and an electronic device placed around her head, with several doctors monitoring her through the glass wall, watching what appears to be a simulation being created for her through the device on a screen, and tapping a button marked [...] "days to reset" [...] on another as it counts down and cycles through the days of the week. The woman's sleep appears to be getting less restful from the simulation as she fidgets and begins breathing harder. She is shown walking out onto a rooftop and taking a transparent rake from one of the men escorting her, redrawing the lines in a large sand garden, and looking out at the city around them before she and two of the men go back inside. We see her in the same room and on the same bed as before, but without the electronic devices, leaning away from an unknown man with a somewhat frightened expression as he <b>lifts</b> <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> to look at him and then begins undressing himself. Shots are shown of her flipping through a journal with a loose note stuck into it, reading [...] "you are stronger than you think." [...] She goes up to the rooftop to draw in the sand again, only this time bumps into an exact duplicate of herself accompanied by two different men, as both women take a moment to stare at each other in shock. She is later seen laying in bed, again without the devices, appearing to contemplate the emotions of these recent encounters. She is then shown looking through the glass wall of a small room, filled with sixteen more of the duplicates, standing but deactivated. She places a new note in the journal atop the other, reading [...] "look right. You are stronger in numbers." [...] On the last day before the reset, the version of her with the simulation device suddenly startles awake, tears off the device and snaps it in half before throwing a stack of books from the nightstand through the window and escaping. We see her weave through numerous people trying to catch her, the source of some of the shots spread through the rest of the video, before she locks herself in a small room, containing a [...] "final reset" [...] button which she presses. She steps up onto a platform that lays her on her back as she appears to deactivate, before we see every one of the sixteen other duplicates wake up.|$|R
60|$|Quite suddenly, he put {{his hand}} under <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> and <b>lifted</b> up <b>her</b> face to him. Her dark blue eyes, in their wetness of tears, dilated as if she was startled in her very soul. They looked at him through their tears in terror and a little horror. His light blue eyes were keen, small-pupilled and unnatural in their vision. Her lips parted, as she breathed with difficulty.|$|R

60|$|Sir Richmond {{recalled}} that little speech {{now as he}} returned from Salisbury station to the Old George after his farewell to Martineau. He recalled too the soft firmness of her profile and the delicate line of <b>her</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>chin.</b> He felt that this time at any rate he was not being deceived by the outward shows of a charming human being. This young woman had real firmness of character to back up her free and independent judgments. He smiled {{at the idea of}} any facile passion in the composition of so sure and gallant a personality. Martineau was very fine-minded in many respects, but he was an old maid; and like all old maids he saw man and woman in every encounter. But passion was a thing men and women fell back upon when they had nothing else in common. When they thought in the pleasantest harmony and every remark seemed to weave a fresh thread of common interest, then it wasn't so necessary. It might happen, but it wasn't so necessary.... If it did it would be a secondary thing to companionship. That's what she was,--a companion.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of April 30, 1970, Stevens' {{sometime}} roommate and companion, Lola McNally, found her {{on the kitchen floor}} of her Hollywood Hills home. According to McNally, when she called Stevens' name, she opened <b>her</b> eyes, <b>lifted</b> <b>her</b> head, and tried to speak, but was unable to make any sound. McNally told police that she had spoken to Stevens the previous night and had seen no sign of trouble. Stevens died in the ambulance {{on the way to the}} hospital. On arrival, medics removed a small bandage from <b>her</b> <b>chin</b> that revealed a small amount of what appeared to be fresh blood oozing from a cut which appeared to have been a few hours old. Los Angeles County Coroner Dr. Thomas Noguchi attributed Stevens's death to [...] "acute barbiturate poisoning." ...|$|R
