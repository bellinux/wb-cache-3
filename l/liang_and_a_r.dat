40|$|Pectic polysaccharides solubilized in vivo during ripening, were {{isolated}} using phenol, acetic acid, and water (PAW) {{from the outer}} pericarp of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa [A. Chev. ] C. F. <b>Liang</b> <b>and</b> <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> Ferguson var deliciosa `Hayward') before and after postharvest ethylene treatment. Insoluble polysaccharides of the cell wall materials (CWMs) were solubilized in vitro by chemical extraction with 0. 05 molar cyclohexane-trans- 1, 2 -diamine tetraacetate (CDTA), 0. 05 molar Na 2 CO 3, 6 molar guanidinium thiocyanate, and 4 molar KOH. The Na 2 CO 3 -soluble fraction decreased by 26 %, and the CDTA-soluble fraction increased by 54 % 1 day after ethylene treatment. Concomitantly, {{an increase in the}} pectic polymer content of the PAW-soluble fraction occurred without loss of galactose from the cell wall. The molecular weight of the PAW-soluble pectic fraction 1 day after ethylene treatment was {{similar to that of the}} Na 2 CO 3 -soluble fraction before ethylene treatment. Four days after ethylene treatment, 60 % of cell wall polyuronide was solubilized, and 50 % of the galactose was lost from the CWM, but the degree of galactosylation and molecular weight of pectic polymers remaining in the CWMs did not decrease. The exception was the CDTA-soluble fraction which showed an apparent decrease in molecular weight during ripening. Concurrently, the PAW-soluble pectic fraction showed a 20 -fold reduction in molecular weight. The results suggest that considerable solubilization of the pectic polymers occurred during ripening without changes to their primary structure or degree of polymerization. Following solubilization, the polymers then became susceptible to depolymerization and degalactosidation. Pectolytic enzymes such as endopolygalacturonase and β-galactosidase were therefore implicated in the degradation of solubilized cell wall pectic polymers but not the initial solubilization of the bulk of the pectic polymers in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa, C. F. <b>Liang</b> <b>and</b> <b>A.</b> <b>R.</b> Ferguson) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{commercial}} varieties grown in New Zealand. The long shelf-life of the ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit along with its inherent properties such as flavour, colour, texture and high content of vitamin C has allowed the development of New Zealand kiwifruit exports. However, the quality of the fruit can be affected by factors such as storage time and temperature along the supply chains to different markets. This study investigated changes in physiochemical parameters of kiwifruit along three supply chains to Indian markets, as well as development of predictive mathematical models for the loss of flesh firmness and storage potential of ‘Hayward’ kiwifruit along the supply chains. At each analysis point along the three supply chains, the ‘On arrival’ and ‘At departure’ quality of twenty kiwifruit were analysed for flesh firmness (kgf), soluble solids content (% Brix) and core temperatures (°C). The variation in the environmental temperature during storage and transportation along the supply chains were recorded. Three firmness loss models: Simple Exponential, Boltzmann and Inverse Exponential Polynomial were used to characterise the flesh firmness data collected along each supply chain. Three storage potential models: Reciprocal, Power and Reciprocal Quadratic, were fitted to the flesh firmness and core temperature data collected along each supply chain. The Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) test was used to determine the most suitable model that characterised the flesh firmness loss along the supply chains. The flesh firmness decreased (P< 0. 05) in all the grower lines along the three supply chains, while the soluble solids content increased (P< 0. 05) with temperature variation during storage and transportation. The Simple Exponential model best characterised the firmness data collected along supply chains 1 and 3. Changes in flesh firmness of fruit along supply chain 2 were best characterised by the Boltzmann model. The Reciprocal model best fitted the data on flesh firmness and core temperature. The Power model was the second best storage potential model that characterised the data collected along the three supply chains. The developed storage potential models may be used to determine the shelf-life of kiwifruit along similar supply chains in other markets...|$|E
