40|$|The black poplar, Populus nigra L. (Salicaceae), grows {{predominantly}} along {{rivers and}} streams in Turkey. It is valuable because of its rapid growth and has been the tree chosen for plantations where a quick return on the investment was desired by growers.

40|$|We {{performed}} a ﬁeld trial {{to evaluate the}} response of different poplar clones to heavy metals. We found that poplar plants of the same clone, propagated by cuttings, had a marked variability of survival and growth in different zones of the ﬁeld that were characterized by very similar physical–chemical prosperities. Since metal uptake and its accumulation by plants can be affected by soil microorganisms, we investigated soil microbial populations that were collected in proximity {{to the roots of}} <b>large</b> and small <b>poplar</b> plants. We used microbiological and molecular tools to ascertain whether bacterial strains or species were associated with <b>large,</b> or small <b>poplars,</b> and whether these were different from those present in the bulk (without plants) soil. We found that the culturable fraction of the bacteria differed in the three cases (bulk soil, small or <b>large</b> <b>poplars).</b> While some taxa were always present, two species (Chryseobacterium soldanellicola and Variovorax paradoxus) were only found in the soil where <b>poplars</b> (<b>large</b> or small) were growing, independently from the plant size. Bacterial strains of the genus Flavobacterium were prevalent in the soil with <b>large</b> <b>poplar</b> plants. The existence of different microbial populations in the bulk and in the poplar grown soils was conﬁrmed by the DGGE proﬁles of the bacterial culturable fractions. Cluster analysis of the DGGE proﬁles highlighted the clear separation of the culturable fraction from the whole microbial community. The isolation and identiﬁcation of poplar-associated bacterial strains from the culturable fraction of the microbial community provided the basis for further studies aimed at the combined use of plants and soil microorganisms in the remediation of heavy metal polluted soils...|$|R

50|$|Poplar admiral {{habitat is}} {{widespread}} in continental Europe and many areas in Asia. The <b>large,</b> seldom-seen <b>poplar</b> admiral {{is one of}} the biggest butterflies in Europe. It is found in deciduous forests, where aspen (Populus tremula) or black poplar (Populus nigra) trees grow. This is because the caterpillar only eats the leaves of these species. At altitude, for instance in the Alps, where there are not large Populus forests, they accommodate with a grove, in the southeast of France they can be seen flying in large open spaces, for instance in the department of Alpes-Maritimes, as noted by Jacques Rigout. The males are easier to find. The females are rarer, because they tend to stay in the tops of the trees and seldom venture to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The Trysting Tree at Oregon State University, in the USA, was a <b>large</b> Gray <b>Poplar</b> (Populus × canescens) located {{southeast}} of Benton Hall, {{and was a}} popular gathering spot on campus. According to one story, George Coote, a faculty member in Horticulture, planted the tree between 1880 and 1885. An early alumnus claimed that the Trysting Tree was so named because of its [...] "magical effects on students, especially in springtime". The tree's popularity was such that the Board of Regents felt obliged to place two arc lights on the cupola of Benton Hall (then the administration building) [...] "to keep the tree from being overworked". On September 27, 1987, the original Trysting Tree was cut down because of advanced disease in its trunk and limbs. Prior to its removal, Jack Stang (Department of Horticulture) took several cuttings from the tree and rooted them.

40|$|Poplar is a {{suitable}} species for phytoremediation, able to tolerate {{high concentrations of}} heavy metals (HMs). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) form symbiotic associations with the roots of most land plants; they improve nutrient uptake and enhance phytoextraction of HMs while alleviating stress in the host plant. This review summarizes previous results from field and greenhouse studies conducted by us and dealing with this topic. In a field trial on a highly Zn- and Cu-contaminated site, differences in plant survival and growth were observed among 168 clones originating from natural populations of Populus alba L. and Populus nigra L. from northern Italy. After {{two and a half}} years from planting, the density, activity and metabolic versatility of the culturable fraction of the soil bacteria in the HM-polluted field was higher in the soil close to where <b>larger</b> <b>poplar</b> plants were growing, in spite of comparable HM concentrations recorded in these soils. One well-performing clone of P. alba (AL 35), which accumulated a higher concentration of both metals and had high foliar polyamine (PA) levels, was used for further investigation. In a greenhouse study, AL 35 cuttings pre-inoculated with AMF (Glomus mosseae or Glomus intraradices) and then transferred to pots containing soil, collected from the HM-polluted site, displayed growth comparable to that of controls grown on unpolluted soil, in spite of higher Cu and Zn accumulation. Such plants also showed an overall up-regulation of metallothionein (MT) and PA biosynthetic genes, together with increased PA levels. A genome-wide transcriptomic (cDNA-AFLP) analysis allowed the identification of a number of genes, mostly belonging to stress-related functional categories of defense and secondary metabolism, that were differentially regulated in mycorrhizal vs. non mycorrhizal plants. A proteomic analysis revealed that, depending on sampling time, changes in protein profiles were differentially affected by AMF and/or HMs. It is concluded that soil-borne microorganisms affect plant performance on HM-polluted soil. In particular, mycorrhizal plants exhibited increased capacity for phytostabilization of HMs, together with improved growth. Their greater stress tolerance may derive from the protective role of PAs, and from the strong modulation in the expression profiles of stress-related genes and proteins...|$|R

Therefore, the present study was performed to examine the effect of senescence poplar leaves on wheat germ and some other biochemical parameters.

Biochemical parameters, namely, pigment, carbohydrate, protein, and phenol content, were estimated. Activities of catalase and polyphenol oxidase which are stress marker enzymes were also measured.

40|$|The study {{determined}} the productivity, fuel consumption and product quality obtained {{with a new}} tractor-powered drum chipper, designed to reduce the gap between industrial chippers and small-scale chippers. The machine was tested with poplar logs and beech slabs, considered as representative of the raw material commonly used for energy wood production. After accounting for accessory work and delays, productivity of green chips ranged between 4 and 6 tons per scheduled machine hour, which was very good for a tractor-powered unit. Specific fuel consumption of oven-dry chips varied between 2. 5 and 3. 0 L per ton, or 0. 6 L per m 3. These figures compared favourably with those obtained from previous studies of both smaller and bigger chippers. Chip quality was very good. Samples contained no oversize particles, qualifying for use in small-scale plants.
