50|$|An {{arbitrary}} mechanical excitation {{applied to}} a plate will generate a multiplicity of Lamb waves carrying energy {{across a range of}} frequencies. Such is the case for the acoustic emission wave. In acoustic emission testing, the challenge is to recognize the multiple <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> components in the received waveform and to interpret them in terms of source motion. This contrasts with the situation in ultrasonic testing, where the first challenge is to generate a single, well-controlled <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> mode at a single frequency. But even in ultrasonic testing, mode conversion takes place when the generated <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> interacts with flaws, so the interpretation of reflected signals compounded from multiple modes becomes a means of flaw characterization.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{emission}} uses {{much lower}} frequencies than traditional ultrasonic testing, and the sensor is typically expected to detect active flaws at distances {{up to several}} meters. A large fraction of the structures customarily testing with acoustic emission are fabricated from steel plate - tanks, pressure vessels, pipes and so on. <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> theory is therefore the prime theory for explaining the signal forms and propagation velocities that are observed when conducting acoustic emission testing. Substantial improvements in the accuracy of AE source location (a major techniques of AE testing) can be achieved through good understanding and skillful utilization of the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> body of knowledge.|$|E
50|$|Particle {{motion in}} the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes is in general elliptical, having {{components}} both perpendicular to and parallel to {{the plane of the}} plate. These components are in quadrature, i.e. they have a 90° phase difference. The relative magnitude of the components is a function of frequency. For certain frequencies-thickness products, the amplitude of one component passes through zero so that the motion is entirely perpendicular or parallel to the plane of the plate. For particles on the plate surface, these conditions occur when the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> phase velocity is √2ct or for symmetric modes onlycl, respectively. These directionality considerations are important when considering the radiation of acoustic energy from plates into adjacent fluids.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Piezoelectric wafer active sensors (PWAS) are inexpensive, non-intrusive, {{unobtrusive}} {{devices that}} can be surface-mounted on existing structures or inserted between the layers of new composite structures. The PWAS {{can be used in}} both active and passive modes. PWAS generate and detect <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> and enable the development of embedded NDE concepts. This paper will present two embedded NDE concepts based on the PWAS technology and <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> approach. The first concept utilizes traveling <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> and could be described as embedded ultrasonics. It is shown that embedded PWAS are able to reproduce most of the conventional ultrasonic techniques, such as pitch-catch, pulse-echo, and phased array.

50|$|As the {{frequency}} is raised, the higher-order wave modes make their appearance {{in addition to}} the zero-order modes. Each higher-order mode is “born” at a resonant frequency of the plate, and exists only above that frequency. For example, in a ¾ inch (19mm) thick steel plate at a frequency of 200 kHz, the first four <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes are present and at 300 kHz, the first six. The first few higher-order modes can be distinctly observed under favorable experimental conditions. Under less than favorable conditions they overlap and can not be distinguished.|$|E
50|$|Lamb waves {{propagate}} {{in solid}} plates. They are elastic waves whose particle motion {{lies in the}} plane that contains the direction of wave propagation and the plate normal (the direction perpendicular to the plate). In 1917, the English mathematician Horace Lamb published his classic analysis and description of acoustic waves of this type. Their properties {{turned out to be}} quite complex. An infinite medium supports just two wave modes traveling at unique velocities; but plates support two infinite sets of <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes, whose velocities depend on the relationship between wavelength and plate thickness.|$|E

5000|$|... where n is any {{positive}} integer. Here c can {{be either}} the longitudinal wave velocity or the shear wave velocity, and for each resulting set of resonances the corresponding <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes are alternately symmetrical and antisymmetric. The interplay of these two sets results in a pattern of nascent frequencies that at first glance seems irregular. For example, in a 3/4 inch (19mm) thick steel plate having longitudinal and shear velocities of 5890 m/s and 3260 m/s respectively, the nascent frequencies of the antisymmetric modes a1 and a2 are 86 kHz and 310 kHz respectively, while the nascent frequencies of the symmetric modes s1, s2 and s3 are 155 kHz, 172 kHz and 343 kHz respectively.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{ultrasonic}} testing {{has been conducted}} with waves whose wavelength is very much shorter than the dimension of the part being inspected. In this high-frequency-regime, the ultrasonic inspector uses waves that approximate to the infinite-medium longitudinal and shear wave modes, zig-zagging to and from across {{the thickness of the}} plate. Although the <b>lamb</b> <b>wave</b> pioneers worked on nondestructive testing applications and drew attention to the theory, widespread use did not come about until the 1990s when computer programs for calculating dispersion curves and relating them to experimentally observable signals became much more widely available. These computational tools, along with a more widespread {{understanding of the nature of}} Lamb waves, made it possible to devise techniques for nondestructive testing using wavelengths that are comparable with or greater than the thickness of the plate. At these longer wavelengths the attenuation of the wave is less, so that flaws can be detected at greater distances.|$|E
5000|$|In reality we {{deal with}} finite plates, or plates wrapped into {{cylindrical}} pipes or vessels, or plates cut into thin strips, etc. <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> theory often gives a very good account {{of much of the}} wave behavior of such structures. It will not give a perfect account, and that is why the phrase [...] "Guided Lamb Waves" [...] is more practically relevant than [...] "Lamb Waves". One question is how the velocities and mode shapes of the Lamb-like waves will be influenced by the real geometry of the part. For example, the velocity of a Lamb-like wave in a thin cylinder will depend slightly on the radius of the cylinder and on whether the wave is traveling along the axis or round the circumference. Another question is what completely different acoustical behaviors and wave modes may be present in the real geometry of the part. For example, a cylindrical pipe has flexural modes associated with bodily movement of the whole pipe, quite different from the Lamb-like flexural mode of the pipe wall.|$|E

The problem of propagation of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> in a plate with an internal microstructure and loaded with an inviscid liquid on both sides is studied using the couple stress theory. The dispersion equation of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> with the liquid loadings is derived. The impact of the liquid loadings is studied on the propagation of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves.</b> The effect of the characteristic length is also studied on the phase velocity of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> in the plate for various modes in the presence of liquid loadings...|$|R

In this paper, the use of leaky <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> is considered for non-destructive testing (NDT) on parallel and immersed structures assimilated as plates. The first phase of our approach involved studying the propagation properties of leaky <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves.</b> Equations that model the propagation of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> in an immersed plate were solved numerically. The phase velocity can be experimentally measured using a two dimensional Fourier transform. The group velocity can be experimentally measured using a short-time Fourier transform technique.

40|$|AbstractA closed-form {{expression}} for the leading-order dispersion coefficient, describing {{the trend of}} Lamb-wave branches at their onset from thickness resonances, is derived for an arbitrary anisotropic plate. The sign of this coefficient and hence of the in-plane group velocity near cutoffs decides the existence or non-existence of the backward <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> without a necessity to calculate the dispersion branches. A link between the near-cutoff dispersion of <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> and the curvature of bulk-wave slowness curves in a sagittal plane is analyzed. It is established that a locally concave slowness curve of a bulk mode entails the backward <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> {{at the onset of}} branches emerging from this bulk mode resonances of high enough order. A simple sufficient condition for no backward <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> near the resonances associated with a convex slowness curve is also noted. Two special cases are discussed: the first involves the coupled resonances of degenerate bulk waves, and the second concerns quasi-degenerate resonances which give rise to pairs of dispersion branches with a quasilinear positive and negative onset. Occasions of the backward <b>Lamb</b> <b>waves</b> in isotropic plate materials are tabulated...|$|R
5000|$|While Lamb's {{analysis}} {{assumed a}} straight wavefront, {{it has been}} shown that the same characteristic equations apply to cylindrical plate waves (i.e. waves propagating outwards from a line source, the line lying perpendicular to the plate). The difference is that whereas the [...] "carrier" [...] for the straight wavefront is a sinusoid, the [...] "carrier" [...] for the axisymmetric wave is a Bessel function. The Bessel function takes care of the singularity at the source, then converges towards sinusoidal behavior at great distances. These cylindrical waves are the eigenfunctions from which the plate's response to point disturbances can be composed. Thus a plate's response to a point disturbance can be expressed as a combination of Lamb waves, plus evanescent terms in the near field. The overall result can be loosely visualized as a pattern of circular wavefronts, like ripples from a stone dropped into a pond but changing more profoundly in form as they progress outwards. It should be noted always that <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> theory relates only to motion in the (r,z) direction; transverse motion is a different topic.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} of these equations also reveals the precise {{form of the}} particle motion, which equations (1) and (2) represent in generic form only. It is found that equation (3) {{gives rise to a}} family of waves whose motion is symmetrical about the midplane of the plate (the plane z = 0), while equation (4) gives rise to a family of waves whose motion is antisymmetric about the midplane. Figure 1 illustrates a member of each family. Lamb’s characteristic equations were established for waves propagating in an infinite plate - a homogeneous, isotropic solid bounded by two parallel planes beyond which no wave energy can propagate. In formulating his problem, Lamb confined the components of particle motion to the direction of the plate normal (z-direction) and the direction of wave propagation (x-direction). By definition, Lamb waves have no particle motion in the y-direction. Motion in the y-direction in plates is found in the so-called SH or shear-horizontal wave modes. These have no motion in the x- or z-directions, and are thus complementary to the <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> modes. These two are the only wave types which can propagate with straight, infinite wave fronts in a plate as defined above.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relationship}} between velocity and frequency (or wavelength) {{is inherent in}} the characteristic equations. In the case of the plate, these equations are not simple and their solution requires numerical methods. This was an intractable problem until the advent of the digital computer forty years after Lamb's original work. The publication of computer-generated [...] "dispersion curves" [...] by Viktorov in the former Soviet Union, Firestone followed by Worlton in the United States, and eventually many others brought <b>Lamb</b> <b>wave</b> theory into the realm of practical applicability. Experimental waveforms observed in plates can be understood by interpretation with reference to the dispersion curves. Dispersion curves - graphs that show relationships between wave velocity, wavelength and frequency in dispersive systems - can be presented in various forms. The form that gives the greatest insight into the underlying physics has [...] (angular frequency) on the y-axis and k (wave number) on the x-axis. The form used by Viktorov, that brought Lamb waves into practical use, has wave velocity on the y-axis and , the thickness/wavelength ratio, on the x-axis. The most practical form of all, for which credit is due to J. and H. Krautkrämer as well as to Floyd Firestone (who, incidentally, coined the phrase [...] "Lamb waves") has wave velocity on the y-axis and fd, the frequency-thickness product, on the x-axis.|$|E
