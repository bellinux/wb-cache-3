5|$|In 1993, Ryder {{offered a}} reward {{in the hope}} that it would lead to the return of kidnapped child Polly Klaas. Klaas lived in Petaluma, the same town where Ryder grew up. Ryder offered a $200,000 reward for the 12-year-old kidnap victim's safe return. After the girl's death, Ryder starred as Jo in the 1994 film {{adaptation}} of <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> by Louisa May Alcott and dedicated her performance to Klaas's memory. <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> was one of Klaas's favorite novels.|$|E
5|$|Belle's {{strength}} {{and love of}} reading was inspired by American actress Katharine Hepburn's performance as Jo March in the film <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (1933), while the writers instilled the adventure-seeking heroine with goals and aspirations beyond romance. However, the story artists and animators often disagreed with Woolverton's liberated vision for the character. Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas' ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of <b>Little</b> <b>Women.</b> There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and was delighted to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{took over}} as {{production}} head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: Morning Glory (1933), for which she won her first Oscar, and <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress. Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade. Ginger Rogers had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and cast her in the big-budget musical Flying Down to Rio (1933). Rogers was paired with Astaire, making his movie debut. Billed fourth and fifth respectively, the picture turned them into stars. Hermes Pan, assistant to the film's dance director, {{would become one of}} Hollywood's leading choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire.|$|E
5|$|Having played diverse {{roles in}} many well-received {{films in the}} mid to late 1980s and early 1990s, Ryder won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award {{nomination}} in the same category for her role in The Age of Innocence (1993), as well as another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her role in the literary adaptation of <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> the following year. She later appeared in the Generation X hit Reality Bites (1994), Alien Resurrection (1997), the Woody Allen comedy Celebrity (1998), and Girl, Interrupted (1999), which she also executive-produced. In 2000, Ryder received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, honoring her legacy in the film industry.|$|E
25|$|A Long Fatal Love Chase is a {{suspense}} {{novel by}} Louisa May Alcott. She wrote it in 1866, {{two years before}} the publication of <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (1868) finally established her literary reputation and began to resolve her financial problems. The manuscript remained unpublished until 1995.|$|E
60|$|There was a <b>little</b> <b>woman</b> on board, with {{a little}} baby; and both <b>little</b> <b>woman</b> and <b>little</b> child were cheerful, good-looking, bright- eyed, and fair to see.

He has recorded many new works with Houston Grand Opera: Mark Adamo's <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (Ondine, 2002), Daniel Catán's Florencia en el Amazonas (Albany, 2002), Carlisle Floyd's Cold Sassy Tree (Albany, 2005) and Of Mice and Men (Albany, 2003), Jake Heggie's Dead Man Walking (Virgin Classics, 2012) and Three Decembers (Albany, 2008), Tod Machover's Resurrection (Albany, 2002), André Previn's Brief Encounter (Deutsche Grammophon, 2011), and Christopher Theofanidis's The Refuge (Albany, 2007). On DVD and Blu-ray Disc, releases include Bellini's I puritani (Deutsche Grammophon, 2008), Puccini's Madama Butterfly (Sony, 2011), and Richard Strauss's Salome (Sony, 2011) all with the Metropolitan Opera; Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro (2011) with Opera Australia; Rossini's La Cenerentola (Decca, 2010) with the Gran Teatre del Liceu; and Mark Adamo's <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (Naxos, 2010) with Houston Grand Opera.

25|$|Duffy {{is also a}} playwright, and has had plays {{performed}} at the Liverpool Playhouse and the Almeida Theatre in London. Her plays include Take My Husband (1982), Cavern of Dreams (1984), <b>Little</b> <b>Women,</b> Big Boys (1986) Loss (1986), Casanova (2007). Her radio credits include an adaptation of Rapture. Her children's collections include Meeting Midnight (1999) and The Oldest Girl in the World (2000). She also collaborated with the Manchester composer, Sasha Johnson Manning, on The Manchester Carols, a series of Christmas songs that premiered in Manchester Cathedral in 2007.|$|E
25|$|A common trend {{throughout}} the 20th century, in both opera and general orchestral repertoire, {{is the use}} of smaller orchestras as a cost-cutting measure; the grand Romantic-era orchestras with huge string sections, multiple harps, extra horns, and exotic percussion instruments were no longer feasible. As government and private patronage of the arts decreased {{throughout the}} 20th century, new works were often commissioned and performed with smaller budgets, very often resulting in chamber-sized works, and short, one-act operas. Many of Benjamin Britten's operas are scored for as few as 13 instrumentalists; Mark Adamo's two-act realization of <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> is scored for 18 instrumentalists.|$|E

In addition, DiDonato gave a recital at New York's Morgan Library {{under the auspices of the}} George London Foundation and sang the mezzo-soprano solos in the Seattle Symphony's production of Handel's Messiah.|$|E
25|$|Bale {{starred in}} the musical films Newsies and Swing Kids, the latter about {{teenagers}} who secretly listened to forbidden jazz during the rise of Nazi Germany. Bale was recommended by actress Winona Ryder to star in Gillian Armstrong's 1994 film <b>Little</b> <b>Women.</b> Bale also voiced Thomas, a young compatriot of Captain John Smith, in Disney's Pocahontas (1995) and in 1997 played Arthur Stuart in Velvet Goldmine, Todd Haynes' tribute to glam rock. In 1999, Bale contributed to an all-star cast, including Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer, Stanley Tucci, and Rupert Everett, portraying Demetrius in {{an updated version of}} William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
25|$|On January 12, 1940, Bennett and Walter Wanger {{were married}} in Phoenix. They were {{divorced}} in September 1965 in Mexico. They had two children together, Stephanie Wanger (born June 26, 1943) and Shelley Wanger (born July 4, 1948). The following year on March 13, 1949, she became a grandmother at age 39, similar to her co-star Elizabeth Taylor who became a grandmother at the same age (she and Taylor also shared a February 27 birthday, and each gave birth {{to one of their}} children on their birthdays. They also played Amy March in <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> - Bennett in the 1933 RKO version; Taylor in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer remake in 1949.).|$|E

25|$|Bennett left Fox to play Amy, a pert sister {{competing}} with Katharine Hepburn's Jo in <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (1933), which {{was directed by}} George Cukor for RKO. This movie brought Bennett {{to the attention of}} independent film producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a contract and began managing her career. She played the role of Sally MacGregor, a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity, in Private Worlds (1935) with Joel McCrea. She starred in the film Vogues of 1938 (1937), including the title sequence, where she donned a diamond and platinum bracelet set with the Star of Burma ruby. Wanger and director Tay Garnett persuaded Bennett to change her hair from blonde to brunette as part of the plot for her role as Kay Kerrigan in the scenic Trade Winds (1938) opposite Fredric March.|$|E

500|$|Hepburn's second {{film was}} Christopher Strong (1933), {{the story of}} an aviator and her affair with a married man. The picture was not commercially successful, but Hepburn's reviews were good. Regina Crewe wrote in the Journal American that {{although}} her mannerisms were grating, [...] "they compel attention, and they fascinate an audience. She is a distinct, definite, positive personality." [...] Hepburn's third picture confirmed her as a major actress in Hollywood. For playing aspiring actress Eva Lovelace—a role intended for Constance Bennett—in Morning Glory, she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She had seen the script on the desk of producer Pandro S. Berman and, convinced that she was born to play the part, insisted that the role be hers. Hepburn chose not to attend the awards ceremony—as she would not for the duration of her career—but was thrilled with the win. Her success continued with the role of Jo in the film <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> (1933). The picture was a hit, one of the film industry's biggest successes to date, and Hepburn won the Best Actress prize at the Venice Film Festival. <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> was one of Hepburn's personal favorites and she was proud of her performance, later saying, [...] "I defy anyone to be as good [...] as I was".|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Ryder {{played the}} lead role of Josephine March in <b>Little</b> <b>Women,</b> an {{adaptation}} of Louisa May Alcott's novel. The film received widespread praise; critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of the novel, and remarked on Ryder's performance: [...] "Ms. Ryder, whose banner year also includes a fine comic performance in 'Reality Bites', plays Jo with spark and confidence. Her spirited presence gives the film an appealing linchpin, and she plays the self-proclaimed 'man of the family' {{with just the right}} staunchness." [...] She received a Best Actress Oscar nomination the following year.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1994, Dunst co-starred in {{the drama}} film <b>Little</b> <b>Women</b> {{opposite}} Winona Ryder and Claire Danes. The film received favorable reviews. Critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film was the greatest adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel {{of the same name}} and remarked on Dunst's performance, [...] "The perfect contrast to take-charge Jo comes from Kirsten Dunst's scene-stealing Amy, whose vanity and twinkling mischief make so much more sense coming from an 11-year-old vixen than they did from grown-up Joan Bennett in 1933. Ms. Dunst, also scarily effective as the baby bloodsucker of Interview With the Vampire, is a little vamp with a big future." ...|$|E
