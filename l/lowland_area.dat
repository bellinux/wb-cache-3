5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive <b>lowland</b> <b>area.</b> Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Unlike mountainous <b>areas,</b> <b>lowland</b> <b>areas</b> {{have limited}} {{potential}} to generate energy from water flows. Instead, for water systems in <b>lowland</b> <b>areas</b> that continuously need to pump {{water out of}} the system, the focus should be set to saving energy in the present water management. This paper gives an introduction into possibilities to manage water systems in <b>lowland</b> <b>areas</b> in a sustainable manner. An example of an energy saving method is presented that is implemented by means of model predictive control on an actual physical large pumping station in The Netherlands. I...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the impacts}} of natural {{disaster}} {{are more and more}} severe on coastal <b>lowland</b> <b>areas.</b> With the threats of climate change and sea level rise, the reduction of natural disasters in coastal <b>lowland</b> <b>areas</b> receives increased attention. Based on a number of literature sources, this paper summarizes the categories and characteristic of natural disasters emerging in coastal <b>lowland</b> <b>areas,</b> such as windstorm and storm surge, tropical cyclones and tropical cyclone winds, tsunamis and floods, and analyzes the most devastating natural disasters in coastal lowland throughout the world in 2005. This paper also summarizes the effects of typhoons on the coastal <b>lowland</b> <b>areas</b> of China in 2005 and analyzes the natural disaster mitigation measures and research results. Finally, the paper discusses the vulnerability assessment and response strategies for natural disasters...|$|R

25|$|The natural {{vegetation}} of the Faroe Islands {{is dominated by}} arctic-alpine plants, wildflowers, grasses, moss and lichen. Most of the <b>lowland</b> <b>area</b> is grassland and some is heath, dominated by shrubby heathers, mainly Calluna vulgaris.

25|$|The largest <b>lowland</b> <b>area</b> {{is located}} in the south of the {{province}} along the lower Côn River. It encompasses much of Quy Nhơn City, the districts of Tuy Phước, An Nhơn, the western part of Phù Cát, and the eastern part of Tây Sơn. Given its size, and the access to a major port as well as Bình Định's major river, it has long been the place where most of Bình Định's people and economic activities concentrate. It was the site of Vijaya, one of the major city-states of Champa. The majority Bình Định's population lives in the districts around this plain.|$|E

25|$|In {{the west}} of the country, these {{lowlands}} consist of a broad, hot, fertile plain. Punctuating this plain are several large volcanoes of the Cordillera Los Maribios mountain range, including Mombacho just outside Granada, and Momotombo near León. The <b>lowland</b> <b>area</b> runs from the Gulf of Fonseca to Nicaragua's Pacific border with Costa Rica south of Lake Nicaragua. Lake Nicaragua is the largest freshwater lake in Central America (20th largest in the world), and is home to some of the world's rare freshwater sharks (Nicaraguan shark). The Pacific lowlands region is the most populous, with over half of the nation's population.|$|E
25|$|South Korea has no {{extensive}} plains; its lowlands are {{the product}} of mountain erosion. Approximately 30 percent of the area of South Korea consists of lowlands, with the rest consisting of uplands and mountains. The great majority of the <b>lowland</b> <b>area</b> lies along the coasts, particularly the west coast, and along the major rivers. The most important lowlands are the Han River plain around Seoul, the Pyeongtaek coastal plain southwest of Seoul, the Geum River basin, the Nakdong River basin, and the Yeongsan River and the Honam plains in the southwest. A narrow littoral plain extends along the east coast.|$|E

It consists {{of a series of}} beels connected to one another by various channels to form a continuous water body during the rainy season. Although the beel area expands into a vast water body with dense aquatic vegetation as long as the Jamuna remains flooded during the monsoon months, it dries out in the winter months, leaving only patches of water in the central parts of this zone.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the major}} tributaries of the Kobuk River flow from the north, {{draining}} the mountains in the southern Brooks Range. From east to west, these include the Reed River, Beaver Creek, Mauneluk River, Kogoluktuk River, Shungnak River, Ambler River, Akillik River, Tutuksuk River, Salmon River, and the Squirrel River. Within Kobuk Valley National Park, are the Kallarichuk, Kaliguricheark, and Adillik rivers. All of their headwaters are in the Baird Mountains. The major tributaries flowing north from the Waring Mountains are the Pah River, Pick River, and Niaktuvik Creek. The Pah River drains a <b>lowland</b> <b>area</b> of the basin. Most major tributaries draining high relief areas have higher unit runoff than tributaries draining the lower relief areas.|$|E
25|$|The <b>lowland</b> <b>area</b> of Cavite is {{generally}} composed of Guadalupe clay and clay loam. It is characterized as coarse and granular when dry but sticky and plastic when wet. Its substratum is solid volcanic tuff. These types of soils are suited to lowland rice and corn while {{those in the}} upland are suited for orchard and pasture. Guadalupe clay adobes are abundant {{in the southern part}} of Bacoor and Imus bordering Dasmariñas. The soil is hard and compact and difficult to cultivate that makes it generally unsuitable for diverse cropping. It is very sticky when wet and granular when dry. Forage grass is advised for this type of soil. Hydrosol and Obando sand are found along Bacoor Bay. The shoreline of Rosario, Tanza, Naic and Ternate are lined with Guadalupe sand.|$|E
