40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} aimed at obtaining {{detailed}} information about the interaction of NaCl salinity and elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration in the halophyte S. salsa, which was irrigated with five different salinity levels under ambient and elevated (530 ppm) CO 2. The results show that total soluble sugar concentration was significantly increased by salt-treatments in both <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots, and that the most progressive sugar increments were observed in <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots of S. salsa under the elevated CO 2. The Na concentration in the <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots increased with the increased NaCl concentration, the K accumulation gradually decreaed by increasing salinity levels in <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots. Proline increased in response to salt stress along with incremental NaCl concentration. The GB concentrations of leaves were significantly raised as NaCl levels increased. Electrolyte leakage increased in the leaves of S. salsa grown under NaCl stress. ψs of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots decreased as the NaCl concentration increase, and that elevated CO 2 both had markedly greater effects on ψs of <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots. The osmotic adjustment values ascended with elevated CO 2 concentration in both <b>leaves</b> <b>and</b> roots...|$|R
