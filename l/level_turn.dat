50|$|When an {{airplane}} is {{in a small}} to moderate bank (roll angle) {{a small amount of}} 'back pressure' is required to maintain height. This is required because the lift vector, which would be pointing vertically upwards in level flight, is now angled inwards so some of the lift is turning the aircraft. A higher overall amount of lift is required so that the vertical component remains sufficient for a <b>level</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although washout filters {{do provide}} great utility for {{allowing}} the simulation {{of a wider}} range of conditions than the physical capabilities of a motion platform, there are limitations to their performance and practicality in simulation applications. Washout filters take advantage of the limitations of human sensing to the appearance of a larger simulation environment than actually exists. For example, a pilot in a motion simulator may execute a steady, <b>level</b> <b>turn</b> {{for an extended period of}} time which would require the system stay at the associated bank angle. In this situation, a washout filter allows the system to slowly move back to an equilibrium position at a rate below the threshold which the pilot can detect. The benefit of this is that the motion system now has a greater range of motion available for when the pilot executes his next maneuver.|$|E

50|$|Washout {{filters are}} an {{important}} aspect of the implementation of motion platforms as they allow motion systems, with their limited range of motion, to simulate the range of vehicle dynamics being simulated. Since the human vestibular system automatically re-centers itself during steady motions, washout filters are used to suppress unnecessary low-frequency signals while returning the simulator back to a neutral position at accelerations below the threshold of human perception. For example, a pilot in a motion simulator may execute a steady, <b>level</b> <b>turn</b> {{for an extended period of}} time which would require the system stay at the associated bank angle, but a washout filter allows the system to slowly move back to an equilibrium position at a rate below the threshold which the pilot can detect. This allows the higher level dynamics of the computed vehicle to provide realistic cues for human perception, while remaining within the limitations of the simulator.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{methodology}} using bifurcation analysis and nonlinear control techniques to design aircraft maneuvers. As an illustrative example, maneuvering of an aircraft from a steady level flight to <b>level</b> <b>turn</b> flights is attempted. A constrained bifurcation analysis based procedure is {{used to determine the}} level flight and <b>level</b> <b>turn</b> steady states for an F- 18 /HARV model. Using the available states from bifurcation analysis results as setpoints, a Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) technique based controller is designed to perform the closed loop simulation of a constant speed, level, coordinated turn maneuver from a straight and level flight to the maximum sustained turn rate flight conditions. Successful implementation of the technique while satisfying the prescribed constraints shows usefulness of the approach...|$|E

40|$|With the advancements in the {{computing}} power of personal computers, pc-based flight simulators and trainers have opened new avenues {{in the training}} of airplane pilots. It may be desirable to have the flight simulator make a quantitative evaluation of the progress of a pilot's training thereby reducing the physical requirement of the flight instructor who must, in turn, watch every flight. In an experiment, University students conducted six different flights, each consisting of two <b>level</b> <b>turns.</b> The flights were three minutes in duration. By evaluating videotapes, two certified flight instructors provided separate letter grades for each <b>turn.</b> These <b>level</b> <b>turns</b> were also evaluated using two other computer based grading methods. One method determined automated grades based on prescribed tolerances in bank angle, airspeed and altitude. The other method used was deviations in altitude and bank angle for performance index and performance grades...|$|R

The UAV mission is made of elementary trajectories, where we can differentiate two types of these: 'trimming' trajectories or configurations, such as rectilinear straight and <b>level</b> <b>turn</b> flights, and 'nontrimming' trajectories, when the UAV leaves a trim configuration to reach another. After definition of the constraints of under-actuation, we study two examples of nontrim trajectories, for this we consider two essential maneuvers: the change in the flight path angle during a symmetrical flight, and the transition between a straight-level flight and a horizontal turn in nonsymmetrical mode...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We use {{a sample}} of 14 OECD {{countries}} to test for the effect of trade on productivity {{at different levels of}} aggregation: {{a sample of}} 15 manufacturing industries, aggregate manufacturing, services, and the total economy. Endogeneity concerns are accounted for using the geographical component of trade as instrument as suggested by Frankel and Romer (1999). We find that trade increases productivity, even if country-fixed effects such as the quality of institutions are controlled for. Estimates at the aggregate manufacturing <b>level</b> <b>turn</b> out much larger, emphasizing the role of inter- industry spillovers. We cannot identify, however, important spillover effects between manufacturing and services. The aggregate estimates suggest that an increase in openness by 1 percent raises productivity by 0. 2 percent...|$|E
