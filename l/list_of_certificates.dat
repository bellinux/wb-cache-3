40|$|Certificate {{revocation}} is {{a challenging}} task, especiallyin mobile network environments such as vehicular ad Hoc networks (VANETs). According to the IEEE 1609. 2 security standard for VANETs, public keyinfrastructure (PKI) will provide this functionality by means <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> revocation <b>lists</b> (CRLs). When a certificate authority (CA) needs to revoke a certificate, itglobally distributes CRLs. Transmitting these lists pose {{a problem as}} they require high update frequencies {{and a lot of}} bandwidth. In this article, we propose BECSI, aBandwidth Efficient Certificate Status Informationmechanism to efficiently distributecertificate status information (CSI) in VANETs. By means of Merkle hash trees (MHT), BECSI allowsto retrieve authenticated CSI not onlyfrom the infrastructure but also from vehicles actingas mobile repositories. Since these MHTs are significantly smaller than the CRLs, BECSIreduces the load on the CSI repositories and improves the response time for the vehicles. Additionally, BECSI improves the freshness of the CSIby combining the use of delta-CRLs with MHTs. Thus, vehicles that have cached the most current CRLcan download delta-CRLs to have a complete <b>list</b> <b>of</b> revoked <b>certificates.</b> Once a vehicle has the whole <b>list</b> <b>of</b> revoked <b>certificates,</b> it can act as mobile repository...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} problem <b>of</b> {{efficiently}} revoking <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> malicious and compromised nodes in vehicular networks. As in previous work, our focus {{is making sure that}} vehicles receive the new <b>list</b> <b>of</b> revoked <b>certificates</b> (CRL) before they can be compromised. Unlike previous solutions, our work revolves around the idea of making use of existing capabilities offered by mobile network operators to improve the efficiency of the distribution of the CRL. Our proposed solution gathers positions and headings of vehicles using a location service enabler. Based on that information, the infrastructure can decide when and in which areas to broadcast the incremental CRL using any of the existing technologies such as the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS). Our simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms existing solutions based on the use of Road-side Units (RSUs) for disseminating CRLs. The improvement in terms of distribution delay and number of compromised nodes is noticeably better as the density of vehicles decreases...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this chapter, {{we present}} several {{authentication}} methods {{that have been}} proposed for WMNs. These authentication methods can be classified into three different types. First, the PSK authentication methods rely on a shared secret between two STAs or between an STA and an AS. In the first case, STA has to store a password or a PSK for each of its peer STAs, while in the second case STA has {{to pass through the}} AS each time it authenticates to another STA. The second type of authentication is the certificate-based authentication. It relies on the use <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> and requires the heavy deployment of a public key infrastructure (PKI) that is controlled by a CA. In general, the management <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> in wireless environments is a cumbersome task because it requires the definition <b>of</b> a <b>certificate</b> management policy to control the generation, transmission, and revocation <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b> That is, the network STAs will have to periodically download a certificate revocation list (CRL) in order to update their local <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> revoked <b>certificates</b> and expired keys. However, the CRL request and response messages are bandwidth consuming. Finally, the third type of authentication relies on IBC. IBC seems to be a well-suited solution for authentication issues related to WMN. Indeed, IBC permits the use of public key cryptography with no need for certificates and PKI deployment, as keys are directly derived from nodes identities. However, IBC algorithms, especially those relying on pairing functions, are less efficient in terms of time compared to classical encryption and signature algorithms (e. g., DES, AES, RSA, ECDSA, ElGamal) ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} project {{management}} certifications.

The main objective is to make a cross-section area <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> in the Czech market, create a a summary of available certifications and perform research, which chats certifications of companies carving out on bussines within the Czech ICT market. The thesis is divided into several parts. The first part is based on the theoretical foundations and was set up as an introduction to project management. Futher are particularly detailed project management competencies like an object of knowledge and skills, that are required to perform manager's work.

5000|$|The purpose <b>of</b> a <b>certificate</b> {{authority}} in the conventional SSL system is to vouch for {{the identity of a}} site, by checking its SSL certificate. Without some vouchsafing, one is open to a man-in-the-middle attack. A single site is vouched for by only a single certificate authority (CA), and this CA has to be trusted by the user. Web browsers typically include a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> default trusted <b>certificate</b> authorities, and display a warning about an [...] "untrusted connection" [...] when a site cannot be vouchsafed by a trusted CA. A problem with this system is that if a user (or browser vendor) loses trust in a CA, removing the CA from the browser's <b>list</b> <b>of</b> trusted authorities means losing trust in all the sites that used that CA. This happened when major browsers lost trust in the DigiNotar CA and sites registered with this CA had to get new certificate authorities (see Certificate authority#CA compromise for more examples of trust breaches).|$|R
40|$|Certificate status {{validation}} {{is a hard}} {{problem in}} general but it is particularly complex in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) because we require solutions to manage both the lack of fixed infrastructure inside the MANET and the possible absence of connectivity to trusted authorities when the certification validation has to be performed. In this sense, certificate acquisition is usually assumed as an initialization phase. However, certificate validation is a critical operation since the node needs to check the validity <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> in real-time, that is, when a particular certificate {{is going to be}} used. In such MANET environments, it may happen that the node is placed {{in a part of the}} network that is disconnected from the source of status data at the moment the status checking is required. Proposals in the literature suggest the use of caching mechanisms so that the node itself or a neighbour node has some status checking material (typically on-line status responses or <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> revoked <b>certificates).</b> However, to the best of our knowledge the only criterion to evaluate the cached (obsolete) material is the time. In this paper, we analyse how to deploy a certificate status checking PKI service for hybrid MANET and we propose a new criterion based on risk to evaluate cached status data that is much more appropriate and absolute than time because it takes into account the revocation process.

40|$|In a subscription-based remote service, a user {{is charged}} a flat fee {{for a period}} of time {{independent}} of the actual number of times the service is requested. The main concern of the service manager is to make sure that only customers that have paid the fee for the current period are granted access to the service. To do this, the service manager might give each user a username and a password to be used for accessing the service. An SSL/TLS (Security Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) session is started each time a user requests the service. As a part of the handshake protocol of SSL/TLS, the user hands a certificate to the server and proves to be the legitimate owner <b>of</b> the <b>certificate.</b> Then, the server application matches the <b>certificate</b> against a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> qualified <b>certificates</b> and decides whether to grant access. The most time-consuming phase of the SSL/TLS security protocol is the handshaking process between the client and the server, since many messages should be sent until successful negotiation is done and a secure session is created. In this paper we introduce a security management system in order to: 1) improve the handshaking process by making use of SSL/TLS client-side session caching, and 2) allowing trusted users to share sessions with others. According to our experimental setup, the proposed enhancement of SSL/TLS has improved its performance relative to the corresponding traditional handshaking of SSL/TLS protocol...|$|R
