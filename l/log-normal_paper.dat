A computer program carries out all the calculations...|$|R

This <b>paper</b> undertakes {{a comparison of the}} suitability of the log-hyperbolic and log-normal distributions in describing the textural characteristics of desert-dune sediments. A statistical analysis of the results shows that no apparent gain is obtained when using the parameters of the log-hyperbolic distribution to describe such sediments...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in the study of firm size distributions and firm growth rate distributions. The stochastic firm growth approach builds on the assumption that firm growth rates are independent identically distributed and size is determined by a first order autoregressive process leaving the size distribution <b>log-normal.</b> This <b>paper</b> analyzes these distributional patterns in an empirical context questioning the foundation of the stochastic growth approach. In a cross section analysis of four industries using Danish data it is shown that the foundation for and the outcome of the stochastic firm growth process as it has so far been conceived are empirically far-fetched. In particular significant deviations from normality are found with respect to third and fourth moments. Firm Growth Rate and Size Distributions, Evolution of Industries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the pricing of contingent claims using an approach developed {{and used in}} insurance pricing. The approach is of interest and signi…cance because of the increased integration of insurance and …nancial markets and also because insurance related risks are trading in …nancial markets {{as a result of}} securitisation and new contracts on futures exchanges. This approach uses probability distortion functions as the dual of the utility functions used in …nancial theory. The pricing formula {{is the same as the}} Black-Scholes formula for contingent claims when the underlying asset price is <b>log-normal.</b> The <b>paper</b> compares the probability distortion function approach with that based on …nancial theory. The theory underlying the approaches is set out and limitations on the use of the insurance based approach are illustrated. We extend the probability distortion approach to the pricing of contingent claims for more general assumptions than those used for Black-Scholes option pricing. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} issues in economics is the study of industrial dynamics and evolution. Firm size distributions are central when analyzing market structures. The intimate relationship between the firm growth process and the emanating market structures demands attention to firm size distributions and firm growth rate distributions. The stochastic firm growth approach builds on the firm growth rates being normally distributed and size being determined by a first order autoregressive process leaving the size distribution <b>log-normal.</b> The <b>paper</b> analyses these distributional pattern in an impirical context questioning the foundation of the stochastic growth approach. In a cross section analysis of four industries it is shown that neither the foundation nor the outcome of the stochastic firm growth process is empirical regularities. By testing growth rates and log(Size) for normality, reviewing their moments and looking at the plotted data an alternative interpretation is put forward. This interpretation mainly gives reference to industrial evolution, limited effect of heterogeneity on growth rates and the level of disaggregation...|$|R
40|$|The {{separation}} of the desirable parts of a medicinal plant in air flow is a widely applied procedure. Therefore there has been established the goal to measure flow characteristics of sage (Salvia officinalis L.) and peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) leaves. Leaves were picked from stem and classified according to dimensions in four (sage) and three (peppermint) fractions. The description of fraction collectives according to dimensions, after either manual or laboratory screen sorting, and data entering into <b>log-normal</b> distribution <b>paper,</b> is given by median and standard deviation. The flow characteristics defined by the air velocity of fluidization of a material layer show the possibility of separating sage leaves and stems, due to {{a significant difference in}} velocity values, 1. 75 m s" 1 maximum for leaves and 3. 35 m s" 1 for stems. Due the difference in flow characteristics the {{separation of}} different peppermint leaves fractions is also possible. The values of air velocity of fluidization for large peppermint leaves and stems were not significantly different, 3. 50 m s* 1 and 4. 18 m s", respectively. Therefore, for their separation, a machine with more homogenous air velocity field is required...|$|R

However, little is known about how big they are, how they grow over time, what are the distribution of the contribution among their users or the popularity of their contents. This paper is a first step to measure these operational aspects of Learning Object Repositories and Referatories through a series of quantitative analysis. Measuring key aspects of the production and consumption of Learning Objects is a new sub-field of Informetrics that we call “Learnometrics”. The analyses are performed on current data from widely used LOR’s. The results confirm some long held beliefs, but also point out some new issues: LORs grow linearly, contribution distribution follows a power law and popularity of objects follows a <b>log-normal</b> distribution. The <b>paper</b> discusses the implications of these findings for the LOR community. 1...|$|R
40|$|Safford Valley, Arizona obtains {{irrigation}} {{water from a}} combination of surface water and ground water. Sometimes during the summer both surface and ground water are not enough for crop demands. Ground water is very high in dissolved solids. Every year approximately 200, 000 tons of dissolved solids are deposited on the crop lands in the {{irrigation water}}. The total annual irrigation water requirement in the valley, as estimated by the Blaney-Criddle method, is 241, 000 acre-feet. Diverted water plus pumpage is 210, 000 acre-ft. per year. Total net annual water use in the valley, as estimated by a water budget equation, is 107, 000 acre-ft. Diverted plus pumped water less the net volume of water • represents water lost to seepage from the valley. Historical data records were used to generate data by a lag-one Markov process using statistical parameters from five different periods. The generated data were then used to estimate storage capacity of a proposed reservoir by flow-mass curve analysis. The 100 -year flood was estimated by flood frquency analysis using three different frequency distributions. The extreme flood, as plotted on Gumbel, arithmetic and <b>log-normal</b> probability <b>paper</b> was found to be 78, 000, 75, 000 and 126, 000 cubic feet per second (cfs), respectively. Three water management alternatives were suggested for the purpose of improving water use in the basin. The alternative that was more efficient in irrigation practices was recommended...|$|R
