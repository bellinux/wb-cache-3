5|$|The {{ejection}} seat is {{a version of}} the ACES II (Advanced Concept Ejection Seat) commonly used in USAF aircraft, with a center-mounted ejection control. The F-22 has a complex <b>life</b> <b>support</b> system, which includes the on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS), protective pilot garments, and a breathing regulator/anti-g (BRAG) valve controlling flow and pressure to the pilot's mask and garments. The pilot garments were developed under the Advanced Technology Anti-G Suit (ATAGS) project and are to protect against chemical/biological hazards and cold-water immersion, counter g-forces and low pressure at high altitudes, and provide thermal relief. Suspicions regarding the performance of the OBOGS and <b>life</b> <b>support</b> equipment have been raised by several mishaps, including a fatal crash.|$|E

5|$|While in Lexington for a {{deposition}} on May 26, 2002, Wilkinson began to experience chest pains and {{was admitted to}} St. Joseph's Hospital. Doctors diagnosed him with arterial blockages and scheduled him for arterial bypass surgery. Before the surgery could be performed, however, doctors discovered another lymphatic mass. Wilkinson began taking chemotherapy, and doctors removed the mass on June 4, 2002. Wilkinson was placed on <b>life</b> <b>support</b> on June 26, 2002. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002. Wilkinson had previously instructed his family not to continue <b>life</b> <b>support</b> after all hope of recovery was gone; accordingly, they decided to withdraw <b>life</b> <b>support,</b> and Wilkinson died on July 5, 2002. He was originally buried at Blue Grass Memorial Gardens in Nicholasville, Kentucky. In August 2002, his coffin was moved to a locked mausoleum at Sarasota Memorial Park in Sarasota, Florida; the family chose July 4, 2002 as the date of death for his marker.

5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, Type III and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced <b>Life</b> <b>Support</b> and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic <b>life</b> <b>support</b> and transfer of patients. The Type III is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate <b>life</b> <b>support</b> (ILS), rapid cardiac defibrillation, emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced <b>life</b> <b>support</b> (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{emergency}} escape hatches {{of refuge}} cabin are usually installed in {{both sides of}} the <b>life</b> <b>supporting</b> compartment, which might cause the toxic gases or water enter into <b>life</b> <b>supporting</b> compartment when the gas explosion and water inrush accident occur. A new type of refuge cabin structure that can effectively resist the toxic gases and water entering the <b>life</b> <b>supporting</b> compartment is developed in this paper. Numerical simulation of antiknock impact performance of the new refuge cabin was calculated and analyzed by using the finite element software of LS-DYNA. The stress and strain distributions and maximum antiknock performance were obtained. Refuge chamber cabin has been optimized to reduce cost. The antiknock impact performance of optimized mine refuge chamber cabin can reach 1. 4 MPa which is greater than the 0. 6 MPa of standard value and the cost can be reduced approximate 19 % than the original model...|$|R

5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted.

Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical futility, will be associated with the withdrawal of <b>life</b> <b>support,</b> and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
