50|$|The {{increasingly}} asymmetric underwater {{shape of}} the hull matching the increasing angle of heel may generate an increasing directional turning force into the wind. The sails' centre of effort will also increase this turning effect or force on the vessel's motion due to increasing <b>lever</b> <b>effect</b> with increased heeling which shows itself as increased human effort required to steer a straight course. Increased heeling reduces exposed sail area relative to the wind direction, so leading to an equilibrium state. As more heeling force causes more heel, weather helm may be experienced. This condition has a braking effect on the vessel but has the safety effect in that an excessively hard pressed boat will try and turn into the wind, therefore, reducing the forces on the sail. Small amounts (≤5 degrees) of weather helm are generally considered desirable because of the consequent aerofoil lift effect from the rudder. This aerofoil lift produces helpful motion to windward & the corollary {{of the reason why}} lee helm is dangerous. Lee helm, the opposite of weather helm, is generally considered to be dangerous because the vessel turns away from the wind when the helm is released, thus increasing forces on the sail {{at a time when the}} helmsperson is not in control.|$|E

An electrical gain lever with greater than 7 dB enhancement of AM efficiency was achieved {{within the range of}} appropriate DC biasing currents, but this gain dropped rapidly outside this range.

40|$|Abstract—Despite {{the fact}} that {{minimally}} invasive robotic surgery provides many advantages for patients, complex tasks are still time-consuming, error-prone and lead to quicker fatigue of the surgeon. Automating recurrent tasks could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients. While surgeons gain {{most of the information}} which is necessary to perform the operation from the visual feedback of cameras, there is only little work on autonomous systems utilizing visual information to generate movement commands. A major step towards automated tasks is the autonomous positioning of surgical instruments with high precision inside the situs. In this paper, we tackle the challenges arising from automated positioning by employing visual servoing techniques in two ways: On one hand, a calibration of all system components has to be performed to enable position-based servo-ing in Cartesian space. On the other hand, <b>lever</b> <b>effects</b> which appear {{due to the nature of}} laparoscopic surgery and intrinsic system imprecisions may not be overcome with calibrations.

Although increased restorative vertical space with longer collar length could {{play a role in}} screw loosening, there is no certain evidence that increase in abutment collar length can affect screw loosening. However, considering the abutment height from implant platform to the top of abutment (including abutment collar), an increase in the collar length might result in an increase in the vertical cantilever.

40|$|The {{coast of}} East and Southeast Asia is a {{far-field}} region {{and thus a}} scientifically valuable site for sea level and coastal study. The high population density in low-lying coastal areas of this region means a high vulnerability to human society if sea level is going to rise in the future. This research is designed to tackle two scientific issues: (1) Analyze the past local land level change including the <b>levering</b> <b>effect</b> and tectonic movements; and (2) Investigate how coastal system have responded to past sea level change. In order to tackle the first issue, three glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models were simulated to produce a series of predictions for the study area, and 560 sea level data from published sources were re-analyzed and re-calibrated to convert them into useable sea level index points for sea level reconstructions. After a comparison between the model predictions and the reconstructed sea level histories, the <b>effects</b> of GIA, <b>levering</b> <b>effects</b> and tectonic movements are identified and assessed. The results show the three coastal sectors have had different responses to sea-level change. The Sundaland Block as a teconically stable region is more sensitive to GIA intensity changes. The Cathaysian Block is also sensitive to GIA intensity changes. But the coast was affected by small magnitude, localized uplift and subsidence. These tectonic movements can be clearly distinguished from the GIA processes, {{paving the way for}} eventual quantification of land movements. The Yangtze Block and North China Craton are located in low to middle latitudes, but still show characteristics of far-field GIA. Tectonic movement in this sector is relatively negligible, except the west Bohai Bay where subsidence is more obvious. For the second issue, the sedimentary sequence of a protected coastal wetland (Mai Po) in Hong Kong was investigated. Its developmental history and how it has responded to the past sea level change were examined. The results show, before 1000 years ago, the Mai Po area was a subtidal area, with sandy silt and abundant marine shells deposited in seabed implying an environment under deeper water and with better sea water exchange. A change took place about 800 years ago, and the area became a low energy environment with finer sediment and no marine shell. Soon after this, the sedimentation slowed down markedly possibly due to a fall in sea level. By about 200 years ago, mangrove vegetation colonized the site and kept expanding seawards progressively. In the past 100 years, due to human activity in the Deep Bay area, sedimentary supply from both Hong Kong and Shenzhen has increased. As sea level has also risen, another phase of rapid sedimentation takes place in {{the lower part of the}} mangrove forest and current mudflats. published_or_final_versionEarth SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} {{the origins of}} phase transformation hysteresis in electrodes of Li-ion batteries, focusing on the alloying reaction of Li with Sb. Electrochemical measurements confirm that the reaction path followed during Li insertion into Sb electrodes differs from that followed upon subsequent Li extraction.

An unusually high Li mobility in Li 3 Sb facilitates over potentials during charging, {{which leads to a}} substantially larger driving force for the nucleation of Sb compared to that of Li 2 Sb. The differences in nucleation driving forces arise from a <b>lever</b> <b>effect</b> that favors phases with large changes in Li concentration over phases that are closer in composition along the equilibrium path.

40|$|AbstractOrganizational {{management}} systems, {{for control}} and command, have attracted {{a great amount}} of research and debate since the very origin of management, as its underlying question is: how to manage human activity systems successfully? More recently, the so-called ‘Balanced Score Card’ approach has assumed dominance in managers’ practice. While that approach has its merits, it also has some important limitations; among others it ignores time and its relation to information. To deal with some aspect of this limitation, this paper introduces a metric, (e. g. mathematical model) funded upon information theory (entropy) that is linked through a notion of time-distortion to the economic performance of an organization. In this, a goal-related time- distortion, between a management system and its operating system, is a carrier of information with economic dependence. The proposed model shows, among others, that time-distortion influences economic performance dramatically, including a <b>lever</b> <b>effect,</b> while high information entropy does not necessarily imply high economic outcome...|$|E

40|$|Semiconductor {{quantum dot}} (QD) lasers are {{competitive}} candidates for many {{applications such as}} high-speed long-haul optical communication systems. This is due to their superior lasing characteristics (compared to conventional quantum well (QW) lasers) and also their potential for high differential gain and direct modulation with negligible chirp. Recently, substantial efforts {{have been made to}} improve the modulation characteristics of QD semiconductor lasers such as enhancing the modulation efficiency and improving the overall modulation bandwidth. The gain <b>lever</b> <b>effect</b> is a method used to enhance the efficiency of amplitude modulation and optical frequency modulation at microwave frequencies by taking advantage of the sub-linear nature of the gain versus carrier density. Previously, two-section quantum well lasers have been investigated theoretically and experimentally to explore the gain <b>lever</b> <b>effect.</b> As for QD devices, which are extremely promising because of the strong gain saturation effect in dots, have not been investigated until recently. In this thesis, first the characteristics and applications of conventional two-section gain lever semiconductor lasers are presented. In related previous studies, gain levered single and multiple QW lasers have been used to enhance the modulation efficiencies in both intensity (IM) and frequency (FM) modulation. In this work, the modulation characteristics of a gain lever QD laser diode is demonstrated for the first time. In this work we report an amplitude modulation enhancement of 8 -dB for a p-doped two-section quantum dot laser and discuss the relation between the normalized 3 -dB bandwidth and the modulation section gain for different power levels. Also based on rate equations and small signal analysis, a novel modulation response equation is derived to describe the device dynamics. Using the new modulation response function the actual gain lever ratio can be measured for various power levels. For future work, the gain lever laser structure can be optimized to reduce the effect of non-linear gain suppression which directly limits the efficiency enhancement through the damping factors and relaxation oscillation frequency.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the potential of coupled-cavity semiconductor lasers for bio-sensing applications. This has involved the design and development of a fabrication process for a novel micro-fluidic coupled-cavity laser sensor. The efficiency of the etched inner laser facets of this device have been identified as a key determinant of the device behaviour. The multi-section gain characterization technique has been used to measure the efficiency of these facets to be η = 0. 48 ± 0. 13. Perturbation of the optical coupling between the two laser sections of the device can induce a wavelength shift in the laser output of Δλ = 20 ± 5 Å. This wavelength change is attributed to the difference in the threshold gain requirements of the coupled-cavity and individual cavity modes of the device. A multi-mode travelling wave rate equation model has been used to predict that the size of this effect can be maximized by optimizing the cavity lengths of the device. For the AlGaInP quantum well material used in this work the coupling effect is maximized by using the shortest cavity lengths possible that can still achieve laser action. The utility of including a segmented contact system to the coupled-cavity design has also been investigated. This modification enables wavelength tuning via the gain <b>lever</b> <b>effect</b> and self-pulsation through saturable absorption. A wavelength tuning range of Δλ = 1. 2 ± 0. 2 nm has been measured for a single cavity laser with a segmented contact length ratio of 4 : 1. This tuning behaviour has been attributed to the carrier density dependence of the net modal gain peak. Rate equation modelling has been used to interpret the self-pulsation behaviour of the segmented contact device and to demonstrate how optical pumping of a saturable absorber can increase the sensitivity of the coupled-cavity device.

Jensen 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) control hypothesis predicts that high levels of free cash flow will {{increase the likelihood that}} managers will engage in opportunistic behavior, especially at low-growth firms. I test two hypotheses: (1) increased leverage reduces opportunistic behavior as proxied by three measures of agency costs, and (2) increased leverage reduces earnings management using three accrual-based measures of managerial discretion. I find that for low-growth, high free cash flow firms, increased leverage reduces one measure of opportunistic behavior. For low-growth, high free cash flow firms, increased leverage reduces earnings management for two accrual-based measures. These results contribute to the literature that examines the effect of opportunistic behavior on earnings management. In subsequent analysis, I examine cross-sectional differences in accrual measures and find that firms that undergo large leverage increases have significantly lower ending accrual levels than firms that remain consistently highly <b>levered.</b> This <b>effect</b> holds for firms with initially high levels of free cash flow.
