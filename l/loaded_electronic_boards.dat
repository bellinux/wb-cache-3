40|$|Abstract. The paper {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of non-uniform cooling of <b>electronic</b> circuit <b>boards.</b> The block diagram of the system implementing this approach, the method of calculation of the <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> temperature field, {{as well as the}} principle of its thermal performance optimizing are presented. In the considered scheme the main heat elimination from <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> is produced by the radiator system, and additional cooling of the most temperature-sensitive components is produced by thermoelectric batteries. Are given the two-dimensional temperature fields of the <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> during its uniform and non-uniform cooling, is carried out their comparison. As follows from the calculations results, when using a uniform overall cooling of electronic unit there is a waste of energy for the cooling 0 f <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> parts which temperature is within acceptable temperature range without the cooling system. This approach leads to the increase in the cooling capacity of used thermoelectric batteries in comparison with the desired values. This largely reduces the efficiency of heat elimination system. The use for <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> cooling of non-uniform local heat elimination removes this disadvantage. The obtained dependences show that in this case, the energy required to create a given temperature is smaller than when using a common uniform cooling. In this approach the temperature field of the <b>electronic</b> <b>board</b> is more uniform and the cooling is more efficient.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Production of <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> {{containing}} brominated {{flame retardants}} is constantly increasing, posing important problems with disposal of products containing these materials. The present {{study investigated the}} thermal degradation behavior of <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> manufactured using tetrabromobisphenol A and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy resins. Qualitative and quantitative information was obtained on the products formed in the thermal degradation process, and the bromine distribution in the different product fractions was determined. The more important decomposition products included hydrogen bromide, phenol, polybrominated phenols, and polybrominated bisphenol A species. The formation of considerable amounts of hydrogen bromide and high-molecular-weight organobrominated compounds, {{as well as the}} potential formation of limited quantities of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, is an important element of concern in the safety and environmental assessment of the thermal degradation processes of <b>electronic</b> <b>boards</b> containing brominated flame retardants...|$|R
