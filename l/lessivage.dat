40|$|Understanding soil {{evolution}} requires characterising, quantifying, and modelling {{the major}} processes that govern pedogenesis. We proposed to study {{one of the}} most widespread processes in soils: <b>lessivage,</b> understood as the vertical transfer of fine particles from a horizon, called eluviated, to another horizon, called illuviated. <b>Lessivage</b> fluxes were never measured to our knowledge due to obvious technical difficulties. In addition, despite its description in many soil types, the existence of this process is somewhat controversial. We designed a laboratory experimental device to imitate the <b>lessivage</b> process and to test the impact i) of extreme events, as heavy rain, and ii) {{of the structure of the}} eluviated horizon on <b>lessivage.</b> We used a rainfall generator that allows the examination of the effect of rainfall on soil under controlled conditions. Two climatic modalities were tested: heavy rain on dry soil and small intensity rainfalls on wet soil. We present here the first results of these experiments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLessivage, {{also called}} argilluviation, {{consists}} of a substantial vertical transfer of particles less than 2 pm from a superficial departure horizon to a deeper horizon. This process is common in many soil types and responsible {{for the development of}} a textural differentiation in soil profiles in the subsurface. However, the mechanisms of <b>lessivage</b> are still poorly understood, and to our knowledge, <b>lessivage</b> has rarely been quantified. We propose here two original experiments of in vitro pedogenesis on soil columns to analyse the mechanisms acting in eluviation and illuviation, the two phases of <b>lessivage,</b> and to quantify these two phases in terms of particle export and fixation. We paid special attention to the experimental conditions, so that the conditions were favourable for <b>lessivage</b> and as close as possible to field conditions. The eluviation experiment showed that the release of particles was not the determining process for <b>lessivage.</b> We also showed that the smectite selectivity of eluviation was not continuous overtime. Both physical and chemical processes were identified as acting on both eluviation and illuviation. Concerning illuviation, experiments showed that from 25 to 90 % of the eluviated particles were retained in the deeper horizon. Although large, to our knowledge this range represents the first quantification of illuviation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the development under metamorphic conditions of banded skarns and oscillatory precipitation by metasomatism. Two types of banded skarns are described at Rio Marina (Elba, Italy), {{the first one}} is composed of light pyroxene (hedenbergite) bands and dark ilvaite bands, and another one is composed of light quartz bands and dark ilvaite bands. The directions of the bands are parallel to the zoning of the skarns or to the contact between the skarn and the limestone. The geochemical studies indicate that the banded skarns and the ordinary skarns are formed upon the same massive and homogeneous limestones and that the formation of the skarns require important gains of Si and Fe and losses of Ca and CO 2. The same fluid is responsible for the formation of the ordinary and the banded skarns. The comparison of the banded skarns of Rio Marina with other examples of banded skarns allow us to state the following rules: (1) The banded skarns can occur as alternating strata or as orbicular structures. (2) The width of the bands varies from 0. 2 to 6 mm; the widths of the light bands and the dark bands are the same in most cases. (3) In banded skarns {{there is at least one}} mineral constituted not only of an element, such as Ca or Mg, derived from the dissolution of the carbonates, but also of an element, such as Si or Fe, derived from the fluid. The formation of banded skarns requires the coupling between the precipitation of the minerals in the bands and the dissolution of the carbonates. The second mineral is composed essentially of the elements derived from the fluid, such as Si and Fe. Based on the previous observations and on the analysis of the conditions for the coupling between the different processes operating in the formation of banded skarns, the qualitative models have been set forth to discuss the possible mechanism for the appearance of banding. The main mechanism is the dissolution-precipitation loop where coupling operates thanks to the aqueous species liberated or consumed by the dissolution and precipitation reactions. This is a positive feedback loop and an indirect auto-catalytic reaction; it creates a delay between the reaction and the transport, that gives rise to the pause of the activity of the loop, then its starting again when the transport fills the delay. The banded skarns are the result of the repetitive appearance of the loop due to the coupling between the reaction and transport. The stability analysis on a quantified model indicates that one necessary condition for the formation of the banded skarns is a high concentration of Si or Fe and a low concentration of Ca in the original fluid. Cette thèse se propose de discuter la formation des alternances récurrentes dans les skarns et la précipitation oscillante par métasomatose en contexte métamorphique. On commence par discuter deux types d'alternances de Rio Marina (Ile d'Elbe, Italie). Les directions des bandes sont parallèles à la zonation des skarns ou au contact entre le skarn et le calcaire. Les études géochimiques montrent que les skarns à alternances et les skarns ordinaires sont formés sur des calcaires massifs et homogènes et que la formation des skarns nécessite des apports importants de silice et de fer et de <b>lessivages</b> de calcium et de gaz carbonique. La comparaison des alternances de Rio Marina avec d'autres exemples d'alternances a permis d'énoncer les règles suivantes: (1). Les alternances apparaissent généralement sous 2 formes: des strates alternantes ou des structures orbiculaires. (2) Les épaisseurs des bandes varient de 0, 2 mm a 6 mm; les épaisseurs des bandes claires et des bandes sombres sont les mêmes dans la plupart des cas. (3) Dans les alternances, il y a au moins un minéral qui est constitué non seulement d'un élément provenant de la dissolution des carbonates comme Ca et Mg mais aussi d'un élément provenant du fluide comme Si et Fe. le deuxième minéral dans les alternances est compose essentiellement d'éléments provenant du fluide comme Si et Fe. La formation des bandes requiert le couplage de la précipitation des minéraux en alternances et de la dissolution de la roche carbonatée. Des modèles qualitatifs sont établis pour discuter le mécanisme possible d'apparition de ce type de structure spatiale...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLong-term {{impacts of}} climate {{evolution}} and agricultural management on soil properties and thus soil functioning must be assessed by modelling studies. We focus on modelling of the clay depth distribution {{as a result}} of natural soil formation and agricultural management by using the soil genesis model SoilGen 2 with loess-derived Luvisols in northern France. An essential first step is the calibration of the processes concerning clay leaching (<b>lessivage)</b> in this model, for which we propose a reproducible method consisting of a screening for a realistic parameter range, a sensitivity analysis and finally a model calibration. To be able to separate the effects of natural soil evolution and more recent agricultural activities, we calibrated the model firstly on natural soils still under forest. Four parameters were the most sensitive and in need of calibration, representing the volume fraction of the soil in contact with macropores, a filter coefficient and physical weathering producing clay-sized particles. These parameters were successfully calibrated, but independent validations at Belgian and Norwegian sites with Albeluvisols and Stagnosols developed in loess and marine clay did not always show an improvement on earlier calibrations. This can be related to several factors, most importantly the dominance of processes other than <b>lessivage</b> in Albeluvisols and uncertain reconstructions of the climate. After calibration, a functional sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of agricultural management on <b>lessivage.</b> Clear effects on clay loss in the topsoil were found for the length of the crop-cover period and the ploughing depth {{and to a lesser extent}} for the intensity of soil mixing and the interception evaporation of the crops. As it is not feasible to reconstruct these factors for the entire period of agriculture in this region (several millennia), further analysis should take the form of scenario studies, but this should be preceded by use of field leaching experiments to calibrate SoilGen 2 over short time-scales...|$|E

The development is comprised of the addition of two sub-models of nitrate transport: one relating the amount of soil nitrate to its concentration in drainage water for different types of soil, and the second accounting for the proportion of permeable rock underlying the catchment. The sub-model that calculates the supply and transport of soil nitrate has been made sensitive to annual patterns of weather according to a classification based on the maximum soil water deficit.

40|$|Cutans {{occurring}} in Albeluvisols of the Precarpathians in the Ukraine were studied. The morphology of the cutans and their components were described. The obtained {{results show that}} the studied cutans are composed mainly of colloidal clay. Clay cutans in the studied soils are characterized by smooth surface, microlamination, and clear optical orientation of clay domains. It was found that the microlamination of the clay cutans is a result of cyclic material deposition due to translocation of colloids (i. e. eluviation-illuviation). Complex layered cutans containing layers of pure clay, microlaminated clay and silt were also found. It was shown that the colour of clay cutans depends on their composition. Domination of brown, dark brown and rusty-brown cutans indicates that clay minerals and Fe-oxides are main component of such microstructures. Several morphotypes of cutans were determined: sandy-silty, clay, humus-clay, humus-silty-clay, silty-clay, and iron-clay. Most of the identified morphotypes of cutans are a result of mobilization, translocation, and accumulation of colloids within the studied soil profiles. Based on the cutans complex it was concluded that the genesis of the studied soils is related to illimerization (<b>lessivage)</b> and gley-eluvial processes...|$|E

On a slope in the 'Kokel' uplands in Romania (Transylvanian Piedmont at {{the foot}} of the eastern Carpathians) the {{earthworm}} species Proctodrilus tuberculatus (Černosvitov, 1935), P. thaleri Höser & Zicsi, 2009 and P. opisthoductus Zicsi, 1985 were found at different points in the soil catena. The colluvial soil clearly has the distinctive characteristics of an inverse profile. P. tuberculatus occurs at the top of the slope and in the colluvial soil, while P. thaleri was found exclusively in the area {{at the foot}} of the slope towards the valley, in the section of greater colluvial horizon diversity. P. opisthoductus occurs towards the valley floor, in the relatively humus-rich mineral layer of the inverse profile. The pedological findings indicate that P. tuberculatus prefers the leached horizons of the lessived soils. Where P. thaleri occurs is a colluvial soil with a probable tendency to a soil-type interference of lessive soil and brown loam (terra fusca), where these two types are within one and the same soil profile.

40|$|The {{increased}} inorganic nitrogen (N) {{deposition in}} the last decades {{has become a major}} concern for the health of forest ecosystems. High anthropogenic N emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion and livestock agriculture, have resulted in both high gaseous concentrations and high deposition in rainfall and throughfall. In forest ecosystem, where N is no longer limiting to primary production due to high inputs, the excess N is thought to be related to forest decline and a concept of ‘N saturation ‘ has been developed. In particular, N in the form of NH 4, in excess to plant and microbial demands could lead to soil acidification if nitrified in the soil and leached, causing loss of base cations or mobilisation of phytotoxic aluminium. Nutrient imbalances due to high soil solution NH 4 /cation ratios or damaged root systems may also occur. The fate of the incoming NH 4 is central to determining the effects on the ecosystem, and is closely related to the controls of nitrification. Although this process has been intensely studied in pure cultures for some nitrifying bacteria, the organisms responsible and controlling factors in acid forest soils are still poorly understood. A better comprehension of the fate of NH 4 deposition is necessary to determine ‘Critical Loads for N’, the threshold deposition not damaging to the ecosystem, which is used as a political tool for quantifying pollution limits. In this thesis, I focused on a) the effects of increased (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition on soil solution chemistry of six coniferous forest sites the presence of live roots, b) the impacts of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition on Norway spruce (Picea abies [L. ] Karst) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) fine roots, and c) the controls of nitrification in an acid forest soil. The work was part of the CEC project ‘CORE’, investigating the effects of atmospheric pollution on nutrient turnover in soils. An identical field experiment was performed in six coniferous sites, situated in five European countries. Chronically increased NH 4 deposition by 75 kg N ha- 1 a- 1 through (NH 4) 2 SO 4 application, demonstrated the contrasting responses of the different ecosystems. Soil solution concentrations and yearly ionic fluxes were analysed. (NH 4) 2 SO 4 treatment resulted in deposition of 79 to 93 kg N ha- 1 a- 1 at the different sites. In the two less acidic, clay/clay loam soils, only 6 % of the added NH 4 was lost through leaching. The two sandy soils lost up to 75 % of the added NH 4, and the two remaining sites lost ca. 25 %. Leaching of added NH 4 was thought to be related to soil physico-chemical characteristics, such as pH, C and N content and texture. NO 3 leaching was increased at three sites, only 4 - 9 months after starting the (NH 4) 2 SO 4 treatment, with a maximum doubling of concentrations. One sandy soil failed to nitrify under any condition, and the other sandy soil showed high NO 3 leaching under all treatments, but no increase due to increased N inputs. The presence of live roots reduced NO 3 leaching in two sites, delaying the increase in soil solution NO 3 concentrations in response to the (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition in one of them. In all nitrifying soils, soil solution NO 3 concentrations were related to cation concentrations, with Al being the dominant cation in the more acid soils with low base saturation. This experiment demonstrated the importance of soil N storage capacity and nitrification potential in determining the consequences of increased NH 4 deposition, and the strong relationship between NO 3 and cation leaching. Ionic fluxes and soil solution chemistry were further analysed in one of the six sites (Grizedale, UK). In this Norway spruce stand on clay soil, NO 3 fluxes were increased by increased (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition, and mainly balanced by increased Al losses. This soil had a pHH 2 O around 3. 6, and was characterised by over 90 % of the exchange complex being occupied by Al. Independent of treatment, soil solution changed from Ca to Al leaching during the 18 month field experiment, with a decrease in soil solution pH from 4. 9 to 3. 8. At the end of the experiment, soil solution Al concentrations were higher for the (NH 4) 2 SO 4 treatments. It was suggested that nitrification had caused the pH decrease, with a further lowering of the base saturation, linked to a abrupt increase in soil solution Al concentrations. The impacts of increased (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition and soil characteristics on Norway spruce root biomass and vitality, and on Norway spruce and Scots pine fine root chemistry, were investigated with an ingrowth core technique. The same experiment was performed in a Norway spruce stand on clay soil (Grizedale, UK) and a Scots pine stand on sandy soil (Wekerom, NL), using soil from each of the two sites. For Norway spruce, root biomass and numbers of fine root tips were higher in the organic than in the mineral horizon of the clay and sandy soils. This was related to higher fine root Al and lower Ca contents in the mineral horizon. Root biomass and the proportion of dead roots were higher in the clay soil, compared to the sandy soil, with higher root Al contents, despite lower soil solution Al concentrations than in the sandy soil. For Norway spruce, a negative correlation between root biomass and fine root Al content was established. Enhanced N deposition caused an increase in the total number of root tips and in the proportion of dead roots in the sandy soil. Effects of increased (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition on root biomass were not significant for the clay soil, yet caused increased fine root N content in the organic horizon for both species. Scots pine fine roots also showed higher Al and lower Ca contents in the mineral horizon. (NH 4) 2 SO 4 treatment caused increased fine root Al content and a decreased Mg/Al ratio in the mineral layer of the sandy soil, with opposite effects in the clay soil. This (NH 4) 2 SO 4 treatment effect in the sandy soil for Scots pine was the only indication of a potential adverse effect of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 deposition on fine roots. Results demonstrated the dominant importance of inherent soil characteristics and the stratification into soil horizons on fine root growth and chemical composition. The effects of temperature, throughfall volume and NH 4 deposition on soil solution NO 3 concentrations, N 2 O emissions and numbers of NH 4 oxidisers were investigated for the Grizedale soil in a controlled laboratory experiment. Multiple regression and surface response analysis revealed temperature as the most important factor, with an optimum for NO 3 leaching and numbers of NH 4 oxidisers in the mineral horizon at 11 °C. Volume acted independently of temperature with a minimum at 870 mm throughfall 2 weeks- 1. The relatively low optimum temperature compared to other studies was explained by the minimum disturbance of the soil in the current study. NO 3 fluxes increased quadratically with throughfall volume. N 2 O fluxes increased quadratically with temperature and throughfall volume, and showed high variability. It was suggested that the temperature optimum for net nitrification depended on the physico-chemical characteristics of the soil and on the activity of decomposers, by competition for O 2 and NH 4. Optimum temperatures may have been overestimated in previous studies using disturbed soils. The regression model for NO 3 leaching derived from the laboratory experiment was applied to data from the previous field experiment and tested with different time intervals for temperature input parameters. A model including two-monthly mean temperatures yielded the best fit between measured and simulated values, as determined by correlation and minimum sum of squared residuals. Simulated NO 3 leaching was over-estimated {{in the second part of}} the field study. The good correspondence between field temperature frequency distribution and the optimum temperature determined by the regression model, as well as the high correlation between measured and simulated values, demonstrated the adequacy of a quadratic model with a relatively low temperature optimum to describe field NO 3 leaching, determined for the same soil with an identical sampling design. L’augmentation des dépôts d’azote inorganique (N) au cours dernières décennies est un souci majeur pour la santé de nos écosystèmes forestiers. Les concentrations élevées dans l’atmosphère et les dépôts importants par la pluie et les pluviolessivats proviennent essentiellement des émissions de N d’origine anthropique, principalement de l’agriculture et de la combustion des réserves fossiles. Ainsi, le concept de la saturation en azote a été développé pour les écosystèmes forestiers où, à cause des dépôts élevés, l’azote n’est plus un facteur limitant pour la production primaire, et où l’excès de N est supposé lié au dépérissement forestier. En particulier, le NH 4 qui se trouve en surplus par rapport aux besoins des plantes et des micro-organismes peut être nitrifié et lessivé et ainsi engendrer une acidification du sol, une perte en cations basiques et une mobilisation de l’aluminium phytotoxique. Des déséquilibres nutritionnels causés par un rapport élevé NH 4 /cations dans la solution du sol ou des dommages au système racinaire pourraient en résulter. Le devenir du NH 4 détermine donc les effets sur l’écosystème et son sort est étroitement lié aux contrôles du processus de nitrification. Malgré des études intensives en cultures pures de certaines bactéries nitrifiantes, les organismes responsables de la nitrification et leurs facteurs de contrôle sont mal connus dans les sols forestiers acides. La détermination des ‘charges critiques pour l’azote’, c’est à dire, la quantité de dépôt maximale acceptable n’endommageant pas l’écosystème, est utilisée comme outil politique pour quantifier les limites de pollution. Elle nécessite cependant une meilleure compréhension du devenir du NH 4 apporté par la pluie dans les sols. Dans cette thèse, j’ai focalisé mon attention sur les effets d’une augmentation du dépôt azoté, sous forme de (NH 4) 2 SO 4, a) sur la composition chimique de la solution du sol dans six sites forestiers de conifères en présence d’un système racinaire vivant, b) sur les impacts du dépôt de (NH 4) 2 SO 4 sur les racines de l’épicéa commun (Picea abies [L. ] Karst.) et du pin sylvestre (Pinus sylvestris L.), et c) sur les contrôles de la nitrification dans un sol forestier acide. Cette recherche s’insérait dans le cadre général du projet ‘CORE’ (CCE), étudiant les effets de la pollution atmosphérique sur le cycle des éléments nutritifs dans les sols forestiers. Une expérience de terrain identique a été mise en place dans six plantations de conifères, situés dans cinq pays européens. L’enrichissement régulier de la pluie locale par une solution de (NH 4) 2 SO 4 (75 kg N ha- 1 a- 1) a résulté en un dépôt de 79 à 93 kg N ha- 1 a- 1 dans les différents sites et a engendré des réponses distinctes dans les six sols. Les concentrations de la solution du sol, ainsi que les flux ioniques annuels ont été analysés. Dans les deux sols les moins acides, argileux et limono-argileux, seulement 6 % du NH 4 ajouté ont été perdus par <b>lessivage.</b> Les deux sols sableux ont perdu 75 % du NH 4 ajouté, et les deux autres sites environ 25 %. On suppose que le <b>lessivage</b> du NH 4 ajouté est lié aux caractéristiques physico-chimiques du sol, comme le pH, le contenu en C et N, et la texture. Le <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 a été, au maximum, doublé dans trois sites, 4 - 9 mois après le début du traitement. Un des sols sableux n’a jamais nitrifié, alors que l’autre montrait un <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 élevé, quel que soit le traitement, et sans être influencé par l’apport de (NH 4) 2 SO 4. Le <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 a été réduit par la présence de racines vivantes dans deux sites, retardant l’augmentation du NO 3 due à la présence de (NH 4) 2 SO 4 dans l’un d’eux. La concentration de la solution du sol en NO 3 était lié à la concentration en cations dans tous les sites nitrifiants, avec une dominance de Al dans les sols acides ayant une saturation en bases faible. L’expérience a démontré une forte corrélation entre le <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 et de cations. Il apparaît donc que, pour déterminer les conséquences d’une augmentation du dépôt azoté, il est important de connaître la capacité de stockage du sol en N et son potentiel de nitrification. L’étude des flux ioniques et de la solution du sol a été approfondie dans l’un des six sites (Grizedale, UK). Dans cette plantation d’épicéa commun sur sol argileux, les flux en NO 3 ont été augmentés par l’apport de (NH 4) 2 SO 4, et accompagnés par des pertes en Al. Le pH de ce sol se situait autour de 3. 6 et le complexe d’échange était saturé à plus de 90 % par Al. L’analyse de la solution du sol a révélé que, pendant les 18 mois de traitement, le <b>lessivage</b> du sol en Ca était remplacé par un <b>lessivage</b> en Al et cela indépendamment du traitement. En même temps, le pH diminuait de 4. 9 à 3. 8. A la fin de l’expérience, la concentration de la solution du sol en Al était plus élevée pour les traitements au (NH 4) 2 SO 4. La diminution du pH serait provoquée par la nitrification, et s’accompagnerait d’une diminution du taux de saturation en bases, liée à une augmentation brusque des concentrations de la solution du sol en Al. Les impacts d’une augmentation du dépôt de (NH 4) 2 SO 4 et des caractéristiques du sol ont ensuite été étudiés sur la biomasse et la vitalité des racines de l’épicéa commun, ainsi que sur la composition chimique des racines fines de l’épicéa commun et de pin sylvestre par la technique de ‘ingrowth cores’. Le même schéma expérimental a été suivi dans une plantation d’épicéa commun sur sol argileux (Grizedale, UK) et dans une plantation de pin sylvestre sur sol sableux (Wekerom, NL), en utilisant les deux types de sol dans chaque site. Pour l’épicéa, la biomasse racinaire et le nombre de pointes de racines fines étaient plus élevés dans l’horizon organique que dans l’horizon minéral des sols argileux et sableux. Ceci était lié à une concentration en Al plus élevée et une concentration en Ca plus faible dans les racines de l’horizon minéral. Malgré une concentration en Al dans la solution du sol plus faible dans le sol argileux, les concentrations en Al des racines y étaient plus élevées, avec une biomasse racinaire totale et une proportion de racines mortes plus élevées. Cependant, une relation négative entre la biomasse racinaire et le contenu des racines fines en Al a été montrée chez l’épicéa commun. Le dépôt de (NH 4) 2 SO 4 a provoqué une augmentation du nombre de pointes racinaires et de la proportion en racine mortes dans le sol sableux. Les effets du (NH 4) 2 SO 4 sur la biomasse des racines n’étaient pas significatifs dans le sol argileux. Ils ont cependant induit une augmentation du contenu en N dans les racines de l’horizon organique des deux espèces dans le sol argileux. Les racines du pin sylvestre de l’horizon minéral montraient également une augmentation de la concentration en Al et une diminution de la concentration en Ca. Le traitement (NH 4) 2 SO 4 a conduit à une augmentation du contenu en Al et une diminution du rapport Mg/Al dans l’horizon minéral du sol sableux, et à des effets opposés dans le sol argileux. Cet effet pour le pin sylvestre dans le sol sableux était la seule indication d’un effet négatif du dépôt de (NH 4) 2 SO 4 sur les racines fines. Les résultats ont démontré l’importance dominante des caractéristiques du sol et de la stratification en horizons sur la croissance de racines fines et sur leur composition chimique. Les effets de la température, du volume de pluviolessivats et du dépôt de NH 4 sur les concentrations en NO 3 de la solution du sol, les émissions de N 2 O et le nombre de bactéries oxydant le NH 4 ont été étudiés pour le sol de Grizedale par une expérience en laboratoire, en conditions contrôlées. L’analyse des résultats a montré que la température était le facteur majeur, avec un optimum, à 11 °C, pour le <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 et le nombre de bactéries, dans l’horizon minéral, oxydant le NH 4. L’influence du volume était indépendante de la température, avec un <b>lessivage</b> minimum à 870 mm de pluie par 2 semaines. Les flux de NO 3 augmentaient de manière quadratique avec le volume des pluviolessivats. Les flux de N 2 O augmentaient de manière quadratique avec la température et le volume des pluviolessivats. Il a été suggéré que l’optimum de température pour la nitrification nette dépendait des caractéristiques physico-chimiques du sol et d’une limitation en O 2 résultant de l’activité des décomposeurs, et que l’optimum de température a été surestimé dans des études précédentes utilisant des sols manipulés. Le modèle de régression pour le <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 dérivé de l’expérience en laboratoire a été appliqué aux données de l’expérience de terrain décrite précédemment, et testé avec des pas de temps différents pour les données de température entrant dans le modèle. La meilleure correspondance entre les valeurs de NO 3 mesurées et simulées, déterminée par corrélation et par la somme minimale des carrés des résidus, débouchait sur un modèle incluant la moyenne de la température calculée sur deux mois. Le <b>lessivage</b> en NO 3 était surestimé par le modèle dans la deuxième partie de l’expérience de terrain. La bonne correspondance entre la distribution de fréquence des températures de terrain et l’optimum déterminé par le modèle, ainsi que la corrélation entre les valeurs mesurées et simulées, a démontré qu’un modèle quadratique avec un optimum de température relativement faible était adéquat pour décrire le <b>lessivage</b> de NO 3 d’un sol forestier acide...|$|E
40|$|Our {{study of}} a loessic soil profile from east-central Nebraska shows that the A horizons of the modern soil are {{characterized}} by higher concentrations of fine-grained (b 0. 1 Am) magnetic minerals. This pedogenic magnetic component leads to higher values of concentration-dependent parameters, such as magnetic susceptibility (v), isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM), combined with increases in frequency-dependent susceptibility (v fd) and ARM/IRM ratios. Hysteresis properties are relatively insensitive towards {{the presence of this}} pedogenic magnetic component. The magnetic properties of the soil profile are dominated by ferrimagnetic magnetite or maghemite. Analyses of bsoftQ IRM (sIRM) and bhardQ IRM (hIRM), however, do show that approximately 80 – 90 % of the remanence carrying magnetic component exists in the form of hematite or goethite and that the magnetically enhanced horizons are enriched in both ferri- and antiferromagnetic minerals. The pedogenic magnetic component is most likely caused by the conversion of paramagnetic, iron-bearing minerals to ferriand antiferromagnetic minerals.

A representative soil profile was sampled, on a horizon basis, and a further 10 topsoil samples were collected, on a grid basis, from each plantation. Properties determined in the laboratory included pH, organic carbon content, particle size distribution, exchangeable base content (Ca, Mg, K, Na), total free and organically-bound iron content, and lead and zinc concentrations. Morphological and chemical changes within the soil profiles were examined {{to shed light on}} the processes and pathways of soil formation, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare topsoil characteristics between the different plantations. Morphological and chemical changes within the soil profiles indicated that organic matter accumulation and mor humus formation, acidification, clay translocation (<b>lessivage)</b> and incipient podzolisation were the dominant pedogenic processes. There are very few systematic age-related changes in soil morphological or physical and chemical characteristics, possibly due to a combination of young stand ages, high topsoil variability, soil mixing due to drainage operations and silvicultural practices. There are, however, a number of statistically significant but non-systematic differences in soil properties between the different aged plantation blocks. Possible associations between these differences and age-related litter production and root growth, and silvicultural operations such as understory control, plantation thinning and selective harvesting are explored...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{examined}} {{base cation}} leaching from {{the canopy of}} a subtropical rainforest in northeastern Taiwan. The forest is characterized by extremely low levels of base cations in both canopy vegetation and in the soils. The rates of canopy leaching of K+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + were very high, representing up to 30, 35, and 190 %, respectively, of the amount stored in leaves. The rate of H+ retention in the canopy {{was close to the}} rate of base cation leaching, suggest-ing that cation leaching is neutralizing acid precipitation. The subtropical forest studied leached cations from the can-opy throughout the year, unlike temperate deciduous forests, which are physiologically inert in the winter. The forest canopy of the subtropical forest we studied is impacted by acid deposition and fog throughout the winter because of frequent rainfall and high relative humidity. This continuous exposure to acid precipitation could cause more intense negative effects on the canopy of subtropical forests as compared with temperate forests exposed to similar pollution loads. We suggest that the low base status of subtropical forests growing on low base status soils may make them very vulnerable to the negative effects of air pollution.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Iron oxide {{minerals}} in soils {{provide valuable}} insights into pedogenic processes. A wealth of such {{information has been}} obtained by rock magnetic investigations on temperate soils but similar studies on tropical soils are rare. Here, we report rock magnetic data on pristine soil profiles and surficial soils from five catchments in the tropical southern India and throw light on the pedogenic processes. We ruled out contributions from greigite, bacterial magnetite and anthropogenic sources; hence, the magnetic signal is mainly from the catchment, principally pedogenic and, thus, has a climatic signature embedded in it. The Pookot profile from a high rainfall (~ 4000 mm/year) region does not exhibit any magnetic enhancement at the surface. In fact, there is hardly any difference between surface and sub-surface samples, which reflects on its deeply weathered nature {{as a result of}} the high rainfall. The Shantisagara profile exhibits <b>lessivage</b> of magnetic minerals, resulting in a thick magnetically enhanced zone. It shows the highest χlf values among the five profiles studied. The Thimmannanayakanakere (TK) and Ayyanakere (AK) soil profiles do not exhibit any magnetic enhancement of top-soil. In fact, χlf values increase towards the profile-bottom, suggesting top-soil erosion, besides contribution of magnetic minerals from parent rocks. In the TK profile, there is a clear distinction between surface and sub-surface samples, the former being magnetically coarser grained. The Kurburukere profile exhibits moderate to strong χlf values and a mild magnetic enhancement at the surface. The data would be usefu...|$|E

Two laboratory experiments focusing respectively on eluviation and on illuviation were designed. Eluviation was experienced on an undisturbed loamy soil column (called L 1). Illuviation was experienced on a column made of undisturbed loamy horizon (L 1) lying on a second undistrurbed monolith of a loamy horizon (called L 2) having contrasting mineralogical and physicochemical properties. For both experiments, rain events of 30 mm were applied with two different intensities: 20 mm/h and 6 mm/h. The lower boundary was free drainage during the rain event, and constant pressure head during the infiltration phase. Between two rain events, the soil columns were allowed to dry up in order to recover their initial water content. The water content in the column, the chemistry of the soil solution {{and the release of}} particles into the drainage water were monitored. These experiments allowed quantifying eluviation and relating it to preferential drainage, or to the succion applied {{at the base of the}} columns and to chemical composition of the soil water. The contribution of these different processes was most probably related to the structure of the soil column. We also determined that 20 to 80 % of the particles released by the L 1 horizon were trapped into the L 2 horizon allowing for the first time to our knowledge to quantify the intensity of particles fixation in natural soils...|$|E

This sreseach was aimed to: (1) study the soil development of rainfed paddy soils derived from lacustrine and (2) evaluate rainfed paddy soils potency for paddy and corn in Paguyaman. Soil samples were taken from three profiles according to toposequent, and they were analyzed in laboratory. Data were analyzed with descriptive-quantitative analysis. Furthermore, assessment on rainfed paddy soils potency was conducted with land suitability analysis using parametric approach. Results indicate that all pedon had evolved with B horizons structurization. However, pedon located on the summit slope was more developed and intensely weathered {{than those of the}} shoulder and foot slopes. The main pedogenesis in all pedons were through elluviation, illuviation, <b>lessivage,</b> pedoturbation, and gleization processes.

40|$|ABSTRACTKnowledge of soil {{characteristics}} {{in areas where}} activities related to the environment are developed, such as Porto Alegre Botanical Garden (JB-PoA), is a fundamental condition for the sustainable use of this natural resource. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize, classify and evaluate some issues about soil formation in Porto Alegre Botanical Garden, as well as relate their distribution on the landscape according to environmental characteristics. For the morphological description and collecting samples four profiles were selected (P 1 to P 4), located in the summit-shoulder transition, backslope, footslope and toeslope, respectively. Granulometric distribution of the P 1 and P 3 profiles indicated sharp textural gradient, with presence of textural and "plânico" B horizons, respectively, according to Brazilian System of Soil Classification. There is predominance of low values of pH, and low base saturation, with exception of P 4, indicating probable deposition of solution material at this area. The Fed/Fes relationship was greater in the profile located in the summit-shoulder transition (P 1), indicating higher weathering. The Feo/Fed relationship increased in P 3 and P 4 profiles, indicating greater participation of iron oxides of low crystallinity in reducing environment. The occurrence of some pedogenic processes may be inferred, like <b>lessivage</b> in P 1 (Ultic Hapludalf), due to clay skins and higher values of fine clay:total clay relationship in subsurface; ferrolysis and gleization, by low pH value and high Feo/Fed relationship in E and EB horizons of P 3 (Oxyaquic Hapludalf), being the last also present in P 4 (Humaqueptic Endoaquent), indicating gleization occurrence...|$|E

Detailed soil descriptions, and chemical, physical, and mineralogical information are necessary for planning and management. Soils of the forested area around Chefchaouen, Morocco, were described along altitudinal gradients, and classified using soil taxonomy. Nitrogen mineralization was measured in the laboratory, using anaerobic and aerobic incubations, and in the field with trenched plots. The dominant forest species were Quercus suber, Quercus perinalca, Abies marocana, Pinus pinaster var. moghrebiana, Pinus radiata, and Cedrus atlantica. Most of the soils were shallow, unstable, and were limited in their productive capability. They were classified as Entisols, Inceptisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, and Ultisols. The main soil development processes were weathering, decalcification, melanization, mineralization, Redacted for Privacy humification, rubifaction, leaching, <b>lessivage,</b> gleization, and erosion. There were some differences in clay minerals related to parent material.

40|$|The genetic {{relationship}} between a Vertisol and an associated Mollisol with an argillic horizon was studied. These soils are taxadjuncts of the Hawkins and Ostler series, respectively. They occur in the Wasatch Mountains of northern Utah and have similar parent materials, altitudes, and slope percentages. Ostler soils have a dense cover of Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) and occur preferentially on north aspects. Mule 2 ̆ 7 s ear (Wyethia amplexicaulis) is the dominant vegetation on Hawkins soils, which are most frequent on south aspects. Erosion is prevalent on Hawkins soils because the mule 2 ̆ 7 s ear does not adequately cover the soil surface during the fall, winter, and early spring. The dense oak woods and the litter cover on the Ostler soil protect it from erosion. Both soils dried sufficiently for cracks to develop in their clayey portions. The Ostler soil was drier, probably because it has more and longer transpiring vegetation than the Hawkins soil. The Ostler subsoil and the Hawkins solum both had cracks, slickensides, high clay contents, high COLE values, and smectite as the dominant clay mineral. These characteristics of high shrink-swell activity were most strongly expressed in the Hawkins soil. The Ostler subsoil clay was overlain abruptly by loam surface soil. The textural difference was attributed to <b>lessivage,</b> eolian contributions mixed with preexisting surface soil by soil animals, and in situ clay formation in the subsoil. Eolian additions were inferred from the presence of easily weathered silt and clay-size minerals in the Ostler A horizons and within the zone of mixing in the Hawkins soil. These minerals were not present or were less abundant in the Ostler subsoil and in the Hawkins C horizon. The formation of Hawkins soils (Vertisols) probably resulted from erosional exposure of the clay subsoil of Ostler soils or their precursors...|$|E

The {{results of the study}} of three earlier decades have been discussed earlier. This paper deals with the processes of synchronous production and soil formation as well as with pedogenetic activity during the fourth decade of the experiment and during the total period of 40 years. An intensive humus-accumulative process, wavy and cyclic in intensity, has continued, accompanied by the breakdown of skeletal carbonates, partial leaching of products, formation and accumulation of amorphous and crystalline nonsiliceous products of weathering, progress of argillization in situ, and slight <b>lessivage</b> of fine silt and clay within the thin top of enriched humus solum. Net accumulation of organic carbon and nitrogen was obtained by nearly equivalent amounts of humifiable issues of the production process. As these are temporally dynamic, the temporal periodicity of mineralization and humification relationships is also characteristic of synchronous pedogenesis. The low C : N ratio indicates an excellent quality of the humus formed since the beginning of primary soil formation. Against the background of the decadewise dynamic fulvicity of the humus and evident decrease in its total solubility, the transformation of Ca-humates into humins and the formation of R 2 O 3 -humic-fulvic complexes at the expense of RO-humic-fulvic complexes already during the third decade were ascertained. Intensification of the bonds of the humic-fulvic complexes with inactive sesquioxides and clay minerals and decrease in the amount of fulvic acids in the interlayeral structure of clay progressed during the fourth decade. Due to the weathering of sand fractions, an accumulation of silty-clayey particles, accompanied by an increase in the cation exchange capacity and in the specific surface area, progressed in the formed soils. The progress of Calcaric Cambisol (Rendollic Eutrochrept) can be diagnosed on the basis of data obtained during 40 years...|$|E

Graded amounts (0 [control], 25, 50, 100 mg) of litters (wheat straw, nax straw (Equi-lin(R)), zeolite (Zeolite Stall Fresh(R)), spruce sawdust and beech sawdust) {{were added to the}} tubes which were incubated for 24 h. Ammonium and nitrate concentrations, and pH, were checked on the supernatant. A preliminary experiment was carried out with zeolite to come to an ammonium balance. After adsorption of ammoniumby graded amounts of zeolite, [0 (control), 0. 25, 1, 2, 4 g], ammonium balance was assessed after two elutions with 1 N HCl. In Exp. 2, Woulff flasks were used and ammonia was trapped in a solution of 0. 1 N HCl. The preliminary experiment showed that the ammonium added and adsorbed by different amounts of zeolite was completely recovered after 2 elutions. All litters, except beech sawdust, were effective in ammonium adsorption. Especially, the straws were required in very small amounts to immobilize the added ammonium or nitrate. Furthermore, with straws the pH value decreased from pH 7. 5 - 7. 60 to pH 6. 90, and this effect was related to the amounts of material added. For each pH group, ammonia volatilization was significantly decreased (P 0, 05). Dans l'ensemble, la volatilisation de l'ammoniac (Exp. 2) a diminué avec les pailles d'une façon significative (P < 0, 05).

40|$|Le présent travail porte sur le développement et la {{validation}} du modèle conceptuel RQSM (Runoff Quality Simulation Model). Le modèle RQSM a pour objectif de simuler le <b>lessivage</b> des matières en suspension. Le modèle RQSM considère que l’accumulation est infinie sur les surfaces perméables et imperméables. Il utilise l’énergie cinétique des précipitations pour décrire la mise en suspension des particules solides. Il modélise le transport des matières en suspension à l’aide de la théorie des systèmes linéaires. Les charges de matière en suspension mesurées durant 22  événements pluvieux enregistrés à l’exutoire du sous-bassin (1) de l’arrondissement de Verdun au Canada et à l’exutoire de trois sous-bassins de la ville de Champaign aux États‑Unis ont servi à valider le modèle RQSM. Les charges de matière en suspension simulées par le modèle RQSM ont été comparées aux charges mesurées et aux charges simulées par le modèle de « rating curve » et par le modèle de <b>lessivage</b> exponentiel du logiciel SWMM. Les charges simulées à l’aide du modèle RQSM étaient comparables aux charges mesurées. De plus, la performance du modèle RQSM a été jugée équivalente à celle des modèles exponentiel et « rating curve ». Une analyse de sensibilité menée sur le modèle RQSM a mis en lumière l’influence de chaque paramètre sur la charge simulée. Urban runoff pollution due to {{suspended particles}} {{is of great}} concern for sewer system managers. Indeed, particles are {{the main source of}} urban water pollution because a large amount of chemical elements and organic wastes are associated with particles. Modelling runoff pollution due to particles is essential for the evaluation of its impact on receiving waters and for the adequate design of treatment structures. This paper presents a new conceptual model called RQSM (Runoff Quality Simulation Model) used to simulate the washoff (erosion and transport of particles) of total suspended particles (TSS) at the outlet of urban catchments. Conceptual models can accurately represent complex physical phenomena with a limited number of parameters and a simple mathematical formulation. Moreover, they can be easily calibrated and used at many sites. The build-up of solid particles in the RQSM model is infinite for pervious and impervious areas. The erosion process is related to the rainfall kinetic energy. Two relationships involving two erosion parameters are used, one for the impervious areas and the other for the pervious areas. The transport of suspended particles is described using the linear system theory. A rectangular impulse response function with a duration equal to the time of concentration describes the catchment response to an instantaneous erosion rate. Thereafter, a convolution product between the erosion rate and the rectangular impulse response function is used to compute loads of TSS at the catchment outlet. The mathematical formulation of the RQSM model has three advantages. Firstly, it describes the washoff of TSS by using only rainfall intensity. Secondly, it treats the washoff of pervious and impervious areas separately. Finally, it uses only two parameters to describe the washoff. The RQSM model was validated with the help of 285  TSS data points monitored during 22  rainfall events. Four rainfall events were monitored in the subcatchment (1) of Verdun borough in Canada and 18  rainfall events were monitored on three subcatchments in Champaign city (USA). The catchment areas varied between 6. 8 and 177  ha, the catchment slopes between 0. 4 % and 1 %, and the ratio of directly drained impervious area between 0. 19 and 0. 58. Land use was residential in two catchments and commercial for the other ones. The first step in the RQSM model validation was to calibrate the two erosion parameters. This step was realized using 11  measured TSS pollutographs. The erosion parameter for impervious areas was calibrated first for low intensity rainfall. The erosion parameter for pervious areas was then calibrated for high intensity rainfall. The second validation step was to simulate the TSS load resulting from 11  other rainfalls. The simulated loads of the RQSM model were compared to the measured loads. They were also compared to the simulated loads obtained with the rating curve model and with the SWMM exponential washoff model. Comparisons were made using three performance criteria: the Nash criterion, the ratio of the simulated TSS mass divided by the measured TSS mass (RM), and the peak charge ratio (RP). Reasonable agreement was reached between loads computed with the RQSM model and measured loads. The mean RM was 1. 08 and the standard deviation was 35 %. Moreover, the Nash criterion was greater than 0. 6 for 50 % of simulated events. Unfortunately, the number of events was insufficient to detect statistically significant differences in accuracy, between the RQSM model, the rating curve and the exponential model. Nevertheless, a qualitative study based on the value of the three performance criteria showed that the results given by the RQSM model are equivalent to the results given by the SWMM exponential wash off model. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the RQSM model. In order to achieve the sensitivity analysis, reference values were attributed to the parameters of the RQSM model. The values of the RQSM parameters were then changed individually and the resulting change in the Nash criterion was noted. The change in the Nash value indicates that for rainfalls of high intensity and short duration, the RQSM method is particularly sensitive to the time of concentration. In the other cases, the erosion parameter of impervious areas was the most sensitive parameter...|$|E

L’objectif principal est l’évaluation quantitative des mécanismes de transfert de Composés Organiques Volatils (COV) depuis la zone non saturée vers la nappe dans le cas d’une source de pollution localisée en zone non saturée. Le cas du transport du trichloroéthylène (TCE) a été abordé où une analyse comparative du transfert du TCE depuis la zone non saturée vers la nappe via la frange capillaire est présentée en étudiant les deux mécanismes : dispersion et dissolution.

Dans la seconde expérience, l’impact sur la pollution de la nappe du <b>lessivage</b> des vapeurs par une pluie contrôlée est quantifié. Les résultats montrent que la dispersion passive des vapeurs peut causer une pollution significative de l’eau de la nappe, et ce, malgré la lenteur du processus de diffusion dans la partie inférieure de la frange capillaire suffisamment saturée en eau. Le <b>lessivage</b> des vapeurs par la pluie provoque une pollution de nappe plus importante et plus étendue.

Les résultats expérimentaux et analytiques mettent en évidence, d’une part, le rôle d’écran joué par la frange capillaire contre le transfert de la pollution vers la nappe, et d’autre part, l’augmentation significative du degré et de l’étendue de la pollution de la nappe en cas de <b>lessivage</b> des vapeurs par les eaux de pluie. Two large-scale experiments {{were conducted on}} a controlled artificial aquifer referred to as SCERES (Site Contrôlé Expérimental de Recherche pour la Réhabilitation des Eaux et des Sols: 25  x  12  x  3  m). The experimental tool SCERES was completely buried in the subsurface {{in order to get}} stable temperature conditions in the aquifer. The hydraulic gradient, flow rate, visualization of the water table and water sampling were managed and monitored in two technical pits located at the upstream and downstream ends of the SCERES basin. It was packed with a main layer of uniform quartz sand and a 0. 5  m-deep drainage layer {{at the bottom of the}} basin having hydraulic conductivities of 8  x  10 ‑ 4 and 6  x  10 ‑ 3  m/s respectively. The quartz sand had a mean grain diameter of 0. 45  mm, a total porosity of 0. 4 and a uniformity coefficient of 2. 1; its longitudinal dispersivity was determined in laboratory column experiments to be approximately 1  mm. The aquifer is composed of a 1  m-thick saturated zone and a 2  m-thick unsaturated zone, making it possible to monitor the propagation of vapours in this zone. The hydraulic gradient of the groundwater was fixed at 0. 003  m/m, which corresponded to a flow rate of 0. 5  m 3 /h and an average velocity of approximately 0. 4  m/day. The thickness of the capillary fringe was estimated to be approximately 0. 25  m as deduced from water profile measurements by exploration with a TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) probe. In the capillary fringe, water saturation at depths of 1. 85 and 1. 95  m was approximately 57 % and more than 90 %, respectively. The contaminant chosen for these experiments was trichloroethylene (TCE), because it is among the most frequently detected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in subsurface environments. TCE as the pure phase was injected 0. 35  m beneath the soil surface of SCERES with an experimental design that maintained a uniform infiltration of TCE in the vadose zone for 15  min. The chosen injection device was built from a stainless steel tank (0. 58  m diameter and 0. 15  m height), on which 31 screened brass rods were fixed at the bottom and separated by a distance of 0. 1  m. Each rod contained four injection holes of 0. 2  mm diameter in the lower extremity (JELLALI, 2000; JELLALI et al., 2001). In order to prevent TCE volatilization from the device during injection, the TCE volume in the injection tank was covered with a 0. 02  m thick water layer. The resulting vapour and aqueous phases were monitored along with temperature and moisture content in order to investigate the mass transfer of VOC from the unsaturated zone to groundwater. The originality of this research was based on the fact that the controlled SCERES site allowed the study of transfer phenomena in the capillary fringe, which is difficult to reach in a reduced laboratory physical model or in a real contaminated site. This characteristic offers an exceptional opportunity for data acquisition in controlled conditions between laboratory and site scales. This aspect is of importance due to the fact that in this capillary zone, water content varies with depth and this situation causes changes in flow rate affecting the intensity of the pollution flux. This study aimed to quantify, in an experimental way, the pollution flux from the unsaturated zone towards the groundwater. In the first experiment, carried out in the summer (July-September), the infiltrated TCE volume was 5  L. In the second experiment, carried out in autumn (October-December), the TCE volume was 3  L in order to increase the distance between the pollution source and the water-table. These volumes were selected on the basis of previous knowledge of TCE residual saturations determined in laboratory column tests (JELLALI, 2000) and in order to obtain a pollution source limited to the unsaturated zone. The first experiment was conducted without water infiltration to study the dispersion of TCE vapours across the capillary fringe, while the second experiment was carried out with a limited rain infiltration in order to investigate the effect of vapour leaching on groundwater pollution. The transport of TCE was monitored in the vadose zone, the capillary fringe and the groundwater where a comparative analysis of two mechanisms of TCE transfer from the unsaturated zone to groundwater via the capillary fringe was carried out: dispersion and dissolution. In both cases, the coupling of measurements of pollutant concentrations in the unsaturated zone, the capillary fringe and the groundwater of SCERES allowed us to take into account the mechanisms intervening near the source area, on a scale close to that of a real pollution problem. The concentration of dissolved TCE was analyzed by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) after liquid-liquid extraction with hexane. The online quantitative analysis of TCE vapours was performed by a multigas monitor equipped with a photoacoustic infrared detector. For the first experiment, the TCE mass fluxes from the vadose zone to groundwater were quantified using the method of JOHNSON and PANKOW (1992) where we applied the analytical solution of GRATHWOHL (1998) and incorporated parameters due to the capillary fringe. For the second experiment, we used the numerical code HYDRUS that allowed the simulation of one-dimensional flow in the unsaturated zone. In this example, the TCE mass fluxes leaving the unsaturated zone to the groundwater due to rain infiltration were obtained from the knowledge of the infiltration flow rate and the measured concentrations at the top of the capillary fringe. The observed results indicate that the hydrodynamic dispersion of TCE vapours within the capillary fringe (vertical dispersion) can cause significant groundwater pollution despite the slowness of the aqueous diffusion in the lower region of the highly water saturated capillary fringe. Vapour leaching due to controlled water infiltration causes more significant groundwater pollution in degree and extent than vertical dispersion. The experimental and analytical results demonstrate, on the one hand, the role of the capillary fringe as a barrier against pollution transfer to groundwater when the only mechanism is hydrodynamic dispersion, and on the other hand, significant enhancement of groundwater contamination due to the capture and leaching of vapours from the vadose zone by infiltrating water...|$|E
40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Like {{many of the}} world’s {{subtropical}} regions, the Western Cape of South Africa {{is highly}} sensitive to oscillations in the earth’s climate system triggered by major tectonic changes, local variations in orbital forcing, better known as Milankovitch cycles, and its position at the interface between temperate and tropical circulation systems. Regrettably, a dearth of reliable and continuous palaeoenvironmental records means that relatively {{little is known about}} how regional environments have been impacted over centennial to multi-millennial timescales. Palaeosols constitute an important stratigraphic marker for past environments and may provide useful validation of pedogenic and other earth system process models. However, the characterisation and analysis of palaeosols has been a largely neglected source of information in the Western Cape, South Africa. This thesis aims to improve the understanding of the environments and climate dynamics using evidences from palaeosols. Various palaeosol-based proxies including geochemistry, mineralogical, macro- and micromorphological, δ 13 C and δ 18 O isotope, and selected physico-chemical properties of palaeosols were studied and records obtained for four sites in the Western Cape. A number of chemical weathering indices and geochemical climofunctions were used to calculate weathering intensities, pedogenesis, palaeotemperature and palaeoprecipitation for the various locations using geochemical and stable isotope data. Results {{of this study indicate that}} palaeosol-based proxies have the potential to provide snapshots into the palaeoenvironments and palaeoclimate of Western Cape and may complement previous studies done with other proxies such as pollens and diatoms. For example, the interpretation of the pedofeatures (calcareousness, vertic, gleyic, illuviation) - from the micromorphology - of thepalaeosols suggests cyclic patterns of erosion and deposition that correlate with climate changes of the past. Podzolization and laterization are the principal pedogenic processes responsible for the red palaeosol formation at the Cape Peninsula, while calcification and salinization are accountable for the Quaternary palaeosols. Inferences of gleization and <b>lessivage</b> are only evident in the mid-Miocene palaeosol at Langebaanweg. At LBW, pedogenesis was more advanced in the Mid-Miocene and Early Pliocene layers signifying a more humid and warmer climate with more stable landscape. Two major regional climate cycles were evident at the Cape Peninsula: relatively warm and humid subtropical climate which gave rise to the pedogenically modified buried red palaeosol and dry semi-arid Mediterranean climate under which the soils overlying the stone line is currently forming, as seen from the poor horizonation and translocation of materials. Clay mineral assemblages suggest the Quaternary palaeoclimate of the Western Cape has been predominantly characterised by low precipitation and active coastal erosion, which jointly accounted for poor soil profile development. This is in agreement with the early reports obtained from marine records of the African continent (e. g. deMenocal, 2005). A cross plot of the δ 13 C and δ 18 O of the carbonate palaeosols indicates they all formed under strong marine influence and C 3 plants have been dominant since late Quaternary...|$|E

Notons que ce microcrustacé marin est {{sensible}} à la pollution mais résistant aux caractéristiques physico-chimiques des types d'eaux testés (salinité et température notamment). On évalue ensuite les effets de ces eaux sur la production larvaire en 10 jours et sur l'ingestion en 4 jours par les copépodes d'une suspension de Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Nous observons ici, pour des lots de sédiments provenant de la région de Marseille, des réductions de la production de larves variant de 61 % (Les Embiez) à 90 % (Vaine). Le test "consommation d'algues", bien moins sensible aboutit pour les mêmes stations à des réductions de 19 % à 35 %. Le test "production larvaire" du fait de sa plus grande sensibilité doit être préféré au test "consommation d'algues". Most pollutants discharged {{into the}} sea are found in sediments, generally after temporary fixation in planktonic organisms. The slightest discharge leaves a trace in the soft bottoms. Thus, it may be said that these behave as good "data storage indicators" testifying {{to the degree of}} pollution present. Sediments therefore represent a privileged field in research on the state of pollution in the aquatic ecosystem. How can the degree of pollution in this field be evaluated?A chemical analysis of pollutants in sediments is a good means of investigation to detect of degradation in the quality of waters. Most pollutants however are difficult to detect and dose. Moreover, in many cases dosage is tedious and costly. It is {{from this point of view}} that biological assays were considered essential. Interstitial water or water used to wash a sediment was placed in contact with batches of 50 ovigerous females of the copepod Tigriopus brevicornis. This marine microcrustacean is known to be sensitive to pollution, though resisting the physical and chemical effects of the waters tested (salinity and temperature, in particular). An evaluation was the made on the effects of these waters; first on larval production during a period of ten days, and then on ingestion by copepeds of a suspension of Pheodactylum tricornutum for four days. The results obtained here with batches of sediment from the Marseilles region show that the larval production test is the most sensitive one. Indeed, the inhibition percentages found by the larval production test range from 35 to 100 % (figure 1), whereas they vary from 5 to 55 % with the algae consumption test (figure 2). With the larval production test, it is possible to classify sediments according to their ecological quality. From this test, moreover, the presence of harmful substances in the sediments can be rapidly detected. Being reproductible and not expensive, it supplements the far too restrictive traditional chemical analyses. When applied to estuarine sedimentary zones, combined with other tests, it should help establish a quality coefficient for sediments based on experimentation...|$|E
40|$|L'exploitation du charbon dans le Nord-Pas-de-Calais (France) a engendré le dépôt d'importantes quantités de résidus miniers sous forme de terrils, essentiellement constitués de schistes houillers. Le <b>lessivage</b> de ces stériles par les eaux météoriques et l'oxydation des sulfures de fer contenus sont {{susceptibles}} de contribuer à l'enrichissement en sulfates et métaux associés de l'aquifère de la craie, principale ressource en eau de la région. Des analyses chimiques et isotopiques (S & C) ont été effectuées sur des prélèvements d'eau {{en amont}} et en aval hydraulique des sites d'étude ainsi que sur la fraction minérale des terrils. Afin de déterminer les modalités d'infiltration des eaux météoriques au sein des terrils, des prospections radio-magnétotelluriques, couplées à des mesures de perméabilité et de granularité ont été effectuées. Les analyses ont permis de mettre en évidence que le <b>lessivage</b> des terrils entraîne un flux d'ions sulfate et de carbone vers l'aquifère de la craie. L'approche géophysique a permis de mettre en évidence un phénomène d'infiltration des eaux météoriques. Elle a montré en outre l'existence de barrières de perméabilité en profondeur. Il apparaît donc que les eaux météoriques, lorsqu'elles s'infiltrent dans le terril, ne peuvent pénétrer à plus de quelques mètres de profondeur. L'existence de zones imperméables, en limitant l'infiltration des eaux en profondeur, limite également la quantité de sulfure potentiellement oxydable et donc la quantité de sulfates entraînée vers l'aquifère de la craie. In the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region (France), coal mining activity has induced a build-up of many mine tips. The tip materials are dominantly composed of siltstones, locally rich in iron sulfide. Weathering of pyrite {{might be expected}} to release sulfate ions and associated metals within the run-off waters down to the underlying aquifer, which is composed of a thick Cretaceous chalk formation. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) to determine the possible role of the mine tips in the sulfate mineralization of the chalk aquifer and; (2) to assess the amount of waste material that can be leached and may supply sulfate ions to the water table. Two sites were selected for this study. Site 1 rests directly on the Senonian-Turonian chalk, whereas site 2 lies on sandy-clayey Cenozoic formations overlying the chalk formations (Figs. 1 - 2). Water samples were collected within the chalk aquifer (Fig. 3), which represents a free water table except for where the almost impermeable Cenozoic formations confine this table (site 2). Rock samples were collected at the surface and at a depth of < 12 m at both sites. Various analyses were performed on these samples including mineralogical analyses carried out on both the bulk fraction and the clayey fraction, as well as elementary analyses of total carbon, total sulfur and CaCO 3 contents. Elemental analyses were carried out by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES: major and minor elements) or Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS: trace elements). Chemical and isotopic (C, S) analyses were performed on water sampled from upstream and downstream of the mine tips. In situ measurements were also carried out during sampling. Finally, to assess the degree of rainwater seeping through the coal mine tips, two radio-magnetotelluric surveys were carried out in September and November, 1999 following rainy periods. Permeability measurements and grain-size analyses of subsurface samples were also performed at site 2. The carbon and sulfur contents showed superficial leaching on the mine tips (Fig. 4). The use of sulfur isotopes as tracers of the sulfate origin allowed identification of two sources for the two sites: a "mine tip" source with a slightly negative d 34 S (- 2. 8 ‰ to - 3. 9 ‰), which corresponds to the oxidation of sulfides contained by the Carboniferous shales, and another source (d 34 S=- 20 ‰) corresponding to the gypsum of the Cenozoic formations, which was only present at site 2 (Figs. 5 & 6). This study outlined different behavior for the tips of the two sites. At site 1, where there is a free water-table zone, the mine tip leachates carry sulfate ions directly to the water table, whereas {{in the case of a}} confined aquifer zone such as the one present at site 2, a proportion of the sulfate was reduced once exported to the water table (the redox potential showed negative values; Table 1). This suggestion of bacterially-mediated reduction is supported by the d 34 S of the sulfate content in the water table. The bacterial activity was fueled by the organic carbon release that accompanies the sulfur leaching on the mine tips. This carbon contribution was confirmed by the 14 C activity that characterized the chalk aquifer waters at the upstream region of the mine tip and noticeably decreased downstream. The decrease is a result of the supply of "dead carbon" from the mine tips (Fig. 7). The oxidation of pyrite also results in H+ production. However, the pH decrease observed downstream from the sites was very slight. Waters derived from leaching of the mine tip seeped through the buffered environment of the chalk aquifer. The distribution of metal content showed no surface to depth gradient for samples taken from both sites. The only evidence of "neutral acid mining drainage" (NAMD) was the sulfate amounts exported, and the increase in Mg, Ca, HCO 3 - and Sr contents observed downstream from the sites (Table 2 a-b). The decrease in the apparent resistivity of radio-magnetotelluric profiles demonstrated that rain waters could deeply penetrate in some parts of the tip at site 2 (Fig. 9). Considering the constant nature of the waste material (grain size and porosity), a decrease in resistivity accompanied by an increase in conductivity between the two surveys indicated water seepage. Permeability measurements showed the occurrence of deep permeability barriers (Fig. 10), limiting not only rainwater seepage, but also the amount of mobilizable sulfide and consequently the amount of sulfates exported to the chalk aquifer. Grain size is not the only reason for the permeable or impermeable nature of waste material - the grain ordering and the compaction of levels at depth also have a role...|$|E
40|$|Dans cette thématique {{concernant}} le transport solide des cours d’eau, il nous semble opportun de résumer le cadre général et d’y situer notre approche. Les formules classiques du transport solide évaluent le débit en matériaux du lit (charriage et suspension) à partir de ses déformations. Elles ne permettent pas d’estimer le débit des matériaux provenant directement du <b>lessivage</b> des versants et qui transite sans interaction avec le lit. Dans cet article, nous considérons uniquement la phase en suspension "MES" mesurée sans distinction à priori de l’origine des grains qui la constitue : provenance directe du bassin versant (phase directe) et (ou) reprise des stocks disponibles dans le lit (phase différée). Le bassin hydrographique du Timis-Béga (Roumanie) est particulièrement bien équipé pour le suivi des débits de 28 sous bassins et le contrôle des flux de MES de douze d’entre eux. De plus, son contexte physiographique nous {{permet de}} penser que la phase directe est prépondérante. Le protocole de mesure des flux de MES prévoit, entre autres, une densification variable des observations selon l’intensité des crues liquides. Ces considérations précédentes nous permettent d’envisager une modélisation statistique des apports solides en MES des sous-bassins du Timis-Béga. Celle-ci est directement inspirée des connaissances acquises sur la modélisation statistique "QdF" des régimes hydrologiques des bassins versants. Sur l’exemple du sous-bassin du Béga à Balint, qui draine une superficie de 1064 km 2, nous retiendrons deux principaux résultats issus de la transposition du concept QdF aux débits solides QMESdF : Les analyses statistiques des régimes liquide et solide montrent que les débits solides de MES ne sont pas simplement proportionnels aux débits liquides mais croissent plus rapidement. Les deux lois de distributions privilégiées, Pareto généralisée pour les MES et exponentielle pour les débits, permettent de le justifier. Le temps de montée des hydrogrammes de projet liquide ou solide est quasiment identique, autrement dit nous vérifions la quasi concomitance de leurs débits de pointe. Ce résultat n’est possible que si le débit solide de MES provient essentiellement du <b>lessivage</b> des versants, ce qui était supposé à priori. With respect to sediment transport, we detailed the general framework and how our approach contributes to these developments. Starting from the single traditional relation for the bed material load, specialists in river hydraulics cannot assess sediment yield of basins, when {{it involves the}} auto-suspension of fine sediments coming mainly from slope erosion (wash load). This latter estimate is needed for simulating the transfer of sediments and possible deposition in certain areas, particularly when a strong slowing down occurs. The Timis-Bega drainage basin (Romania) is fairly well equipped for the monitoring of discharge and suspended materials (sediment discharge). The hydrometric network includes 28 stations, of which 12 allow a monitoring of wash load. Moreover, its physiographic characteristics led us {{to think that the}} wash load dominates. Thus we assumed that sediment discharge was correlated with the physiographic features of the catchment area. The protocol for the measurement of the suspended sediment load was intensified during the floods. Thus, statistical modelling of the sub-basin sediment yields could be performed. The current study was directly inspired by the knowledge obtained in the domain of statistical modelling that describes hydrological regimes. The approach adopted was based on the flood-duration-frequency (QdF) analysis that takes into account the temporal variability of floods. The QdF approach analyses maximum average flows (Vd) over various durations (d), equivalent to intensity-duration-frequency (IdF) curves commonly used for rainfall analysis. The proposed model allows QdF curves V(d, T) for a given basin to be estimated using a minimum number of parameters. When the statistical law is the exponential law, this model contains only three parameters, due to observed scale invariance properties. The ∆ parameter that informs about the shape of the flood hydrograph is consequently the flood characteristic duration of the studied basin. The two parameters of the exponential maximum flood distribution for d= 0 (a 0 and x 0) and ∆ were fitted to sample discharges (Vd). This model is called a converging QdF model because of the observed convergence of distributions towards small return periods. This model is also useful for the determination of threshold discharges (Qd). The analytical formulation of the V(d,T) model can be derived according to d, in order to obtain a Q(d,T) model. This model then permits the calculation of the hydrograph for any return period (T) and any duration (d). The regionalization of the sediment yield was achieved {{within the framework of the}} Riverlife European project, in collaboration with NIHWM (National Institute of Hydrology and Water Management of Romania). Initially, local models were built. As an example, starting from the Bega sub-basin at Balint, with a surface of 1, 064 km 2, our intent was to present the transposition of the discharge-duration-frequency analysis concept (or QdF) to the wash load QMES dF. The latter relates to the measurement procedure, the statistical processing of the observed data QMES (t), and to the building of the discharge hydrographs of the associated projects. The main results were:- The statistical analyses of floods and sediment discharges show that the wash loads were not simply proportional to the discharge, but rather they increased more rapidly. The selection of the appropriate distribution laws (Pareto generalised for the QMESdF model (four parameters) and exponential for the QdF model) reinforced this result. - The lag-time was the same for both hydrographs with respect to flood and sediment discharge. This result can be achieved if the sediment transport comes primarily from the scrubbing of the slopes (wash load), which was hypothesised a priori. However, falling limb of the sediment hydrograph decreases more quickly than for the discharge hydrograph (∆MES is lower than ∆). The Bega sub-basin example at Balint was a first test towards the regional modelling of the contributions to sediment discharge in the catchment area of Timis-Béga. This flood and sediment discharge regionalization is necessary for the study of the protection of the town of Timisoara against flooding...|$|E
40|$|La présence de métaux dans les boues municipales demeure l'obstacle majeure à leur {{valorisation}} comme fertilisant agricole ou forestier. L'utilisation des boues en milieu forestier diminue certes les risques de contamination de la chaîne alimentaire humaine. Cependant, nos connaissances sur le comportement à long terme des métaux ajoutés aux sols forestiers sont encore très limitées. Le risque de <b>lessivage</b> des métaux vers les écosystèmes aquatiques situés en aval des zones traitées doit être évalué. Cet article propose une comparaison des risques de contamination de l'eau selon que l'application des boues s'effectue en forêt ou en milieu agricole. Les concentrations de métaux dans les boues municipales, leurs formes et leur mobilité dans les sols amendés sont passées en revue. Et finalement, les normes québécoises qui ont été établies pour protéger le milieu récepteur contre les métaux présents dans les boues sont comparées à celles recommandées par l'U. S. EPA. The {{presence of}} metals in municipal sewage sludge {{is still a}} major obstacle to their land application. Forest land application of sludge reduces the possibility of metals entering the human food chain. Present knowledge of their long-term behavior in forest soil is however limited. The risk of metals leaching to the aquatic ecosystem situated downstream from treated zone must be evaluated. This paper present {{a comparison of the}} risks of water contamination when sludges are applied to forests instead of cropland. The levels of metals in municipal sludge, their form and their mobility in sludge-treated soil are reviewed. Finally, the regulations of the Province of Quebec that have been established to protect forest land are compared to the recommendations of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Although sludge applications to forest land reduce the risk of human foodchain contamination, properties of forest soils (low pH, low cation exchange capacity (CEC), presence of large continuous pores) could represent an increased hazard of metals leaching to aquatic ecosystems. Metal concentrations in sludge vary considerably depending on the source of the sludge. Metals found in sludge are predominantly associated with the solid phase, while soluble and exchangeable forms generally represent less than 10 % of the total metals. Short term studies have revealed that metals tend to accumulate in the upper layers of soil, but few studies have evaluated long-term metal mobility or bioavailability. Many factors can contribute to an increase mobility (pH, oxidation-reduction potential, organic matter decomposition). The risk of aquatic ecosystem contamination by aluminum leached from sludge-treated soils hasn't yet been evaluated. It seems, however, that the risk exists if the soil become more acidic after sludge decomposition. Limits on the amount of metals allowed in sludge have been fixed by many countries. Nevertheless, given the wide variation in the standards used to regulate the allowable content of metal in sludge or sludge-treated soils, disagreement presently exist among regulatory agencies. For example, the maximum cadmium limit allowed in sludge destined to be used as forest fertilizer in Quebec is 15 mg kg- 1, whereas it is 85 mg kg- 1 in the United States. Different philosophical views on environmental protection (zero tolerance or tolerance of a certain level of metals in soil), as well as the organism chosen when standards are set, are responsible for this inconsistency. Before sewage sludge application to forests becomes a common practice, the associated risks of metals leaching to the aquatic ecosystem must be evaluated. Long-term studies should be undertaken in order to establish safe standards for applying sludge in a forest environment. Such additional efforts will enable good quality sludge to be considered as a usable and valuable resource in forestry...|$|E
40|$|Les outils mathématiques sont de plus en plus utilisés pour simuler la {{contamination}} d'origine agricole des eaux souterraines. Le modèle AgriFlux permet, à l'aide du module PestiFlux, de simuler les processus responsables du devenir des pesticides dans le sol: ruissellement, volatilisation, adsorption/désorption rapide, adsorption/désorption lente, complexation par la matière organique dissoute, biodégradation en sous-produits, hydrolyse, drainage et <b>lessivage.</b> AgriFlux est utilisé pour simuler le devenir de l'atrazine et du dééthylatrazine sur une parcelle expérimentale de la région de Québec (Québec, Canada) cultivée en maïs sucré (Zea mays, L.) traité à l'atrazine. Des prélèvements d'eau interstitielle ont été réalisés (1986 - 1990) à l'aide de lysimètres avec succion (0, 5 et 1, 0 m de profondeur) et analysés pour leur contenu en atrazine et dééthylatrazine. De manière générale, AgriFlux reproduit bien l'évolution des concentrations mesurées, dans {{le temps}} et dans le profil de sol (r= 0, 76). Certains pics de concentrations observés sur le terrain ne sont toutefois pas représentés ou sont décalés dans le temps, ce qui pourrait être attribué à une sous-estimation de la variabilité spatiale des paramètres. Le rapport dééthylatrazine/atrazine est relativement bien simulé en 1988 à 0, 5 m, mais est moins représentatif pour les autres données, ce qui pourrait être dû à une certaine imprécision dans la simulation de la biodégradation. Une analyse de sensibilité du modèle aux variations de différents paramètres a montré que le paramètre le plus influent dans les conditions testées est la constante de biodégradation. Les résultats obtenus montrent la pertinence d'AgriFlux (PestiFlux) dans la simulation du devenir des pesticides dans le sol et donc des risques de contamination des eaux souterraines en région agricole. Groundwater and surface water contamination by agricultural practices {{has become an}} increasingly preoccupying problem. Mathematical models are valuable tools to help prevent this type of pollution from non-point sources. AgriFlux is a mechanistic, stochastic model simulating the fate of agricultural contaminants in the unsaturated zone at {{the scale of the}} agricultural field. AgriFlux, through the PestiFlux module, now simulates pesticide transformations in the soil from their application to the field until their leaching with percolating water. The processes represented include volatilization, complexation by the soluble organic matter, instantaneous adsorption and desorption, slow adsorption and desorption to less available sites, biodegradation to by-products and hydrolysis to non-toxic compounds. The pesticide freely dissolved in solution or complexed with soluble organic matter can be mobilized with runoff, drainage and leaching waterAn application of PestiFlux to an experimental field near Quebec City (Quebec, Canada) is presented. The soil is a well-drained loamy sand cropped from 1986 to 1990 with sweet corn (Zea Mays, L.) receiving atrazine treatments (1. 6 to 1. 8 kg. ha- 1 of active ingredient). Interstitial water was sampled using 12 suction lysimeters located at both the 0. 5 and 1. 0 m depths in the soil. All stations were sampled monthly in 1986 and 1987 and the collected water was analyzed for atrazine alone. In 1988, the sampling (every two weeks) was limited to the lysimeters which had previously shown the highest pesticide concentrations (two lysimeters at 0. 5 m and one lysimeter at 1. 0 m). The interstitial water was analyzed for atrazine and deethylatrazine. There was no sampling in 1989. In 1990, all stations were sampled on a weekly basis and a composite water sample obtained for each depth was analyzed for both compounds. Most of the pesticide-related parameters required to run PestiFlux were deduced from the literature, {{with the exception of the}} biodegradation rate coefficient which was estimated from field monitoring of atrazine. The parameters required to simulate water fluxes and plant uptake were the same as those used in a previous application of AgriFlux to the same experimental field for the simulation of nitrate fluxes (LAROCQUE and BANTON, 1995). Results show that PestiFlux generally represents well the measured atrazine and deethylatrazine concentrations in the interstitial water at 0. 5 and 1. 0 m. A linear regression using all measured and simulated concentrations indiscriminately gives a correlation coefficient of 0. 76 when using the logarithm of concentrations. The temporal evolution of the pesticide concentrations is relatively well simulated, especially on the long term with an adequate representation of the increase in pesticide concentrations in the soil profile at 1. 0 m. This increase is probably due to the fallow existing in 1985 which would have favored leaching of adsorbed pesticide below the soil profile, leaving only low residual pesticide concentrations. Over one growing season, the transport of atrazine and deethylatrazine is well represented by the model, although some peak concentrations are delayed or attenuated. This result could be due to an underestimation of the spatial variability of the different parameters. It is possible that the coefficient of variation of 10 % adopted may not represent adequately the spatial variation of some parameters. Nevertheless, most measured concentrations of both compounds are within the mean simulated concentrations and included between two standard deviations. For 1988, most of the measured concentrations are located near the upper limit of the envelope curve which is consistent with the fact that the sampled lysimeters were those yielding the highest concentrations. The simulated concentrations show a generally good representation of the relative atrazine and deethylatrazine concentrations. The ratio of the mean deethylatrazine to atrazine concentrations provides a closer look at the adequacy between the simulated concentrations of both compounds. A comparison between the measured and the simulated ratios shows a good adequacy at 0. 5 m in 1988 and both over- and under-estimation of the ratio for the other available data. This is probably due to an imprecision in the simulation of biodegradation rates during some periods. All the parameters used in the simulation have an important uncertainty, due to the significant spatial variation of the parameters in the field and to the imprecise knowledge of some pesticide characteristics. In order to identify the parameters which have the most important influence on the results, an analysis of the sensitivity of the cumulated leaching mass of both compounds at 1. 0 m to variations of the different input parameters was performed. The results show that the biodegradation rate has the greatest influence on the results. This is probably due to the importance of this process in the simulated situation. This result confirms the importance of an adequate quantification of this parameter and of its spatial variation. PestiFlux offers a comprehensive representation of pesticide transformations in the soil and is easy to use. As a module of AgriFlux, it has the advantage of being integrated into a well-tested and reliable modeling environment. The presented simulation results show that, apart from some limits due to the quantification of some of the parameters, PestiFlux is a useful and comprehensive tool for estimating potential groundwater pollution by pesticides...|$|E
40|$|L'étude hydrochimique des eaux de la nappe libre de la Chaouia côtière montre une teneur {{excessive}} en sels dans ces eaux, spécialement des chlorures (jusqu'à 3 g. l- 1). Cette salinité élevée peut, à terme, nuire gravement à l'économie de la région qui se consacre essentiellement à la culture maraîchère sous irrigation. Des mesures isotopiques (18 O/ 16 O, 2 H/ 1 H) couplées aux éléments chimiques, notamment Br-/Cl-, excluent l'hypothèse d'une intrusion marine généralisée. L'existence d'une paléosalinité (SHIVANNA andal., 1993) n'est pas soutenue par les mesures des teneurs en isotopes radioactifs (3 H, 14 C). Il en est de même pour le <b>lessivage</b> de dépôts chlorurés préexistants dans les sédiments. L'apport essentiel en chlorures provient de l'altération de la roche mère, des fertilisants et des embruns marins lessivés par suite de l'irrigation et entraînés vers la nappe par percolation. Le recyclage de l'eau souterraine depuis au moins trente ans, par l'irrigation, n'a fait qu'augmenter cette salinité. Toutefois en bordure de l'océan quelques puits semblent montrer la présence d'eau marine, en effet les débits d'exhaure des puits sont à la limite d'exploitation de la nappe et toute augmentation de débits dans ces puits engendrera fatalement une invasion marine généralisée. In West of Morocco, {{the coastal}} plain Chaouia is located between Casablanca and Azemmour (south-west of Casablanca) over a distance of 65 km (Figure 1). This plain aquifer spreads over 1100 km 2 in semi-arid climatic conditions with about 370 mm. year- 1 of mean precipitation and 17 °C in mean air temperature. Irrigated agricultural farming is the main economic resource of the region. The only source of water is provided by highly mineralized groundwaters, which are harmful for the rural population and agricultural irrigation. The chloride content represents the main contribution of the salinity of ground waters. Most of the previous authors and authorities have attributed the high mineralization to seawater intrusion (YOUNSI, 1994). The objective {{of the present study}} is to determine the cause of salinity, considering three hypothesis: seawater intrusion, leaching of salts and evaporation of water. The environmental isotopes (2 H, 18 O, 3 H, 14 C) have been used with hydrogeology together with major and minor ion chemistry to identify the source of salinity and to estimate the residence time of ground water. Moreover an environmental isotope study was carried out in order to identify the origin of the salinization (MERLIVAT et al., 1970; COTECCHIA et al., 1974; GASPARINI, 1989; CABRAL et al., 1991; GOMEZ-MARTOS et al., 1993; HASHASH et al., 1995). Both isotopic studies and Br-/Cl- ratios have been used to identify the salinity origin. The potential sources for this salinization are: seawater encroachment as a consequence of intense exploitation of the aquifer, dissolution of the halite from the several diapiric structures intruded in the aquifers. The isotopic waters sampling were carried out in August 1993 on several wells (Figure 2), in order to study the variations of the oxygen- 18, deuterium, tritium and carbon- 14 isotopes. Table 1 shows the results of the isotope and chemical analyses carried out. As oxygen- 18 data for local precipitation are not available in Morocco, the oxygen- 18 and deuterium mean contents in precipitation were taken from stations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network near the studied area (Gibraltar, Faro, Ponta Delgada) and/or deduced from published isotopic composition of shallow groundwaters in Morocco (KABBAJ et al., 1978; LOUVA and BICHARA, 1990; BOUCHAOU et al., 1995); the mean values for the precipitation are - 4. 0 ± 0. 5 ‰ and - 23. 0 ± 2 ‰ (vs. V-SMOW) respectively. The oxygen- 18 and deuterium mean contents in ground waters are - 3. 7 ± 0. 3 ‰ and - 20. 1 ± 1. 8 ‰ (vs. V-SMOW) respectively. The relationship between the oxygen- 18 and deuterium contents of some groundwater samples indicates a good fitting along the world meteoric line (CRAIG, 1961) (Figure 3), suggesting that the ground waters are mainly of meteoric origin. There is no indication of possible mixing with seawater because there is no indication of a relation between the oxygen- 18 content of the wells and their distance from the sea (Figure 4). On the other hand, no isotopic enrichment is noted during the infiltration of water from precipitation and/or irrigation. The diagram d 18 O-Cl- (Figure 5) shows that all the data do not lie along a theoretical mixing line with seawater and/or an evaporation line. Every 18 O data point is very close to the isotopic values of precipitation [- 4. 0 ± 0. 5 ‰ (vs. V-SMOW) ] but with a large scatter in Cl- content. In this zone, an increase in the salt concentration is not accompanied by an isotopic effect. The sources of the chloride must be found among the products of rock alteration, fertilizers and marine airborne salts. The recycling of salt water by irrigation increases the salinity of soil and ground waters. Halite is characterized by a very low Br-/Cl- ratio(0. 183 x 10 - 3). Water in some wells presents Br-/Cl- ratios similar to those of halite, but most of the groundwater samples have a greater ratio. These results argue against the hypothesis of dissolution of halite in the aquifer formation. But the Br-/Cl- ratio alone is not sufficient for detecting a possible seawater intrusion. During August 1994, 20 drilled wells were sampled over the study area for determining tritium concentrations. Carbon- 14 activities were measured only on some samples. The relatively high tritium content in the majority of the sampled waters [between 2 and 9 tritium units (TU) ] indicates a recent groundwater recharge (Table 1). The use of natural radioactive isotopes (3 H, 14 C) in the ground waters gives an estimate of mean residence time of 50 ± 20 years (mixing model). Some waters show a mean residence time greater than 100 years because they are isolated from the general circulation and limited to local spots. The recent 14 C activity of the groundwater (_ 100 pcm) allows us to reject the hypothesis of a mixing with paleoconnate waters as demonstrated elsewhere (SHIVANNA et al., 1993). In the case of the coastal Chaouia (semi-arid environment), the use of both chemical tracers (Cl-, Br-) and isotopes (18 O, 2 H, 3 H, 14 C) has shown that rainfall constitutes the essential origin of ground water in the area. The high salinity caused by seawater intrusion is probably limited in space to some coastal wells; neither evaporation of water before and during percolation, nor dissolution of evaporitic deposits (halite), has been found. The past marine transgression salt origin has also been discarded. The main source of the salinity is the washout of the rock alteration salts, fertilizers, marine airborne salts, and the unusable salts rejected by plants in the soil. Thus the increase of salinity is well explained by the recycling of salty ground waters by irrigation during at least thirty years...|$|E
