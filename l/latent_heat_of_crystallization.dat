The convection is likely some combination of thermal and compositional convection. The mantle controls the rate at which heat is extracted from the core. Heat sources include gravitational energy released by the compression of the core, gravitational energy released by the rejection of light elements (probably sulfur, oxygen, or silicon) at the inner core boundary as it grows, <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> at the inner core boundary, and radioactivity of potassium, uranium and thorium.|$|E
50|$|Mars {{possibly}} {{hosted a}} core-generated magnetic {{field in the}} past. The dynamo ceased within 0.5 billion years of the planet's formation. Hf/W isotopes derived from the martian meteorite Zagami, indicate rapid accretion and core differentiation of Mars; i.e. under 10 million years. Potassium-40 {{could have been a}} major source of heat powering the early Martian dynamo. Core merging between proto-Mars and another differentiated planetoid could have been as fast as 1000 years or as slow as 300,000 years (depending on the viscosity of both cores and mantles). Impact-heating of the Martian core would have resulted in stratification of the core and kill the Martian dynamo for a duration between 150 and 200 million years. Modelling done by Williams, et al. 2004 suggests that in order for Mars to have had a functional dynamo, the Martian core was initially hotter by 150 K than the mantle (agreeing with the differentiation history of the planet, as well as the impact hypothesis), and with a liquid core potassium-40 would have had opportunity to partition into the core providing an additional source of heat. The model further concludes that the core of mars is entirely liquid, as the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> would have driven a longer-lasting (greater than one billion years) dynamo. If the core of Mars is liquid, the lower bound for sulfur would be five weight %.|$|E

30|$|The {{chondrule}} solidification texture {{reflects the}} crystal growth pattern inside the melt droplet {{at the time}} of formation in the early solar nebula. We numerically investigated the following two thermal effects on the crystal growth pattern; (i) the cooling at the droplet surface and (ii) the release of <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization.</b> Surface cooling makes the droplet surface cooler than the center. Since the crystal growth rate is faster along the cooler surface than across the hotter center, the rim was formed when the cooling rate is large enough. The release of the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> caused a rapid temperature increase near the growing rim, resulting in a very steep temperature gradient at the interface between the rim and the remaining liquid (melt) phase. This “reversed” temperature gradient led to den-drite formation due to the morphological instability. We found that the double structure of rim and dendrite could be formed only when the cooling rate is within a narrow range. An understanding of these thermal effects on chon-drule melt solidification is the first step to elucidate the formation mechanism of chondrule solidification textures.|$|E

This is a gray contour map of the phase value ranging from φ = 0 (solid phase, black) to φ = 1 (liquid phase, white). The transition layer between the solid and liquid is too thin to distinguish in this map, meaning that the solid-liquid interface is very sharp. At the beginning, there is a tiny seed crystal on the right hand side at the droplet surface (panel (a)). At 0.02 s after seeding, a dendritic crystal grows from the seed crystal (panel (b)). The temperature distribution is shown by isothermal lines in terms of T − TM. Crystal growth is accompanied by release of the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization,</b> so the temperature around the dendritic crystal increases up to almost the melting point. On the other hand, the supercooling far from the dendritic crystal is still large, resulting in a steep temperature gradient ahead of the growing dendrite tips. The dendritic crystal is spreading into the entire region inside the droplet (panel (c)). Around 0.06 s after seeding, the rapid dendritic crystal growth {{comes to a stop}} because the temperature inside the droplet increases to the melting point (panel (d)). It is found that a liquid phase still remains at the gap between dendrite tips. Finally, the remaining liquid solidifies completely as the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> is removed by the surface cooling. It took 0.42 s to solidify completely. The luminosity of the droplet increases rapidly from panel (a) to (d), and then decreases gradually (Miura et al., 2010).|$|E

Although localized heating caused shallower thermal gradients ahead of the interface, {{the magnitude of the}} localized heating required for convexity was less than that which resulted in a thermal inversion ahead of the interface. A convex interface shape was most readily achieved with ampoules of lower thermal conductivity. Increasing melt convection tended to flatten the interface, but the amount of radial heating required to achieve a convex interface was essentially independent of the convection intensity...|$|E

A 2 D numerical scheme has been developed to evaluate the heat transfer inside and around a magma body, the <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> and the inputs of magma from the asthenosphere to a crustal reservoir. Assuming a ratio > 1 between velocities of magma ascending in the conduit and magma laterally displaced in the reservoir, the results indicate that, after 40 ka, the reservoir is vertically thermally zoned. As a consequence it hosts magma batches that can individually differentiate, mix and be contaminated by the crust, and produce the spectrum of isotopic compositions of the Vesuvian products. The thermal model reproduces the geothermal gradient and the brittle-ductile transition (250 – 300 °C) at 6 km of depth (the maximum depth of earthquake foci) only after 0. 5 – 1 Ma, implying a long lived magma chamber below the volcano...|$|E

This steady thermal fractionating state can be invoked to explain large amounts of erupted basalts of similar composition over long time periods from the same volcanic center and some rhythmically layered basic cumulate sequences...|$|E

It has been suggested by Williams–Landel–Ferry kinetics (WLF) that a higher particle temperature and lower glass-transition temperature would increase the crystallization rate of the particles during the spray-drying process. Freshly humidified air produced by a Buchi-B 290 spray dryer as a humidifier attached to the main spray dryer decreased the particle glass-transition temperature (Tg), while allowing the particle temperature (Tp) to reach higher values by using an insulated drying chamber. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and moisture sorption analysis were {{used to measure the}} degree of crystallinity for the spray-dried lactose powders.

The shortenings were prepared and their rheology, thermal behavior, and solid fat content (SFC) were determined and compared to the commercial samples. The CLA-rich shortening samples showed similar rheological properties to the commercial samples and showed a better consistency (more solid-like behavior) compared to the soy oil control samples. In addition, the CLA-rich shortenings also have a higher SFC (% SFC) as well as higher <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> and melting than the soy oil controls indicating a comparatively higher crystalline fraction.

The Si 3 N 4 films were also deposited by rf sputtering. It was observed that the crystallization was affected by the stress in a-Si films introduced by the Si 3 N 4 cap layer.

40|$|Any {{quantitative}} {{interpretation of}} the formation conditions of igneous rocks requires methods for determining crystallization temperature. Accurate application of such thermobarometers relies on the attainment of equilibrium in the system to be studied. This may be particularly difficult in silicic magmas, where diffusivities are low and crystallization kinetics sluggish. Moreover, progressive degassing of volatile-rich magmas during ascent can result in continuous changes in effective undercooling, causing particular problems in achieving equilibrium between melt and crystals that grow in response to decompression. We consider these problems {{in the context of}} plagioclase-melt equilibria for magmas undergoing decompression and degassing-driven crystallization, using two published thermometers. The two thermometers show similar trends with key parameters but absolute temperatures can vary significantly. Analysis of decompression experiments conducted at constant temperature shows systematic variations in calculated temperature and equilibrium constant with varying decompression rate and quench pressure. This indicates that an unrecognized lack of equilibration could result in significant temperature overestimates and potentially spurious results. This highlights the need to assess for equilibrium, and we discuss problems associated with some commonly used indicators of equilibration. Finally, retrospective analysis of published plagioclase-hosted melt inclusion suites from five subduction zone volcanoes shows systematic increases in calculated temperature and decreases in equilibrium constant with decreasing H 2 O concentration. While this could represent the signature of <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization,</b> we suggest that such patterns should be treated with caution unless there is clear evidence of sustained equilibrium between plagioclase and melt during decompression...|$|E

40|$|Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions {{are driven by}} exsolution of H 2 O-rich vapour from silicic magma. Eruption dynamics involve a complex interplay between nucleation and growth of vapour bubbles and crystallization, generating highly nonlinear variation in the physical properties of magma as it ascends beneath a volcano. This makes explosive volcanism difficult to model and, ultimately, to predict. A key unknown is the temperature variation in magma rising through the sub-volcanic system, as it loses gas and crystallizes en route. Thermodynamic modelling of magma that degasses, but does not crystallize, indicates that both cooling and heating are possible. Hitherto {{it has not been}} possible to evaluate such alternatives because of the difficulty of tracking temperature variations in moving magma several kilometres below the surface. Here we extend recent work on glassy melt inclusions trapped in plagioclase crystals to develop a method for tracking pressure-temperature-crystallinity paths in magma beneath two active andesite volcanoes. We use dissolved H 2 O in melt inclusions to constrain the pressure of H 2 O at the time an inclusion became sealed, incompatible trace element concentrations to calculate the corresponding magma crystallinity and plagioclase-melt geothermometry to determine the temperature. These data are allied to ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry to show that the temperature of ascending magma increases by up to 100 degrees C, owing to the release of <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization.</b> This heating can account for several common textural features of andesitic magmas, which might otherwise be erroneously attributed to pre-eruptive magma mixing...|$|E

Two main dynamic mechanisms are considered: (1) a pure buoyancy-driven system where the convective flow is induced by density changes during magma cooling; (2) a buoyancy-driven convective system governed by chaotic advection. The non-Newtonian rheology of natural magmas is taken into account linking the Herschel-Bulkley formulation {{with the results of}} fractional crystallization experiments of magmas with the same composition and at the same conditions of temperature and pressure of the studied system. The <b>latent</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallization</b> is also considered in order to address the thermal release in the system induced by the crystallization. Results indicate that the development of chaotic advection generates a complex thermochemical evolution of the system speeding up the crystallization process and the timing required to reach the jamming condition relative to the pure buoyancy-driven convective system (nearly 2 times faster). Our results have important implications for both the rheological history of the magmatic body and the refilling of shallower magmatic systems. In particular, (1) a time-dependent composition ranging from basalt to andesite can be extracted from an initial basaltic magmatic batch; (2) at the attainment of the maximum packing fraction (i. e., just before the jamming condition), homogeneous andesitic melts can be potentially extracted from the system; and (3) the development of chaotic advection within the system allows for the extraction of andesitic melt in shorter times compared to a buoyancy-dominated system...|$|E

The Pito Deep sheeted dyke complex has a similar composition to the sheeted dykes drilled at ODP Hole 504 B suggesting that the measured compositions are representative of sheeted dyke complexes at intermediate- to fast-spreading ridges. The dykes show only small increases in ? 34 S which, combined with the rock dominated d 34 S of vent fluids, requires the majority of seawater sulphate to be precipitated as anhydrite before the fluid reacts with the sheeted dyke complex. This loss of sulphate from the fluid means that a much higher Fe 2 O 3 in the sheeted dyke complex than in fresh MORB glasses cannot be explained by oxidation due to seawater sulphate reduction during fluid-rock reaction. Instead, oxidation probably occurs due to degassing of reduced species, largely H 2, during dyke emplacement and solidification. A mass balance model that accounts for anhydrite precipitation and Sr partitioning into the anhydrite, as well as fitting the concentration and isotopic ratios of S and Sr in the sheeted dykes and vent fluids, suggests water/rock ratios of ? 1.
