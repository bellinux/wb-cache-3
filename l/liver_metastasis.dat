5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and <b>liver</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

LCLC's, as a subtype of NSCLC, have traditionally been included in many of these clinical trials, and have been treated like other NSCLC's. More recent trials, however, have shown that some newer agents may have particular effectiveness in prolonging survival of LCLC patients. Pemetrexed, in particular, has shown significant reduction in the hazard ratio for death when used in patients with LCLC. Taxane-based (paclitaxel, docetaxel) chemotherapy was shown to induce a complete and sustained response in a <b>liver</b> <b>metastasis</b> in a case of LCC-RP. A later-appearing metastasis within mediastinal lymph nodes in the same case also showed a durable response to a taxane alone.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} an animal model with human hepatocyte- repopulated liver {{for the study}} of <b>liver</b> cancer <b>metastasis.</b> METHODS: Cell transplantation into mouse livers was conducted using alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) -producing human gastric cancer cells (h-GCCs) and h-hepatocytes as donor cells in a transgenic mouse line expressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) driven by the albumin enhancer/promoter crossed with a severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse line (uPA/ SCID mice). Host mice were divided into two groups (A and B). Group A mice were transplanted with h-GCCs alone, and group B mice were transplanted with h-GCCs and h-hepatocytes together. The replacement index (RI), which is the ratio of transplanted h-GCCs and h-hepatocytes that occupy the examined area of a histological section, was estimated by measuring h-AFP and h-albumin concentrations in sera, respectively, as well as by immunohistochemical analyses of h-AFP and human cytokeratin 18 in histological sections. RESULTS: The h-GCCs successfully engrafted, repopulated, and colonized the livers of mice in group A (RI = 22. 0 % ± 2. 6 %). These mice had moderately differentiated adenocarcinomatous lesions with disrupted glandular structures, which is a characteristics feature of gastric cancers. The serum h-AFP level reached 211. 0 ± 142. 2 g/mL (range, 7. 1 - 324. 2 g/mL). In group B mice, the h-GCCs and h-hepatocytes independently engrafted, repopulated the host liver, and developed colonies (RI = 12. 0 % ± 6. 8 % and 66. 0 % ± 12. 3 %, respectively). h-GCC colonies also showed typical adenocarcinomatous glandular structures around the h-hepatocyte- colonies. These mice survived for the full 56 day-study and did not exhibit any metastasis of h-GCCs in the extrahepatic regions during the observational period. The mice with an h-hepatocyte-repopulated liver possessed metastasized h-GCCs and therefore could be a useful humanized liver animal model for studying <b>liver</b> cancer <b>metastasis</b> in vivo.

Here, we report a 52 -year-old man with <b>liver</b> cystic <b>metastasis</b> from locally cured NPC. The patient received concurrent chemoradiotherapy for NPC 4 years ago and presented with a 6 -month history of upper abdominal fullness and pain.

40|$|Background: Surgical {{procedures}} such as liver resection {{and liver}} transplantation are the first-line treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, the {{high incidence of}} tumor recurrence and <b>metastasis</b> after <b>liver</b> surgery remains a major problem. Recent studies have shown that hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contribute to tumor growth and metastasis. We aim to investigate the mechanism of FTY 720, which was originally applied as an immunomodulator, on suppression of <b>liver</b> tumor <b>metastasis</b> after <b>liver</b> resection and partial hepatic I/R injury. Methodology/Principal Findings: An orthotopic liver tumor model in Buffalo rat was established using the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line McA-RH 7777. Two weeks after orthotopic liver tumor implantation, the rats underwent liver resection for tumor-bearing lobe and partial hepatic I/R injury. FTY 720 (2 mg/kg) was administered through the inferior caval vein before and after I/R injury. Blood samples were taken at days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for detection of circulating EPCs (CD 133 +CD 34 +). Our results showed that intrahepatic and lung metastases were significantly inhibited together with less tumor angiogenesis by FTY 720 treatment. The number of circulating EPCs was also significantly decreased by FTY 720 treatment from day 7 to day 28. Hepatic gene expressions of CXCL 10, VEGF, CXCR 3, CXCR 4 induced by hepatic I/R injury were down-regulated in the treatment group.

METHODS ICAM- 1 expression in fresh tissues of normal liver and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was examined by immunoperoxidase staining. The expression of ICAM- 1 in human hepatoma, tumor surrounding tissues and normal livers were semiquantitatively analyzed by Dot immuno blot. Tissue ICAM- 1 expression at mRNA level was detected by Northern blot. RESULTS All 6 cases of normal liver samples were negative in anti-ICAM- 1 immunohistochemical staining, 80. 0 % (36 / 45) of HCC presented various ICAM- 1 expression. The number of positive cells was a little higher in large tumors, tumors with intact capsule and metastasis, {{but there was no}} significant difference. Two cases with cancer embolus also had high ICAM- 1 expression. ICAM- 1 concentration in HCC (13. 43 ± 0. 09) was higher than that in tumor surrounding tissues (5. 89 ± 0. 17, P< 0. 01) and normal livers (4. 27 ± 0. 21, P< 0. 01). It was also higher in metastasis group (20. 24 ± 0. 30) than in nonmetastasis group (10. 23 ± 0. 12, P< 0. 05). Northern blot analysis revealed that ICAM- 1 expression at mRNA level was also higher in HCC and cancer embolus than that in tumor surrounding tissues and normal livers.
