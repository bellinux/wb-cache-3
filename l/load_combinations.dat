40|$|A {{methodology}} concerning how {{to determine}} the correlation factors between individual long-term dynamic load components for the prediction of the combined total stress is presented. The combined stress in short-term sea states can be expressed by the square root of sum of squares of the load components with corresponding stress factors and relevant correlation factors. One of advantages for this formulation is that the correlation factors do {{not depend on the}} relative magnitudes of the individual stress components. The long-term stress is expressed by an equation similar in format to one derived for the shortterm sea states. The weighted average values of the correlation factors over wave scatter diagram entry and wave headings are defined as the long-term <b>load</b> <b>combination</b> factors. For illustration, the direct calculations of the <b>load</b> <b>combination</b> factors are performed for end longitudinal connections in the midship tank of a modern crude oil tanker. The calculation results show that the <b>load</b> <b>combination</b> factors for short-term sea states strongly depend on wave heading and average zero-up crossing wave period. For long-term multiple sea states, it is shown that the <b>load</b> <b>combination</b> factors are not sensitive to the selected probability of exceedance level. It is found, however, that the long-term <b>load</b> <b>combination</b> factors can be noticeably different depending on the cargo loading and environmental wave conditions.

50|$|The PLGen module {{stands for}} the virtual model {{generator}} or the pre-processor of the PLPAK. It mainly changes any structural drawing to {{what is called the}} “virtual model”. Modeller can import structural drawings from DXF CAD files or can draw then directly using the CAD capabilities of the PLGen. The virtual model looks very similar to the original structural drawing. The PLGen mainly define the structure using series of objects. These objects are classified into one of three categories: the geometrical objects (single slab and openings), the loading objects (column load, wall load, load patch, load assembly) and the supporting objects (column, wall, wall assembly, soil support, beam). Using such objects the modeler can define all elements in the building slab. It has to be noted that the virtual model represents the actual slab shape (not like the centre-line model of the finite element method). Columns and walls are represented by the actual cross section shape. The PLGen can also input the numerical models of each object such as the number of boundary elements for each segments, the discretization of the beam-slab contact areas, etc. Load cases only (i.e. no <b>load</b> <b>combinations)</b> are defined in the PLGen module. Material properties are also defined herein. The below Figure demonstrates the graphical user interface of the PLGen module.|$|E

Going out with Cantrell to test fire and evaluate different <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> in the three calibers selected for use by the New United States Army, the two stumble upon and combat brigands raiding a nearby farm. The down-timer Germans had chopped down several trees behind the battlefield of the Battle of the Crapper to gauge and evaluate the penetration power of the Grantvillers' firearms, and used the knowledge to create an armored (timberclad) wagon. Under fire from Santee and Cantrell, eight of the rogue ex-mercenaries use the timberclad wagon to begin to close on the position of the two Americans. Realizing their bullets will not penetrate, a wounded Santee bravely orders Cantrell to return to the arsenal and return with an elephant gun while he holds them in check himself. Santee and Cantrell managed to eliminate the brigands with the elephant gun. At the end, Santee agrees to become an unofficial advisor to the military trainers.|$|E

50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, casting bed suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and rigging arrangements is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during lifting (suction to the casting bed, or crane dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the rigging arrangements used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the casting bed on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the planned load direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed pin head style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|E
40|$|Issues of <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> of {{earthquakes}} and heavy trucks are important contents in multihazards bridge design. Current load resistance factor design (LRFD) specifications usually treat extreme hazards alone {{and have no}} probabilistic basis in extreme <b>load</b> <b>combinations.</b> Earthquake load and heavy truck load are considered as random processes with respective characteristics, and the maximum combined load is not the simple superimposition of their maximum loads. Traditional Ferry Borges-Castaneda model that considers load lasting duration and occurrence probability well describes random process converting to random variables and <b>load</b> <b>combinations,</b> but this model has strict constraint in time interval selection to obtain precise results. Turkstra’s rule considers one load reaching its maximum value in bridge’s service life combined with another load with its instantaneous value (or mean value), which looks more rational, but the results are generally unconservative. Therefore, a modified model is presented here considering both advantages of Ferry Borges-Castaneda's model and Turkstra’s rule. The modified model is based on conditional probability, which can convert random process to random variables relatively easily and consider the nonmaximum factor in <b>load</b> <b>combinations.</b> Earthquake load and heavy truck <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> are employed to illustrate the model.

The optimal combination is based on a parametric numerical analysis of several reinforced concrete elements, which are designed using different load factor values.

The formulation is applied to different failure modes: flexure, shear, torsion, and compression plus bending of short and slender reinforced concrete elements.

40|$|Sandwich Plate System (SPS) is a {{sandwich}} construction consisting of steel face sheets and polyurethane core. The main objective for the steel faces is to resist bending and in-plane loads, while the compliant core transfers shear between the faces. One important benefit with sandwich panels is {{the elimination of}} the need for intermediate stiffeners. SPS panels are today used in stadium and arena terraces, bridges, ships and as structural flooring. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) is currently developing rules and guidelines for design and installation of SPS in ship newbuildings. To do this it is important to study how the SPS panels behave under a variety of loads such as lateral pressure load, in-plane shear load and in-plane uni-axial compression <b>load.</b> <b>Combinations</b> of these loads are important to study to establish strength criterias for SPS panels.

40|$|AbstractThe new Egyptian Code (ECP- 201 : 2012) {{introduces}} new vehicular {{live loads}} (VLL) and new <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> {{for the design}} of roadway bridges. The new VLL and <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> introduced in ECP- 201 : 2012 are fundamentally different than those presented in previous versions of the code. The impact of these new loads and <b>load</b> <b>combinations</b> on the design of new bridges or the structural safety of the existing bridges that have been designed according to ECP- 201 : 2003 or ECP- 201 : 1993 has not been fully addressed for the different bridge deck systems. Three different bridge deck systems, i. e. concrete I-shaped girders, composite steel plate girders, and concrete box-girders with different spans were numerically modeled using two-dimensional grillage analogy. The bridge decks were analyzed under main gravity loads using VLL according to ECP- 201 : 2012 and ECP- 201 : 2003. The internal forces of individual load cases, total un-factored load combination, and total factored load combination of ECP- 201 : 2012 and ECP- 201 : 2003 were compared. The study shows that concrete box-girders designed according to ECP- 201 : 2012 and ECP- 201 : 2003 using the ultimate limit state method yield almost the same demand. Despite the increase in the VLL of ECP- 201 : 2012, and consequently the live load forces, concrete I-shaped girder bridges will be subjected to less total factored internal forces in comparison to ECP- 201 : 2003 This is attributed to the interaction between the live to dead loads ratio and the <b>load</b> <b>combinations.</b> Design of composite steel plate girder bridges according to ECP- 201 : 2012 using the allowable stress design method yields over designed sections...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{important}} feature of time variant reliability problems is identified. The concept of barrier failure dominance (BFD) is introduced to characterize those problems where an out-crossing or overload failure {{is more likely to}} be caused by a very small realization of the barrier (resistance) than by an exceptionally large realization of the load process. This result arises from a study of the ensemble out-crossing rate approximation, reported in a previous paper and which is reviewed herein.
