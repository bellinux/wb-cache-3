25|$|The odor {{detection}} threshold for phosgene is 0.4 ppm, {{four times the}} threshold <b>limit</b> <b>value.</b> Its high toxicity arises from {{the action of the}} phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary alveoli, the site of gas exchange: their damage disrupts the blood–air barrier, causing suffocation. It reacts with the amines of the proteins, causing crosslinking by formation of urea-like linkages, in accord with the reactions discussed above. Phosgene detection badges are worn by those at risk of exposure.|$|E

Critics point out that: (1) the workplace safety standards are based on allowable maxima in the workplace, not mercury body burden; (2) the workplace safety numbers are not applicable to continuous 24-hour exposure, but are limited to a normal work day and a 40-hour workweek; and (3) the uptake/absorption numbers are averages and not worst-case patients (those most at risk).|$|E

30|$|At the EU level, two {{concepts}} for deriving occupational exposure <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> exist. The first being binding occupational exposure <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> (BOELVs) for which member states {{are obliged to}} derive national <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> equal to or lower than the BOELV [7, 8, 12]. For their derivation, toxicological information, socio-economic information and technical feasibility factors {{need to be taken}} into account [13]. The second set are the indicative occupational exposure <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> (IOELVs) [14 – 16] for which member states are obliged to derive national <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> that can either be higher or lower than these IOELVs. These <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> were based on consideration of evidence for an impact of the substance on health [13]; currently 5 BOELVs and 112 IOELVs have been set. For both sets of limits, the focus is on airborne exposure rather than dermal contact. The progress with the EU standards can be compared to historical national exposure limits. For example, in Germany, occupational exposure <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> for inhalation have been derived for 386 substances [17].|$|R

25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) {{is extremely}} toxic. The threshold <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> {{set by the}} American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, as well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air).|$|E

40|$|The {{standards}} for contaminants in fertilisers in Denmark, Germany, Flanders, the Netherlands and United Kingdom, {{are given in}} the context of the proposals for new European fertiliser legislation. This EU legislation might result in generic <b>limit</b> <b>values</b> for contaminants and input lists of materials, and importantly specific waste materials, per categories of fertiliser. With the national and European targets of recycling and energy recovery, the sustainable use of waste materials as fertilisers is becoming more and more important.

2500|$|The {{hepatotoxicity}} of {{vinyl chloride}} {{has long been}} established since the 1930s when the PVC industry was just in its infant stages. In the very first study {{about the dangers of}} vinyl chloride, published by Patty in 1930, it was disclosed that exposure of test animals to just a single short-term high dose of vinyl chloride caused liver damage. In 1949, a Russian publication discussed the finding that vinyl chloride caused liver injury among workers. In 1954, B.F. Goodrich Chemical stated that vinyl chloride caused liver injury upon short-term exposures. [...] Almost nothing was known about its long-term effects. They also recommended long-term animal toxicology studies. The study noted that if a chemical did justify the cost of testing, and its ill-effects on workers and the public were known, the chemical should not be made. In 1963, research paid for in part by Allied Chemical found liver damage in test animals from exposures below 500 parts per million (ppm). Also in 1963, a Romanian researcher published findings of liver disease in vinyl chloride workers. In 1968, Mutchler and Kramer, two Dow researchers, reported their finding that exposures as low as 300 ppm caused liver damage in vinyl chloride workers thus confirming earlier animal data in humans. In a 1969 presentation given in Japan, P. L. Viola, a European researcher working for the European vinyl chloride industry, indicated, [...] "every monomer used in V.C. manufacture is hazardous....various changes were found in bone and liver. Particularly, much more attention should be drawn to liver changes. The findings in rats at the concentration of 4 to 10 ppm are shown in pictures." [...] In light of the finding of liver damage in rats from just 4–10 ppm of vinyl chloride exposure, Viola added that he [...] "should like some precautions to be taken in the manufacturing plants polymerizing vinyl chloride, such as a reduction of the threshold <b>limit</b> <b>value</b> of monomer …" [...] In 1970, Viola, reported that test animals exposed to 30,000 ppm of vinyl chloride developed cancerous tumors. Viola began his research looking for the cause of liver and bone injuries found in vinyl chloride workers. Viola's findings in 1970 were a [...] "red flag" [...] to B.F. Goodrich and the industry. In 1972, Maltoni, another Italian researcher for the European vinyl chloride industry, found liver tumors (including angiosarcoma) from vinyl chloride exposures as low as 250 ppm for four hours a day.|$|E
