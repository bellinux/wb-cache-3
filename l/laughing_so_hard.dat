500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about? And he said, ‘You know, “Sail away, sail away...”’ And I thought, this {{guy is going to}} make Blomkvist as metro as we need." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{thought that}} Will Arnett, who {{appeared}} as Devon Banks, was [...] "shrewdly cast". Webb Mitovich added that this episode displayed some [...] "good, good stuff". Anna Johns of AOL's TV Squad declared [...] "Fireworks" [...] as [...] "one {{of the best}} episodes so far this season" [...] citing that [...] "the writers juggled a handful of storylines very, very well". She wrote that {{the best part of}} the episodes were [...] "the one-liners. They had [...] <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that [...] frequently had to pause the TiVo to recover." [...] Robert Canning of IGN wrote that this episode [...] "was another prime example of what this show is capable of". He thought that [...] "the choice of Arnett as Jack Donaghy's nemesis was perfect, right down to their shared graveled vocal delivery", and that recurring character Chris Parnell's [...] "short, quick hitting scenes are always nonsensical perfection".|$|E
500|$|... "Wet Hot Demonic Summer" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. David Hinckley of New York Daily News rated it {{four out of}} five stars and commented that although it may not make sense to some viewers, it is [...] "equally possible they will keep watching anyway because the jokes work so well all by themselves". Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> at what just happened that you miss a fun line..." [...] Lastly, Wagner observed that [...] "Ugly Americans can be gross and bizarre, but everything makes sense in the world that it has created".|$|E

500|$|Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "SeinfeldVision was a clever and ironic way to {{incorporate}} Seinfeld." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] {{was a solid}} start to the new, fought-for season" [...] and that it did have [...] "some great, great moments." [...] Despite this praise, Webb Mitovich criticised Kenneth and Tracy's [...] "office wife" [...] storyline saying that [...] "we've seen this shtick before on countless other sitcoms, {{so it was a}} bit empty and filled with 'easy' jokes." [...] Criticism was also received regarding the [...] "striped outfit... it didn't work. No," [...] referring to a joke involving Jenna trying to distract the TGS writers from her newly gained weight. Lisa Schmeiser of Television Without Pity graded this episode as a [...] "B+." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it thought that this episode [...] "started off [...] second season on a pretty strong note." [...] Porter said that this episode wasn't the best episode of 30 Rock but it was still [...] "one of the sharpest and wittiest comedies on television." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "was a really funny beginning to the second season." [...] Sassone also notes that the appearance of Seinfeld did not feel like stunt casting. He also said that the joke about Jerry being able to buy NBC for $4 million was [...] "one of the many reasons [...] this show." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that this episode [...] "proves the low-rated show's best comedy Emmy win was no undeserved fluke." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger described this episode as [...] "really funny" [...] and thought that [...] "everyone is played in a style that's believable within [...]" [...] Linda Stasi of The New York Post said that [...] "the on-going story of the regulars that had me <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> I almost fell out of bed." [...] Jake Brooks of The New York Observer thought that this episode was [...] "a rather poor 22 minutes of television (well, only [...] portion of it, the rest was pretty great)." [...] Robert Canning of IGN said that [...] "30 Rock delivers a fantastic episode to open the season. Let's hope they can also deliver an audience to keep this great show on the air." [...] Canning also awarded this episode a rating of 9.4 out of 10. Brian Lowry of Variety said that it [...] "neatly highlights this series' strengths and weaknesses, elevated by moments of inspiration and Alec Baldwin's brilliance and leavened by considerably-less-flattering silliness." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times thought that [...] "SeinfeldVision" [...] "is mostly a reminder that even the most talented actors and writers sometimes slip under pressure." [...] Seinfeld was criticized as using his appearance in this episode as a plug for his upcoming feature film Bee Movie. Seinfeld, NBC and General Electric stated that this was done as metahumor.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{highlights}} of Batchelor's career came in 1912 when the Detroit Tigers went on strike to protest the suspension of Cobb. The team was in Philadelphia when the players went on strike, and manager Hughie Jennings spent the morning visiting Philadelphia's sandlots to recruit replacement players for a 3:00p.m. game. Batchelor covered the game and called the replacement players [...] "the worst bunch of clowns ever to wear major league uniforms." [...] He opined that the only reason the replacement Tigers scored in the 24-2 defeat was because [...] "the Athletics were <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> they couldn't field." ...|$|E
2500|$|Production {{went very}} well, and as {{expected}} {{with so many}} comic actors and personalities around, was very lively. During production, Hudlin said that whenever David Alan Grier and Martin Lawrence worked, the film's crew usually worked a little slower because wherever they were, there {{would be so much}} comedy being generated and they were so funny that everyone wanted to hang out near where they were throughout the day. In the scene where the new fragrance is being presented to Strangé, the director said that [...] "what Grace was doing on the set while we were shooting was so funny that I remember Halle crying off camera, cause she was trying to keep a straight face but she couldn't. So whenever she was off-camera, she would just be literally crying because she was <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> And fortunately, for her reaction shots she was able to recover." ...|$|E

60|$|Before {{he could}} reply Johnny Chuck began to chuckle. The chuckle became a laugh, and {{presently}} Johnny was <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> {{he had to}} hold his sides.

At last Peter Rabbit stopped laughing long enough to ask Johnny what he was laughing at.|$|E
50|$|Dee {{became one}} of the best known (and most listened to) talk hosts in Cleveland.

5000|$|Good Day to Cross a River was {{met with}} highly {{positive}} reviews, such as Allmusic's David Jefferies who summarized the album's content saying, [...] "There are times during Good Day to Cross a River when the audience is <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> you know they're wiping tears out of their eyes".

5000|$|Vincent d'Onofrio {{was cast}} as Jack Horn, ("the Mountain Man"), on {{the urging of}} co-stars Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke. [...] For the role, d'Onofrio {{developed}} a raw, high-pitched voice {{to give the impression}} of a man who'd lived in the wilderness for years without speaking to people, and, when he wanted to test the voice for Fuqua, the director refused to listen, instructing the actor to surprise him with it in his first scene, which resulted in a delighted Fuqua <b>laughing</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that he almost ruined the scene by interfering with the sound recording.|$|E

"For a {{contemporary}} example, one verse of the naughty kuplét of Money, Love and Shame, sung by a clever comedian in Tel Aviv in 1975, {{makes fun of}} Brezhnev, {{to the delight of}} an audience of recent immigrants from Russia ...

5000|$|Regarding the {{reasoning}} behind the emoji's popularity, Fred Benenson, author of Emoji Dick, commented that [...] "it is versatile.

[...] Benenson also attributed the emoji's popularity to it being one of the better designed emojis from Apple. Abi Wilkinson, a freelance journalist writing for The Guardian opined that the Face with Tears of Joy emoji is [...] "the worst emoji of all," [...] describing it as an [...] "obnoxious, chortling little yellow dickhead with bulbous, cartoonish tears streaming down its face." ...|$|E
