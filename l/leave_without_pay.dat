He recalled that there were 15–20 Vietnamese officers present along with Khánh and Khiêm, and that many had been placed on <b>leave</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay</b> or removed after Diệm's overthrow. Chuan said that Khánh chaired a meeting, and claimed that Minh's government was [...] "neutralist, pro-Communist and pro-French", and incompetent. He said that the plotters [...] "didn't know what to call the coup d'état {{to make it sound}} all right; it was only a while later that they thought of the term 'rectification'". Wilson was present at the meeting and telephoned Harkins [...] "every five minutes", and Khánh left the meeting early and left Khiêm in charge, saying that he had to meet Harkins. During the meeting, Thieu and Mậu turned up by 08:40 and the atmosphere of the meeting was likened to a triumphant election campaign function on vote-counting night. Before leaving and telling the others he was meeting Harkins, Khánh had announced to the officers in the room that he would be heavily dependent on US advice and support.|$|E

2500|$|Kejriwal {{joined the}} IRS as an Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax in 1995 after {{qualifying}} through the Civil Services Examination. In November 2000, he was granted two years' paid leave to pursue higher education {{on condition that}} upon resuming his work he would not resign from the Service {{for at least three}} years. Failure to abide by that condition would require him to repay the salary given during the leave period. He rejoined in November 2002. According to Kejriwal, he was not given any posting for almost a year, and kept getting his salary without doing any work; so, after 18 months, he applied for <b>leave</b> <b>without</b> <b>pay.</b> For the next 18 months, Kejriwal was on sanctioned unpaid leave. In February 2006, he resigned from his position as Joint Commissioner of Income Tax in New Delhi. The Government of India claimed that Kejriwal had violated his original agreement by not working for three years. Kejriwal said that his 18 months of work and 18 months of unpaid absence amounted to the stipulated three-year period during which he could not resign and that this was an attempt to malign him due to his involvement with the Indian anti-corruption movement. The dispute ran for several years until, in 2011, it was resolved when he paid {{his way out of the}} Service with the help of loans from friends. Kejriwal paid [...] 927,787 as dues, but stated that this should not be considered as an admission of fault.|$|E
