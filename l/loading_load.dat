40|$|An {{anisotropic}} {{damage mechanics}} model {{is presented to}} describe the behavior and failure of con-crete under biaxial fatigue loading. Utilizing the approach of bounding surfaces, the limit surface becomes a special case {{when the number of}} loading cycles is set to one. By increasing the number of loading cycles, the strength of concrete gradually decreases and the limit surface is allowed to contract and form new curves representing residual strengths. The magnitude of <b>loading,</b> <b>load</b> range, and the load path are known to influence the fatigue life and hence are addressed in this formulation. In this paper, a strength softening function is proposed in order to address the re-duction in the strength of concrete due to fatigue. Separate softening functions are also proposed to account for the deformation characteristics in concrete under cyclic loading. Numerical simula-tions predicted by the model in both uniaxial and biaxial stress paths show a good correlation with the experimental data available in the literature...|$|E

The investigations were conducted on bearings of various sizes and designs, including circular cylinder bearings, double wedge bearings, four-face bearings and tilting pad bearings with five pads. Experimental bearings with a diameter of 40 to 60 mm and a maximum bearing width of 80 mm can be installed in the bearing test rig. The motor is connected to a single-stage turbo spur gear so that the gearbox output shaft reaches a maximum rotational speed of 48, 600 min"-" 1. The experimental bearings can be steplessly loaded between 0 and 4 N/mm" 2. The operational behavior of the bearings is assessed by means of their friction energy, shaft displacement, oil flow rate, and bearing temperatures. The influence of bearing <b>loading,</b> <b>load</b> direction, oil feed temperature, and oil feed pressure on the operational behavior was investigated for every bearing type. The investigations were focused on the tilting pad bearings in a flooded mode of operation.
