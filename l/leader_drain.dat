2500|$|Church {{spokesman}} Steve Drain {{declined to}} answer questions about Phelps' excommunication, and denied that the church had a single <b>leader.</b> <b>Drain</b> said that [...] "the church of Jesus Christ doesn't have a head" [...] and [...] "the Lord Jesus Christ is our head". Referring to the church having a defined leader, he said that [...] "for a very long time, we haven't been organized in the way you think". The church's official website said that membership status is private and did not confirm or deny the excommunication.|$|E
5000|$|In the Age of Apocalypse, Ship {{was nearly}} {{destroyed}} by Magneto when it endangered {{the lives of}} his X-Men. This was after they successfully thwarted the plans of En Sabah Nur's Horsemen {{to take control of the}} United States' nuclear arsenal. The battle between Ship and Magneto left the X-Men <b>leader</b> <b>drained</b> and unable to ever fully restore his magnetic powers. Later, while hovering over the Moon and in possession of the Horseman Death, who powered Ship using Sunfire's explosive mutant abilities, Ship was destroyed when Sunfire's powers flared out of control. Some of Ship's remains were salvaged and would later be used to construct the science chamber run by Peter Corbeau.|$|R

50|$|Now a {{free man}} (whichever one he may be), the Leader teleported the Hulk's allies, the Warbound, to Nevada. There, he used Hiroim of the Warbound, {{harnessing}} his tectonic power to activate a gamma powered shield over {{a portion of the}} desert. It is revealed that the Leader is dying, and that he constructed the dome to cure him. Due to a miscalculation, the energy of the dome actually kills him faster. In battle with the Warbound, the Leader is stabbed through the chest with an iron pipe. The Leader then absorbed the power of the dome, turning himself into a gray-skinned giant. Hiroim also absorbed the power, and battled the <b>Leader,</b> <b>draining</b> both of their powers. In death, Hiroim channels his old power into Kate Waynseboro, who attacks the Leader, and forces him to teleport away.|$|R
50|$|Just {{before the}} Carthaginians razed Kamarina in the 5th century BC, the Kamarinians were plagued with a mysterious disease. The marsh of Kamarina had {{protected}} {{the city from}} its hostile neighbors to the north. It was suspected that the marsh {{was the source of}} the strange illness and the idea of draining the marsh to end the epidemic became popular (the germ theory of disease was millennia in the future, but some people associated swamps with disease). The town oracle was consulted. The oracle advised the <b>leaders</b> not to <b>drain</b> the marsh, suggesting the plague would pass with time. But the discontent was widespread and the <b>leaders</b> opted to <b>drain</b> the marsh against the oracle's advice. Once it was dry, there was nothing stopping the Carthaginian army from advancing. They marched across the newly drained marsh and razed the city, killing every last inhabitant.|$|R

Jeffrey Coffey) is an American drummer, {{known for}} being the drummer of the psychedelic/noise rock band Butthole Surfers and band <b>leader</b> of <b>Drain.</b> He began {{drumming}} in a Fort Worth hardcore punk band called The Hugh Beaumont Experience.

50|$|The Black Death {{had reached}} England in 1348. The {{widespread}} {{effects of the}} plague had effectively put the war on hold. However, by the mid 1350s the disease had receded sufficiently to allow the country to start rebuilding its finances. So in 1355 Edward's son, Edward the Black Prince, resumed the war and invaded France from English held Gascony and by August of that year he had begun a brutal campaign of raids known as chevauch√©e. This campaign was designed to terrorise and demoralise the people, discredit their <b>leaders</b> and <b>drain</b> the French king's financial resources. Anything that was portable was looted and anything {{that could not be}} taken away was broken or burnt. An observer at the time said, of the Black Prince, that as he rode to Toulouse there was no town that he did not lay waste.|$|R
