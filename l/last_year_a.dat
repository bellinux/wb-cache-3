5|$|For {{five years}} after the {{expansion}} era contract with ESPN ended in 1997, the CFL was absent on American television. At the end of 2001 the league began a relationship with America One that would last until 2009. Coverage was relatively generous with 43 games, including the playoffs, covered in the <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>A</b> more modest deal of 14 games was negotiated with the NFL Network in 2010, which lasted two years. The 2012 season began without a contract and the league resorted to internet broadcasts on ESPN3 until NBC Sports Network agreed to a 14-game regular season package of its own; unlike the NFL network, NBC opted to broadcast games during the NFL preseason as well as cover the playoffs and Grey Cup. Both the NBC and ESPN deals were renewed in 2013 with a slight scaling back of playoff coverage and ESPN2 also picking up a handful of games in the summer months. American broadcasts have been simulcasts of game coverage from Canadian networks.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{noteworthy}} {{importance is}} the 1962 Bel Air Sport Coupe, the <b>last</b> <b>year</b> <b>a</b> Bel Air pillarless hardtop {{was available in}} the US.

A car with this configuration is a valuable collector vehicle that commands a big premium over other 1962 models including the Super Sport.|$|E

A new trim level was offered for 1989, a limited-edition turbo coupe that featured an ASC/McLaren turbocharged version of GM's 3.1L V6 (Only 749 were produced). Output was , 65 more than <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>A</b> four-speed automatic was the only transmission offered. The coupe was an SE model with body work such as hood louvers and extra body cladding(which {{will be the most}} controversial design element in the years to come). The interior featured more equipment, and only seated four, in contrast to the LE's five seats. The full analog gauges would become the 1990-93 sport cluster, and the basis for the new instrument cluster to replace the digital cluster for 1990.|$|E

A second [...] "American" [...] emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the 258 six. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split folding backs and a column-mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a safety lock lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> <b>A</b> new [...] "American" [...] emblem with different typography was applied to glove box door.
