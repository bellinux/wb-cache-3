40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general {{framework for the}} formulation of generic uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, we introduce a basic generic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> that contains recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> by Andrews [2] and Hoadley [7 J as special cases. We also develop a truncation approach. {{that makes it possible}} to obtain uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the functions under consideration from uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for truncated versions of those functions. The point of the truncation approach is that uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the truncated versions are typically easier to obtain. By combining the basic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and the truncation approach we also derive generalizations of recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> introduced in Potscher and Prucha [13, l 5]. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{under some}} weaker conditions, we give three laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> under sublinear {{expectations}} (capacities), which extend Peng's law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> under sublinear expectations in [8] and Chen's strong law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for capacities in [1].

5|$|The bats {{were entirely}} digital (except in shots {{containing}} {{only one or}} two bats), as it was decided directing <b>larger</b> <b>numbers</b> of real bats on set would be problematic.

5|$|Early games {{involved}} varying {{numbers of}} players. Games {{could also be}} played with uneven numbers on each side either because some failed to show or one side offered a handicap. The first match between Sheffield and Hallam involved 16 players versus 20. Games predominantly involved <b>larger</b> <b>numbers</b> than used in the modern games. In October 1863, Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches. Despite this it continued to do so on occasions.

The North Korean aircraft split into two groups of four and quickly destroyed a Republic of Korea Air Force T-6 Texan parked on the tarmac at Kimpo.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to <b>larger</b> <b>numbers</b> of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{mechanisms}} {{exist to}} promote the degradation of oxidatively damaged proteins via the proteasome system. In particular, proteasomes localized to the nucleus are regulated by PARP and actively degrade inappropriately oxidized histones. Oxidized proteins, which often form large amorphous aggregates in the cell, can be degraded directly by the 20S core particle without the 19S regulatory cap and do not require ATP hydrolysis or tagging with ubiquitin. However, high levels of oxidative damage increases the degree of cross-linking between protein fragments, rendering the aggregates resistant to proteolysis. <b>Larger</b> <b>numbers</b> and sizes of such highly oxidized aggregates are associated with aging.|$|E

Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops.

5|$|Beat 'em up (also {{known as}} brawler) is {{a video game}} genre {{featuring}} hand-to-hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents. These games typically take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, sci-fi or fantasy themes. Traditional beat 'em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open three-dimensional (3D) environments with yet <b>larger</b> <b>numbers</b> of enemies. These games are noted for their simple gameplay, a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} First Aliyah in 1881, Jews began immigrating {{to the area}} from Eastern Europe in <b>larger</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{particularly}} from Poland and Russia. These Zionist pioneers were motivated both ideologically and by the Mediterranean climate to reject the Ashkenazi cooking styles they had grown up with, and adapt by using local produce, especially vegetables such as zucchini, peppers, eggplant, artichoke and chickpeas. The first Hebrew cookbook, written by Erna Meyer, and published in the early 1930s by the Palestine Federation of the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO), exhorted cooks to use Mediterranean herbs and Middle Eastern spices and local vegetables in their cooking. The bread, olives, cheese and raw vegetables they adopted {{became the basis for}} the kibbutz breakfast, which in more abundant forms is served in Israeli hotels, and in various forms in most Israeli homes today.|$|E
5|$|European {{occupation}} of Australia has, on the whole, benefited black-shouldered kites through land clearing and irrigation for agriculture and grain harvesting and storage practices which provide suitable conditions for much <b>larger</b> <b>numbers</b> of mice. According to raptor researcher Dr Stephen Debus, this species {{did not suffer}} from eggshell thinning {{during the period of}} DDT use in Australia, though he believes it is possible that secondary poisoning may occur from rodenticides used during mouse plagues or from pesticides used during locust plagues. Populations in areas with high sheep and rabbit numbers may decline, as these animals compact the soil and reduce the available habitat for mice.|$|E
