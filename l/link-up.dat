5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the <b>link-up</b> mode, rear-view mirror, and running the game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player <b>link-up</b> mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's <b>link-up</b> instead.|$|E
40|$|Small {{and medium}} sized {{enterprises}} (SME), in particular, can derive opportunities from voluntary external collaborations {{in the form of}} cooperative <b>link-ups.</b> Collaboration with several partners in networks and controlling the success of cooperative <b>link-ups</b> further promote the profitability of companies. Suitable approaches for full control of the success of a cooperative relationship, starting with assessment of companies' capacity for cooperative <b>link-ups</b> through to measurement of the success of cooperations on the basis of appropriate indices, are, however, still in their infancy. This article introduces the reader to the necessity for a systematic assessment of networks and illustrates the present status of controlling of cooperative <b>link-ups</b> in the manufacturing sector...|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck's XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, were {{unlikely}} to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the <b>link-up.</b>|$|E
5|$|Widely {{regarded}} as Canada's greatest soccer player of all time, {{and as one}} of the greatest ever women soccer players, Sinclair is a fast, well-rounded, physically strong, and intelligent forward, known for her ball skills, athleticism, and technique. An accurate finisher, and a highly prolific goalscorer, she is a versatile and hard-working player, who is capable of playing both as a striker, and also as an advanced playmaker in midfield, due to her passing accuracy, ability to read the game, <b>link-up</b> with other midfielders, and create chances for teammates. Sinclair is also capable of scoring from free-kicks and penalties. In addition to her footballing abilities, she has stood out for her leadership and defensive work-rate throughout her career.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and <b>link-up</b> play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E

5|$|Giovinco is a small, quick, {{technically}} gifted, and agile player, with noted dribbling skills, balance, acceleration, {{and excellent}} ball control; these characteristics {{allow him to}} beat opponents, hold up the ball {{with his back to}} goal or in tight spaces, and create space or chances for teammates, despite his lack of strong physical attributes. Although he is capable of scoring goals, he also possesses good <b>link-up</b> play as well as notable playmaking skills, and he is known for his vision, creativity, and his passing and striking ability with both feet, despite being naturally right footed, as well as his accuracy and ball delivery from free kicks. Giovinco is capable of playing in several offensive positions, and he is usually deployed in a free role as a second striker, although he is also capable of playing as a winger, on either flank, or in the centre as a creative attacking midfielder; he has also been used in a more offensive, central role as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle. The <b>link-up</b> between the relief {{force and the}} Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp. The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for Operation Delaware, an air assault into the A Shau Valley. At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated. Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded and five missing. Thirty-three South Vietnamese troops were also killed and 187 wounded. Because of the close proximity of the enemy and their high concentration, the massive B-52 bombings, tactical airstrikes, and vast use of artillery, NVA casualties were estimated by MACV as being between 10,000 to 15,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Operation Rösselsprung was a coup de main operation, {{involving}} {{direct action}} {{by a combined}} parachute and glider-borne assault by the 500th SS Parachute Battalion and a planned subsequent <b>link-up</b> with ground forces of the XV Mountain Corps converging on Drvar. The airborne assault was preceded by heavy bombing of the town by the Luftwaffe. The ground forces included Home Guard forces of the Independent State of Croatia. Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the Allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of}} the airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location and the lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans.|$|E

5|$|American {{casualties}} were climbing, both from frequent German counterattacks {{and the cost}} of storming pillboxes. The Germans had spent the night of 10 October turning cellars of houses in the town of Bardenberg into fortified pillboxes; American attackers were forced to withdraw and instead shell the town into submission. On 12 October, the Germans launched a major counterattack against the American 30th Infantry Division. It was disrupted by heavy artillery fire and well-placed anti-tank defenses. At the village of Birk, a three-hour fight broke out between German tanks and a single American Sherman; the Sherman managed to knock out an enemy Panzer IV and force another one to withdraw, but was soon attacked by others. This lone tank was eventually joined by elements of the 2nd Armored Division, and the Germans were driven from the town. The 30th Infantry Division soon found itself in defensive positions all along its front; nevertheless, it was ordered to continue pushing south for its intended <b>link-up</b> with the 1st Infantry Division. To accomplish this, two infantry battalions from the 29th Infantry Division were attached to the hard-pressed 30th.|$|E
5|$|Amphibious {{landings}} at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean {{forces from}} behind, allowing I Corps and IX Corps {{to break out}} of Pusan. Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the <b>link-up</b> was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of Chongju, forty miles from the Yalu River border of North Korea, had been captured.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player <b>link-up</b> mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Events organised and presentations were twofold. On one hand we aimed at the effective dissemination and exploitation of the <b>Links‐up</b> project outcomes, {{on the other hand}} we aimed at involving stakeholders of the project and target groups via 'Learning Dialogues' and events to ensure sustainability on a long term. The primary target groups for the dissemination and exploitation activities have been targeted when organising and selecting events where <b>Links‐up</b> was presented: EU and national government agencies, policy‐makers; Learning and inclusion networks; training providers. Events started at an early stage of the project to ensure continuity and deeper involvement of target groups. Events included the three Learning Dialogues combined with national events and the Final Conference (reported separately) with intensive exchange of opinions and experiences using action learning set methodology and role‐plays. Based on the participant feedback at the first Learning Dialogue, the project consortium decided to concentrate efforts on the local initiatives and their learning path during the validation experiments while launching dissemination actions targeted on fellow researchers in trendsetting positions. Based on this strategy, <b>Links‐up</b> were mostly set in international or national scientific conferences. During the events participants were asked to put themselves in the position of grass‐root initiative facilitators and policy makers to exchange opinions and experiences on the key research questions of the project. An introduction of experiences of previous events and ongoing emerging results of the project were fed back to the event participants to fertilise discussions. Events included Learning Cafés at the Plymouth e‐Learning Conference 2010, at the EduMedia Conference 2010 as well as the 2010 EDEN Annual Conference, keynote speeches and workshops at the NEXT regional conferences in 2010 and 2011, various activities at the EDEN 2011 Annual Conference, the presentation of a research paper and interactive discussions at the e‐Challenges e‐ 2011 Conference, the Final <b>Links‐up</b> Conference and an additional Online Webinar. One of the outputs of such events were the recorded interviews of 5 key researchers and experts on the field of open learning (Prof. Aharon (Roni) Aviram, Chair of the Center for Futurism in Education at Ben‐Gurion University, Steve Wheeler, Associate Professor at the University of Plymouth and Edublogger, Ingeborg Bo, Member of the Board of Trustees of the ICDE (International Council for Open and Distance Education, Graham Attwell, Director of Welsh independent research institute Pontydysgu, Associate Fellow at University of Warwick, UK and University of Bremen, Germany, Maruja Gutierrez‐Diaz, Advisor to the Director, Education and Culture, European Commission; Former Head of Unit Innovation and Transversal Policies, European Commission) published on YouTube and on the project website (details and links on the interviews are included in the Report on Learning Dialogues). As <b>Links‐up</b> events were supported by presentations at selected conferences, announcements at the project website and through regular <b>Links‐up</b> Newsletters and project presence on social web channels such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, elearningeuropa. info community and EDEN social web community with considerable amount of visits, shares and readers...|$|R

5|$|The {{orders for}} Operation Roland were issued {{in the closing}} hours of 13 July 1943. But after meeting with Manstein, Hitler {{countermanded}} the XXIV Panzer Corps' deployment to the Kursk salient, sending them on 14 July to support the 1st Panzer Army to the south. The assault began at 04:00 on 14 July. Following a brief artillery barrage, the 4th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment Der Führer of Das Reich struck out for the high ground south-west of Pravorot, evicting {{the remnants of the}} 2nd Guards Tank Corps from the village of Belenikhino following house-to-house and hand-to-hand fighting. Das Reichs 2nd SS-Panzer Regiment fought off a series of counterattacks and forced the Red Army units to withdraw eastward to a new line. Zhukov ordered the 10th Guards Mechanized Brigade of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps to reinforce the line. The 7th Panzer Division of the III Panzer Corps made contact with Das Reich, but Trufanov, commanding the Soviet forces in the gap, was aware of the threat and conducted a fighting withdrawal. The <b>link-up</b> failed to trap the Soviet forces, though they abandoned a substantial number of their anti-tank guns. Operation Roland failed to produce a decisive result for the German side, and Totenkopf began withdrawing from its positions north of the Psel, following orders issued late on 15 July, as the II SS-Panzer Corps assumed a defensive stance along its entire front.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish playmaker Victor Vázquez in midfield at the {{beginning}} of the 2017 season saw less responsibility placed on Giovinco and captain Michael Bradley to create Toronto's goalscoring opportunities, and this in turn freed up the Italian, enabling him to focus more on his attacking game. Coach Greg Vanney also switched tactics from a 4–4–2 diamond to a 3–5–2 formation, benefiting Giovinco's and Altidore's attacking partnership by allowing them to play closer together, and with Vázquez supporting them as the team's main creator, the attacking duo began to demonstrate a deeper understanding and an increased awareness of each other's movements, which improved their <b>link-up</b> play, and saw an increase in Altidore's goalscoring output throughout the season. Giovinco scored his first goal of the season in a 2–2 home draw to expansion team Atlanta United, on 8 April 2017. On 27 June, Giovinco scored both goals in a 2–1 home win over Montreal in the 2017 Canadian Championship final second leg — edging Montreal 3–2 on aggregate; he also won the George Gross Memorial Trophy for the most valuable player of the tournament. On 30 July, Giovinco scored two goals and set up another in a 4–0 home win over New York City FC; his second goal of the match, which came from a free kick, was his 50th MLS goal, and his record-breaking 10th MLS goal from a free kick. While Giovinco was ruled out on injury, Toronto FC won the Supporters' Shield for most points in the league that season, following a 4–2 home win over New York Red Bulls on 30 September. In Toronto FC's last match of the regular season on 22 October, Giovinco scored from a free kick on his 100th appearance for the club in a 2–2 away draw to Atlanta; in doing so, Toronto FC broke the MLS regular season point record of 68 points, set by LA Galaxy in 1998, by one point. The goal was also Giovinco's sixth free kick goal of the season, which set the record for most free kicks scored in an MLS regular-season. On 30 October, in the first leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals in the 2017 MLS Cup Playoffs, Giovinco scored the match-winning goal from a free kick in a 2–1 away win over New York Red Bulls. Giovinco was subsequently included among the finalists for the 2017 MLS MVP award, after being omitted from the list of finalists for the award the previous season. On 5 November, in the second leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, Giovinco received a booking for dissent in the 80th minute, causing his suspension for the Conference Finals as he also received a yellow in the first leg; Toronto lost the match 1–0 at home, but still advanced to the next round on away goals.|$|E
