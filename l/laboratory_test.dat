A {{study of}} the antioxidant capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five organic acids: oxalic, citric, malic, quinic, and fumaric acids. Using a standard <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> to determine antimicrobial activity, Hygrophorus agathosmus was shown to inhibit the growth of various pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis; it also inhibits {{the growth of the}} yeast Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.|$|E

5|$|A <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> {{showed how}} males of P. fimbriata from Queensland {{minimise}} {{the risk of}} meeting each other, by recognising fresh pieces of blotting paper, some containing their own silk draglines and some containing another male's draglines. Males also were attracted by fresh blotting paper containing females' draglines, while females {{do not respond to}} fresh blotting paper containing males' draglines. This suggested that the males usually search for females, rather than vice versa. Neither sex responded to one week-old blotting paper, irrespective of whether it contained males' or females' draglines. A similar series of tests showed that P. labiata showed the same patterns of responses between the sexes.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if use of basic <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> improves {{diagnosis and treatment}} outcomes in outpatients attending rural primary health care facilities. Setting: Six rural health centres in Kenya. Design: Cross-sectional study to observe change in diagnosis and treatment made by clinical officers after <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> in outpatients attending six rural health centres in Kenya. Subject: The {{diagnosis and treatment of}} 1134 patients attending outpatient services in six rural health centres were compared before and after basic <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> Essential clinical diagnostic equipment and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were established at each health centre. Clinical officers and laboratory technicians received on-site refresher training in good diagnostic practices and laboratory procedures before the study began. Results: <b>Laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were ordered on 704 (62. 1 %) patients. Diagnosis and treatment were changed in 45 % of tested patients who returned with laboratory results (21 % of all patients attending the clinics). 166 (23. 5 %) patients did not return to the clinician for a final diagnosis and management decision after <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> Blood slide examination for malaria parasites, wet preparations, urine microscopy and stool microscopy resulted in most changes to diagnosis. There was no significant change in drug costs after <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing.</b> The greatest changes in numbers of recorded diseases following <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> was for intestinal worms (53 %) and malaria (21 %). Conclusion: Effective use of basic <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> at primary health care level significantly improves diagnosis and patient treatment. Use of <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> can be readily incorporated into routine clinical practice. On-site refresher training is an effective means of improving the quality of patient care and communication between clinical and laboratory staff. <br /...|$|R

Friedländer's initial work introduced the Gram stain, a fundamental <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> still used today to identify and categorize bacteria.

An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years.

Researchers in Australia later developed the Hunter Toxicity Criteria Decision Rules, which have better sensitivity and specificity, 84% and 97%, respectively, when compared with the gold standard of diagnosis by a medical toxicologist. As of 2007, Sternbach's criteria were still the most commonly used.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:Because of the {{increase}} in diagnostic resources, <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> have become an essential tool in diagnostic elucidation. Therefore, we observe {{an increase in the number}} of tests request. Objectives:To determine the prevalence of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> requests by the intensive care unit (ICU) of the General Hospital at southwest Bahia, and to anticipate the expenses with unnecessary <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests,</b> indicating avoidable costs, and aiming at rationalization of <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> use. Methods:This is a cross-sectional retrospective study, in which a survey on medical records and <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> results of patients admitted to the ICU was conducted, in the period from August to September 2013. Results:The sample consisted of 105 patients, 58. 1 % males, 47. 6 % aged between 18 - 59 years. During the period, 12. 217 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> were ordered, of which 49. 4 % was within the normal limits. The more requested exams were: complete blood count, sodium, and potassium. A number of 1. 750 <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> could be evaluated according to criteria established in the literature, among them, 719 (41 %) were considered unnecessary. A greater number of requests (29 %) were observed on Mondays, compared with the average of the rest of the week. Conclusion:Significant number of unnecessary testing was found, with occurrence pattern on Monday and not dependent on age or length of stay. The data indicate the need to implement guidelines or protocols for ordering <b>laboratory</b> <b>tests</b> in the ICU, which have proven effective in helping the prescribing professional in their clinical practice, and contribute to optimize for health care spending...|$|R
5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a <b>laboratory</b> <b>test</b> of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies that bind heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E

Occurring errors may negatively affect the patient treatment process and clinical decision making. Evaluation on <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> and <b>Laboratory</b> Information System (LIS) {{may explain the}} root cause to improve the testing process and enhance LIS in supporting the process. This paper discusses a new evaluation framework for LIS that encompasses the <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> cycle and the socio-technical part of LIS. MethodologyLiterature review on discourses, dimensions and evaluation methods of <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> and LIS. A critical appraisal of the Total Testing Process (TTP) and the human, organization, technology-fit factors (HOT-fit) evaluation frameworks was undertaken {{in order to identify}} error incident, its contributing factors and preventive action pertinent to <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> process and LIS. ResultA new evaluation framework for LIS using a comprehensive and socio-technical approach is outlined. Positive relationship between laboratory and clinical staff resulted in a smooth <b>laboratory</b> <b>testing</b> process, reduced errors and increased process efficiency whilst effective use of LIS streamlined the testing processes.
