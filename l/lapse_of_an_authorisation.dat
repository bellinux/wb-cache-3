This guideline sets out the requirements for monitoring plans to assist licensees meet an acceptable standard. 1 Legal framework Under the Environment Protection Act 1993 (EP Act) the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) can require monitoring and testing as <b>a</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>authorisation</b> or environment protection order (EPO). The most common tool the EPA uses to impose a requirement for monitoring is <b>a</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>authorisation,</b> including licences (section 36), exemptions (section 38) and works approvals (section 35). Section 52 (1) of the EP Act, states that: … the Authority may, by conditions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental <b>authorisation,</b> require the {{holder of the authorisation}} to … carry out specified tests and environmental monitoring relating to the activity undertaken pursuant to the authorisation … and to make specified reports to the Authority on the results of such tests and monitoring. … The EPA may also require monitoring as <b>a</b> condition <b>of</b> EPOs (section 93) and clean up orders (section 99). Under clause 44 of the Environment Protection (Water Quality) Policy 2003, the EPA is obliged to impose monitoring where an exemption is granted. 2 Purpose of regulatory monitoring and testing 2. 1 Why does the EPA require monitoring? The EPA may impose monitoring as <b>a</b> condition <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> or order, where there is a hazard that the EPA considers to be a priority environmental risk. Generally, the EPA will specify monitoring: to assist with characterising or assessing a priority environmental risk to assist with the management <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental risk, eg to assess performance against criteria and therefore assess compliance with a licence condition and/or requirement the EP Act...|$|R
