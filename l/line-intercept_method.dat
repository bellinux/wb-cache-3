A qualitative X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed using both XRD- 7 (Seifert-FPM, Freiberg, Germany) and DRON- 3 M (Russia) diffractometers under CuKα radiation. A size of crystallites in sintered ceramic samples was estimated using Scherrer equation and calculated average for three pellets in the batch. The average grain size was measured from TEM micrographs using a <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> (55 grains). Vickers hardness and fracture toughness were measured at 50  g and 10  kg load conditions by both PMT- 3 (LOMO, Russia) and MMT- 3 (Buehler, USA) hardness testers, respectively.

40|$|Coverpercentage {{values for}} plant species were {{estimated}} using the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> along two belt transects {{starting at the}} lower mangrove frontier and ending at the upper height of the salt marsh. Twelve perennial species representing five growth forms were recorded with a total cover ranging between 10 and 50 %, {{depending on the type}} of substrate. Principal components analysis of the soil data indicated an array of stands, on the basis of which four vegetation zones couldbe distinguished. The procumbent growth form predominating on the salt marsh is related to high salinity levels. The procumbent vegetation shows a zonation related to the degree of waterlogging. The rhizomatous growth form is found on sites with a low bicarbonate content and saturation percentage levels, while the undershrub- and stoloniferous growth forms occupy sites of low salinity level, linked with intermediate values of the other edaphic factors.

40|$|Abstract Vertical surface {{properties}} of the landscape were measured using a laser altimeter mounted in a small twin-engine aeroplane. The laser altimeter makes 4000 measurements per second with a vertical recording precision of 0. 05 m for a single measurement. These airborne laser measurements were analysed to provide information on topography, vegetation canopy and stream and gully cross-sections. Laser altimeter data were used to measure small (less than 0. 20 m deep) and large gullies and stream cross-sections. Vegetation canopy heights, cover, structure and distribution were determined in studies in Texas and Arizona. Laser measurements of vegetation cover and height were significantly correlated with ground measurements made with <b>line-intercept</b> <b>methods.</b> While conventional ground-based techniques {{may be used to}} make all these measurements, airborne laser altimeter techniques allow the data to be collected in a quick and efficient way over large and inaccessible areas. The airborne laser altimeter data can also help quantify various lan...|$|R
40|$|Vehicles cause {{environmental}} damage on sandy beaches, including physical displacement and compaction of the sediment. Such physical habitat disturbance provides {{a relatively simple}} indicator of ORV-related impacts that is potentially useful in monitoring the efficacy of beach traffic management interventions; such interventions also require data {{on the relationship between}} traffic volumes and the resulting levels of impact. Here we determined how the extent of beach disturbance is linked to traffic volumes and tested the utility of image-based data acquisition to monitor beach surfaces. Experimental traffic application resulted in disturbance effects ranging from 15 % of the intertidal zone being rutted after 10 vehicle passes to 85 % after 100 passes. A new camera platform, specifically designed for beach surveys, was field tested and the resulting image-based data compared with traditional <b>line-intercept</b> <b>methods</b> and in situ measurements using quadrats. All techniques gave similar results in terms of quantifying the relationship between traffic intensity and beach disturbance. However, the physical, in situ measurements, using quadrats, generally produced higher (+ 4. 68 %) estimates than photos taken with the camera platform coupled with off-site image analysis. Image-based methods can be more costly, but in politically and socially sensitive monitoring applications, such as ORV use on sandy beaches, they are superior in providing unbiased and permanent records of environmental conditions in relation to anthropogenic pressures...|$|R
40|$|Decreasing {{diversity}} and plant cover, {{as well as}} increasing variability of these characteristics with increasing aridity are expected in grasslands due to climate change. These predictions were tested in perennial sand grasslands in Hungary. Two sites were chosen in different positions on an aridity gradient and two stands in each site were monitored for 9 years. Presence of plant species were recorded along 52 m long circular belt transects of 1040 units of 5 cm × 5 cm contiguous microquadrats. This sampling procedure — a version of <b>line-intercept</b> <b>methods</b> — enabled us to monitor {{diversity and}} total abundance in a sensitive, precise and non-destructive way. We found no trend but fluctuation in most community level attributes and in species composition. Contrary to fluctuations, between-site differences in diversity did not change and diversity remained lower in the more arid site during our 9 -year-study. Compositional diversity performed better than species diversity because allowed us to detect vegetation changes that would have remained hidden if monitoring would be based only on the species richness. Comparing the magnitudes of fluctuations, five times higher relative interannual variability (CV%) was found for compositional diversity at the more arid site, while the relative temporal variability of total abundance and species richness did not show consistent patterns. We conclude that a 9 year-long study was too short to identify trends caused by the changing climate. However, the larger temporal variability of species combinations found in the more arid site suggests larger vulnerability and {{highlights the importance of}} non-linear dynamics during climate changes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of titanium aluminides consolidated by plasma pressure compaction (P 2 C). Gamma phase (TiAl) powders with average particle size of 10 micrometers were rapidly consolidated via P 2 C. This rapid consolidation process inhibits grain growth and ensures high strength and ductility of the consolidated material. Microstructure of the consolidated material was characterized via optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. The average grain size of the consolidated specimen (calculated via the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method)</b> {{was found to be}} 10 micrometers indicating that no grain growth occurred during consolidation. The microstructures showed relatively full densification with no apparent porosity. The flexure strength and elastic modulus in bending were measured to be 684 MPa and 180 GPa, respectively at room temperature (RT). The Vickers hardness was measured to be 2. 7 GPa at RT. The flexure strength and elastic modulus remained constant from RT to 600 oC. I...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Environmental {{conditions}} in distinct tropical rainforest phytophysiognomies {{can act as}} regional filters in determining the distribution of montane bryoflora likewise, local filters inherent to phorophyte species can have modulating influences. We analyzed the bryophyte communities in three phytophysiognomies of Atlantic Forest, {{in order to examine}} the influences of local (phorophyte species) and regional (forest phytophysiognomies) filters on their distributions. The study was undertaken in the Serra do Mar State Park, Ubatuba, SP, Brazil, using 1 ha plots in three forest phytophysiognomies along an elevational gradient. Four phorophyte species were selected, with three to seven replicates each. The <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> was used on each phorophyte for collecting botanical material. Multivariate analyses were used to correlate species distributions with environmental filters. A total of 71 taxa were identified. Mean bryophyte coverage did not vary among the different phytophysiognomies, and although their species compositions were markedly distinct, no cohesive or isolated groups were found. Among the local filters examined, phorophyte DBH was found to be correlated with bryophyte coverage; the pH of the bark of Euterpe edulis and the high rugosity of the trunk of the Cyatheaceae influenced species compositions. Other filters not evaluated here may also be relevant for determining species distributions...|$|E
40|$|We still lack {{quantitative}} and comprehensive methods to assess spatio-temporal changes in biodiversity of landscapes. Even more, we need methods {{to determine the}} amounts of change especially {{in the light of}} the current acceleration in the loss of biodiversity. We have developed a widely applicable method to reveal spatio-temporal changes in vegetation patterns and relate them to ecosystem processes. We use a systematic grid of hexagonal plots in a spatially nested design (three spatial scales and levels) to examine these patterns. The hexagonal grid, as well as the hexagonal plot, provides several advantages compared to other methods. Most important in the context of evaluating patterns is the equidistant nature of the grid. This facilitates data analysis and circumvents statistical and logical problems (compared to squared or circular plots). Correlation is very strong (r/ 0. 88 **) between structural data assessed with the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> and that gathered from field sketches. This indicates that the lines used to mark out the plots provide an easy and feasible method to assess quantitative data on structure and disturbance. We show that frequency data does not perform better than presence absence data regarding correlation with other variables. We conclude that the hexagonal grid provides an efficient method to assess patterns of biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|Satellite imagery {{has proven}} {{extremely}} useful for repetitive timeline-based data collection, {{because it offers}} a synoptic view and enables fast processing of large quantities of data. The changes in tree crown number and land cover in a very remote watershed (area 1305 ha) in Nepal were analyzed using a QuickBird image from 2006 and an IKONOS image from 2011. A geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) was carried out using the region-growing technique for tree crown detection, delineation, and change assessment, and a multiresolution technique was used for land cover mapping and change analysis. The coefficient of determination for tree crown detection and delineation was 0. 97 for QuickBird and 0. 99 for IKONOS, calculated using a <b>line-intercept</b> transect <b>method</b> with 10 randomly selected windows (1 × 1 ha). The number of tree crowns decreased from 47, 121 in 2006 to 41, 689 in 2011, a loss of approximately 90 trees per month on average; the area of needle-leaved forest was reduced by 140 ha (23 %) over the same period. Analysis of widely available very-high-resolution satellite images using GEOBIA techniques offers a cost-effective method for detecting changes in tree crown number and land cover in remote mountain valleys; the results provide the information needed to support improved local-level planning and forest management in such areas...|$|R
40|$|While diverse, native {{riparian}} vegetation provides important functions, {{it remains unclear}} to what extent these assemblages can persist in urban areas, and under what conditions. We characterized forested {{riparian vegetation}} communities across an urbanizing metropolitan area and examined their relationships with surrounding land cover. We hypothesized that native and hydrophilic species assemblages would correlate with forest cover in the landscape. For each of 30 sites in the Portland–Vancouver metro area, we recorded vegetation at 1 -cm intervals along 3 transects using the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method.</b> Land cover was characterized at 2 scales: within 500 m of each site and across the entire watershed. Multivariate analyses were used to evaluate relationships between species composition and land cover patterns. A classification tree was created to determine landscape predictors of riparian community type. Results indicated a strong relationship between watershed land cover and vegetation diversity and structural complexity. Our hypothesis of native species association with landscape forest cover in urban riparian areas was supported, but we found no clear relationship between land cover and wetland indicator status. Our results suggest that high watershed forest cover (at least 15 %) may enable the persistence of functionally diverse, native riparian vegetation communities in urban landscapes.

40|$|Plans for the {{construction}} of Lake Naconiche, located in northern Nacogdoches County, included a monitoring project to demonstrate at least 176 acres of land adjacent to the lake would be converted into wetlands. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the creation of wetlands around the lake and establish a benchmark of vegetation composition and condition for future comparison. Eight locations, placed where the majority of wetlands were expected to form, were chosen for monitoring from the shoreline at 348 feet above mean sea level (ft MSL) to the county fee take line at 357 ft MSL. Shallow groundwater monitoring wells were installed along transects perpendicular to the shoreline at all sites to monitor hydrologic changes in order to project how much land around the lake will convert to wetland. Two vegetation sampling techniques, a plot-based method and the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method,</b> were used at each site to determine baseline species composition along an elevation gradient in areas predicted to become wetlands. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values at each site were compared along an elevation gradient to determine the baseline physiological condition of vegetation in areas predicted to become wetlands. Groundwater monitoring revealed that the water table at monitoring sites around the Naconiche and Telesco branches consistently reached an elevation of 352 ft MSL during the growing season. Using the elevation of 352 ft MSL as an estimate for the entire lake, an area of approximately 188 acres of land adjacent to the lake was projected to become wetlands.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Riparian {{communities}} in the southern portion of Malheur National Forest were intensively studied {{with the objective of}} designing an approach for classifying disturbed riparian areas into units of similar potential. Not all riparian community types in this portion of the Blue Mountains were sampled due to time limitations. Some of the major community types sampled included: Baltic rush (Juncus balticus) communities; Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) communities; beaked sedge (Carex rostrata) communities; water sedge (Carex aquatilis) communities; mountain alder (Alnus incana) communities; and various willow communities (Salix geyeriana, Salix exigua ssp. exigua, Salix rigida var. mackenziana, and Salix lemmonii). Sites were selected to maximize geographic variation. Piezometers were placed at each site to determine depth to water table. Soil temperature at depths of 15 cm and 50 cm and water table depth were measured semi-weekly. Plant frequency and understory cover by species were determined using 25 cm square plot frames along three 10 m transects in each community sampled. Belt transects were run to determine tree and shrub densities. Tree cover was determined using a hand-held densiometer and the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> was used for shrub cover. Soils were described and samples were collected from each horizon for laboratory determination of percent organic carbon, soil texture, and reaction (pH). Ordinations of plant communities and plant species were calculated using the DECORANA program for detrended correspondence analysis. The first axis of ordination arranged both species and communities along a moisture gradient. This was verified by correlation analysis as well as through canonical correlation of a species matrix and an environmental matrix. Stand ordination tables combined with water table and soils data were employed in separating these {{communities in}}to units of similar vegetative potential (Riparian dominance types). Use of these riparian dominance types may improve management of riparian zones {{in this part of the}} Blue Mountains and the use of these types is encouraged...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScConsEcol(Conservation Ecology and Entomology) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The Succulent Karoo {{biodiversity}} hotspot {{is threatened}} by pressure caused by increasing human populations and its associated land use types. Land use is primarily focussed on agriculture, with livestock grazing as a dominant land use in the region. Cultivation is also practiced along the major perennial rivers, and in drier areas, where this largely depends on rainfall. Only about seven percent of the biome is formally protected, and this area substantially under-represents the biodiversity of the Succulent Karoo and does not incorporate key ecological processes and biodiversity drivers. Therefore, there is urgent need for outside reserve conservation initiatives, whose success depend on understanding the ecosystem function of the Succulent Karoo. This study aimed to determine the impacts of heavy grazing, light grazing and cultivation (in a 30 -year old fallow field) on assemblages of ground-dwelling and flying invertebrates. Seasonal assemblage changes were also determined. Vegetation structure and composition were determined using the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> to determine if vegetation patterns explain patterns in invertebrate assemblages. Abandoned fields harbour the lowest number of plant species, and these together with the heavily grazed sizes are dominated by a high cover of Galenia africana (Aizoaceae). Lightly grazed sites have the highest structural complexity, with a high cover of succulents and non-succulent perennials. After the winter rains, annual plants occupy most of the bare ground in heavily grazed and previously cultivated sites. Seasonal changes in assemblages of ground-dwelling and flying invertebrates were determined by sampling during the four seasons at the same localities. Results of pitfall traps sampling for ground-dwelling invertebrates and coloured pan traps for flying invertebrates showed that overall species richness and diversity peaked in spring for flying invertebrates while peaks in richness for ground-dwelling invertebrates were in summer, with no difference in overall diversity. Overall abundance for ground-dwelling invertebrates was highest in summer and lowest in winter. Ground-dwelling invertebrate fauna was dominated by Formicidae and Araneae. Grazing and cultivation lead to skewed community composition of ground-dwelling invertebrates which favours disturbance tolerant and generalist species such as Anoplolepis steingroeveri (Forel) ...|$|E
40|$|During 1987 through 1992, 85 wolves (Canis lupus) were captured, radio-collared, and {{relocated}} from aircraft 1, 123 {{times in}} northwest Alaska. Wolf packs usually {{did not follow}} migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) but maintained year-round resident territories that averaged 3, 652 km². During years when caribou were absent and moose densities were low, ≤ 25 % of the wolf packs moved 64 to 272 km to the caribou wintering grounds. Wolves used different slopes, aspects, and habitats in summer versus winter. Twenty-five percent of the radio-collared wolves dispersed. Annual finite rates of increase ranged from 0. 64 to 1. 43. Annual wolf survival rates averaged 0. 59. There were differences in survival rates among years. Sixty-one percent of the wolves died. Hunting was {{the main cause of}} death (69 %) followed by rabies (21 %). Rabies was a significant natural limiting factor. This wolf population could sustain mortality rates of about 53 % annually. Caribou and moose composed 51 and 42 %, respectively, of the observed wolf prey. Adjusted for prey size, each pack killed 1 adult moose equivalent per 6. 7 days. Wolf pack sizes and adjusted kill rates and kgs of available prey per wolf per day were correlated from several areas across North America. When caribou were present they were the principal prey. However, when caribou densities were < 100 / 1, 000 km² wolves preyed upon moose. Wolves preyed upon relatively healthy caribou and moose that were in marginal condition. Wolves were killing about 6 - 7 % of the caribou herd and from 11 to 14 % of the moose population annually. Existing wolf predation may have serious impacts on resident, low-density moose populations. During spring 1990 I tested the <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method</b> of sampling tracks for estimating wolf densities for a known wolf population (i. e., 48 wolves). The population estimate based upon line-intercept sampling was 50. 7 (80 % CI = 33. 4 to 67. 9) suggesting that the survey method provided relatively accurate population estimates. I placed 23 satellite transmitters on wolves aged 10 -months to 8 years with no apparent adverse effects on them. Accuracy of 1, 855 relocations at 9 sites averaged 336 and 728 m for best and worst quality relocations, respectively.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This research describes the effect of a fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) infestation on the ant community of two north Texas blackland prairies, and the effect on the ant community when a bait formulation of the insect growth regulator, fenoxycarb, was selectively broadcast to control the fire ant. To assess effects, ant species richness' abundance and diversity were measured in two separate experiments. In the first experiment (conducted in 1992 and 1993), ants were sampled from fire ant infested, uninfested, and managed areas within management units on the two prairies. In the second experiment (conducted in 1993), ants were sampled within fire ant infested, uninfested, managed and native ant treatment plots. In the native ant treatment plot, fenoxycarb bait was broadcast over uninfested prairie to determine the effect on native ant species. The plant communities of different treatment plots, as estimated by <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method,</b> were similar in vegetative types. Twenty of the 32 ant species previously recorded from north Texas were sampled from the prairies during this study. In the first experiment, ant samples collected from both the managed and uninfested areas were significantly different from the fire ant infested area in mean species richness and diversity. The diversity of ants in the managed area was largely dueto the relative abundance of native species resistant to fire ants, while the diversity of the uninfested areas was {{due in part to the}} abundance of non-resistant species. In the second experiment, ant samples collected from the different treatment plots did not differ in species richness, abundance or diversity, except during the July, 1993 collection period when species richness and diversity (a) were significantly reduced in the area treated with fenoxycarb. Native species showed no change in relative abundance within the uninfested prairie where fenoxycarb was broadcast, although the abundance of S. invicta increased. The mean Simpson dominance measure, 1, was correlated with the number of fire ants collected within treatment plots. Fire ant infested areas were almost completely lacking in richness and diversity of native ant species. This research suggests the need for further study on the reestablishment of native species within previously infested areas, and the effect of fire ant baits on the ant community...|$|E
40|$|Animals are {{restricted}} in their diets by several factors, {{most notably the}} availability and quality of resources. Variation in resource availability causes herbivores to shift their diets seasonally and spatially. Elephants (Loxodonta africana), {{are known to have}} extensive impacts on plant communities, altering ecosystem functioning and causing a decline in biodiversity. In enclosed areas, these impacts are increased leading to a decline in resource availability and presumably resource quality. In the Addo Elephant National Park, the Main Camp section has a history of high elephant impacts and therefore reduced resource availability. Whereas, the recently added Colchester section has greater resource availability, due to the absence of elephants in this section since the fencing of the Park. This study investigated the changes in diet (diet breadth, preference and diet quality) of elephants due to an increase in resource availability. Three alternative hypotheses were contrasted: 1) elephants as generalist foragers, 2) elephants as optimal foragers, or 3) elephants learning foraging behaviour. Using microhistological analysis, the diets of elephants were described over five sampling periods (August 2010 – February 2014) in both sections. Forage availability was estimated using a modified <b>line-intercept</b> <b>method,</b> and was used to determine changes in preference by relating forage availability to use. In the Colchester section the diet breadth of elephants increased, and was coupled with a high initial variation between the diets of elephants, which decreased in subsequent sampling periods. This supported the elephants learning foraging behaviour hypothesis. However, there was no increase in diet preference by elephants in the Colchester section, which supported the elephants as generalist foragers hypothesis. There was also no difference in the diet quality of elephants in the Main Camp and Colchester sections, which did not support any of the three hypotheses. The elephants learning foraging behaviour hypothesis is proposed to be the link between the alternate two hypotheses, and given enough time, either of the two could be supported. The lack of difference in preference and diet quality between elephants in the Main Camp and Colchester sections is hypothesised to be due to the population level (not measured for individuals) at which these were measured. Microhistological analysis of faeces was used to describe the diet of elephants, which was compared to the diet described by DNA metabarcoding. Microhistological analysis is a traditional, favoured technique used in describing the diet of wild herbivores, whereas DNA metabarcoding is a relatively new and untested technique. These two techniques have not yet been compared in the diet of megaherbivores. Results indicated that microhistological analysis identified significantly more grass in the diet of elephants, than DNA metabarcoding did, which was expected as previous studies also found overestimation of grasses. Microhistological analysis identified more plant families in the diet of elephants, than DNA metabarcoding. Most {{of the differences between the}} two techniques can be attributed to the difference in taxonomic resolution, which was due to the lack of a complete reference collection for DNA metabarcoding. Although either of the two techniques can be used to describe the diet of elephants, the most reliable results would be obtained when using both techniques. The findings of this study suggest that due to the high initial variation between the diets of elephants, with an increase in resource availability, the impacts will also initially be highly varied. This suggests that identifying plant species to monitor elephants impacts initially will be difficult. However, important plant species, or those known to be vulnerable to elephants impacts should be carefully monitored initially and monitoring should not only occur annually, but also seasonally...|$|E
