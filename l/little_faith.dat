25|$|Several of {{the younger}} members of the Nyasaland African Congress had <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> {{in the ability of}} its leader, T D T Banda, who they also accused of dishonesty, and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda then living in the Gold Coast. Dr Banda {{announced}} he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted. Dr Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise quite moderate and far less radical that the younger Congress members. In the nine months between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, he combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as the African smallholders' dislike of agricultural practices imposed on them to promote soil conservation and also the remnants of thangata. Banda's strategy was to use these popular issues to mobilise Congress supporters into strikes, demonstrations, disobedience and protests that would disrupt the everyday operation of the colonial government.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{demonstrate}} peaceful intentions toward Germany, on 13 April 1941, Stalin oversaw the signing of a neutrality pact with the Axis power Japan. Since Treaty of Portsmouth, Russia had been competing with Japan for spheres of influence in the Far East, {{where there was a}} power vacuum with the collapse of Imperial China. Although similar to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with the Third Reich, that Soviet Union signed Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan, to maintain the national interest of Soviet's sphere of influence in the European continent as well as the Far East conquest, whilst among the few countries in the world diplomatically recognising Manchukuo, and allowed the rise of German invasion in Europe and Japanese aggression in Asia, but the Japanese defeat of Battles of Khalkhin Gol was the forceful factor to the temporary settlement before Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 as the result of Yalta Conference. While Stalin had <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany, before military confrontation when Hitler controlled Western Europe and for Soviet Union to take control Eastern Europe. Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union, though Stalin was not aware of Hitler's further military ambition.|$|E

The {{freelance}} journalist Dan Owen suggested that this, combined with their refusal to release the series on Blu-ray, suggested that the BBC had <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> in Inside No. 9.

Neurath opined that this was due to the team's status as outsiders, whose company was [...] "some 1,500 miles distant" [...] from their publisher. The team was advanced $30,000 to create the game, but its final cost was $400,000. The game was funded partly by Ned Lerner, and by Neurath's royalties from Space Rogue.

500|$|As {{it spread}} {{throughout}} the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates. [...] They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina. [...] Some of Teach's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, {{to give up their}} arms and to not travel in groups larger than three. [...] As head of a Crown colony, Spotswood viewed the proprietary colony of North Carolina with contempt; he had <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.|$|E

Between 1881 and 1885, Aldis bought a series of lots in the area on Peter Brooks' behalf, including a 70-by-200-foot (21 by 61 m) site on the corner of Jackson and Dearborn streets. The location was remote, yet attractive for several reasons. The construction of the Chicago Board of Trade Building in 1885 had made nearby LaSalle Street the city's prime financial district, driving up property values, and railroad companies were buying up land further south for new terminal buildings, creating further speculation in the southeastern end of the Loop. Brooks commissioned Burnham & Root to design a building for the site in 1884, and the project was announced in 1885, with a brief trade journal notice that the building would cost $850,000 ($ in [...] dollars). The Chicago building community had <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> in Brooks' choice of location. Architect Edwin Renwick would say: ...|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{was still}} serving as Air Member for Supply when Australia {{declared}} war in September 1939. On 9January 1940 {{he was appointed}} acting Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), following {{the resignation of the}} incumbent, Air Vice-Marshal Goble. Anderson remained in the position until 10February, when Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, seconded from the Royal Air Force, arrived to take over. The Australian government at this stage had so <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> in the leadership of its Air Force that it had briefly considered offering temporary command of the service to a Royal Australian Navy officer, Second Naval Member Commodore Maitland Boucher, before deciding against such a [...] "monumental slight to the senior ranks of the RAAF" [...] and settling on Anderson. After relinquishing his temporary position as CAS, Anderson briefly reverted to his previous role as Air Member for Supply before taking over as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) in March 1940; he was succeeded in November by Air Vice-Marshal Henry Wrigley. The next month, Anderson took over from Air Commodore Cole as Air Officer Commanding Central Area, with responsibility for air defence, protection of adjacent sea lanes, and aerial reconnaissance for most of New South Wales; he remained at this post until it was disbanded in August the following year.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Stalin had <b>little</b> <b>faith</b> in Japan's {{commitment}} to neutrality {{even before the}} German attack, but {{he felt that the}} pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany. From Japan's point of view the attack on Russia very nearly ruptured the Tripartite Pact on which the Empire was depending for Germany's aid in maintaining good relations with Moscow so as to preclude any threat from Siberia. Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe felt betrayed because the Germans clearly trusted their Axis allies too little to warn them of Barbarossa, even though he had feared the worst since receiving an April report from Ōshima in Berlin that [...] "Germany is confident she can defeat Russia and she is preparing to fight at any moment." [...] Foreign minister Matsuoka on the other hand vividly tried to convince the Emperor, the cabinet as well as the army staff of an immediate attack on the Soviet Union. However, his colleagues rejected any such proposal, even regarding him as [...] "Hitler's office boy" [...] by now and pointed out {{to the fact that the}} Japanese army, with its light and medium tanks, had no intention of taking on Soviet tanks and aircraft until they could be certain that the Wehrmacht had smashed the Red Army to the brink of defeat.|$|E
