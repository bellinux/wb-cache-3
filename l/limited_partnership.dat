40|$|In April of 2013, Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware {{introduced}} legislation {{that seeks to}} level the playing field between renewable and non-renewable energy companies. Titled the “Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act” (MLPPA), the legislation would amend the federal tax code to allow renewable energy companies to form master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> and thereby gain valuable financing and tax advantages. This legislation would clear the way for the formation of master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> investing in renewable energy, which would have significant impact on clean energy production in the United States. This article discusses the Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act and explores the advantages and disadvantages of master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> as a business organization for renewable energy companies and ultimately argues for the passing of this valuable legislation. The article is divided into six sections. Part I defines master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> and examines their corporate structure and how they operate as compared to other types of business organizations. Part II delineates the history and evolution of master <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> over the last thirty years. Part III describes the Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act, including its history, purpose and aims. Part IV then details the arguments in support of the Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act, while Part V gives the arguments in opposition to the Act. The article then concludes in Part VI with the author 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations and conclusions that the Master <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnerships</b> Parity Act is a step in the right direction for the development of the clean energy sector and environmental protection in the United States...|$|R

25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> must have a general partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the <b>limited</b> <b>partnership,</b> and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E
