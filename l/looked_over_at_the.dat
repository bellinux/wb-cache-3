60|$|Sparrer stopped {{abruptly}} and gazed with unseeing eyes {{off through the}} forest aisles. Pat <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> youngster with the light of understanding in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Little Joe Otter <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bank. He stared and stared, but he didn't see {{anything}} unusual. It looked {{just as it}} always did. He told Jerry Muskrat so.|$|E
6000|$|... "And as I stood hearkening, dulcimers, haut-boys, and shawms, And violoncellos, and a three-stringed double-bass, Joined in, {{and were}} intermixed with a singing of psalms; And I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead men's dwelling-place.|$|E
60|$|The {{friends of}} Mrs. Maybough had now reduced {{themselves}} to Wetmore, who sat beside her, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little tea-table group. Ludlow led the rest toward her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{attack and}} search were shown on live TV. [...] Members of the Dutch royal family who were waving <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowds {{gathered}} were shown {{standing up to}} <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crashed car, visibly shocked and gasping with their hands over their mouths.|$|R
50|$|At Phil's apartment, he does {{dishes and}} <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{sleeping}} Hollow. An {{image of her}} kissing him as the Green Goblin appears within a dinner plate, leading him to smash the plate and awaken Hollow; she does her best to comfort him.|$|R
60|$|He yawned, {{his eyes}} closing. How sleepy he was! He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bed. Then {{he sat down}} on the edge of it and took his shoes off. So much to do, the next day.|$|E
60|$|Jean-Marie {{seemed to}} ponder for a while, {{and then he}} raised his head again and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Doctor with an air of candid inquiry. 'But are not you a very curious gentleman?' he asked.|$|E
6000|$|He didn't like it; and, {{clapping}} on his hat, he {{went out}} to learn what the matter was. He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house, up at the sky, down at the ground, and through the street; but nothing funny appeared, for Poppy and dolly were hidden again, and the old gentleman was puzzled. He went in and sat down to watch, feeling rather disturbed. Presently the fun began again: the children clapped their hands, the people laughed, and every one <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house, in what he thought a very impertinent way. This made him angry; and out he rushed a second time, saying, as he marched across the street: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Overpowered by horrible fascination, I stood {{grasping}} <b>the</b> rail, and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water beneath me, as {{the vessel}} moved slowly and steadily onward, stern foremost. In {{spite of the}} upset condition of my mind, I could not help wondering why the Vessel should move in this way.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are great}} fighters," [...] Jorgenson observed, unconcernedly, {{spreading}} {{his elbows on}} <b>the</b> rail and <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> floating black patch of characteristic shape whence proceeded {{the voice of the}} wily envoy of Tengga. [...] "Each man of them is worth ten of such as you can find in the Settlement." ...|$|R

6000|$|Jean-Marie {{seemed to}} ponder for a while, {{and then he}} raised his head again and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Doctor with an air of candid inquiry. [...] "But are not you a very curious gentleman?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Meg <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cradle, {{and he went}} {{round the}} bed to it, holding to the bed-rail. He had never kissed her, nor anything. When he saw the twins, asleep with their fists shut tight as wax, he gave a laugh {{as if he was}} amused, and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{stirred the}} whole day--no plume {{fell off the}} shrubs, the valley was as {{abstracted}} as a grove of death. I <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tiny, half-buried farms away on the bare uplands beyond the valley hollow, and I thought of Tible in the snow, of the black witch-like little Mrs. Goyte. And the snow seemed to lay me bare to influences I wanted to escape.|$|E
50|$|Pepper {{turns out}} to be Coles, the wealthy businessman, and as both are being treated, Coles' wife arrives and hugs her husband. Caviezel <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> couple, and upon seeing the wife, remembers that they were having an affair. Caviezel {{arranged}} the kidnapping and planned to get rich and win the girl. Horrified by what he has done, he takes the ransom money to the officers. Coles introduces his wife to Caviezel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{just have}} a <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Smiling Pool, {{and if there is}} nothing there, I'll take a turn or two along the Big River," [...] thought he and {{straightway}} started for the Smiling Pool. Long before he reached it, his keen eyes saw Longlegs the Blue Heron standing motionless on the edge of it, and he knew by the looks of Longlegs that he was watching something which he hoped to catch.|$|R
60|$|Of course, {{this was}} evidently {{for the benefit}} of society, but it was {{certainly}} one of those cases where the poetical suffers for the practical. I comforted myself in my despondency, by <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old stone piers underneath, which were indisputably the same. We drove now through beautiful grounds, and alighted at an elegant mansion, which in former days belonged to Lockhart, the son-in-law of Scott. It was in this house that Old Mortality was written.|$|R
60|$|At {{first the}} manner of the {{speakers}} indicated that they were wildly congratulating each other, but very soon it was evident that the Summer Shelter was the subject of their discourse. They all <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> yacht, some of them even shook their fists at her, and although Shirley did not understand their language, he knew very well that curses, loud and savage, were pouring over the bulwarks in the direction of his friends and their yacht.|$|E
60|$|Getting no {{response}} to his pleasant condescension, the easy-mannered officer whistled a bar or two of a popular air, and riding forward to the parapet, <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead. In an instant he had whirled his horse about and was spurring along in rear of the guns, his eyes everywhere at once. An officer sat {{on the trail of}} one of the guns, smoking a cigar. As the general dashed up he rose and tranquilly saluted.|$|E
60|$|He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> black fox and {{the lust}} of greed glittered in his eyes. The animal was of unusual size, and the fur was extra prime. Assuredly {{it would bring}} a great sum. After all, it was but a boy {{with whom he had}} to deal and by the looks of him a novice in the woods. He stuffed the money bag back in his shirt and rose, his axe in hand. Then without warning he leaped forward, axe upraised, his face contorted with rage like that of a demon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! many's the time, miss," [...] Jane {{said with}} a sigh, <b>looking</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> empty grate, [...] "you'd come down here to make cakes or puddings, and laugh and joke like a child with Mary an' me. I often {{used to say to}} Emily--her as was cook here before Ellen Smith,--'Miss Una's never so happy as when she's down here in the kitchen.' And 'That's true what you say,' says Emily to me, many a time and often." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{whole room}} {{would come to}} life with his conductingthe way he would <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> drummer and with just a flick of his finger, things could happen. Once the groove was {{happening}} in the room, forget it; there was nothing like it. And everything, including the strings, responded to the kind of body movement that Burt had. He brings an incredible amount of life to the studio. He's {{probably one of the most}} amazing musicians in the world. —Record producer Phil Ramone ...|$|R

60|$|The {{blizzard}} {{of the previous}} days had whirled away; the sunshine lay still, with a warm glisten and sparkle, on the asphalt which seemed to bask in it, and which it softened to the foot. He loitered by {{the gate of the}} little park or plantation where the statue of General Jackson is riding a cock-horse to Banbury Cross, and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> French-Italian classicism of the White House architecture with a pensive joy at finding pleasure in it, and then he went on to the Arlington.|$|E
60|$|Not {{five minutes}} later Blacky saw {{something}} that made him, oh, so glad he had kept watch. It was a swiftly moving black line just above the water far down the Big River, and it was coming up. He knew what that black line was. He <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hunter hiding behind some bushes {{close to the edge}} of the water. The hunter was crouching with his terrible gun in his hands and was peeping over the bushes, watching that black line. He, too, knew what it was. It was a flock of Ducks flying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, no! The {{most serious}} {{thing of all}} is this. Steve is putting himself in order generally, and so I want to do my part, and I must begin right away before my {{thoughts}} get distracted with clothes {{and all sorts of}} dear, delightful, frivolous things that I can't help liking. Now I wish you'd tell me where to begin. Shouldn't I improve my mind by reading something solid?" [...] And Kitty <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> well-filled bookcase as if to see if it contained anything large and dry enough to be considered [...] "solid." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile Jasper, risen on his {{stocking}} soles, <b>looked</b> all <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little figure, dressed old picture fashion, in {{the simplest}} white frock with blue sash, and short-cut hair tied back with blue.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1931, the Depression was taking its toll on the Negro leagues, and the Black Barons had {{temporarily}} disbanded. Few teams could afford Paige, but Tom Wilson, who was moving the Nashville Elite Giants to Cleveland as the Cleveland Cubs, thought he could. Playing {{in the same city}} as a white major league team, Paige recalled, [...] "I'd <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland Indians' stadium, called League Park ... All season long it burned me, playing there in the shadow of that stadium. It didn't hurt my pitching, but it sure didn't do me any good." ...|$|R
50|$|Dr. Park {{arranged}} for some nurses from the exposition to <b>look</b> <b>over</b> McKinley <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Milburn home until nurses {{from the army}} could arrive. Despite some promising results McKinley died in the Milburn home.|$|R
6000|$|... "Once {{or twice}} I {{went down to}} the bridges after dark and <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river. No. I wasn't the sort of woman who ends her own wretchedness in that way. Your blood must be in a fever, and your head in a flame--at least I fancy so--you must be hurried into it, like, to go and make away with yourself. My {{troubles}} never took that effect on me. I always turned cold under them instead of hot. Bad for me, I dare say; but what you are--you are. Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? ...|$|E
60|$|They {{had come}} up to the paddock behind the barn, and they laid their arms on the fence while they <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> horses, which were still there. The beasts, in their rough winter coats, some bedaubed with frozen clots of the mud in which they had been rolling earlier in the afternoon, stood {{motionless}} in the thin, keen breeze that crept over the hillside from the March sunset, and blew their manes and tails out toward Dan and his father. Dan's pony sent him a gleam of recognition from under his frowsy bangs, but did not stir.|$|E
60|$|They walked {{at a slow}} pace, and Little Dorrit {{took him}} by the Iron Bridge and sat him down there for a rest, and they <b>looked</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water {{and talked about the}} shipping, and the old man {{mentioned}} what he would do if he had a ship full of gold coming home to him (his plan was to take a noble lodging for the Plornishes and himself at a Tea Gardens, and live there all the rest of their lives, attended on by the waiter), and it was a special birthday of the old man. They were within five minutes of their destination, when, at the corner of her own street, they came upon Fanny in her new bonnet bound for the same port.|$|E
5|$|On a field trip, Veronica meets Gia (Krysten Ritter). On the bus home, Veronica {{talks to}} Meg one more time, {{but she is}} still passive-aggressive. Veronica {{explains}} to the audience that she and Duncan are dating. At a rest stop, Veronica sees Weevil and they debate about the stabbed gang member. Meanwhile, Veronica's bus drives away without her. Instead, Weevil takes Veronica on his motorcycle before they run across the limo with Duncan, Gia, and the others in it. They tell Veronica that the bus full of students drove off the cliff and into the sea, and they <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crashed bus.|$|R
60|$|There {{were little}} traces of sunny clouds {{all over the}} heavens; and little fleeces of foam all over the sea; and the ship made a strange, musical noise under her bows, as she glided along, with her sails all still. It seemed a pity {{to go to work}} at such a time; and if we could only have sat in the {{windlass}} again; or if they would have let me go out on the bowsprit, and lay down between the manropes there, and <b>look</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fish in the water, and think of home, I should have been almost happy for a time.|$|R
5000|$|Part 2, [...] "School": The second {{short film}} {{in which we}} follow the story of Abby as she ends the {{phone call from the}} first short. Abby then {{proceeds}} to call her friend, Brooke (played by Ginny Weirick), to ask about plans that evening. When the call ends, Abby receives a photo message from her boyfriend Ross (from the first short). When Abby looks closer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> image, she sees that Kayako is in the hotel room with Ross. Abby attempts to call her boyfriend and warn him, but she only hears Kayako and then it hangs up. Abby <b>looks</b> <b>over</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl that was sitting beside her to see Kayako.|$|R
