25|$|Almost {{every piece}} of metal is an alloy of one type or another. Copper, aluminium, and other base metals are {{occasionally}} alloyed with beryllium, which is a highly toxic metal. When a metal <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> welded or cut, high concentrations of toxic beryllium fumes are released. Long-term exposure to beryllium may result in shortness of breath, chronic cough, and significant weight loss, accompanied by fatigue and general weakness. Other alloying elements such as arsenic, manganese, silver, and aluminium can cause sickness {{to those who are}} exposed.|$|E
25|$|Body {{modification}} enthusiasts have {{experimented with}} magnetic implants {{to attempt to}} replicate this sense. However, in general humans (and it is presumed other mammals) can detect electric fields only indirectly by detecting the effect they have on hairs. An electrically charged balloon, for instance, will exert a force on human arm hairs, which can be felt through tactition and identified as coming from a static charge (and not from wind or the <b>like).</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> not electroreception, {{as it is a}} post-sensory cognitive action.|$|E

Some {{in this category}} have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate clutch coupling to engage and slip varying amounts.

25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the <b>like.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E
500|$|For Streep, {{the most}} {{significant}} thing about the film was that [...] "his was the first time, on any movie I have ever made, where men {{came up to me}} and said, 'I know what you felt <b>like,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> kind of like my life.' That was for me the most ground-breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada—it engaged men on a visceral level," [...] she told Indiewire.|$|E

500|$|Bookmakers {{estimated}} that over £1million {{would be spent}} gambling {{on the outcome of}} the storyline. Ladbrokes experienced its busiest ever 24 hours of gambling on a television series ahead of the episode's transmission, taking £100,000 in bets on 30 different characters, while William Hill took £500,000, surpassing the amount placed on Dallas Who shot J. R.? storyline in 1980. Spokesman Rupert Adams commented: [...] "The BBC were amazing keeping this quiet. We have broken even which in a market <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> amazing.

500|$|The {{cast and}} crew of the episode enjoyed the [...] "amusement park" [...] feel of the story. Gillian Anderson later noted, [...] "Because of all the magic, I was {{constantly}} being entertained. The difficulty with something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> you have tendency to forget that people are still having bad things happen to them." [...] Anderson later stated that, {{because many of the}} lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.|$|E
500|$|The {{paternity}} reveal {{in which}} Summer was {{revealed to be}} Jack's daughter was met with a negative response.

Bibel wrote: [...] "When a secret <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> released into the soap wild, its consequences should ricochet through the town. But this time the impact is minimal". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "sad to see a storyline that started with such huge, game-changing potential devolve into a head-scratching stink bomb".|$|E

[...] A partial reunion of the band occurred in 2005 when keyboardist Greg Hawkes and lead guitarist Elliot Easton toured with singer Todd Rundgren, drummer Prairie Prince and bassist Kasim Sulton as [...] "The New Cars"; neither Ocasek nor Cars drummer David Robinson participated, and the Rundgren lineup split following two years of touring.|$|E

[...] Although it had a working title of Decade of Decadence, it would be released as Decade of Aggression after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album.

500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the {{last thing you want to}} do in a story <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> affect performances".|$|E
