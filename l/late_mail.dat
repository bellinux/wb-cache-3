5000|$|The {{day after}} the wreck, Vice-president Finley made a speech in which he said: [...] "The train {{consisted}} of two postal cars, one express and one baggage car for the storage of mail.... Eyewitnesses said the train was approaching the trestle at speeds of 30 to 35 miles an hour." [...] The Southern Railway placed blame for the wreck on engineer Broady, disavowing {{that he had been}} ordered to run as fast as possible to maintain the schedule. The railroad also claimed he descended the grade leading to Stillhouse Trestle at a speed of more than 70 mph. Several eyewitnesses to the wreck, however, stated that the speed was probably around 50 mph. In all likelihood, the railroad was at least partially to blame, as it had a lucrative contract with the U.S. Post Office to haul mail (hence the train's name), and the contract including a penalty clause for each minute the train was late into Spencer. It is probably safe to conclude that the engineers piloting the Fast Mail were always under pressure to stay on time so that the railroad would not be penalized for <b>late</b> <b>mail</b> delivery.|$|E

30|$|A {{possible}} {{concern in}} this study is that the final number of evaluable questionnaires was low. The main reason for this was that patients returned questionnaires after the stipulated time periods (17  days and 70  days, respectively). Late response generally owed to <b>late</b> <b>mail</b> back but was also due to logistical reasons, such as postponed revisits. However, there were no appreciable differences in background characteristics between those who responded within the time limits and those who responded late. Another factor possibly contributing to a smaller number of evaluable questionnaires was that the research staff was requested to not assist the patients or to check for and ask patients to fill in unanswered questions. In all analyses only questionnaire data with complete answers to all items comprising a subscale were analyzed to ensure that analyses were unbiased by missing values. However, as seen in Table 1, there was rather little partial missing data.|$|E

50|$|Chain-mail cuirasses (known then {{simply as}} the lorica) were worn by the Principes and offered {{superior}} protection to the small square chest-piece used by the Hastati. Mail was, however, heavier and more expensive to manufacture. The mail cuirasses worn {{seem to have had}} a double thickness on the shoulders for extra protection against downward cuts. Polybius states that only those soldiers rated over 10,000 drachmae (i.e. the First Class of commoners) wore a mail-shirt, while the rest wore a pectorale, or small, square breastplate designed to protect the heart. The First Class at this time served mainly in the cavalry, so this would imply that only a tiny minority of heavy infantrymen wore mail. This would also result in different armour within the same ranks. As the Ahenobarbus monument shows all foot soldiers in mail armour, it would appear that by c. 120 BC at the <b>latest,</b> <b>mail</b> was standard issue.|$|R

A few narrow-minded folk with binoculars {{said that there were}} mahouts upon their backs, but this was never clearly proven. I prefer to believe in what I saw--a sleepy town, just one house thick, scattered along a lovely stream and inhabited by slow, solemn elephants, building stockades for their own diversion. There was a strong scent of freshly sawn teak in the air--we could not see any elephants sawing--and occasionally the warm stillness was broken by the crash of the log. When the elephants had got an appetite for luncheon they loafed off in couples to their club, and did not take the trouble to give us greeting and the <b>latest</b> <b>mail</b> papers; at which we were much disappointed, but took heart when we saw upon a hill a large white pagoda surrounded by scores of little pagodas.

50|$|From the <b>late</b> 1940s, <b>mail</b> planes became {{increasingly}} rare, as the increasing size of aircraft and economics dictated {{a move towards}} bulk carriage of mail onboard airline flights, and this remains the primary method today. Parcel mail, overnight mail and priority mail, however, are still carried aboard what may be considered the spiritual successors of classic, pre-war mail planes; small, general aviation aircraft that have been adapted to the role, with the Cessna 208 and Piper PA-31 Navajo being among the most popular. Cargo airline operators, such as UPS and FedEx, also carry mail along with bulk cargo, aboard converted airliners.|$|R
30|$|Although we call MMi {{the actual}} mail month {{indicator}} vector, {{it does not}} indicate the actual mail month for every observation, because a small share of Tickets were never mailed, and an even smaller share were mailed shortly after the rollout window (that is, after the last month represented in MMi). In coding MMi, we had to choose one of the rollout period mail months {{for each of these}} observations in order to keep them in the sample. For each case, we chose a virtual month that is assumed to be consistent with the individual’s actual behavior. For the bulk of such cases—those never mailed a Ticket because of benefit termination prior to their IMM—we used the actual IMM on the assumption that had SSA proceeded to mail their Ticket on their IMMs, their behavior would have been the same as their actual behavior. That seems very likely, because they would have received their Ticket after they could no longer use them, and a large majority were deceased. For the very small share of cases in which the Ticket was mailed {{a few months after the}} rollout ended (0.07 percent for Phase 2 and 0.19 percent for Phase 3, as shown in Table  2), we chose the last rollout month; that is, we coded these <b>late</b> <b>mailing</b> cases as if their Tickets were mailed a few months earlier than they were actually mailed.|$|R

50|$|To {{compensate}} for high mail volume and slow long-distance transportation which saw mail arrive at post offices throughout the day, deliveries were made multiple times a day.

50|$|Those {{going to}} California by {{crossing}} Panama, Nicaragua or Mexico {{had a much}} quicker trip than going around Cape Horn or taking the California Trail to California. A typical trip {{could be done in}} about 30-90 days assuming shipping and transit connections could be made. The biggest handicap the Panama, Nicaragua or Mexico routes had was the wait until scheduled Pacific shipping was established in late 1849 to carry them to California. These routes also suffered form the risk of catching a possibly fatal disease and having to potentially endure threats of attack by bandits. Unfortunately, getting shipping from the Pacific ports of Panama, Nicaragua, or Mexico to California was very problematic until mid to <b>late</b> 1849. <b>Mail,</b> returning gold miners and gold shipments nearly all used the Panama Route. The number of passengers who used the Panama route in 1849 and 1850 is unknown but must be numbered in the tens of thousands. In 1851 29,600 passengers used the Panama Route. This increased to 33,000 passengers in 1852 and dropped to 27,200 passengers in 1853. by the time the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in the United States in 1869, it is believed 800,000 travelers had used the Panama Route to get to and from California. Its estimated that 20% of the original Argonauts left to return home—most via the Panama Route. Many returned to California with their wives and families.|$|R
40|$|Spilleklar (The 11 +) is a {{comprehensive}} warm-up programme developed to prevent injuries by improving strength, awareness and neuromuscular control during static and dynamic movements. Its effect was tested in a cluster randomised study of 13 - 17 year old female football players. For one football season the intervention teams used the complete exercise programme as their warm up for every training session and the running exercises {{as part of their}} warm up before every match (65 clubs, 1055 players), whereas the control teams continued to use their ordinary warm-up exercises (60 clubs, 837 players). The primary outcome was defined as an injury to the lower extremity (foot, ankle, lower leg, knee, thigh, groin, and hip). Exposure (participation in training and match), injuries, and to what extent the warm-up programme was carried out in each session (intervention clubs) was reported by coaches on weekly registration forms.
