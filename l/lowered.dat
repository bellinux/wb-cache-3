At 11 p.m., hurricane warnings were <b>lowered</b> in the Florida Keys but extended northward from Daytona Beach to Savannah, Georgia. At 11 a.m. on September 11, all warnings were <b>lowered</b> {{south of}} Vero Beach {{and along the}} Florida west coast, while hurricane warnings were extended northward from Savannah to Myrtle Beach. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were <b>lowered</b> south of Fernandina Beach, while they were extended northward to include the entire North Carolina coast. Gale warnings were issued northward to Cape May. At 9 p.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued northward to Eastport, Maine. Ships at dock in Newport, Rhode Island were towed out into the bay to weather the storm. On September 12 at 5 a.m., hurricane warnings were extended northward to Eastport, and dropped south of Cape Hatteras. At 7 a.m., hurricane warnings were <b>lowered</b> south of Cape Charles. At 2 p.m., hurricane warnings were dropped south of Cape May. At 5 p.m., hurricane warnings were discontinued south of Manasquan, New Jersey. At 8 p.m., hurricane warnings expired south of Block Island. By 11 p.m. on September 12, all hurricane warnings had been <b>lowered.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the <b>lowered</b> immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, <b>lowered</b> immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{notification}} that a {{newly formed}} tropical cyclone was approaching the Florida coast, the Weather Bureau posted storm warnings for coastal areas between Key West and West Palm Beach, Florida. Later on August6, warnings were <b>lowered</b> in Key West, but the warning area was extended north to Titusville, Florida. Vessels and small craft located offshore north of Miami, Florida were notified to advise caution for the oncoming tropical disturbance. As the storm approached the coast, more accurate forecasts allowed vessels to be cautioned {{as far north}} as Hatteras, North Carolina. Storm warnings between Jupiter and Daytona, Florida were upgraded to hurricane warnings on August7, in accordance with the storm's upgrade to hurricane intensity. After moving inland, hurricane warnings were <b>lowered,</b> but emergency warnings for the storm's potential effects were posted for the interior of the Florida peninsula north of 28°N the following day. Northwest storm warnings were issued in Tampa, while northeast storm warnings were issued from Tampa north to Apalachicola, Florida. All warnings were eventually <b>lowered</b> following the storm's dissipation.|$|E
