5|$|Antlion larvae require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The larvae prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows <b>larger,</b> it constructs <b>larger</b> pits, and thus catches <b>larger</b> prey, sometimes much <b>larger</b> than itself.|$|E
5|$|Like other minks, {{individual}} sea minks {{may have}} maintained home ranges, and, since the males were <b>larger</b> and required more food, males {{would have had}} <b>larger</b> territorial claims. Likewise, their <b>larger</b> size may have allowed the males to target <b>larger</b> prey than the females, {{and they may have}} had to defend females during mating seasons. Like other weasels, the sea mink was probably polygynandrous, with both sexes mating with multiple individuals.|$|E
5|$|A Titan's {{durability}} {{depends on}} its size; <b>larger</b> Titans will take more effort to defeat than others and a few are immune to Crash's attacks. To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the <b>larger</b> Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the <b>larger</b> Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than <b>larger</b> prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than <b>larger</b> ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a <b>larger</b> insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a <b>larger</b> insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race against its prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew <b>larger,</b> Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race against its prey. As prey grew <b>larger,</b> Dimetrodon countered it by growing <b>larger</b> and having sharper teeth.|$|E

They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a <b>larger</b> graph, can be solved in linear time when the <b>larger</b> graph has bounded book thickness.

For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E

5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is <b>larger.</b> Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are <b>larger</b> than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting <b>larger</b> foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from <b>larger</b> adopted cichlids.|$|E
