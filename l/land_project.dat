2500|$|The party's voter base is {{traditionally}} concentrated in Southern Thailand and in Bangkok, where the party {{relies on the}} support from the capital's aristocratic, meritocratic and educated middle and upper classes. In the 1990s, {{under the leadership of}} Chuan Leekpai, a native of Trang province in Southern Thailand, the Democrats quickly became the dominant party in Southern Thailand. The influences of provincial politicians from the south into the party created considerable tension with the party's Bangkok establishment. Chuan's [...] "Mr. Clean" [...] image, however, made him personally popular with Democrat Party supporters throughout Thailand, and so the party managed to stay cohesive under his leadership. The first Chuan government (1992–1995) fell when members of the Cabinet were implicated in profiting from the Sor Phor Kor 4-01 <b>land</b> <b>project</b> documents distributed in Phuket province. Chuan was again Premier from 1997 to 2001, {{in the midst of the}} 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and its aftermath. The Party lost a landslide election victory to Thaksin Shinawatra's populist Thai Rak Thai party, winning 128 seats compared to the TRT's 248 in the 2001 general election.|$|E
