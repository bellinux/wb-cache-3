40|$|Gas {{turbine engine}} NOX, CO 2 and H 20 exhaust {{emissions}} from civil subsonic fleets are potentially in sufficient amounts to affect atmospheric ozone and climate, {{particularly with the}} projected growth in air traffic. Because, {{it may be that}} the future envisaged low-NOX combustor technologies may not keep up with the industry requirements for increased engine thermal efficiency, the potential benefits from optimising aero engine cycles and flight operations for low mission emissions deserve to be thoroughly investigated. The SKY computer simulation system developed to examine such alternative routes integrates flight route performance, aero engine performance and the formation of pollutants within the combustor. Based on Turbomatch, Cranfield Gas Turbine Simulation System, SKY can be used to optimise mission/aircraft/engine/combustor combinations with respect to landing and take-off (LTO) as well as mission emissions. A model of the high capacity Boeing 747 - 400 powered by Turbomatch high bypass ratio turbofan models and simulated on long range routes such as London-Tokyo is selected for this work. On the one hand, aero engine cycles can be designed at a optimum bypass ratio and deliver mission NOX reductions of up to 10 % over designs optimised for LTO NOX, indicating that the current ICAO regulatory regime is a inadequate parameter to control mission NOX. On the other hand, operational measures such as speed reductions could bring further reductions of the order of 10 %, but some of the improvement would be made at the expense of fuel burn, CO 2 and H 20 emissions, payload-range capability and direct operating costs. The benefits from such alternative routes are not negligible but smaller in comparison to the 30 to 80 % potential cuts from future <b>low-NOX</b> <b>technology,</b> as well as to the 30 % reduction due to expected improvements in the next 20 years or so in airframe weight and aerodynamics and more efficient navigation practices...|$|E
2500|$|The 1990 Amendments also {{required}} reductions in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions at Phase I units. [...] The key factors in NOx formation are flame temperature and oxygen levels present for combustion.

Many utilities complied with requirements by installing stack-gas scrubbers and low-NOx burners at the same time. <b>Low-NOx</b> burner <b>technology</b> was readily available, and considerably less expensive than installation of scrubbers, so control of NOx was considered less demanding by most electric utilities.|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of low-volatile coal are utilized in power plants throughout China. With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, {{it is important}} to develop and deploy <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technologies</b> for pulverized coal boilers burning low-volatile coal. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a novel decoupling combustion system for low-volatile coal via experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The combustion system includes horizontal fuel-rich/lean low-NOx burners (LNB) and the associated air distribution system for a polygonal tangentially fired boiler (PTFB). The effects of coal particle diameter and coal feeding rate on the gas/particle flow characteristics of the burner, and the cold state aerodynamic field of the PTFB were analyzed in detail. The structural design of the LNB results in advantageous gas/particle flow characteristics and the PTFB improved the distribution of the flow field. The CFD models and simulation results were validated by comparing with those of cold experiments data. The simulation results demonstrated that this <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology</b> enhances staged combustion at different scales, which can reduce NOx generation significantly. In the industrial application on a 300 MW pulverized coal boiler, installation of the LNBs improved the stability of low-volatile coal combustion and reduced NOx emissions significantly. These research findings provide valuable guidance to the design of low-NOx combustion system for pulverized coal boilers using low volatile coal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been given to the development of <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology</b> for DME (Dimethyl Ether). The present paper describes the R&D study for water-tube boiler carried out in Kansai University and Hirakawa Guidam Co., Ltd. under the support of DME project from METI. The major problem in DME use is the difficulty in the application of premixed flame due to its low ignition temperature and rather high burning velocity. However, the previously developed tube-nested combustor, i. e. water-tubes installed in the empty furnace, becomes effective means together with the flue-gas recirculation to overcome such difficulty in achieving low-NOx combustion. This paper begins with a brief review of the R&D study of the tube-nested combustor specifically designed for city gas. Then the further development for DME-fired water-tube boiler is described...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} principally {{concerned}} with characterizing the organic part of coal combustion fly ashes. High carbon fly ashes {{are becoming more}} common as by-products of <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology,</b> and there is need {{to learn more about}} this fraction of the fly ash. The project team consists of two universities, Brown and Princeton, and an electrical utility, New England Power. A sample suite of over fifty fly ashes has been gathered from utilities across the United States, and includes ashes from a coals ranging in rank from bituminous to lignite. The characterizations of these ashes include standard tests (LOI, Foam Index), as well as more detailed characterizations of their surface areas, porosity, extractability and adsorption behavior. The ultimate goal is, by better characterizing the material, to enable broadening the range of applications for coal fly ash re-use beyond the current main market as a pozzolanic agent for concretes. The potential for high carbon-content fly ashes to substitute for activated carbons is receiving particular attention. The work performed to date has already revealed how very different the surfaces of different ashes produced by the same utility can be, with respect to polarity of the residual carbon. This can help explain the large variations in acceptability of these ashes as concrete additives...|$|R
40|$|OVERVIEW: As {{concerns}} about global environmental problems grow, electric power plants that utilize high efficiency gas-turbine generators are being actively sought after. Accordingly, at SaskPower’s Queen Elizabeth Power Station in Canada, Hitachi, Ltd. has implemented a re-powering system that combines Hitachi’s H- 25 gas-turbine generators with the plant’s existing steam-turbine generators. This re-powering system consists of H- 25 generators combined with OTSG (once-through steam generator: {{also known as}} once-through boiler). The H- 25 gas-turbine generator incorporates a low-NOx emission combustor that meets the demand for low environmental impact. The combustor is based on <b>low-NOx</b> emission <b>technology</b> that Hitachi has accumulated during the development of low-NOx emission combustors for large-scale gas turbines. And it was shown during the commissioning that the low-NOx emission H- 25 gas-turbine generators installed at the Queen Elizabeth Power Station produce NOx emission {{at the level of}} 25 ppm (at 15 % O 2). In addition, the performance of the turbines was demonstrated to be satisfactory; that is, trouble-free operation down to- 30 °C is possible, and generated gross output power and thermal efficiency easily meet the design specifications. It is thus considered that the H- 25 gas-turbine generator incorporating a high-thermal-efficiency low-NOx emission combustor will be an effective response to the growing demands for environmental-protection measures—such as prevention of global warming and reduction of NOx emissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} a recently completed four-year study to {{examine the impact of}} <b>low-NOx</b> firing <b>technologies</b> on ash formation and deposition while firing pulverized coal. Low-NOx burners and staged combustion inhibit NOx formation by restricting the amount of oxygen available to form a fuel-rich zone in which nitrogen compounds are reduced to molecular nitrogen (N{sub 2 }) rather than oxidized. Additional oxygen is provided downstream for complete combustion. Consequently, coal and mineral particles encounter different temperatures and oxygen concentrations when they are burned under low-NOx firing conditions than they do in conventionally-fired units. Two coals with distinctly different inorganic contents and ash characteristics were fired in a pilot-scale laboratory combustor under both conventional and staged combustion conditions. Ash and deposit samples were collected at various locations in the reactor and analyzed in order to assess the influence of staged combustion. This report is organized as follows. First, a background section provides the foundation needed {{in order to understand the}} motivation for and the results of the experimental program. The next section presents a description of the experimental apparatus and procedures, including the development the analytical methods critical to the study. Results of the analyses of coal, ash and deposit samples are then presented and discussed for each of the two coals. Finally, the report ends with a short summary and statement of conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Combustion instabilities {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} operability issues associated with <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology.</b> This paper develops numerical and theoretical analyses of the nonlinear dynamics of harmonically-forced turbulent premixed flames that drive thermoacoustic combustion instability. A key objective of this work is to develop a model that enables tracking of ensemble-averaged turbulent flame fronts. A previous study introduced an equation for modeling the ensemble-averaged turbulent flame dynamics, in which the turbulent flame speed model used a turbulent Markstein length to account for the effect of flame-brush curvature on the propagation speed. This study improves upon the previous modelling by introducing an additional modeling parameter – an effective convection speed – that is required in order to account for nonlinearity associated with turbulent transport. Three-dimensional simulations of the harmonically-forced flame dynamics are performed using the G-equation approach and a flow field involving stochastic velocity fluctuations. The new model equation provides an improved description of the ensemble-averaged flame dynamics that is in close agreement with the G-equation simulation results. Through asymptotic analysis, explicit expressions are derived for the un-curved turbulent flame speed, the turbulent Markstein length, and the effective convection speed. The asymptotic models that have been derived give accurate predictions of the flame dynamics in the vicinity of the flame holder. More general solutions are also derived for flame dynamics in the far field and these provide a basis for general modeling of turbulent flame speeds in harmonically-forced flow...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} legislation affecting the electric power sector is the two-phase {{requirement of the}} U. S. Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) that mandates limits on the emission of pollutants. The overall goal of the CAAA under Title IV is to reduce SO 2 and NOX emissions by 10 and 2 million tons per year respectively. NOX requirements will force electric utilities to install <b>low-NOX</b> burning <b>technology</b> to limit NOX emission to less than. 45 lb/MMBtu. SO 2 emission from all generating units in the United State is capped at 8. 9 million tons per year. CAAA makes provision for electric utilities {{to buy and sell}} emission allowances. Title I of the Act mandates a cap for the amount of allowances the EPA can issue per year. Furthermore, by year 2010, only 8. 95 million allowances are to be distributed for all utilities in the nation; as a result, the management and planning methods of operation of the industry will have to be modified to meet these emission constraints. This paper explore the use of public-domain information such as the one offered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to monitor emissions from power plants. The emission data is to develop a set of operation characteristics in terms of power generation, fuel consumption, and the amount of pollution released. The objective is to minimize environmental pollution caused by fossil-fuel power plants. Finally, test results are provided to illustrate the proposed solution method to the environmentally constrained power generation problem...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{proposed the}} gas phase stoichiometric ratio (SRgas) as an index to evaluate NOx concentration in fuel-rich flames. The SRgas index {{was defined as}} the amount of fuel required for stoichiometric combustion/amount of gasified fuel, where the amount of gasified fuel was the amount of fuel which had been released to the gas phase by pyrolysis, oxidation and gasification reactions. In the present study we found that SRgas was a good index to consider the gas phase reaction mechanism in fuel-rich pulverized coal flames. When SRgas < 1. 0, NOx concentration was strongly influenced by the SRgas value. NOx concentration was also calculated by using a reaction model. The model was verified for various coals, particle diameters, reaction times, and initial oxygen concentrations. The most important reactions were gas phase NOx reduction reactions by hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon concentration was estimated based on SRgas. We also investigated the ratio as an index to develop a new <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology</b> for pulverized coals. We examined the relation between local SRgas distribution in the fuel-rich region in the low-NOx flame and NOx emissions at the furnace exit, by varying burner structures. The relationship between local SRgas value and local NOx concentration was also examined. When a low-NOx type burner was used, the value of SRgas in the flame was readily decreased. When the local SRgas value was the same, it was difficult to influence the local NOx concentration by changing the burner structure. For staged combustion, the most important item was to design the burner structure and arrangement so that SRgas could be lowered as much as possible just before mixing with staged air...|$|R
40|$|Lean combustors as {{introduced}} by General Electric in their latest GEnx engine require {{a new approach}} for the estimation of in-flight NOx emissions. The approach {{presented in this paper}} is implemented as a reactor network model in DLR’s existing combustor pre-design and analysis tool ComDAT. In a reactor network the combustor volume is divided into a number of reactors in which the combustion is calculated with chemical kinetics. The advantage of this approach in comparison to a correlation is that the effect of modifications in the combustor architecture (e. g. cooling concepts) or air-fuel homogenization on the NOx emissions can be investigated. To classify the presented method, alternative methods regarding in-flight emission calculation are initially reviewed and assessed. To enhance the reliability of the emission prediction the reactor networks need to be calibrated. This means that the air and fuel flow distribution within the reactor networks as well as the dimensions of the reactors are adjusted such that the sum of the squared deviations between calculated and reference emissions is minimized for a given set of cruise operating conditions. For modeling the reference (or target) emissions during cruise, publicly available emissions and associated information of the GEnx were used, as this engine type is the only engine in service incorporating lean <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology.</b> The necessary combustor entry and exit conditions for the different flight states are obtained from an engine model using DLR’s engine performance code VarCycle. The development of the reactor networks, the modeling of the reference emissions as well as the process of calibration is described in this paper. Finally the calibrated reactor networks will be used to estimate and compare the NOx emissions of a generic lean burn engine at three different flight altitudes within cruise...|$|R
40|$|Under {{sponsorship}} of the Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), McDermott Technology, Inc. (MTI), the Babcock & Wilcox Company (B&W), and Fuel Tech teamed together to investigate an integrated solution for NOx control. The system was comprised of B&W's DRB- 4 Z{trademark} low-NO{sub x} pulverized coal (PC) burner technology and Fuel Tech's NO{sub x}OUT{reg_sign}, a urea-based selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) technology. The technology's emission target is achieving 0. 15 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu for full-scale boilers. Development of the <b>low-NOx</b> burner <b>technology</b> has been a focus in B&W's combustion program. The DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner (see Figure 1. 1) is B&W's newest low-NO{sub x} burner capable of achieving very low NO{sub x}. The burner is designed to reduce NO{sub x} by diverting air away from {{the core of the}} flame, which reduces local stoichiometry during coal devolatilization and, thereby, reduces initial NO{sub x} formation. Figure 1. 2 shows the historical NO{sub x} emission levels from different B&W burners. Figure 1. 2 shows that based on three large-scale commercial installations of the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burners in combination with OFA ports, using Western subbituminous coal, the NO{sub x} emissions ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 18 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. It appears that with continuing research and development the Ozone Transport Rule (OTR) emission level of 0. 15 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu is within the reach of combustion modification techniques for boilers using western U. S. subbituminous coals. Although NO{sub x} emissions from the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner are nearing OTR emission level with subbituminous coals, the utility boiler owners that use bituminous coals can still benefit from the addition of an SNCR and/or SCR system in order to comply with the stringent NO{sub x} emission levels facing them...|$|R
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the {{coal-fired}} power industry began a more accelerated move toward using <b>low-NOx</b> burner (LNB) <b>technologies</b> to reduce NOx emissions. Most LNBs incorporate less oxygen with the coal initially, creating a cooler and somewhat substoichiometric initial combustion zone, with additional oxygen added further on in the combustion process to complete char combustion. Another method used to achieve lower NOx emissions is to fire the coal substoichiometrically and add additional air through overfire air ports. Both of these methods create certain impacts on fireside performance that are different from conventional high-excess-air firing arrangements. Some of the impacts that have been noticed by the utility industry are higher levels of unburned carbon in the fly ash and bottom ash, increased boiler tube corrosion, higher particulate loadings on control devices, and changes in slagging in the main furnace. Work on the fundamental mechanisms of entrained ash and ash deposit formation during low-NOx combustion has been sparse. This project by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) focuses on the issues of entrained ash formation and slagging for low-NOx combustion systems in general. Time-resolved combustion tests under conventional and low-NOx conditions have been conducted to note particle-size formation and slagging deposition. The results from this work are yielding an increased understanding of the mechanisms of ash formation during low-NOx combustion along with methods for enhancing heat transfer and fly ash collectability. Specific objectives of this research project include (1) determining whether initial char and ash generated under low-NOx conditions have greater tendencies for slagging than conventionally generated ash and (2) determining the differences, if any, between particle size and composition for entrained ash generated under low-NOx and conventional combustion conditions...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} systems {{represent a}} potentially significant <b>technology</b> development in <b>low-NOx</b> gas turbine <b>technology.</b> The challenges {{associated with the}} implementation of catalytic combustion in a gas turbine include the need to present both a uniform fuel/air mixture as well as a uniform approach velocity to the catalyst within a minimal volume. The effort described herein addresses the design of catalytic combustor premixer for use on a small frame industrial (5 MW) stationary gas turbine. The general requirements for the premixer were to provide velocity and fuel air mixture uniformity at the exit plane of ± 10 % of the mean and ± 3 % of the mean respectively at nominal idle and full load conditions while maintaining a pressure drop of 4 % maximum. The target turbine's packaging and air-flow path presented an additional challenge requiring the flow to make a 180 degree flow reversal immediately upstream of the combustor. Computational fluid dynamics modeling was. utilized to iterate the mixer design. A unique solution was obtained utilizing an involute shaped contraction/throat/expansion scheme. The most promising design was fabricated and tested at atmospheric conditions. As compared to a "baseline" mixer, the final involute design improved upon the flow mixing and velocity uniformity. The novel premixer design also eliminated the use of fuel injection spokes and static mixers, relying upon fuel injection from the wall and a high turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) throat section to provide the mixing, thereby simplify manufacturing. To test both scaling issues in the mixer and to provide an opportunity to test the design at high pressure, a 25 % scale (approximate) reduced size mixer was designed and fabricated. Subsequent atmospheric and elevated pressure (11 atm, 1110 kPa) testing confirmed that the mixture uniformity was maintained and the general concept was applicable at both a reduced scale and at elevated pressures. Finally the premixer was integrated with a catalyst and fueled to confirm the overall system performance. The emissions of NOx were < 1 ppm...|$|R
40|$|Gas Technology Institute (GTI), {{together}} with Hamworthy Peabody Combustion Incorporated (formerly Peabody Engineering Corporation), the University of Utah, and Far West Electrochemical have developed and demonstrated an innovative combustion system suitable {{for natural gas}} and coke-oven gas firing within the steel industry. The combustion system is a simple, low-cost, energy-efficient burner that can reduce NOx by more than 75 %. The U. S. steel industry needs to address NOx control at its steelmaking facilities. A significant part of NOx emissions comes from gas-fired boilers. In steel plants, byproduct gases – blast furnace gas (BFG) and coke-oven gas (COG) – are widely used {{together with}} natural gas to fire furnaces and boilers. In steel plants, natural gas can be fired together with BFG and COG, but, typically, the addition of natural gas raises NOx emissions, which can already be high because of residual fuel-bound nitrogen in COG. The Project Team has applied its expertise in low-NOx burners to lower NOx levels for these applications by combining advanced burner geometry and combustion staging with control strategies tailored to mixtures of natural gas and byproduct fuel gases. These methods reduce all varieties of NOx – thermal NOx produced by high flame temperatures, prompt NOx produced by complex chain reactions involving radical hydrocarbon species and NOx from fuel-bound nitrogen compounds such as ammonia found in COG. The Project Team has expanded GTI’s highly successful low-NOx forced internal recirculation (FIR) burner, previously developed for natural gas-fired boilers, into facilities that utilize BFG and COG. For natural gas firing, these burners {{have been shown to}} reduce NOx emissions from typical uncontrolled levels of 80 - 100 vppm to single-digit levels (9 vppm). This is done without the energy efficiency penalties incurred by alternative NOx control methods, such as external flue gas recirculation (FGR), water injection, and selective non-catalytic reduction. The FIR burner was previously demonstrated on firetube and watertube boilers, and these units are still operating at several industrial and commercial boiler sites in sizes ranging from 2. 5 to 60 million Btu/h. This report covers the development of an innovative combustion system suitable for natural gas or coke-oven gas firing within the steel industry. The prototype FIR burner was evaluated on a 20 million Btu/h watertube boiler. Acceptable burner performance was obtained when firing natural gas and simulated coke-oven gas doped with ammonia. The laboratory data reveals a direct relationship between NOx formation and the ammonia concentration in the fuel. In addition, NOx formation increases as the primary stoichiometric ratio (PSR) increases. Representative ammonia concentrations, as documented in the steel industry, ranged from 200 to 500 vppm. When the laboratory burner/boiler was operated with 500 vppm ammonia in the fuel, NOx emissions ranged from 50 to 75 vppm. This, conservatively, is 75 % less than state-of-the-art burner performance. When the burner is operated with 200 vppm ammonia in the fuel, the corresponding NOx emissions would range from 30 to 45 vppm, 84 % less than present burner technology. During field evaluation on a 174 million Btu/h industrial prototype burner both natural gas and actual COG from on-site generation were tested. Despite the elevated hydrogen cyanide and ammonia content in the COG throughout the test program, the FIR burner showed an improvement over baseline emissions. At full load; 167 million Btu/h, NOx emissions were relatively low at 169 vppm. This represents a 30 % reduction compared to baseline emissions not accounting for the higher hydrogen cyanide content in the COG. CO emissions remained below 20 vppm and were stable across the firing range. This represents a 68 % reduction compared to baseline CO emissions. When firing natural gas, emissions were stable as firing rate increased over the range. At low fire; 45 million Btu/h, NOx emissions where 33 vppm and increased at full load; 144 million Btu/h, to 49 vppm. CO emissions fluctuated with the oxygen content and remained below 135 vppm during all tests. The boiler’s maximum output was not achieved due to a limitation dictated by the host site natural gas supply. The FIR burner benefits the public by simultaneously addressing the problems of air pollution and energy conservation through a <b>low-NOx</b> combustion <b>technology</b> that does not increase energy consumption. Continuing activities include the negotiation of a license with Hamworthy Peabody Combustion, Incorporated (Hamworthy Peabody) to commercialize the FIR burner for steel industry applications. Hamworthy Peabody {{is one of the largest}} U. S. manufacturers of combustion equipment for boilers in the Steel Industry, and has stated their intention to commercialize the FIR burner...|$|R
